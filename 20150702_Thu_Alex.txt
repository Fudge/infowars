[00:00.000 --> 00:13.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.240 --> 00:22.020]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.020 --> 00:30.900]  get this the TSA is announcing when I first saw them talk about being their
[00:30.900 --> 00:37.340]  dream back in 2002 they're announcing outside of law like everything else now
[00:37.340 --> 00:41.340]  that happens comes from the executive branch the bureaucracy of the courts
[00:41.340 --> 00:46.220]  forget legislation forget laws they're announcing we're gonna play this
[00:46.220 --> 00:53.020]  news clip coming up that if your state doesn't have the federally approved
[00:53.020 --> 01:01.220]  national ID card and many states have not adopted it that you will not be
[01:01.220 --> 01:06.500]  allowed to fly and the feds are also saying states have to comply with every
[01:06.500 --> 01:11.700]  federal edict or they'll kick them out of the federal ID program where it still
[01:11.700 --> 01:14.780]  is a texas driver's license or a california driver's license or a new
[01:14.780 --> 01:17.940]  or driver's license or a florida driver's license or a colorado driver's
[01:17.940 --> 01:24.420]  license but it's really federal and so this is how using the casual society
[01:24.420 --> 01:28.700]  they can kill the right to travel the right to buy and sell I think I read
[01:28.700 --> 01:33.380]  about that when I was really young in sunday school when they would get into
[01:33.380 --> 01:39.420]  revelations but whether revelations is real or not is it a good idea to give
[01:39.420 --> 01:44.300]  governments the power that science fiction writers if you believe that from
[01:44.300 --> 01:49.620]  that perspective 2000 years ago envisioned as the ultimate nightmare
[01:49.620 --> 01:55.980]  scenario that the devil incarnate would want I mean regardless the devil
[01:55.980 --> 02:01.300]  character thousands of years ago wanted you to have to have a mark to buy and
[02:01.300 --> 02:08.540]  sell and now it's here might want to investigate it might want to be against
[02:08.540 --> 02:13.140]  it whether you're a christian a muslim an atheist an agnostic an animus a
[02:13.140 --> 02:20.820]  tooth fairy worshiper the Santa Claus lover whatever the case is but that
[02:20.820 --> 02:25.700]  dovetails nicely with the illegals in the supreme court ruling three days ago
[02:25.700 --> 02:32.300]  that they don't have to have a license or proof to vote and states all over the
[02:32.300 --> 02:37.580]  country are issuing illegals drivers license I mean all I'm saying is I
[02:37.580 --> 02:42.740]  can't go to Mexico I can't go to Nigeria and just show up and get free health
[02:42.740 --> 02:47.820]  care get a driver's license and vote I mean they'd laugh at you if I walked
[02:47.820 --> 02:53.380]  into an ijurian or in the Philippines or I walked into Mexico or I walked into
[02:53.380 --> 02:58.700]  the Czech Republic or wherever and said hi I'm here to vote they said okay who
[02:58.700 --> 03:05.860]  are you well about Igor striker yeah you're like okay let us see an ID you
[03:05.860 --> 03:10.380]  don't look like Igor striker you don't sound like Igor striker you sound like a
[03:10.380 --> 03:16.180]  yank but see using their common sense would be called discrimination no no
[03:16.180 --> 03:20.500]  no they would say here you're allowed to vote no of course they wouldn't my name
[03:20.500 --> 03:26.780]  is Juan Gonzalez and I'm here to vote really we need to see spruce ID it's
[03:26.780 --> 03:35.500]  what you show in Mexico not here because this country is a joke and the
[03:35.500 --> 03:39.740]  reason this country is a joke is we're the television nation we're the we
[03:39.740 --> 03:44.340]  consume the most media except for South Koreans and we're basically vegetables
[03:44.340 --> 03:49.700]  and we've got a new powerful mark dice video that's up on info wars calm it's
[03:49.700 --> 03:54.220]  also on drudge report calm drudge report calm and prison planet calm has it as
[03:54.220 --> 03:58.540]  well where he went out he he shows everybody they interviewed the good the
[03:58.540 --> 04:02.500]  bad thing ugly two people say they like the red white and blue and what is it
[04:02.500 --> 04:11.020]  eight others don't know why we have the fourth of July two people know why one
[04:11.020 --> 04:18.740]  foreigner I guess one American no one else knows and of course the one
[04:18.740 --> 04:24.700]  American just quasi knows that it has to do with the founding of the country in
[04:24.700 --> 04:29.380]  1776 they get the year wrong and of course a few days ago he was out there
[04:29.380 --> 04:35.620]  and most Americans want to ban the American flag I mean ban it not just
[04:35.620 --> 04:41.780]  get rid of it they want to ban so the video is up on info wars calm Americans
[04:41.780 --> 04:45.860]  have no idea why they are celebrating fourth of July this is why we're in so
[04:45.860 --> 04:51.260]  much trouble because we have a scientifically rewired brain damaged
[04:51.260 --> 04:57.140]  population that is completely servile and quite frankly not even conscious not
[04:57.140 --> 05:02.980]  even human although the government admits it has no credible evidence of a
[05:02.980 --> 05:07.140]  potential terror attack taking place over the fourth of July holiday the FBI
[05:07.140 --> 05:11.260]  has moved to establish command centers around the country these command
[05:11.260 --> 05:15.540]  centers will integrate local state and federal law enforcement agencies so
[05:15.540 --> 05:20.300]  officials can gauge the threat level and respond quickly let's be real the
[05:20.300 --> 05:24.900]  target of this apparatus is not ISIS and foreign jihadist terrorists but the
[05:24.900 --> 05:28.940]  American people command centers and so-called fusion centers around the
[05:28.940 --> 05:33.740]  country are routinely used to monitor political activists not supposed
[05:33.740 --> 05:37.340]  terrorists and these command centers will certainly be convenient during the
[05:37.340 --> 05:41.780]  upcoming jade helm exercise despite the fact that most Americans are sick and
[05:41.780 --> 05:46.100]  tired of endless terror warnings that don't pan out these threats will
[05:46.100 --> 05:50.460]  continue to be used as a pretext to build and expand the surveillance grid in
[05:50.460 --> 05:55.220]  the United States read more about how the FBI is exploiting baseless fourth of
[05:55.220 --> 06:00.260]  July terror threats to establish command centers at info wars calm ladies and

[08:29.820 --> 08:45.580]  standard time 1776 marked in a big way the demarcation line between the age of
[08:45.580 --> 08:53.860]  kings the age of oligarchies the key the age of conquest and the beginning of the
[08:53.860 --> 09:04.060]  age of enlightenment that's at least how it was built and to a great extent that
[09:04.060 --> 09:11.260]  enlightenment was attained freedoms were expanded human creativity was turned
[09:11.260 --> 09:17.020]  loose the dynamic human spirit was unchained to an extent never before
[09:17.020 --> 09:26.340]  seen but only a fraction of the dream was realized but that fraction of freedom
[09:26.340 --> 09:35.180]  created so much wealth so much technology that we are now drowned we are
[09:35.180 --> 09:42.220]  now drowned to a certain extent in that prosperity and to become decadent
[09:42.220 --> 09:54.060]  disconnected demonic slobs I'm gonna break down right now actually what 1776
[09:54.060 --> 09:58.380]  and what our Republic and what the American flag stands for we're gonna
[09:58.380 --> 10:02.780]  put all glory the stars and stripes up behind me we are a TV viewer info wars
[10:02.780 --> 10:07.180]  com forward slash show to find the free feeds if you want to watch on your phone
[10:07.180 --> 10:12.780]  or home computer or whatever it's important to add that because I'm always
[10:12.780 --> 10:16.460]  talking about put this on screen put that on screen and we still get emails
[10:16.460 --> 10:20.540]  every day saying why are this a radio show and I'm listening to you and say
[10:20.540 --> 10:25.260]  Kansas City or Chicago or wherever and you're talking about look at this look
[10:25.260 --> 10:30.900]  at that we should probably announce every segment we are radio TV in every
[10:30.900 --> 10:35.660]  sense of the word I was probably the first major talk show host to start a
[10:35.660 --> 10:43.460]  webcam about 18 years ago and others followed suit but for at least a decade
[10:43.460 --> 10:47.900]  we've been a full TV production and we've expanded on the quality of that over
[10:47.900 --> 10:52.860]  the years and here we are today and and they say necessity is the mother of
[10:52.860 --> 10:59.100]  invention it is I got tired of saying I went to the Grand Canyon and showed the
[10:59.100 --> 11:03.980]  UN signs and then I would read the UN treaty saying it meant that the UN owned
[11:03.980 --> 11:08.340]  that land and all the land around it for up to 100 miles in all directions and
[11:08.340 --> 11:15.140]  that the park rangers threatened to arrest me for videotaping the UN sign and
[11:15.140 --> 11:23.180]  radio listeners would have trouble believing it back then and so I said
[11:23.180 --> 11:27.420]  that's it I've got to start making films and that grew into what we have here
[11:27.420 --> 11:32.100]  today because back then folks were in denial they thought Ron Paul was lying
[11:32.100 --> 11:38.300]  that the Federal Reserve was private they thought that there was no plan for a
[11:38.300 --> 11:42.580]  world government they thought that NAFTA and get really was just a trade deal
[11:42.580 --> 11:47.540]  at least some Americans believed it now everybody pretty much knows we're going
[11:47.540 --> 11:55.580]  under global corporate government and that's a good thing the bad thing is the
[11:55.580 --> 12:01.500]  general public has been so dumbed down and so distracted and have had their
[12:01.500 --> 12:05.860]  values set on things that don't matter that they don't even understand why
[12:05.860 --> 12:13.220]  that's a bad thing coming up heartbreaking scene unfolds as Greek banks and
[12:13.220 --> 12:23.700]  pensioners clamor for cash their money that ties into the leader of Greece who
[12:23.700 --> 12:30.460]  got into power claiming he'd fight austerity and the EU takeover saying
[12:30.460 --> 12:35.820]  that well now he's not going to listen to the referendum even if the people vote
[12:35.820 --> 12:43.060]  to not go along with the continued accelerated taxes and regulations that
[12:43.060 --> 12:46.340]  are designed to bankrupt them that even if they vote against it the
[12:46.340 --> 12:50.460]  government's now going to not go with the vote and is going to follow the EU
[12:50.460 --> 13:05.940]  eat it and already it was in the news yesterday and today that in Greece
[13:05.940 --> 13:12.660]  multinational banks that own the EU Federal Reserve they've taken over the
[13:12.660 --> 13:19.260]  countries through fraud are withholding PayPal and other credit card payments
[13:19.260 --> 13:26.940]  through the fulfillment merchant accounts to major Greek resorts and
[13:26.940 --> 13:34.580]  hotels killing tourism which is an act of economic piracy outside of law and
[13:34.580 --> 13:39.860]  act of terrorism similar things were done at first against Iceland five years
[13:39.860 --> 13:43.900]  ago when they refused to pay the debts that it turned out 90 plus percent of
[13:43.900 --> 13:49.700]  which were not their debts and so the Greek military says they're prepared to
[13:49.700 --> 13:55.180]  put down the public they're going to ignore their vote and they are going
[13:55.180 --> 14:00.500]  to put in a VAT tax over all the other taxes designed to fully bankrupt what
[14:00.500 --> 14:06.740]  they have left and consolidate the nation but the globalists aren't waiting
[14:06.740 --> 14:13.940]  they are going ahead with grabbing your money that you've paid for your Greek
[14:13.940 --> 14:24.060]  vacation and stealing it this is the casual society this is why they want
[14:24.060 --> 14:28.060]  us doing everything online this is where the world's going when they have full
[14:28.060 --> 14:36.220]  control in fact I will get into why America had been different why it was
[14:36.220 --> 14:39.580]  so special to bottom of the hour and play the latest video that's on drudge
[14:39.580 --> 14:52.020]  report.com and info wars.com that went up last night in fact I'm going to have it
[14:52.020 --> 14:56.660]  reposted to the top of info wars.com
[14:56.660 --> 15:08.020]  citizens don't know what country we succeeded from on July 4th 1776 in fact
[15:08.020 --> 15:14.820]  the people they talked to in California thought that it was secession from the
[15:14.820 --> 15:22.540]  south when the civil war was the opposite of that from the perspective of the
[15:22.540 --> 15:28.420]  north I mean they're doubly ignorant doubly wrong violently ignorant violently
[15:28.420 --> 15:35.700]  stupid and by violently this type of ignorance is what emboldens our enemies
[15:35.700 --> 15:43.700]  this is the ocean in which these megalodons of oppression swim we have a
[15:43.700 --> 15:52.420]  plague of corruption that is upon us we're like a body that has no immune system
[15:52.420 --> 15:56.940]  and we're not living in a bubble we're living in a world full of political
[15:56.940 --> 16:03.300]  diseases and all over the US there are flag burnings of the stars and stripes
[16:03.300 --> 16:13.780]  going on as calls to ban the American flag spread with the leftist all over
[16:13.780 --> 16:17.540]  the country burning American flags they're coming out of the woodwork they
[16:17.540 --> 16:20.900]  don't know who they are they don't know what planet they're from they can hardly
[16:20.900 --> 16:30.580]  talk but they could say racist racist racist I told you two weeks ago burn the
[16:30.580 --> 16:37.700]  rebel battle flag burn the American flag next and make no mistake the global
[16:37.700 --> 16:41.220]  estate the rebel flag because it symbolizes rebellion against central
[16:41.220 --> 16:46.260]  power it was never about slavery and any racist can adopt any symbol they want
[16:46.260 --> 16:49.700]  if somebody wears a cross around their neck and goes and kills people do we
[16:49.700 --> 16:57.740]  ban it somebody wears a star around their neck do we ban the image of a
[16:57.740 --> 17:08.220]  star it's total totalitarianism TT when someone else does something and then you
[17:08.220 --> 17:14.780]  get blamed for it as a collective group but speaking of the cashless society
[17:14.780 --> 17:18.260]  that's almost in place and then the globalist can control everything you do
[17:18.260 --> 17:22.980]  track everything you do raise taxes no order escape in their own words they
[17:22.980 --> 17:26.820]  admit they're setting this up they will feed everything into the collapsing
[17:26.820 --> 17:33.220]  global derivatives by design on the other side a global cashless society we're
[17:33.220 --> 17:38.220]  now being fed through the meat grinder through the woodchipper we're now
[17:38.220 --> 17:44.540]  entering the new world order feet first into a woodchipper if you like feeling
[17:44.540 --> 17:48.940]  your feet chopped off wait till it gets up to your chest wait till it gets up
[17:48.940 --> 17:57.340]  to your neck wait till your family's fed through it and then all around you if
[17:57.340 --> 18:01.300]  you talk about freedom and transparency in the Constitution and restoring
[18:01.300 --> 18:05.820]  checks and balances you'll be screamed at that you're a racist by dim-witted
[18:05.820 --> 18:12.380]  dull-eyed dullards who for all intents and purposes aren't even human or
[18:12.380 --> 18:17.660]  conscious they have had their humanity sucked out of them they are wickedly
[18:17.660 --> 18:24.940]  stupid and wear it like a magisterial crown scepter signant on a gold throne
[18:24.940 --> 18:32.140]  the ignorant giggle and snicker and laugh every time they don't know it mark
[18:32.140 --> 18:39.580]  dice they revel in it they revel in their time living off all the hard work
[18:39.580 --> 18:44.340]  in the past living off the honor of great men and women spitting on it
[18:44.340 --> 18:50.420]  decadently squatting on it as the seized captured government beats the war
[18:50.420 --> 18:55.580]  drums with all the memos and files and movies and TV shows and propaganda
[18:55.580 --> 19:00.580]  newscast demonizing the founders demonizing property demonizing self

[24:00.380 --> 24:06.140]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on
[24:06.140 --> 24:12.900]  the GCN radio network now the University of Wisconsin's come out and said that
[24:12.900 --> 24:18.540]  complimenting anyone of color is racism see everything is racism when the high
[24:18.540 --> 24:22.820]  priests erected so that everyone is guilty and can be politically
[24:22.820 --> 24:30.100]  disappeared demonized at any time brown paper bags are racist criticizing
[24:30.100 --> 24:33.980]  Obamacare is racist not turning your guns in as racist being nice to people as
[24:33.980 --> 24:40.740]  racist this is what we understand now this is our culture is being mentally ill
[24:40.740 --> 24:45.660]  and obsessing over things that don't exist while the globalists consolidate
[24:45.660 --> 24:52.100]  total control over society the video report detailing the new racism being
[24:52.100 --> 24:56.980]  nice to people of color see there's no way to prove you're not evil you are
[24:56.980 --> 25:01.780]  inherently bad because of your color you are white the opposite of what Martin
[25:01.780 --> 25:07.300]  Luther King said but it doesn't matter because we now have an ignorant public
[25:07.300 --> 25:14.020]  that doesn't know any better and we have this newscast piece dealing with the
[25:14.020 --> 25:19.060]  announcement of the TSA kind of like Obama announces more power plans to be
[25:19.060 --> 25:23.780]  shut down outside of law or Obama announces he's gonna stop deportations
[25:23.780 --> 25:31.740]  of felons even Obama just announces what he's gonna do with ISIS well now the
[25:31.740 --> 25:36.340]  agencies are the same TSA to demand real ID licenses that means federally
[25:36.340 --> 25:43.140]  approved state IDs and you'll not be allowed to travel and they will say it's
[25:43.140 --> 25:48.980]  not for federal official use now I've witnessed this many many times and it
[25:48.980 --> 25:54.620]  even came out in the news last year confirming it that illegals can fly
[25:54.620 --> 26:02.140]  without any ID if they're from Mexico it's selectively enforced and the
[26:02.140 --> 26:11.980]  illegals line up I'll hear him talking they'll have no ID nothing they'll show
[26:11.980 --> 26:14.660]  him a letter from the Mexican consulate something like that boom right
[26:14.660 --> 26:18.540]  through citizens I don't care what color you are you're trained to be a slave
[26:18.540 --> 26:23.380]  it's about breaking your will training you to be a prisoner in this new
[26:23.380 --> 26:27.500]  economy and I'm not just saying that rhetorically that's really what's
[26:27.500 --> 26:35.020]  happening so let's go to this piece because Ron Paul's warned of this and by
[26:35.020 --> 26:39.220]  the way he's coming up today in the second hour so is Jesse Ventura and
[26:39.220 --> 26:46.820]  more and so remember this 4th of July land the free home of the brave are you
[26:46.820 --> 26:51.940]  kidding by every benchmark by every yardstick by every historical comparison
[26:51.940 --> 27:00.260]  the apparatus of total oppression is in place and the finishing touches are
[27:00.260 --> 27:06.300]  being fast-tracked in and you notice every major agency every major corporate
[27:06.300 --> 27:10.260]  group not just here but all the world they're announcing forced inoculations
[27:10.260 --> 27:15.420]  from Australia to the United States to England to the UK they are just
[27:15.420 --> 27:19.900]  announcing open borders they are just announcing increased taxes they are
[27:19.900 --> 27:23.140]  announcing that banks will grab money out of your account number they want and
[27:23.140 --> 27:30.420]  keep it themselves why not they already got away with everything why not if you
[27:30.420 --> 27:33.820]  had a Greek vacation booked for months one of the best places to go in the
[27:33.820 --> 27:40.980]  world ultra-beautiful cool people great food amazing culture
[27:41.660 --> 27:47.940]  super successful 20 years ago under globalism under the euro being sucked
[27:47.940 --> 27:53.020]  dry Ireland was the big success story now suddenly they're not they just entered
[27:53.020 --> 27:58.380]  the EU within three years they're getting screwed it's an admitted plan but
[27:58.380 --> 28:06.620]  illiteracy about globalism is what's causing this so here it is to TSA this
[28:06.620 --> 28:12.860]  is a global ID card not just a national ID card you either have a national ID
[28:12.860 --> 28:17.940]  card or you don't travel here it is which is important to know before you get
[28:17.940 --> 28:22.020]  here as it can be a bit of a hassle I've been here twice and I got to be sent home
[28:22.020 --> 28:26.220]  one more time because my passport's expired and I don't have the stamp on
[28:26.220 --> 28:31.140]  my marriage license so I got to go to I said my steel box and find that but
[28:31.140 --> 28:35.580]  Darlene says the wait has actually been short and this will all simplify things
[28:35.580 --> 28:40.060]  for her later on she's right about that and that's the case for anyone who uses
[28:40.060 --> 28:44.700]  their license instead of say a passport for ID it's a choice you don't have to
[28:44.700 --> 28:50.460]  get a real ID card but if you want to get an airplane after 2016 or sometime in
[28:50.460 --> 28:55.500]  there you're gonna have to have a real ID card or a passport so what is a real
[28:55.500 --> 28:59.420]  ID card well looks a lot like your driver's license but that star and the
[28:59.420 --> 29:03.020]  gold circle around it showed that the DMV has checked out all right let's stop
[29:03.020 --> 29:07.180]  right there these cards have at this current point Texas did comply but
[29:07.180 --> 29:11.740]  doesn't comply because the feds can always add more and then refuse the state
[29:11.740 --> 29:14.700]  like you heard if they didn't make the speed limit of 55 of they would hold
[29:14.700 --> 29:20.540]  highway funds same deal this is how they federalize you an internal passport
[29:20.540 --> 29:28.780]  another absolute hallmark jewel in the crowd that you are in a hardcore fascist
[29:28.780 --> 29:33.220]  or totalitarian state I mean they're going down the list every one of them
[29:33.220 --> 29:37.980]  checked the black uniforms the cameras the NSA the FEMA camps the army
[29:37.980 --> 29:41.900]  admitting they're training to round up tea partiers and that will start a civil
[29:41.900 --> 29:47.900]  war all run by Soros as they sit back offshore and laugh roasting hot dogs as
[29:47.900 --> 29:54.380]  this country burns we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:54.380 --> 29:57.900]  GCN radio network
[29:59.020 --> 30:03.300]  have you ever come across someone on the internet that you suspected was a paid
[30:03.300 --> 30:07.420]  government troll well there's a very good chance that you are not imagining
[30:07.420 --> 30:11.780]  things thanks to Edward Snowden we now have solid proof that paid government
[30:11.780 --> 30:16.420]  trolls are using psychology based influence techniques on social media
[30:16.420 --> 30:20.500]  websites such as YouTube Facebook and Twitter some of these techniques include
[30:20.500 --> 30:24.460]  uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote distrust fake online
[30:24.460 --> 30:29.620]  resources such as magazines and books to provide inaccurate information they
[30:29.620 --> 30:33.300]  also set up Facebook groups that encourage and monitor discussion on a
[30:33.300 --> 30:37.460]  topic they can also set up fake trade sites that can take a person's money
[30:37.460 --> 30:42.220]  and personal information as well as send those customers degraded or spoof
[30:42.220 --> 30:45.700]  products like sending computers overseas that are already equipped with a
[30:45.700 --> 30:49.620]  backdoor for the NSA all of this is just more proof that it's actually the
[30:49.620 --> 30:54.100]  government engaging in cybercrime of course it's all an effort to ramp up a
[30:54.100 --> 30:57.940]  non-existent threat to take our freedoms Leanne McAdder reporting for

[33:06.140 --> 33:13.020]  now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear and the shot at Lexington
[33:13.020 --> 33:18.780]  heard around the world when the British fired in the early dawn the war of
[33:18.780 --> 33:25.740]  independence had begun the die was cast the rebel flag unfurled and on to
[33:25.740 --> 33:30.500]  Concord march the fold to seize the arsenal there you know waiting folks

[33:41.140 --> 33:49.020]  town and the shot around the world was a start on the revolution men men were
[33:49.020 --> 33:55.940]  ready on the move take your powder take your gun before the general
[33:55.940 --> 34:02.340]  Washington hurry man there's an hour to lose. It happened that they had planned
[34:02.340 --> 34:06.500]  if the British was ever to come over here that they had put a light up in
[34:06.500 --> 34:12.340]  this high church steeple and Paul went down there to look and showing up there
[34:12.340 --> 34:17.820]  was the light burning brighter than day well Paul he jumped on his old horse and
[34:17.820 --> 34:21.300]  he lit out he didn't know where he's going but he knew he had to go
[34:21.300 --> 34:25.100]  somewhere oh I wish you could have seen it that old horse with his ears laid
[34:25.100 --> 34:29.660]  back in his nostrils wide open a sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding
[34:29.660 --> 34:34.100]  on them cobblestones striking off sparks Paul are holding on for dear life and
[34:34.100 --> 34:38.060]  are hollering at the top of his lungs he says the British is coming the British
[34:38.060 --> 34:43.420]  is coming get you a gun we gonna have us a revolution and them farmers come up
[34:43.420 --> 34:48.340]  piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive minute men there's called. What's
[34:48.340 --> 34:53.140]  mean? Minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and when
[34:53.140 --> 34:57.140]  Paul comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and hit out
[34:57.140 --> 35:02.380]  behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere and when the British come
[35:02.380 --> 35:07.740]  pranks and law all dressed up and in their red suits they let them have it
[35:07.740 --> 35:15.260]  it was a sight to see and then it happened they fired the gun they fired
[35:15.260 --> 35:24.820]  the gun and the shot was so loud it was heard clear around the world. Oh, get out.
[35:24.820 --> 35:29.620]  That's the way this country started.
[35:30.900 --> 35:35.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show I'm your host Alex Jones thank you for
[35:35.900 --> 35:42.140]  joining us I'm not trying to be negative as we approach this July 4th what this
[35:42.140 --> 35:52.460]  country's been around 239 240 years how many is it now founded July 4th 1776 and
[35:52.460 --> 35:56.180]  we did this a few years ago and went out about half the Austinites we talked to
[35:56.180 --> 36:03.100]  didn't know what the fourth of July was about. Mark Dice has gone out and he's
[36:03.100 --> 36:10.340]  done these reports as well and I think it's seven out of ten have no idea two
[36:10.340 --> 36:16.420]  people do one of them is from Italy and one of them thinks that it was the war
[36:16.420 --> 36:21.820]  between the states or the war of Northern aggression as it's seen in the
[36:21.820 --> 36:29.660]  south and you could only get responses like this in a trendy area a university
[36:29.660 --> 36:35.940]  a liberal area and folks know I'm nonpartisan the Republican leadership is
[36:35.940 --> 36:41.580]  just as bad as the Democrats but the constituents of the Democratic Party are
[36:41.580 --> 36:48.540]  some of the most culturally historically ignorant people of the planet
[36:48.540 --> 36:57.060]  they're scary and they're very self-satisfied in their ignorance and
[36:57.060 --> 37:04.900]  they're very totalitarian he goes out in California out to Venice Beach and
[37:04.900 --> 37:11.580]  other areas and these are not edited and by that he's not cherry picking the
[37:11.580 --> 37:15.820]  stupid people talking to 50 folks and finding you know finding 10 and showing
[37:15.820 --> 37:21.020]  and he's showing you everyone he talked to we've been out there with him we've
[37:21.020 --> 37:30.420]  done it too it's frightening you go to a blue collar working area and almost
[37:30.420 --> 37:35.020]  everyone knows who we declared independence from you go to a wealthy area everybody
[37:35.020 --> 37:39.300]  knows you go to an area where folks actually have jobs they know you can
[37:39.300 --> 37:42.700]  go to an area and talk to people that are immigrants I've noticed and they
[37:42.700 --> 37:46.740]  know because that's interesting that we had a war with the British Empire and
[37:46.740 --> 37:54.140]  one but if you talk to trendies black white Hispanic Asian I don't care they
[37:54.140 --> 38:02.420]  are so stupid you can hardly believe it and they're proud of it they're proud of
[38:02.420 --> 38:05.220]  not caring about their neighbors or themselves they're proud of not knowing
[38:05.220 --> 38:10.660]  how to find their butt with both hands they like it and the reason I say
[38:10.660 --> 38:13.940]  they're not people and I've not dehumanized them they dehumanize
[38:13.940 --> 38:20.020]  themselves the reason they're not people is that from birth they put but in
[38:20.020 --> 38:24.620]  front of a television and they're not
[38:24.620 --> 38:30.340]  creative they have no innate spark they don't even have their instincts for
[38:30.340 --> 38:35.220]  survival and building a better world and being creators their free will has been
[38:35.220 --> 38:41.980]  erased to where they just absorb whatever they're told and then regurgitate it
[38:42.820 --> 38:47.180]  if you asked them about the rebel flag they could tell you it was racist and
[38:47.180 --> 38:51.060]  evil need to be banned if you asked them about Kim Kardashian or her stepdad
[38:51.060 --> 38:56.580]  they know all about it if you asked them about the different flavors of energy
[38:56.580 --> 39:01.260]  drinks they could tell you if you asked them about the NFL they could tell you
[39:01.260 --> 39:10.620]  if you asked the women about different sexual positions they know but they
[39:10.620 --> 39:17.100]  don't have any idea even where they are most Americans now in big college
[39:17.100 --> 39:19.980]  polls they have every year the majority don't know the three branches of
[39:19.980 --> 39:25.300]  government don't know their state capital they are helpless except for one
[39:25.300 --> 39:29.380]  thing they're basically reanimated dead they have no mind they basically their
[39:29.380 --> 39:35.140]  soul is a shadow of its former self they're just filling space until they
[39:35.140 --> 39:41.780]  physically die but they can be animated like a zombie army by the mainstream
[39:41.780 --> 39:48.940]  media to do anything they're told as long as they feel like they're being
[39:48.940 --> 39:53.900]  powerful and are on a winning team because they don't care about really
[39:53.900 --> 39:57.300]  not being racist they don't really care about charity they've had major studies
[39:57.300 --> 40:01.580]  that show this that liberals are six times self-identifying modern liberals
[40:01.580 --> 40:09.180]  are six times more likely to steal as London Guardian and just as many times
[40:09.180 --> 40:15.220]  likely six times not to give in charity conservatives and libertarians and
[40:15.220 --> 40:20.660]  classical liberals which you would call a right-wing extremist are the majority
[40:20.660 --> 40:27.020]  of givers but don't want to be told where to give and don't go around
[40:27.020 --> 40:36.340]  advertising it so what you've got is neo-fascist posers who are sickeningly
[40:36.340 --> 40:41.500]  stupid and they are victims they were raised by weaker individuals who probably
[40:41.500 --> 40:47.980]  still had some soul and then now they've been so marinated in this false
[40:47.980 --> 40:52.700]  culture in this synthetic culture that they're gone and let me tell you
[40:52.700 --> 41:01.060]  something they're not coming back and they think we're a democracy where 51
[41:01.060 --> 41:09.860]  percent can vote to enslave the other 49 no we're a constitutional republic the
[41:09.860 --> 41:15.620]  truest sense in our charter doesn't mean we ever lived up to it but what we did
[41:15.620 --> 41:19.860]  do was better than everybody else it's why everybody came here proof is in the
[41:19.860 --> 41:24.500]  pudding it's why we had the most inventions and the most innovation and
[41:24.500 --> 41:29.140]  the most exploration and trailblazing we were exceptionally amazing
[41:29.140 --> 41:34.780]  exceptionally strong exceptionally smart exceptionally brave exceptionally
[41:34.780 --> 41:43.420]  murderous oh we've got a dark side too every major military historian for 240
[41:43.420 --> 41:47.260]  years from the French to the Japanese to the Russians to the British that
[41:47.260 --> 41:54.620]  recorded the behavior of Americans was once you got in a fight with the
[41:54.620 --> 42:00.620]  Americans they would never ever ever ever give up and they would work around
[42:00.620 --> 42:05.820]  the clock to kill you and then basically give you no mercy once they'd gotten the
[42:05.820 --> 42:10.340]  upper hand and that's why this country was feared and didn't need to run around
[42:10.340 --> 42:14.940]  building empires people wanted to trade with us they wanted to be involved with
[42:14.940 --> 42:22.700]  us because we were truly noble compared to other nations we were still free
[42:22.700 --> 42:32.140]  booting and barbarous and wicked as the day is long but if mountains reach into
[42:32.140 --> 42:38.820]  the sky and towards the heavens we were the greatest mountain in a range of
[42:38.820 --> 42:45.540]  corruption and now the forced inoculations and your children belong to
[42:45.540 --> 42:49.820]  the state and national ID cards and internal ID cards to travel and banks
[42:49.820 --> 42:55.100]  taking money out of your account outside of law a criminal global combine
[42:55.100 --> 43:00.580]  globally above the law ready to have its way with you and your family as an act
[43:00.580 --> 43:07.660]  of total domination the lowest of the low the the opposite of the Renaissance
[43:07.660 --> 43:14.460]  the opposite of free will the opposite of a free republic in a republic if 51
[43:14.460 --> 43:20.420]  percent vote to make the other 49 slaves or to give you a national religion or to
[43:20.420 --> 43:25.620]  force you into conscription it can't hold up because it violates the Bill of
[43:25.620 --> 43:32.900]  Rights which only points out unalienable unblockable unchangeable rights that are
[43:32.900 --> 43:41.300]  there in an innate sentient free creature and so we see American flags
[43:41.300 --> 43:47.820]  from New York to Austin Texas in the last day to California being burned by the
[43:47.820 --> 43:52.140]  George Soros funded black lives matter crowd that's basically just a
[43:52.140 --> 43:56.780]  communist recruiting house using the excesses of federalized paramilitary
[43:56.780 --> 44:01.060]  police to build the counter revolution that's meant to spark off the larger
[44:01.060 --> 44:07.820]  revolution that brings in the collapse of the country and that's only one
[44:07.820 --> 44:11.220]  possible corridor they're going down it doesn't mean they'll implement that
[44:11.220 --> 44:17.340]  fully but it's certainly being looked at and engaged and levered up levered up
[44:17.340 --> 44:22.100]  to the highest level ever
[44:25.700 --> 44:31.200]  and so yes the American flag has flown over neocolonialism yes the American
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.420]  flag has flown over massacres from wounded knee to
[44:36.420 --> 44:43.060]  things that happened in Vietnam to Iraq but don't put the American flag up
[44:43.060 --> 44:48.980]  there as the living creature that committed these crimes the crimes were
[44:48.980 --> 44:53.340]  committed by the globalist that have seized control of this nation and that
[44:53.340 --> 44:58.340]  are using our country our treasure our power our blood to build their
[44:58.340 --> 45:07.220]  planetary government while we take the blame and their own agents then blame
[45:07.220 --> 45:12.220]  the Republic for everything they've done
[45:12.700 --> 45:18.620]  don't worry super PACs just this year alone from George Soros have given 24
[45:18.620 --> 45:24.140]  million to Hillary and Hillary's campaign head was at Bilderberg no one
[45:24.140 --> 45:31.420]  else's campaign head was showing you who the aid to campus they've got Trump
[45:31.420 --> 45:38.760]  running as the ringer in my view against Jeb who's the second ringer for
[45:38.760 --> 45:47.980]  Hillary and I predict they're gonna put Trump and Jeb as the front runners by
[45:47.980 --> 45:53.340]  giving them the attention making a fight between them worthy of WWF that
[45:53.340 --> 45:57.460]  that Trump's been gone out and been part of WWF before and we're seeing it on clip
[45:57.460 --> 46:06.780]  on the news and then he will bow out to Jeb at the last minute and then Jeb
[46:06.780 --> 46:13.780]  will fall to Hillary only in America could you have such synthetic made-up
[46:13.780 --> 46:22.140]  fake political garbage but America stands for free market and the right to do
[46:22.140 --> 46:25.980]  process and the right to self-defense and the right to private property and
[46:25.980 --> 46:30.020]  the right to be left alone that's what the flag symbolizes and why it was
[46:30.020 --> 46:34.020]  loved a bunch of out-of-control globalist that have overrun our country it
[46:34.020 --> 46:37.860]  does not symbolize but I'll tell you this if we let them fully take over the
[46:37.860 --> 46:42.660]  country and blame the flag worldwide for what they've done we deserve it to be
[46:42.660 --> 46:47.620]  the slaves we will become fully and the flag will be captured and will be
[46:47.620 --> 46:55.100]  another trinket another war prize another trophy of the globalist conquest of
[46:55.100 --> 47:00.500]  this planet but their attempt and use this country as their juggernaut could
[47:00.500 --> 47:06.780]  be their downfall a battle for planetary freedom is being fought in the United
[47:06.780 --> 47:11.140]  States more than anywhere we are exceptional yet again even in the
[47:11.140 --> 47:16.380]  midst of our drug doubt mind-controlled state let's go to Mark Dice's latest

[49:28.140 --> 49:36.300]  Declaration of Independence what year was that exactly sometime in the 1700s I'm

[54:00.380 --> 54:07.020]  we are back live former Congress from Ron Paul's coming up former governor
[54:07.020 --> 54:12.060]  Jesse Ventura and other surprise guests today Ron Paul's talking about the
[54:12.060 --> 54:17.220]  collapse he's been predicting being very very close quote day of reckoning boy
[54:17.220 --> 54:22.100]  we have a lot of news on that front what day is Mexican Independence Day from
[54:22.100 --> 54:31.380]  Spain is it September something what is it September 16 I mean but I know when
[54:31.380 --> 54:35.540]  people say what's Mexican Independence Day I know it's from Spain another
[54:35.540 --> 54:41.780]  colonial power and of course then Santa Ana basically took over and was a
[54:41.780 --> 54:48.740]  tyrant screwed everything up so Mexico lost Guatemala and Texas but what's
[54:48.740 --> 54:55.380]  frustrating is I don't get any pleasure out of how ignorant my fellow Americans
[54:55.380 --> 54:59.500]  are I mean I know about French Independence Day and the Bastille I
[54:59.500 --> 55:03.140]  know what Bastille day is I know about the different independence movements in
[55:03.140 --> 55:07.220]  England I know about Magna Carta I know about the Parliament Act because this
[55:07.220 --> 55:13.860]  is important stuff it's interesting too but I talk to historians and people and
[55:13.860 --> 55:17.340]  I'll know more than they do in general because they'll be specialists on the
[55:17.340 --> 55:22.460]  Byzantines are on the Japanese are on Mesoamerica it's just so scary that
[55:22.460 --> 55:26.980]  general knowledge is not there I thought growing up that my parents were just
[55:26.980 --> 55:30.300]  normal folks just constantly telling me what this was and what that was and
[55:30.300 --> 55:34.380]  reading me books and showing me news articles and taking me to the Smithsonian
[55:34.380 --> 55:40.820]  but that I'm on one end of this and then you've got these people over here that
[55:40.820 --> 55:45.940]  really believe because I've heard that before that Independence Day is over the
[55:45.940 --> 55:50.060]  South like the South is the enemy most the generals against the British came
[55:50.060 --> 55:56.620]  from the South George Washington you name it general Lee but Lee's grandfather
[55:56.620 --> 55:59.740]  wasn't his dad I'm saying his dad
[55:59.740 --> 56:05.300]  light horse Lee the South the North got along really well up until the Civil
[56:05.300 --> 56:09.140]  War it wasn't about slavery but you've got an ignorant public that can be told
[56:09.140 --> 56:15.660]  lies about it and they believe it and I told you two weeks ago if they could
[56:15.660 --> 56:21.220]  take down the battle flag the Confederate battle flag it's not even the
[56:21.220 --> 56:25.780]  Confederate flag they just call it that it's how ignorant the public is that's a
[56:25.780 --> 56:30.500]  whole nother flag if they can do that they can pull down everything and now

[56:47.740 --> 56:51.300]  but no one ever criticizes Muslims were having slaves because that's cute
[56:51.300 --> 56:58.540]  that's trendy that's fun and I'm not even a Muslim basher Muslims that want
[56:58.540 --> 57:02.460]  their women to be free like the Kurds are under attack or the Syrians are under
[57:02.460 --> 57:09.580]  attack our government's bankrolling the worst radical Muslims there are because

[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:41.660]  in Houston he'll be joining us we've got so much other news we're gonna be
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:47.100]  getting into today before I go any further I did a 30-second plug in the
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.820]  last hour and I'm proud of the fact that we do about a minute of plugging two
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.500]  minutes of plugging an hour on average the average talk show host does it about
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.860]  four or five minutes that's where you really get the big effect is live on
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.900]  air plugs everybody knows that and in TV they have product placement you name it
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.740]  and about once every two weeks sometimes once a week we do 30 minutes or so
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:11.140]  that's kind of infomercially just to try to pay the bills around here it's what
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.540]  we do but it's even more important to support a local AM and FM affiliates
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.940]  to spread the word about them and to become sponsors or to support local
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.420]  sponsors and let them know why you are supporting them it's absolutely integral
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.340]  that's why we're getting more and more affiliates and God bless you but selling
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:31.780]  high-quality non-gmo seeds shortwave radios patriot apparel books films knives
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:38.620]  firearms that's how we fund this operation if I use a cook stove and love
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:43.060]  it a little miniature cook stove we buy it start selling it if I like a
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.740]  particular brand of shortwave radio that's inexpensive I call up and you
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.220]  know find out who owns the company and become a distributor eight years ago
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:56.500]  if I separately test water filters we send them off ourselves it's not very
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.660]  expensive a couple hundred bucks to get each filter tested we found the actual
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:05.460]  best and carry it a propure G2 I mean it's real simple I'm a very
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.740]  superstitious person I don't mean superstitious about walking under ladders
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.100]  and things like that though I don't like when a black cat runs out in front of me
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.660]  I'm okay I'm superstitious I'm not going with all sorts of stuff but I'm not
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.980]  super bad I'm not a superstitious person but I am you know what I mean but I
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:26.460]  would tell you it's called God's fearing I don't do things to people even when
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.940]  I've worked in restaurants and stuff back in college and so I was really rude
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.420]  really mean to me and somebody say let's stick a you know a roach leg in their
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:38.140]  food I'd be like no because I don't want that done to me so whatever we sell and
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.740]  promote here I believe in if you hear me endorsing it the network has its own
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.900]  sponsors I can't vet them I'm not saying they're bad they can't vet mine just if
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:53.740]  you hear me endorsing it I have tested it I believe in it we spent over the year
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:57.380]  over the year trying to come out with the ultimate brain formula of known
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:02.940]  things that naturally without getting you like sped up and burn out would boost
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.020]  you I have a bottle of this at home forgot to take it this morning took it
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:11.100]  right before the show it hit 20 minutes ago it's like a rush of energy clarity
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:15.580]  recall and the problem is we only ordered a limited amount of this because
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.540]  it's expensive to manufacture because two of the ingredients are prescription in
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:25.620]  Europe we went over this with Anthony two days ago and CJ Durand the break was
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.140]  saying oh I saw you pop that brain force 30 minutes ago I can see it's
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:36.060]  hitting because it's amazing and it will sell out by Monday so it's the best of
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.100]  times worst of times people are really excited about this once you try it I
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:46.220]  know that it's gonna really help funder operation praise God CJ you guys in

[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.820]  has been your experience with brain force well I stole one of your pills
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.220]  yesterday didn't do its day so you don't run out but it's by far the most
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:05.240]  effective feeling after taking any of the supplements DNA force gives you some
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.500]  tingling your nerves as the nerves are basically regenerating which is awesome
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:16.420]  but secret 12 basically gives you more fuel to expend energy this I'm not a
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:23.020]  morning person but I can take one and I'm clear I've got energy I don't feel
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:28.180]  like I've taken any supplement that just happens to wake me up it's incredible

[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.860]  now I've tried stuff and you just get a speed feeling off of which I don't like
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:54.500]  this is clear this is calm this is almost euphoric this is secondly good

[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.900]  FBI informants were recruiting people for terror plots which were then busted
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.820]  by the FBI and remember back in February an FBI official said we need to keep
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:35.220]  fair alive to justify terror budget the quote is from a documentary entitled the
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.740]  newberg sting which tells how the feds convince four poverty-stricken New
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.940]  York men to become involved in an informant led terror plot the paid FBI
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.260]  informant is alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million

[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:18.100]  joining us from his television studios in the great state of Texas former
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:25.140]  congressman medical doctor veteran Ron Paul joins us for the next 20 minutes or
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:31.220]  so Institute for peace and prosperity dot org is his powerful think tank
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.620]  website he of course does his daily TV and radio show vignettes and he's got a
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.860]  new book coming out swords into plowshears will obviously have him on as
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:46.180]  soon as that comes out but more active probably more effective now than
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:51.060]  anybody else in the world fighting collectivism he'll go down in history
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.900]  undoubtedly as greater in the fight for liberty than even in Alexander Schultz
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.660]  and eats and a modern Thomas Jefferson and he's a humble man and he won't say
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.860]  those things about himself and even the movement won't say those things because
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:08.940]  libertarians are humble conservatives are humble patriots are humble but we
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:13.220]  have to celebrate our leaders and celebrate that he was doctor no 20
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:17.700]  something years ago never won anything never got cosponsors and then by the
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.140]  time he left congress much of the tea party movement had adopted his americana
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.220]  ideas that said former congressman Ron Paul joins us I want to cover the
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:32.220]  waterfront with him first off a few weeks ago you put an alert saying that
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:40.020]  get ready for serious crises in the stock market you talked about problems in
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.660]  the bond market you said a day of reckoning was coming we're getting
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.660]  closer to the big event in your own words being a von Mies Institute fellow
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:52.860]  you know being on the banking committee but understanding the inside baseball is
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:55.980]  the day of judgment for the Federal Reserve and other private central banks
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:04.620]  coming yeah I think for that not to come would be a surprise to me and you've
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.780]  been involved in this a long time I mean it wasn't like you didn't know what was
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:13.340]  happening with the housing bubble and we had the Nasdaq bubble and now now we
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.220]  have other bubbles we still have another stock market bubble and there's another
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.740]  housing bubble going on but the big bubble I think is in the bond bubble
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:24.420]  it's been going on for 35 years taking interest rates from 21% down to
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.140]  actually negative and they've been getting away with it so this means
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.780]  distortion not only is there money involved but it distorted all the
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.460]  investment over these periods of time in the biggest distortion that it
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.180]  encourages debt encourages debt for a lot of people but in particular government
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:47.580]  and as long as our government is able to print the reserve currency it's going
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.180]  to limp along even though our economy is limping along but that will come to an
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:56.540]  end and right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming apart I mean we
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.060]  look at Detroit as an example we see what's happening in Greece they're
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:05.740]  worrying about what's going to happen you know after Greece is recognized as
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.420]  actually totally bankrupt there'll be other countries this distortion has been
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:14.820]  going on for so long most people think that when governments print money that
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.700]  the only thing that happens is that prices go up as a consequence of
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.460]  inflation and a lot of that is true and it's a serious problem and destroys the
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:28.820]  middle class and the poor but to me the bigger distortion is the lack of pricing
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:34.060]  for money and causing people to do dumb things and that's why they overbuild and
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:38.260]  overinvesting governments overspend and then you have the Keynesians still in
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.580]  charge this says that says the solution for this is just to spend more money and
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:49.100]  print more money and that's coming to an end the day of reckoning is is is at a
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:54.820]  hand. Undoubtedly the day of reckoning came a long time ago for Greece and
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:58.900]  areas of Africa and Latin America there seems to be this arrogant idea that it
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:04.620]  can't ever happen here but if you look at the real numbers 0.2 growth that's
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.380]  with the cook numbers for most Americans we've been in a very long
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:15.140]  recession. Yes and you know even the figures that came out today on the
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:21.460]  employment you know unemployment down to 5.3 percent not recognizing or
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:26.740]  admitting you know that 646,000 dropped out of the workforce and we have more
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:33.340]  people 93 million people unemployed and out of the workforce and that if you
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:37.300]  look at full-time jobs it's a disaster even though they claim there were a lot
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.700]  of new jobs but they were part-time jobs so there's a few new jobs and then they
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.700]  fudged the unemployment figures but it's all you know in the system and even the
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.380]  people who know these are fudge figures still play along because they know that
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.900]  the majority will play along and they think there's another buck to be made
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:59.580]  you know in trading but the markets are are more powerful than the Fed and in
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:04.540]  governments and markets will rule a lot of a lot of people would always say you
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:09.180]  know keep an eye on the Fed on what they're doing but the Fed needs to keep
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.260]  an eye on the market because the market eventually will take over just like the
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:17.100]  market finally took over when they claimed that the dollar was the worst
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:23.340]  $35 you know an ounce and that was not true so the governments will lie to us
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:27.340]  they'll get away with it for a long time there will be an illusion and a false
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.500]  trust and we will benefit tremendously because we have a military might and
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.020]  because we have this privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.380]  but you know the the obligations that we have the unfunded obligations over
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:46.140]  $2 trillion you know $200 trillion that is not going to be paid and the only
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:49.900]  arguments that goes on with these countries like in Greece now there is
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:53.540]  who's going to get stuck and the bankers are worried they're going to get stuck
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.980]  and that's what they argue about but the debt will not be paid and we cannot pay
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.700]  our debt it's just a matter of time but people say well tell me when tell me when
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.900]  well nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event but you can tell when the
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:13.860]  foundation has eroded and the foundation not only of our economic system but the
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:18.740]  world financial system like no other time in history has been eroded and there's
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:23.100]  going to be serious problems because there will have to be a correction of
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.860]  this and you can't correct it with more spending and more debt which is what
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:31.900]  they're trying to do and then we add the Puerto Rico situation and then we've
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.420]  got thousands of counties that are on the edge are already bankrupt we've got
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:42.300]  multiple states that fiscally are worse off than Greece I mean the US really is
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:46.620]  on the same debt path as Greece and my concern is the bigger they are the
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.500]  harder they fall it seems like this bubble is so mega massive that when it
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:56.420]  does implode and we're so non-self-sufficient back when your parents
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.140]  and I guess you as a young man went through the Great Depression people were
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:08.420]  much more resilient now people are not agrarian we were 90% rural 10% urban now
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:14.860]  we're 90% urban 10% rural if we have a real depression in this country I just
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:22.180]  absolutely fear for my children there's reason to be fearful because the work
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:26.860]  ethic is not with us at all people believe that they are owed a living
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.820]  people in Greece you know you sympathize with them to a degree because the
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:35.340]  banks have ripped off the system for so long but that doesn't eliminate the
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.700]  responsibility of the individuals who have benefited from this free money
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.740]  whether it's student aid or houses and these sort of things it's it's it's been
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:48.940]  there for a long time and right now there's many people in in Greece who are
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.940]  really determined they hate this austerity thing of course I can't stand the
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.500]  idea that the IMF is running the show or the European Union is running the show
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:02.780]  it should be should be liquidated but they were retiring at the age of 56 at
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.100]  full benefits and we have that same problem here this is what brought
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:11.980]  Detroit down and I imagine every state has problem but the unemployment
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.580]  well unemployment's a big problem but it's the retirement funds and our
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:21.260]  retirement system our you know social security system is not solvent nor is
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:25.260]  the medical care system it sounds great we're gonna take care of you it's an
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:29.380]  affordable care system well you know the medical system we were having shoved
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.380]  down our throats is unaffordable care system and but the market will
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:39.700]  eventually rule and people will have to face up to their predicament and right
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.780]  now people are getting a little more nervous about the fact you mean those
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:47.540]  poor people in Greece they they went along with it and now all they want to
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.940]  do is get a hundred bucks out a month to live on and the government has you know
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:56.500]  capital controls how much money you can take out that has never worked in the
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:02.340]  past it just causes the next country to try to beat the system so there'll be
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:06.740]  other countries including this country people will try to get out of the system
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.740]  and maybe get their money out of the banks well for me that's what really
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:15.180]  shows us that we're getting close to the big event that you've been warning
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:20.340]  about coming closer is that all over the west elites are hoarding cash holding
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:25.700]  gold trying to restrict the public from doing it the TSA announced next year if
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.380]  the states don't have real ID federally approved IDs you won't be able to fly an
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:35.900]  internal passport we now have speaking of medical tyranny forced inoculations
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:41.740]  bill signed in California we've got the Supreme Court now legislating from the
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:46.940]  bench clearly it seems like the bottom is falling out a do you agree with that
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:51.420]  and then be where does it go from here
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:59.740]  well yes the bottom is falling out and this is the the big problem because
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:06.260]  it's unsustainable and eventually that the people will have to you know
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:13.860]  recognize this and something else has to change the the system is not viable but
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:20.020]  there's always this willingness to try to prop it up like we did in 08 and 09
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:25.780]  we we propped it up but the debt is illiquid it's not worth anything the
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:31.340]  sooner you liquidate the death is better you cannot preserve the debt my
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.500]  argument is and you alluded to this is the fact that you know this is big
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.940]  problems for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of wealth and even
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:44.060]  some wealthy people are going to lose out but everybody has to adjust to the
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.700]  fact that there will be a change and there will be a liquidation and there
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.780]  will be living beneath our means we've lived way beyond our means but it's what
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.100]  we do about it if we keep doing the wrong things it'll last too long this is
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:03.780]  already this recession which is really a depression is lasting too long so if if
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:09.500]  you we do this what we have to preserve is our liberty because if we do if we
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.740]  eliminate all our wealth and had our liberties where you just eliminate all
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:17.460]  those things you just listed here what our government is going to do we would
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.500]  be back on our feet rather shortly but that's where the real crisis is now if
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:25.660]  we don't build our strength on those individuals who know and understand what
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.300]  liberty is all about we're going to lose our wealth we're going to further lose
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:33.260]  our liberty and all this is going to be available some guy walking in with a white
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.100]  horse and say I'm in charge now if you listen to what I'm going to do I will
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.220]  deliver you from all the tragedy that exists and it's not a man on a white
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.940]  horse it's going to save us it's somebody who understands and gets that
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:51.620]  eight or nine percent that's necessary to lead us in the ways of a more free society because
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.380]  that's what's count so people shouldn't be discouraged and say oh this is
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.980]  overwhelming how are you going to 51% to give up their benefit now you're not
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:03.300]  going to but you could get more people in leadership positions and that's where I
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:07.460]  think we're making some progress but we have a tough job ahead because we have
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:11.380]  to convince the majority of people that they cannot find their answers in more
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.060]  government. Former Congressman Ron Paul is our guest the Institute for Peace and
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:19.780]  Prosperity dot org I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com we've only got a few
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.580]  minutes left. Looking at this I've brought up the whole issue and you've
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.340]  brought up the issue of the financial crisis being front and center but as you
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:30.620]  mentioned historically totalitarianism comes out of a collapse and then the
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:37.380]  countries never emerge out of their hellish existence. If we have some of our
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:43.980]  liberties intact we can quickly bounce back but also war follows that and we
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:48.260]  have just extreme examples of funding radicals against Syria funding radicals
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:54.820]  against Russia in Crimea a really aggressive megalomaniacal reckless
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.620]  actions by the governing elite you've been up in Congress for many years you
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.100]  serve the military is it just that we know more about it now so it seems like
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.620]  the government's more out of control or is the government more out of control
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:11.140]  because it seems like on every front they're just power grabbing as fast as
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:15.460]  they can Texas is grabbing its gold from the Federal Reserve the Germans want it
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:18.820]  back I mean if you look at what's going on it looks like they're getting ready
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:25.100]  for something big. Yeah and they they are and I think the worst things guess
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:30.860]  the more of this you'll see because they won't admit the problem they won't
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:35.780]  admit that they don't have enough wealth and money to bribe everybody and
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:39.980]  give them benefits and that's that's when it's coming to an end and right now
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:45.620]  we are facing that and I think it is obviously going to be very very serious
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:51.260]  the the governments will do what is necessary to maintain their control but
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.140]  it can come out better I know what you're talking about how so often this
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:59.700]  leads to war a matter of fact you know many people say oh thank goodness for
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:05.060]  FDR he had this World War two and got us out of the depression what nonsense is
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.220]  that but we had a revolution and it's one of the rare things in history where
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.060]  the people who were involved in the revolution to beat the authoritarians
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:19.220]  actually ended up with more liberty but if you look at you know what happened
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:24.500]  after World War one and the depression and Hitler coming in charge and opening
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:28.780]  up the doors to communism but the 20th century has proved that fascism and
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.980]  communism you know has failed I think it's more apparent to the world that
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:37.820]  communism of the Stalin type has failed and nobody's advocating that but I'm
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:42.380]  frightened by the people who are carelessly drifting into this well we
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:46.140]  need big government big drug companies big medicine everybody in
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:50.460]  partnerships with the government and that is where our biggest problem is
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.660]  and too many people are going along with this because you find that in both
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:23:01.860]  political parties yes sir in closing looking at election 2016 Rand Paul in
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.300]  all the early polls and its CPAC year after year and in New Hampshire and
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:12.740]  other areas was leading but by ignoring him and then the guy behind him Ted
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:19.940]  Cruz they have now basically in new polls focused on Jeb and Trump and I think
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:24.900]  Trump clearly will get a bunch of more libertarian support and then drag it
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:30.140]  away from other candidates and then drop out for Jeb and then Hillary's campaign
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.580]  head was at Bilderberg in Austria this year we were there covering it no one
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:38.900]  else from from other candidates so it looks like she's the one that they're
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:45.380]  pushing for is there any way you see in this upcoming election to reach out to
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.900]  the public and explain to them how they're being conned so that we can get
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:55.820]  a senator Rand Paul and I know he's your son but Ted Cruz supported TPP and
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:59.740]  I'm really upset with him about that and and your son of course valiantly
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.700]  didn't and so they're doubling down on money against him both Republicans and
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.420]  Democrats I know you don't want to get involved in the election you want to
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:11.300]  stay neutral on that but just as an American watching another sickening
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:17.300]  spectacle I mean imagine President Hillary well it's going to be a
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.700]  disaster and they're pretty much in charge and Rand is the alternative to
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.100]  the whole system because he's the only one is suggesting that we should have a
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.460]  less militaristic foreign policy he's been on the right side of challenging
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.500]  the Federal Reserve system and he's been good on civil liberties but the
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.380]  establishment is very very powerful but and we have to recognize that but
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.260]  eventually though the only thing that really counts is reaching out and
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.620]  changing people's hearts and minds and then the political system will reflect
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.980]  those changes right now there are too many Americans who either don't care
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:58.420]  don't pay attention or think these wars are wonderful but you mentioned the
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.420]  wars that are going on and that contributes tremendously to our
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:05.820]  bankruptcy and trim and tremendously to building enemies around the world and
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:09.940]  when we get in worse financial shape believe me they're not going to be
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:16.420]  bashful about coming back at us so right now with all the candidates except
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:21.700]  Rand they're only going to make things much worse as far as I'm concerned it
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:25.140]  must be amazing after all your hard work and success promoting liberty to see
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:31.060]  your son being the only person out of a field of like 11 candidates who's being
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.380]  called radical just because 50 years ago he'd be called middle of the road he's
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.860]  just promoting basic sane Americana ideas and I hope and pray that we can get him
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.380]  the nomination but regardless running he'll help educate people just like you
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:49.180]  did to tens of millions and the young people are waking up as well former
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:54.300]  Congressman Ron Paul congratulations on your successful TV and radio shows and
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.420]  great job your crew down there thank you for all your time thank you good to be
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:03.900]  with you have a great fourth wow well what a great present to the info wars
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:08.460]  audience to have Ron Paul his first live video interview he's been on with us
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:14.020]  since 1996 hundreds of times first time he's been on with us live via video from
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:18.980]  his amazing studios so just so exciting to have him on again I don't get giddy
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:22.820]  when I meet professional football players or basketball players or even
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.260]  movie stars and I know some of the biggest movie stars out there and it's
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:32.060]  interesting it's fine especially if you're a fan of him but Ron Paul I mean
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:38.020]  that's founding father material right there that's the real deal just a decent
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:43.540]  honorable person look how good he looks at almost 80 if you're watching via the
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:49.220]  free feeds and then four wars dot com forward slash show I mean just a blessed
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:53.380]  man with a whole bunch of grandkids and you know standing up working harder now
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:27:00.660]  than he ever did his mind sharper than ever and then you compare that to the
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.860]  slobs at the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership that are selling
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:09.340]  this country out and Ron Paul speaks every week to packed halls of sometimes
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:14.460]  20,000 young people on average about 5,000 I mean he's come to Austin and
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:20.260]  spoke outside when 20,000 people show up that's the antidote to the young people
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:24.260]  that don't know what planet they're on and I want to play again this clip mark
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.460]  dies is up on drudgereport.com citizens don't know what country we
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:34.460]  succeeded from in 1776 here it is what are we celebrating on the 4th of July
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:40.940]  our independence a little more specific it's the day that we overtook the south
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:45.580]  and it's the day that it's our independence it's that's why we have
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.740]  the fire from the south from the south exactly so it was the victor of the
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:57.380]  civil war yes 4th of July yes the Declaration of Independence was signed
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:06.660]  by who I don't know that's good fast forward to the last guy they talked to
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:11.060]  an Italian guy he didn't look like a professor he's just a hip guy and he
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.780]  goes your revolution against Britain against the Colonials we all love this
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:21.620]  the world loved it nobody had kicked the British's butt they'd be beating
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:28.940]  everybody we defeated them because it basically was the colonies were British
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.860]  and German and basically Dutch folks and Irish and others but the point was is
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.060]  that they'd been in a bunch of wars and then the British tried to enslave
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.660]  everybody they said no way and the whole world marveled at that and now
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.060]  Americans don't know why you have the 4th talk about dummies but that's a
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:49.460]  group and those are the Democrats and that's who they've got on their side I
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:53.620]  guarantee every one of those idiots is a hardcore Obama supporter they just go
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.220]  with whatever's trendy they love death panels they love forced abortion they
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:02.260]  love having their prices increased when Obama says two plus two equals five he's
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:07.740]  talking to his morons his brain dead zombies let's go to that clip to celebrate
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.900]  the 4th of July it's a Independence Day when you got ready a read of modern
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.380]  England right yeah well why we celebrated more than American everybody
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.380]  loves to get rid of there like you know like the colon the colonizer so it's

[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:49.740]  this is what they teach this is what they teach is ignorance we're on the

[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.340]  have you ever come across someone on the internet that you suspected was a paid
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.460]  government troll well there's a very good chance that you were not imagining
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:11.820]  things thanks to Edward Snowden we now have solid proof that paid government
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:16.460]  trolls are using psychology based influence techniques on social media
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:20.540]  websites such as YouTube Facebook and Twitter some of these techniques include
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.740]  uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote distrust fake online
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:29.660]  resources such as magazines and books to provide inaccurate information they
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:33.340]  also set up Facebook groups that encourage and monitor discussion on a
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:37.780]  topic they can also set up fake trade sites that can take a person's money and
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:42.260]  personal information as well as send those customers degraded or spoof
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.020]  products like sending computers overseas that are already equipped with a back
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.660]  door for the NSA all of this is just more proof that it's actually the
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.140]  government engaging in cybercrime of course it's all an effort to ramp up a
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:58.020]  non-existent threat to take our freedoms Leanne McAdder reporting for

[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:11.780]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.540]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:21.300]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we

[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:51.380]  Jones we take you now to the central Texas Commence in the heart of the
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:34:00.260]  resistance because we knew Texas would be a center of the resistance we got
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:06.300]  Ron Paul we've got governor Abbott who we know is fully aware of the new old
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.780]  order and against it we've got the Liberty movement we've got the gold
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:14.460]  being taken back from the Federal Reserve by Texas we've got the state
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.660]  waking up and it's happening all over the country as well and make no mistake
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:23.380]  that's why the globalist listed Texas's hostile during Jade Helm was to test the
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:30.220]  waters and see what the public would do all an elaborate criminal sigh up but
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:36.020]  it's not going to work briefly when we come out with a new product we do a
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:41.420]  limited run because obviously we come up with products before where it sits
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:45.060]  there on the shelf for five six months and the way we work is we don't have a
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.340]  bunch extra capital as we sell t-shirts books videos we never know what's going
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:57.420]  to be really hot we have a good idea and then we get a limited supply and then
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:01.780]  try to get a bigger order in the next time and then sometimes it sells
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:08.060]  sometimes it doesn't there's no judging the public's taste but brain force works
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.780]  so good a few months ago when we got in the final formula that I've been taking
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:17.820]  it quietly just one pill a day or I bounce off the walls it's got two
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:22.420]  different formulations in it that are prescription in Europe not prescription
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:27.460]  here yet we've got a video at info wars life calm in the brain force section
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:30.780]  where we break it all down and read over the ingredients and tell you what they
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:36.100]  do and it's got all the classic stuff known to cleanly give your brain what
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:41.300]  it needs but it's got these other high-tech things and it's all on record
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:46.660]  is safe but still if you want to talk to your health care provider I didn't I
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.260]  just wanted to come on and say brain health on air and then it and then I
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.740]  really like it and then I knew once people tried it they'd love it and be
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:56.660]  repeat customers and find their operation a win win win 360 win but then the
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:01.780]  crew unbeknownst to me I wondered why this bottle and the other tester bottles
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:07.900]  kept going down magically have been have been eating them and just briefly CJ
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:12.020]  didn't even know I was gonna do this did it earlier CJ again and then also Joe I
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:15.180]  don't know what Joe's gonna say I already said he loves it describe for a
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.340]  minute or two what brain force has done for you it wakes you up without getting
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:24.340]  jitters I noticed myself talking faster because I didn't have to think I
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:31.700]  didn't have to recall things because that part of my brain was awake it's
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:36.820]  excellent like I said the most effective product first off that I've
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:41.540]  witnessed you come out with and you described you know the mythical bollum
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.100]  and vitamin me 12 secret 12 is giving you a little bit of pep feeling good well
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:50.620]  it makes my energy last longer because it's what your body needs in order to
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:54.420]  metabolize calories one of the other products done for you and then versus
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:37:03.580]  this iodine really helped me get better skin health I didn't have as many acne
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:09.500]  breakouts which even as an adult male you you still get if you have a certain
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:14.100]  skin type so I noticed that I noticed yeah make sure hair grow faster for me
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:17.860]  better fingernails stuff like that it took out some grays actually that hair
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:23.020]  gets more color as I'm aging but and that's usually from the deficiency
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:30.220]  absolutely oxy powder obviously effective big time but this is you feel
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.180]  good but you don't feel like you're on any kind of medication or drug yeah I've
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.500]  never been able to take the energy drinks and I've never been able to take
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:43.420]  even the stuff for I've got a GNC because it makes me irritable or
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:48.540]  afterwards I crash the next day if I forget to take this which I constantly
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:53.140]  forget to take my vitamins and stuff I'm getting better about it I don't feel
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:58.180]  bad the next day that's what is amazing about it and it's because it doesn't
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:02.740]  artificially stimulate your brain it just gives your brain all these co-factors
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:06.980]  are needed together to supercharge it this probably is undoubtedly the best
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:13.860]  nutraceutical neural activator that's natural out there experience it for
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:20.580]  yourself but but the problem is limited run you will see this is not a gimmick
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:23.620]  just like we're sold out of five things right now and we'll be for like eight
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:27.940]  weeks with some of them we're going to sell out by Monday probably sooner of
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:32.860]  brain force I've already told them to hold back some bottles for us and it
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:40.660]  could be four to eight weeks they claim four weeks we put in a double order but
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:44.500]  it could be eight weeks till we get more by the way we're going to sell out a
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:48.460]  survival shield x2-nation iodine a limited supply was left he thinks he's
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:53.220]  gotten a hold of the deep earth crystal source to remake more that's going to be
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:39:00.380]  sold out so if you want that in forewarslife.com or 888-253-3139 but when
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:04.340]  we went to one of the biggest organic manufacturers in the country it looks
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:08.580]  like they're gonna allow us to have their top chemist on they were jumping up
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.940]  and down for this formula they were jumping up and down and saying we wish
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:20.700]  our other customers would do something like this and we're talking about well
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:28.260]  I'm not supposed to say who but it's organic that they're supplying some of
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:32.820]  these big stores it is organic it's just low levels that are only one thing this
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:37.740]  all together is just it's just absolutely awesome my problem is I want to
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:44.220]  eat more of them and that could be an issue so use responsibly it's not like
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:49.380]  coffee which has some good effects some bad effects I like coffee in the morning
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.700]  but I've raked at night it gives me a headache this this this is simply
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.460]  amazing because I've never been a stimulant guy this isn't a stimulant
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.500]  folks this just gets your brain firing the way it's supposed to very exciting
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:06.180]  Joe Jennings did you want to say something sure I like to say I like to
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:11.980]  say so I took one pill yesterday morning after breakfast and it had no effect
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:16.180]  on me was very tired I was going well okay maybe it doesn't work but if you
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:22.140]  have a slow metabolism like me my gosh I took the second pill after lunch and it
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:29.580]  just seemed like everybody else was super unproductive to my detriment I
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.940]  we did the nightly news last night and I was a bear I was I was like why why is
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:39.420]  it taking so long to do everything why are you guys not what is going on and
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:45.300]  it's amazing because it just I was completely focused and like okay let's
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:48.580]  get done let's get it done let's get it done come on guys we can do it come on
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:53.980]  come on come on so it it's truly truly amazing two of the ingredients are
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:59.500]  prescription Europe thank you for your testimony and brain force ladies and
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.500]  gentlemen and again I talked to the medical doctors I talked to the chemist
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.540]  I talked to the nutritionist I will not sell something that's a bunch of herbs
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:12.460]  that just speeds you up and artificially manipulate the brain that's not what
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:19.300]  these ingredients do they chain reaction together for your regular brain
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:26.740]  metabolism it's got the compound in it the brain is made of I mean it's just
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:31.700]  got stuff like that it's basic building blocks for your brain to fire and
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:36.980]  operate I guess the way God intended I'm done plugging in fours life comm or
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:41.540]  eight eight eight two five three three one three nine and then you mix it with
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.180]  things like beyond tangy tangerine from info wars health comm another basic
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:48.260]  building blocks you need to fire with it it just gets better and better and the
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:53.180]  more I remember to take my six or seven vitamins and minerals a day to take my
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:57.780]  beyond tangy tangerine to take my iodine I get a sore throat take loyal

[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.540]  better that's because these things aren't in our environment they're supposed
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:09.540]  to be naturally they're not in the modern diet I'm done plugging in four
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:16.420]  life comm or eight eight eight two five three three one three nine now he hadn't
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:21.380]  been on in a long time and there will be a two minute infomercial at the end of
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:25.140]  the interview that's not why Ted Anderson is on he is the owner of the GCN
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:32.420]  radio network the parent you know company working with minus resources Ted was
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:36.540]  a sponsor for this show 19 years ago when I was a local radio host as a
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:41.340]  reputable golden silver company and then he started his own network Genesis 18
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:46.500]  years ago so I've been syndicated in this this time slot well 17 years in this
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:50.220]  time slot one year I was on at night with him when I first got syndicated
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:55.100]  because there were some casting on my local show but he joins us Ron Paul was
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.740]  just on talking about the basically imminent financial meltdown no one knows
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:03.220]  the exact time but globalists are headed towards the exits for Minnesota
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.880]  governor Jesse Ventura is joining us to cover the waterfront and more and new
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.340]  attacks on free speech coming up but I wanted to get Ted on because this is
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:17.540]  things he was on 10 years ago talking about naked short going on against
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.140]  gold and silver artificially drive down the price he was on breaking down
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:24.720]  universities and governments hoarding gold while having you know tungsten
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.140]  coated gold bars he was talking about Germany wanting its gold back before it
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:33.100]  was in the news he has a lot of top sources he's in the top 10 gold companies
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:37.620]  in the United States probably the top five but so there's a lot of inside
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:43.860]  baseball sources and I just wanted to get him on China once it's called back
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.020]  from the US Bloomberg reports Texas is asked for its gold back saying they
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.420]  believe the government could collapse and that the fellow reserves private and
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:44:00.860]  that they don't trust it being there the governor basically said hey listen
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.700]  Texas is unique it's stable it's strong and we can show that by letting our
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.900]  states and individuals know this yes Texas has a billion dollars with the
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:11.220]  gold as your state of a billion dollars with the gold so it's definitely a move
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:14.460]  against the globalist Germany wants their goal back Bloomberg reports they
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:19.300]  won't give it back the gold now getting released is covered in in in it's
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:23.820]  covered in gold but it's it's tungsten Ron Paul says the stock market day of
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:29.180]  reckoning is near so all of this is happening and I haven't really plugged
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:34.660]  gold in about two years because I've had the guest on it's come out just like
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.900]  interest rates and currency rates are staged it's been in the news and just
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.860]  like it's come out that
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.940]  home loans have been rigged at the central bank level it's all rigged even
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.220]  the Rolling Stone reports that London Guardian reports that and yes now they
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:56.980]  admit that the big banks have been naked shorting putting paper in the market as
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:01.100]  physical gold shelling it for prices way below what it's worth but never
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:04.220]  actually selling the gold to drive down the price it'd be like if people started
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:10.300]  selling Ferrari Ferrari's the million-and-a-half dollar thousand horse power
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:19.460]  Ferrari for $10,000 the Enzo or the Enzo if they started selling it for ten
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.300]  thousand dollars suddenly you'd see the market on Ferrari's go from a million
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.420]  and a half for the top Ferrari down to a half a million now no real Ferrari's
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:31.460]  were sold for 10,000 but if the market started doing that it would ride down
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:37.660]  the price this is the game they play while they're busy hoarding it universities
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:41.740]  around the world are getting billions in gold UT hold several billion that they
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:46.100]  just got but I've been quietly buying a few coins here some silver there while
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:50.620]  the price has been lower used to be 300 went up to 2,000 gone down to you know
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:54.820]  1,200 or whatever doesn't matter I hold it as an emergency backup but I believe
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:46:00.260]  now use the time to get back into golden silver and the safest time for me to be
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:04.100]  able to promote it and really feel like it's going to be going back up I've
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:08.620]  always known it will because this thing will come down at some point even if
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:13.540]  there's a depression in real assets it'll come back up down the road for long
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:18.540]  term holders but now I feel safe after two years of not promoting it to have
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.460]  Ted back on and he didn't even ask to come on I just said I think you got to
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:25.580]  get Ted on to plug some gold and silver but that'll be two minutes at the end of
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:29.340]  the talk here in like 10-15 minutes I've had him on hold for 15 I apologize
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:33.900]  Ted I'm kind of ranting making your case here for you but what do you make of
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:38.700]  Texas and others one of their gold back all this other behavior we see runs on
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:43.500]  banks in in in Greece similar regulations coming in the feds announcing
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:48.900]  internal passports to travel next year I mean this is crazy well you're right
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:52.300]  about that Alex I can tell you what the reason why Texas wants to get their
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:55.580]  gold back is because they don't trust the Federal Reserve system to hold it for
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:59.260]  them but I don't blame them I wouldn't have them do it either you would with
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.260]  Greece falling apart and everything that's happening in the United States
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:06.020]  Puerto Rico trying to file bankruptcy you would think gold would be going up
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:10.260]  right now obviously there's manipulation obviously the Fed would like to see
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:15.580]  people stay on the paper assets the Dow Jones industrial average has been
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:21.340]  skyrocketing gold has been the loser for the last couple of years and and but
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:25.180]  fundamentally you would think that it would be going up like crazy in 2008
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:29.340]  2009 Greece falling apart like it has we'd have gold shooting up like a
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:33.180]  rocket right now Janet Yellen is wondering well do we raise interest rates
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.020]  yet maybe we should wait till people get better you know wage increases should
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:42.060]  come out first you know it it's a it's a big manipulative game and that's why
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.940]  people in Texas want to get out of it get their gold at home rather than
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.500]  having it stored over there the bottom line is is that you know when the house
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:54.780]  of cards falls apart like Ron Paul was talking about when when when everything
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.260]  falls apart it's the United States debt it's a national debt it's the world
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:04.900]  debt I mean I don't know I just County City State local private it is a hell
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:09.300]  storm of debt the world's ever seen anything close to this I know it's
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.900]  just amazing I mean I don't know I went back just I haven't looked at this in a
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.260]  long time I'm looking at the national debt clock online and this thing is
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.060]  ticking away it looks like a time bomb ready to go off it looks like a science
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.460]  fiction film or something out of James Bond well we are the science fiction
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:29.220]  movie that's that's the whole thing Alex so how in the world can we expect to see
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:34.940]  no problems no no catastrophe no everywhere else hell is breaking loose
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:38.140]  that's the thing and we're still here thinking everything's fine but as Ron
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.940]  Paul said 30 minutes ago we're really in a depression every indicator shows a
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:47.580]  depression and and yet still here we are looking at 1165 50 gold it's down
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:53.380]  $3.80 I have the feeling if they took a US Eagle and strapped jet rockets on it
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:57.220]  and lit it off that thing wouldn't make it off the ground it just can't be it
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.140]  can't be pushed upward but meanwhile the elites are buying it faster than ever
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:06.860]  that's even admitted as now Spain tries to ban physical holding of gold well we
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:09.300]  know what happened during the Great Depression first they banned it and a
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:13.100]  year later increased the price explain how this works Ted well that's what they
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:17.580]  did of course they even did that in 1933 when they confiscated gold from the
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:22.660]  United States citizens in 1933 they did it at $26 an ounce they raised it to
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:27.180]  $36 the year afterwards when they take all the way see they have the ability to
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:32.500]  manipulate their the gold prices they can quietly buy the gold prices keep the
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:38.220]  interest rates low make make equities look really attractive meanwhile well
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.060]  they're quietly sopping up all the precious metals if for their own ownership
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:46.340]  then things break loose all of a sudden the prices start to go up I mean you
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:50.340]  even see Warren Buffett getting into silver and gold at this time and I just
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:56.380]  need to say this reminds me of like 1982 and the year 2006 when we had gold
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:03.340]  trading at about $250 an ounce silver was trading just right around 3350 and
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:06.780]  all of a sudden it starts to go up from there but for some reason while the
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:11.340]  market is down like this it's almost impossible to convince people to get in
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:15.660]  but here we are sitting here after inflationary dollars we're looking at
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.620]  the same pricing and people should be getting involved in the market while
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:24.620]  it's soft like this you bet when the market starts to rise and everything
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:28.340]  starts to run the quantities and the supply of what's available in the
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:33.140]  marketplace is going to dry up premiums are going to explode again and you know
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.700]  because I bought all my gold from you because you have the best prices out
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:42.860]  there from my experience just as an average basis I don't call you in
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:46.660]  golds going up buying gold I call you now when it's low and that's what I'm
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:50.460]  doing now and people just do not listen to the common sense at least most of them
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:56.260]  don't all the indicators are that it it's almost impossible for them to keep
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.900]  holding down gold and silver we'll be back stay with us
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:04.380]  communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US

[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:41.380]  look at the way we're reading look at the fear we're feeding Ted it's it's crazy
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:44.700]  I'm not a Ted Anderson here owner of the GCN radio network they're listening to
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:51.580]  right now he also owns minus resources classic case of a kid who started right
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:54.420]  out of high school working at a golden silver company and then starting his
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:57.780]  own now one of the most successful in the world because of low prices and good
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:02.620]  service minus resources dot com I'm gonna do a brief plug here for a gold and
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:05.700]  silver special and some other stuff that's a great deal today just very
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:11.500]  briefly here because I don't expect people to actually do the smart thing
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:16.220]  for whatever reason and buy at what I believe is the bottom of the market when
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:19.660]  we know they're manipulating it down when we know the paper so dangerous I
[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:24.820]  expect people though to remember this this fall when it starts racing up I
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:30.980]  believe it will not a prediction it's just what I believe and if they can
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:35.420]  continue to suppress it I'll be surprised but regardless I'm not just gonna be all
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:40.140]  in paper and all in stuff they can take and grab out of my bank account I've
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:44.220]  got to be able to go to a safety deposit box go wherever cash them stuff in and
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:49.100]  meet payroll if I have to this casual society is about total control and
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:53.740]  everything we warn people about is now starting to happen I mean Ted it's
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.980]  scary to see Greeks having their bank account money kept and they can only get
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:03.220]  out first it was 66 euros a day now it's a hundred a month and then they started
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:08.100]  holding Americans and Europeans money that they paid into PayPal and other
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:13.780]  systems central banks started taking the money from the resorts and just
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:17.540]  stealing people's money did you see that in the news yesterday as a punishment to
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:21.180]  Greece it shows how these mega banks are completely criminal and will do
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.540]  anything and they're trying to push around Greece because they want their
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:27.700]  way they want them to stay in the European Union they want them to
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:32.220]  continue on making their debt payments which just enslaves the people the
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.500]  people are saying no we want to get away from this system and it's a tug of war
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:40.700]  it's a fight and it's going to be God knows what the end result is going to be
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:45.020]  it could be a war even you know it's just ridiculous what the what these banks
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:49.780]  will do in order to keep control of a country and the people that they serve
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:56.140]  it's just amazing but exactly and now the TSA announces a national ID card
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:59.380]  through your state driver's license if your state doesn't adopt it you won't
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.540]  be able to fly next year that's an internal passport we knew that was
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:10.740]  coming they're talking about not letting us have cash here IMF orders US tour
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:15.620]  operators to withhold payments to Greek hotels boom people go that's a Paul
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:22.980]  Watson article you go by your your trip and then the tour operators told don't
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:29.260]  pay it to the Greek hotels I mean that is that's what they tried on Iceland Ted
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:32.940]  but but you know you shouldn't be surprised by this because this stuff has
[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:38.660]  been going on for years it you're going to have manipulation you're gonna have
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:43.540]  forced manipulation and when you take a look at what the central banks did even
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:47.700]  in World War two by supporting Hitler and also supporting the European countries
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:52.060]  that were being attacked crazy I mean you know it gets beyond the pale here
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:55.900]  there's no question about it and Ron Paul talks about liberty I mean my god
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:59.220]  you want to have liberty get away from their currency that's the answer I agree

[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:11.500]  big brother big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:19.540]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:23.980]  Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:36.060]  Ted Anderson owner of GCN live comm is our guest Ted let's just finish up with
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:40.460]  a little pitch for folks for golden silver when they do buy it for me they
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.660]  get a good price good service and it helps the whole network and the rest of
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:49.780]  it but I mean I really got you on today to talk about how surreal it is for me
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:54.060]  at least only get your take to watch Texas and all these universities cashing
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:01:01.060]  in cash and getting gold like UT Harvard you name it Berkeley other
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:05.340]  governments the Chinese government they're all hoarding gold while telling
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:08.980]  people you don't need gold and silver I mean I don't see them being able to
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.380]  suppress the price forever and I just go with my gut I think I've had you on
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:18.020]  once in two years and had you on just as a guest I've had you on about other
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:23.100]  news and radio a few times but I just have a gut feeling maybe I'm wrong
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:26.380]  because they could come up with some new manipulation I just don't know how
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:30.060]  they're gonna suppress gold prices all the elites themselves are gobbling it
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:37.060]  all up Ted well I mean truth be told I suppose we have a couple of more months
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:40.580]  where things are gonna pittle around where it is right now I would suspect
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:45.060]  that we'll have prices go up like it usually does in the fall however the
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:50.260]  last couple of falls it hadn't happened we did have quite a bull market and the
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:54.380]  bear market swing came along but you go through that cycle and now we're
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:58.420]  sitting here at the bottom side of the market there's so many problems that are
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:04.100]  out there we are going to have continued problems in the future and you take a
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:07.820]  look at that debt clock you look at what's going on in Europe you look at
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:11.980]  what's going on in here in the United States and like you're saying UT the
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:18.060]  state of Texas all these different places you know Warren Buffett for one
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:23.300]  the central banks why would the central banks be buying gold when they're not
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:27.900]  when it's their own currency that they can have for free the reason why they're
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:31.940]  doing that is because they know that there's no value in their money and as
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:37.060]  the debt rises sure the supply of money increases it drives the value of their
[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:41.540]  their paper down it just does well Ted I don't know if this is gonna happen but
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:45.020]  I've always been told this by top folks it's been proposed at Davos you know
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:49.740]  that but now they're starting to float a global SDR strategic drawing right that's
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:53.940]  how when I ship packages overseas with USPS it's already dominated in
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:03:00.740]  in SDRs they admit they want to have 10% to 30% gold backed or a spectrum of
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:05.780]  metals backed global new currency when the dollar and others go down you'll
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:10.500]  still have dollars you'll still have the ends yons euros but they'll be tied to
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:15.940]  that global unified SDR and when that happens gold's gonna go up like a
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:20.620]  rocket and the elites will be positioned with it what's your intel on that well
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:25.580]  isn't it just enough to hear that when the dollar drops in value they'll have
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:29.460]  something that holds more value that strategy alone should put people into
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:33.420]  precious metals or at least make them think twice about it I get it the
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:37.100]  Dow Jones industrial average has been running up it's hard to get out of that
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:40.900]  market when you're making money it's tough it's really hard to sell something
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:45.540]  that's up and making you money you want to stay with it and you definitely do
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.740]  not want to move into something that has not been produced you don't want to get
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:52.420]  left with a hanger name when they're passing it around exactly well if you
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:56.180]  can get out of the Dow Jones industrial average even take 10% out of that
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:01.180]  market and move into precious metals that's down right now I mean all of the
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:04.980]  newsletter writers and the forecasters and and the people that are experts are
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:09.460]  saying you have to diversify in this way it's called balancing your portfolio the
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:14.220]  ultimate you know what storm is here I mean Ted how much crazier can it get how
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:19.220]  much bigger in the bubble get till it pops I mean it is ginormous I know and
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:23.860]  it already baffles me that it is where it is but here you have yelling talking
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:27.540]  about raising raising the interest rates and she knows that her back is up
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:32.580]  against the wall interest rates go up the United States debt goes crazy we
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:36.820]  can't afford it no more things collapse that's the bottom line and then what
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:40.180]  happens to gold I mean some argue it'll drive it down because of a depression but
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:44.500]  if the currency is being devalued it would go up I mean it is bottom line
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:47.940]  when you don't know what's gonna happen you need to have a basket of things so
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:50.820]  that something goes up something goes down you're not left with your butt
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:53.940]  hanging out you don't want to be a one-crop economy in the stock market
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:05:00.180]  folks might as resources 800 686 2237 then Tara straight up although the
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:03.900]  government admits it has no credible evidence of a potential terror attack
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:08.260]  taking place over the 4th of July holiday the FBI has moved to establish
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.380]  command centers around the country these command centers will integrate local
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:16.700]  state and federal law enforcement agencies so officials can gauge the
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:21.460]  threat level and respond quickly let's be real the target of this apparatus is
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:26.340]  not ISIS and foreign jihadist terrorists but the American people command
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:30.620]  centers and so-called fusion centers around the country are routinely used
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:34.940]  to monitor political activists not supposed terrorists and these command
[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:39.020]  centers will certainly be convenient during the upcoming jade helm exercise

[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:49.980]  Rand Paul Ron Paul was on with us earlier saying he believes the collapse is
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:55.020]  accelerating and basically could be imminent but we're gonna pull a clip
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:58.740]  from that interview last hour and play it for Ventura coming up a little bit
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:02.900]  later we can also probably open the phones up and take a few calls for
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:08.740]  Jesse Ventura but the reason he's on is he's under attack and I was the person
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:15.500]  who got a call at 6 a.m. on my cell phone when I just woke it up a few years
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:20.860]  ago from the opening an Anthony show so I want you to come on and defend your
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:24.220]  buddy Ventura that got you know beaten up or whatever I said what are you
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:27.460]  talking about they go you didn't hear Chris Kyle yesterday blah blah blah and
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:32.900]  turned out he'd been on Fox News and said it so I called Jesse Ventura he
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:36.460]  was in Mexico and he didn't believe it at first he said man don't joke around
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:42.220]  Alex you don't normally do that you know you're kidding right like I would go
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:45.980]  to a Navy SEAL event where I was at the commencement and say I'm glad Navy SEALs
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:52.340]  are dead that's just sickening plus I'd be physically attacked it was done to
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:57.420]  defame him because they knew he could probably win running for president it
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:02.420]  was political assassination and one problem is is Jim Garrison said if they
[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:07.260]  can do that next they physically kill you so if they could destroy Ventura
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:10.700]  whether you love him or hate him or in between they can bring anybody down well
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.700]  he spent millions of dollars I'm not allowed to say they amount but he spent
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.540]  most his money he's a humble guy private guy but I know a lot of the inside
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:22.060]  baseball consulted on his TV shows traveled around the country with him
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.940]  but in two seasons knew him before that when he came out investigating 9-11 took
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:31.700]  a lot of courage there they're scared of him he's at the CIA visiting basically
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:37.060]  in and you know ask you know if he's going to play ball
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:40.780]  years ago when he first got elected governor and the truth is he hasn't
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:51.180]  played ball with him and so now 30 plus 30 plus top media organizations have
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:59.380]  filed suit to try to overturn his guilty verdict in the slander defamation
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:05.380]  libel trial that he won last year against Chris Kyle the estate has made
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:11.500]  tens of millions of dollars the media combine the books made over a hundred
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:16.180]  million material the latest numbers the movie hundreds of millions profit thank
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:20.500]  God they cut out the part or didn't put the part in about Ventura I've nothing
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:24.580]  against Chris Kyle but the and I debated him on opening Anthony show about all
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:32.660]  this by the way God rest his soul but it wasn't true and so if they're allowed
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:36.220]  to lie about people and get away with it they can come out and say I'm a
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:41.740]  methamphetamine dealer or I'm a child molester and then I sue them and I'm not
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:46.620]  litigious I've not really shared this on air but I've sued people for defamation
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:52.940]  twice and I've won twice once they settled out of court the other time I went
[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.900]  to court and I won because it was so cut and dry but then they basically
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:03.020]  apologized and disappeared they were harassing my sister that was in high
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:06.900]  school at the time it was a media person saying where she was the people
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:09.980]  should go get her they were they were saying things about me I sued them I
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:15.260]  won the other time they they settled and stopped you know saying things about me
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:20.660]  on air and I had to because I have people calling me you know saying is it
[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:25.580]  true you're a drug dealer I mean I don't even use drug illegal drugs is it
[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:34.460]  true that you know stuff like this now imagine now if this ruling and they
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:40.620]  overturn Ventura versus you know Chris Kyle and news core if they overturn that
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:44.140]  like the New York Times and Fox News and CNN and you know all the rest of them
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:50.580]  hope curse publishing the list goes on and on if they win they can come out and
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:14:03.460]  say Jesse Ventura X and then he can't go uphill win the battle basically win an
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:07.300]  amount of money that doesn't even really pay what it cost him and then they can
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:12.020]  destroy the entire right to defend yourself in this country and basically
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:17.900]  legalize lying and destroying people in this country it truly is frightening and
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:24.260]  Jesse has spent almost all his money all his retirement all his savings on this
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:29.460]  and this is a fight for all of us I think people should donate to Jesse
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:36.060]  Ventura's defense fund for us all so that he's fought the fight he's he's not
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:39.980]  shut up he's not quit he's done everything he could do he's not backed off
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:44.060]  he's told the truth about 9-11 told us about testing on the troops told us
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:48.940]  truth about harp and chemtrails and FEMA camps and everything else and it had
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:53.580]  and had Homeland Security show up try to shut down their show and and ban his
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:58.340]  team up camp program that I was in I mean he's been through a lot and been
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:03.300]  blackballed over this and so if we don't support his appeal and bet on this
[02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:07.820]  winner this champion for us all we deserve what we get so this is a platform
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:11.940]  to support patriots that are fighting and I expect anything ever happens to me
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:19.700]  and I'm in trouble people to support me so write your checks to P.O. Box 10629

[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:58.140]  assassination fund or you know the headline last week we put on the video
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:03.980]  was mainstream media asked courts to allow them to lie I mean this is
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:08.580]  unprecedented in thousands of years of common law where you can't get in
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:12.340]  trouble if you lie about somebody and believe me this is all going to be
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:18.700]  selectively enforced this is so big media can get up there on TV well they've
[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:22.140]  already said that that I influence the Boston bombers and then I'm deeply
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:25.460]  racist and my lawyer said yeah you can spend a million and a half dollars will
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:30.940]  win then we'll have to appeal they won't pay and see Ventura has already been
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:35.900]  through all this too so he did this not for money but to bring these liars to
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:40.860]  justice alright Jesse that's a long intro rant thanks for coming on put out
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:44.020]  your appeal here for everybody because you've been fighting and you need
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:48.460]  support in the war for freedom well thank you Alex very much and it's a
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:53.060]  difficult thing for me to do but I'm kind of back against the world but what
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:59.380]  this amounts to in the end is is that it could be a business for them because
[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:04.220]  the more people that they would defame and the more profit that they make from
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:09.900]  that defamation would earn them money it would be equivalent to Alex you and I
[02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:15.220]  go out and rob the bank so we get prosecuted for robbing the bank and they
[02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:20.620]  sentence us to say three years for that that would be the defamation part but the
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:26.420]  unjust enrichment part is after we would get out of jail in three years we get
[02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:31.740]  to keep all the money that we robbed and got illegally through our illegal act
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:38.860]  what they're asking for is the ability to defame someone make profit from it and
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:44.620]  the person who's defamed has no right they get to keep other profits so it
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:49.220]  could become a profitable business for them defaming people because the more
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:53.420]  they would defame and be able to make money off the defamation the more money
[02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:57.620]  they'd make and it's kind of like remember when Howard Stern was on regular
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:03.020]  radio yes and Howard of course would say things and he'd get a ten thousand
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:08.740]  dollar fine from the FCC well the station would in essence let Howard get
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:13.100]  away with that because on the flip side Howard would make them a hundred grand
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:19.700]  so they pay the ten grand and be able to walk away with ninety grand profit and
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.060]  that's what they want they they want the courts to legalize crime and to make a
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:30.140]  business out of destroying people it's incredible yeah and that they can profit
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:34.780]  from that business and the person defamed gives is for lack of term
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:39.860]  blank out a lock you know you're just too bad for you for listeners that just
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:43.660]  joined us again in about a minute or two before we got a break describe how
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:47.860]  they're appealing what they're doing well it's in the 8th Circuit Court of
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:52.300]  Appeal right now first they got three extensions I mean the trial was
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:58.260]  completed last July and August they filed for three extensions which strung
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:03.660]  it out over another nine month period drawing it out and apparently the courts
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:08.340]  of appeals don't work in the summer I don't know much about that at the federal
[02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:13.460]  level but they don't do cases to July and August and then they ramp up again in
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:18.420]  September and that's when I'm due to go in front in the interim these thirty

[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:23.100]  you know what's really big here I was just talking to Governor Ventura during
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:28.220]  the break he was on with us a week and a half ago not one new story and normally
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:35.180]  when he comes on there's always stories about it not one new story about 33 of
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:40.300]  the biggest media companies filing a suit to overturn his ruling so that they
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:47.140]  can lie about people this is a huge story for the First Amendment where is the
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:53.060]  ACLU where are all these organizations saying hey defend people's right to
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:58.180]  get justice when huge lies are told about him this is just unprecedented
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:00.540]  Jesse here in the break we were talking you were making some really good
[02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:05.580]  points please repeat those well you know the thing is is how much money they've
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:10.700]  made already I mean a year ago at my trial Harper Collins the book company
[02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:16.300]  itself had made over 40 million dollars on the book the Kyle estate had made
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:21.980]  around six million and then the movie I don't know what that went to about 300
[02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:28.220]  million I heard on that deal and I know the Kyle estate is getting 5% of the
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:32.900]  net revenue you know whatever that comes out to I don't know if there'll be
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:37.020]  Hollywood bookkeeping in there what'll happen on that end and you know Taya
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:42.620]  Kyle's out doing speaking engagements for $100,000 a pop and not that I'd be
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:48.420]  grudger any of that but they've misled the public she and her family in the
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:53.300]  state does not have to pay one cent during this trial this trial's gone in
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:57.220]  the millions for me they haven't paid a cent because they're covered by an
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:02.780]  insurance company it's Jesse Ventura versus the media and a major insurance
[02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:07.660]  conglomerate and yet they the media has portrayed it that I'm going after this
[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:15.500]  widow and her children it's upside down world yeah exactly you know and the
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:19.820]  point of the matter is is that the bottom line to all of this comes down to
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:25.220]  how our moral compass is flipped upside down the truth now is considered a
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:30.620]  negative if you tell the truth you're a bad person this country seems to prefer
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:36.020]  liars because we make liars into heroes and truth tellers go to prison I
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:40.660]  remember I had on the CIA guy John I forget his last name starts with a K I
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:46.180]  think who was the guy who exposed the torturing and he ends up going to
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:50.140]  prison for three and a half years and the guys who actually tortured got
[02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:56.300]  nothing the guys that exposed it goes to jail and the guys that torture get
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:00.780]  nothing out of the deal and see that's the problem our country right now is
[02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:06.220]  morally upside down we're making liars into heroes and we're taking truth
[02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:11.540]  tellers and putting them in prison that's the way tyranny works and to be
[02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:17.740]  fair there was no article since you were on there was one article back in May in
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:22.940]  the star there in Minneapolis St. Paul that did report that oh this paper
[02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:29.460]  intends to sue Ventura and they ran the headline that the major media and
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:36.140]  scholars side with Kyle's wife against Jesse Ventura I mean talk about a
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:41.020]  spin headline I mean it should be you know major media to sue Ventura's to
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:46.100]  legalize lying yeah what are these scholars who are these scholars what
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:52.380]  scholars are they talking about you mean they're paid people the people that are
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:55.100]  on the payroll
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:03.340]  where does it go from here Jesse well so you know now I just hold on and wait
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:07.580]  I've had I've had I think five settlement conferences that have got
[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:13.140]  nowhere I mean literally nowhere hardly and they haven't even offered to pay
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:18.460]  what I've invested in this so you know it's I don't expect the settlement
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:25.620]  September the 8th Circuit Court will convene if they rule in my favor then
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:30.540]  I'll finally get the money that'll just it'll pay off my lawyers basically out
[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:35.580]  of our deal of what I want initially in court well people are always wanting
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:40.540]  patriots that are under attack to sue sue sue sue well you've done it you've
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:47.020]  won and they don't like the fact that you sued this myth who conveniently got
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:52.920]  killed God rest his soul and so now because you challenged a legend they
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:56.100]  want to destroy you I mean it's just unprecedented where are the media
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:29:00.340]  associations where are the people out there wanting to support people's right
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:05.340]  to the truth you know to me that's what it all comes down to Alex are we a
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:10.100]  country that's going to stand for truth you know the old saying truth I think
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.940]  it was on Superman truth justice in the American way are we going to support the
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:20.300]  truth or do we prefer lying and you know when you look at our government our
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:26.300]  leaders lying is an acceptable business they lie all the time and that's one of
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:30.980]  the reasons I don't think I'd make a good president Alex I tell the truth you're
[02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:35.940]  not a congenital liar I say that not tongue-in-cheek but I think today the
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:40.380]  president has to be able to get on television look at the American people
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:44.620]  and freaking lie more on that when we come back we'll cover world news with
[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:48.660]  Jesse Ventura and open the phones up to take your calls you need to support him
[02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:55.460]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:55.460 --> 02:30:04.180]  network today's example of terror porn is brought to you by the FBI whose agents
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:08.100]  are telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations and you know
[02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:11.540]  what that means that means if you're an FBI informant or a friend of an FBI
[02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:14.300]  informant you better not go anywhere this weekend because you're probably
[02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:18.860]  gonna be set up why do I say that back in 2012 the New York Times published an
[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:23.020]  article terrorist plots hatched by the FBI which details how FBI informants
[02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:27.100]  were recruiting people for terror plots which were then busted by the FBI and
[02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:31.540]  remember back in February an FBI official said we need to keep fair alive to
[02:30:31.540 --> 02:30:35.580]  justify terror budget the quote is from a documentary entitled the Newburg
[02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:39.260]  Sting which tells how the feds convinced four poverty-stricken New York men to
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:43.580]  become involved in an informant led terror plot the paid FBI informant is
[02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:46.700]  alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million dollars to
[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:51.060]  execute an attack we'll be talking about this and more on the Info Wars nightly

[02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:52.060]  you ask champions Iran Paul Jesse Ventura whoever it is to go out and to
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:55.060]  fight against the globalist to fight against the open-world government we're
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:58.900]  seeing to fight against our water being stolen from the Great Lakes to fight
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:05.900]  against the NAU being set up the TPP GMO globalism the government funding ISIS
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:12.300]  then when people come after him you've got to support him and I think we're
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:15.900]  betting on a winner he's already won once I don't think that the courts are
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:19.780]  going to overturn the entire system of letting people get redressed in court
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:25.420]  because then people can argue that they're allowed to take it to the street I
[02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:29.980]  mean if you're gonna let the media sit up there and I've had people in media
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.460]  before say I'm a drug dealer and a child molester two different media outfits I
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:40.820]  suit them both and I didn't want to sue them but I had to get them to admit they
[02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:46.860]  were lying to get them to stop saying it people that are jealous of you hate you
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:51.100]  whatever want to bring you down they can't beat you it's like you have a
[02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:53.900]  better restaurant than the one across the street they'll just say you you feed
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:58.500]  dog meat or roaches it's not true you got to sue them or they won't stop saying
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:03.140]  there's roaches in your food or rat turds this is what losers do this is how
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:10.020]  they operate they think it's okay to sit there and lie about people and then
[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:13.980]  they want to be protected hey I'm up here I'm saying the things I say every
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:21.060]  day and knock on wood I've never been sued except for a copyright thing that
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:27.660]  got thrown out for defamation never been sued for any of that because I watch
[02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:34.540]  what I say may sound wild but it's there if I make a little mistake or
[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:39.220]  something I correct it but there's no malice of forethought with intent to do
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:43.500]  harm like what was done by the media to Jesse Ventura they're coming after him
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:48.700]  I'll tell you why I would support Iran Paul for president if he was gonna get
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:52.260]  the nomination they're fixing it we're more and more it's looking like they're
[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:56.700]  gonna have Trump come in pull votes away from libertarian type folks libertarian
[02:36:56.700 --> 02:37:02.980]  Republicans we're gonna go to Jesse Ventura on this in just a moment and then
[02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:07.180]  that will catapult Jeb to the head but Hillary's people were at Bilderberg it
[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:10.740]  looks like she's who they're planning on they're gonna play the whole feminist
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:15.460]  card that if you don't like her you don't like women that type of baloney but
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:19.860]  regardless if there's a Jeb Bush or there's a Hillary Clinton I will support
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:23.140]  a third-party move in this country because those people work together
[02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:27.340]  their CIA it's all staged some would argue hey don't get libertarians running
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:32.300]  don't get a strong candidate will pull away from conservatives and then the
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:37.180]  Democrats will win well I mean if it's the banners of the world we don't need
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:45.620]  them they give Obama more support than the Democrats do so regardless just as
[02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:50.700]  be done by the heavens fall Jesse Ventura needs to be supported people need
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:55.460]  we'll put the PO box up on screen so folks can send him check send him cash
[02:37:55.460 --> 02:38:00.940]  whatever and a hundred percent of it will go towards the defense of his win
[02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:05.340]  show that he doesn't have to sell his house and basically be bankrupt and then
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:08.860]  they win a lot of us giving a little bit can help this guy that's what we're
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.380]  here to do is a platform to help other patriots we hang together we hang
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:22.380]  separate appeals fund PO box 1 0 6 2 9 white Bear Lake Minnesota 5 5 1 1 0
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:28.980]  PO box 1 0 6 2 9 white Bear Lake Minnesota 5 5 1 1 0 you can also go to

[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:37.020]  maybe they've already done it that's where you really get the donations I do a
[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:39.980]  Kickstarter having that time to tell Ventura what I do I'll just sit on there
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:46.700]  I started Kickstarter or something else and I would you know and I'd say just to
[02:38:46.700 --> 02:38:52.700]  stop the the the the the Goliath media from you know legalizing lying you know
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:58.140]  a fun to stop them a fun for justice a fun for everybody I would do that I
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:03.340]  would have a PayPal immediately but for now PO box 1 0 6 2 9 white Bear Lake
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:08.900]  Minnesota 5 5 1 1 0 and I'd also email this video once it's up tonight or
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:13.020]  tomorrow from the radio TV show to every media outlet and say especially ones
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:17.060]  that are involved in this to say oh we notice you're not reporting on how an
[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:22.180]  unprecedented case to overturn libel and slander laws and defamation laws in
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:28.260]  this country I mean this is an important story regardless so I would support
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:32.220]  Jesse Ventura I know I'm going to write a check we might even do a little fun
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:36.100]  razor here ourselves because we hang together or we hang separate okay
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:40.620]  governor the toll-free number to join us take a few calls in the last segment
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:49.260]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 for quick questions for the governor but
[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:52.940]  shifting years to just the state of the world and everything that's happening
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:59.700]  and election 2016 you told me bomb shell political news that I think if we train
[02:39:59.700 --> 02:40:03.460]  it on to everything else that's happening and get some attention to why
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:08.020]  they're trying to politically assassinate you right now and so I hope
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:13.060]  you'll go ahead to share that story right now on air well if my son
[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:17.660]  apparently a person fairly high up in the libertarian party is encouraging me
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:24.140]  to attend their convention which they hold June of 2016 see the libertarians
[02:40:24.140 --> 02:40:28.660]  are brilliant they don't waste money they they don't make their nomination
[02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:32.820]  until June I mean right now these people are spending hundreds of millions of
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:38.740]  dollars spinning their wheels when if you're like me I truthfully the election
[02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:43.820]  doesn't start until the summer before November basically Labor Day on but the
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:47.660]  libertarians have put out a gesture to me to come to their convention and then
[02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:51.780]  I would have a very good chance of getting their nomination for president
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:56.260]  and then I would be on there the liberty the libertarians virtually have
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:01.460]  ballot access I think pretty well across the whole United States every state but
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:06.500]  one thing we'll have to be clear on I do not want to join them as a party if they
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:10.700]  endorse me I want it to be clear they're endorsing me they're giving me the
[02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:15.820]  nomination if I so choose to go after it but I want to be able to have the armament
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:21.340]  Alex of being the first presidential president elected since George Washington
[02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:27.740]  who does not belong to a political party I need that from them that they won't
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:32.580]  require me to be in their party to receive their nomination because that's
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:37.940]  firepower that I think you can win the election with is that simple thing if you
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:42.540]  could be the first president who does not belong to a political party since the
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:46.340]  father of our country George Washington well that makes sense people should
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.820]  nominate whoever is the best for the job it has integrity at these conventions
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:55.900]  anyways not someone who's been a party hack for 50 years not just that alone we
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:42:00.220]  need to break the stranglehold of these two political is that Ralph Nader called
[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:04.060]  them political dictators you could run on destroying the fraudulent two-party
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:09.300]  system exactly and elect elect the president who doesn't belong to the as
[02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:13.740]  my book the Democrats and the Republicans elect somebody that's not a
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:19.700]  gang member and you've already done it as a mayor and a governor yeah yep but
[02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:25.020]  that's what you got to do the key to me and the advantage is in our favor look
[02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:31.140]  at the last national election 64% of the people failed to turn out the vote
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:36.660]  those are my potential customers those are my potential voters if I can
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:42.180]  rejuvenate them to come back and watch their vote count you win sure well your
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:46.220]  son works in news media a huge majority your son works in news me that's how
[02:42:46.220 --> 02:42:49.140]  they were able to contact him I can get a hold of the president of the Libertarian
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:53.780]  Party to probably today do you want me to call them and get them on the phone
[02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:57.740]  with you let me let's get this no just want to wait
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:03.420]  all right not yet because I don't want to Alex I don't want to get into early I
[02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:08.220]  want to wait till it's down to two right let the pikers jump in there now I
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:14.340]  don't want nothing to do with it till June the next year well all in the
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:18.540]  timing I agree but the system is trying to assassinate you right now and ignore
[02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:23.020]  we'll deal with that we're dealing with that right now if we succeed on that
[02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:28.740]  level it'll open the door for me next June if I fail then close the door on
[02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:33.860]  next June there's another alternative if I if I fail in this lawsuit you can
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:39.220]  forget about next June well I'll tell you this I've got a lot of Republican
[02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:41.460]  friends they're Libertarians they're trying to take over the Republican Party
[02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:45.500]  and we've seen the Tea Party do that partially but still Banner just came in
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:49.300]  with everybody else's steamroll with the TPP and the rest of it I mean I'm of one
[02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:54.060]  school of thought that you know we could get a Rand Paul in or something but
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:58.260]  but the problem is his own party's coming out against him so I don't want to
[02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:01.860]  hear it from Republicans and people that if I was to support you for running
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:05.620]  for Libertarian you know that it was a waste or something because if it's Jeb
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:09.780]  Bush and it's Hillary I mean as far as I'm concerned Jesse that's the same
[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:16.580]  people exactly it is anyway but corporate the corporate powers have paid off
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:21.500]  both of these parties Alex and it's like going to the Super Bowl and you bet on
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:27.860]  both teams you can't lose them Kenya no the establishment but but I mean they
[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:34.380]  really own Hillary and Jeb I mean it's sick they own everybody any
[02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:39.020]  candidate that comes out of these two parties I'll be interested to see what
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:44.340]  happens with Bernie Saunders because he's not he's building momentum and he's
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:48.940]  not gonna get the Democratic will he continue with the race or will he then
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.020]  step aside and let Hillary have it in the end yeah he's not Democrat vote that
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:58.980]  love that idea I don't know I don't know what'll happen on that end but you
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:04.060]  know all I know is that I want more than two choices I want more than coke and
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:13.140]  Pepsi well we know this the country is in dire dire straits TPP is in place
[02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:17.580]  basically now what would you do as president if you were elected president
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:22.460]  under your constitutional powers what would you do in the first month well
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:27.140]  yeah first of all I have to have good people with me to tell me exactly what
[02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:34.580]  my constitutional powers are and then once learning that what I would do some
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:40.260]  of the first things I would do I would pull us out of the Middle East we would
[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:43.500]  not be fighting a war over there anymore would you put Ron Paul in your
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:48.060]  cabinet if he wanted to be absolutely I'd love to put him in charge of the
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:55.340]  banks Secretary of Treasury yeah I'd love to put Ron Paul because he's a
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:59.820]  brilliant guy and when it comes to the man when it comes to the central bank
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:05.860]  stuff there's not a guy I know that knows better than him very exciting what
[02:46:05.860 --> 02:46:09.420]  else would you do would you continue like Obama's down the war on marijuana
[02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:14.980]  no that's another thing I would do I would stop the the entire war on drugs
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:21.740]  it's a miserable failure and my belief is this addiction we addiction should not
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:27.020]  be treated criminally it should be treated medically you can be addicted to
[02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:31.140]  caffeine how many people out there that listen to you Alex have to get up and
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:35.100]  have a morning cup of coffee I'm addicted to get their caffeine going
[02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:38.620]  I'm addicted that's the difference between that and all the other ones hey
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:42.780]  these energy drinks are like cocaine or something you damn right and the point
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:48.020]  is nothing but my point is that the government that you should not be
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:53.860]  convicted of anything that you do with your own body that your business you
[02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:57.660]  talk about the Fourth Amendment to illegal search a reasonable search and
[02:46:57.660 --> 02:47:02.140]  seizure how is it reasonable for them to check your body for what you want to
[02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:07.460]  put into it or ingest it now don't get me wrong if you take drugs and go rob the
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:12.100]  bank I will prosecute you for robbing the bank I don't give a damn what you
[02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:17.420]  took that made you do it you'll get prosecuted for the crime oh yeah they use
[02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:21.060]  drugs is an excuse I'm sick of that I would come I would completely end the
[02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:26.060]  war on drugs right now Colorado is making a billion dollars this year selling
[02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:32.140]  marijuana the budget for the judiciary in Washington has already dropped 15%
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:37.060]  that's massive because of their legalization trust of marijuana they're
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:40.620]  not prosecuting people and they're taxing it let's take a call Elijah in
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:46.820]  California listing on KOMY 1340 a.m. they're in Santa Cruz go ahead you're
[02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:52.540]  on the air welcome now I want to know what you're gonna do with the TPP thing
[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:59.060]  uh mr. Senator Paul is the only one family to say that it's come out against
[02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:03.140]  it now if you and him link up what do you think about that that's a good
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:07.500]  question Jesse what would you do to the TPP well it'd be difficult I mean if they
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:11.860]  pass it through and they sign it you know you got to abide by contracts or
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:16.220]  whatever that's I I would do everything to end it well you can bully pulpit
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:20.620]  against it didn't get cars to repeal it yeah and because to me these trade
[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:24.380]  agreements it's one thing if it's a level playing field but it never is and
[02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:28.860]  in the case of this thing you're looking at sweatshops you're looking at slave
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:33.380]  labor you're looking at the very things that this country has fought for hundreds
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:38.060]  of years to get rid of and it and it ties directly into our own country's
[02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:43.260]  assault on the unions now can unions be bad of course they can they run by
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:49.380]  people and when bad people get power bad things happen but unions are still the
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:52.420]  backbone that created the middle class in this country
[02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:57.420]  true bargaining but they got taken over and I mean remember the unions supported
[02:48:57.420 --> 02:49:02.420]  napkin gas that's suicide let's go ahead and but you're right I mean it is good
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:06.220]  to have a checks and balances let's go to Robert in Missouri you're on the air
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:12.020]  go ahead with Jesse Ventura hey guys I think the only feasible way Jesse if
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:16.100]  you're really serious about running for as an alternative candidate to the two
[02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:20.260]  parties is to basically consolidate a few of the parties together such as
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:25.820]  libertarians the Constitution Party let me explain that doesn't work I tried
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:30.620]  when I was governor of Minnesota to bring we had four or five political
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:34.100]  parties other than the Democrats and Republicans I held a meeting at the
[02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:37.940]  governor's residence I brought the leaders all together it was like herding
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:43.780]  cats they got their ego they all got their main issue and the one thing we
[02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:48.500]  could all agree upon was campaign finance reform none of us took dirty money
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:53.900]  and I said can't we start from there and build and have one candidate it was it
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:58.860]  was it was like I said herding cats it did no good so I ended it right there
[02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:02.780]  because at the end of the day we accomplished nothing everybody wants
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:08.420]  to be in charge and nobody will listen to anybody else that's right my show
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:10.980]  trying to build a coalition of people that are against being conquered by
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:14.020]  these foreign banks I mean while we're all fighting with each other over petty
[02:50:14.020 --> 02:50:17.540]  issues we've been conquered and now they're getting rid of the entire
[02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:22.700]  Bill of Rights and Constitution yep let's go to Chad in Washington Chad you're
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:28.500]  on the air with Jesse Ventura we're skipping this network break go ahead Chad
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:33.900]  hey guys yeah I just wanted to know what you plan on doing about you and Jerry
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:38.980]  because I know you had King Calderon a while back yes governor Kim trailing
[02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.500]  the secret programs they had met her going on but are classified what would
[02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:47.580]  you do as president well to me everything should be declassified after a
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:53.620]  certain length of time because we are the boss the American people and how dare
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:58.620]  them use our tax dollars to do things and not tell us what they do with it it's
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:04.180]  that simple I and you have the right to know what our taxes are spent on we have
[02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:09.340]  every right to know that and to me that is a major right you have the major
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:13.180]  right to know what they're spending your money on and if they're spending it on
[02:51:13.180 --> 02:51:19.180]  chem drills we need to know why how and what for okay let's talk to Trish in
[02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:23.740]  Canada Trish you're on the air with Jesse Ventura good day gentlemen how are
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:31.540]  you today good governor would you comment on blue gold our planet's water
[02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:38.940]  supply because you can see all the big guy in Texas brought all that land I
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:42.860]  forget his name now by the aquifer in Oklahoma they got the funny name down
[02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:47.300]  there yeah T-Boom pickets yeah there you go T-Boom I always forget yeah he bought
[02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:53.420]  our land plus a fifth of the world's fresh water is the Great Lakes and they're
[02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:58.100]  already you're not you're not allowed to take water from the Great Lakes but they
[02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:02.860]  as usual they're rusting out they left a loophole you can go to a tributary and
[02:52:02.860 --> 02:52:07.260]  suck out all the water you want so the Great Lakes are falling at a drastic
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:12.740]  rate the other thing they ship into China well the other thing is this
[02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:17.060]  fracking a lot of people think it's wonderful that we got fracking to get
[02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:23.300]  oil no it's not because they trade water for oil and the water that's used in
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:29.780]  fracking is unusable for like 30 years or something like that or longer and I do
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:34.860]  not want to trade water for oil because if I'm out in the desert Alex and I'm
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:40.580]  dying of starvation and I come across a bottle of water or a can of oil which
[02:52:40.580 --> 02:52:44.860]  one would I need to drink to survive well common course is two plus two equals
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:54.340]  five so I guess you drink the oil well unfortunately I picked the water you
[02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:59.140]  know you can't survive drinking oil I was being sarcastic absolutely I want to
[02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:03.820]  play a short piece of what Ron Paul said about an hour and a half ago here on the
[02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:07.140]  broadcast with us about the state of the world economy and get your take on that
[02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:12.900]  Jesse Ventura is our guest let's go ahead and play this clip yeah I think for
[02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:16.980]  that not to come would be a surprise to me and you've been involved in this a
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:19.900]  long time I mean it wasn't like you didn't know what was happening with the
[02:53:19.900 --> 02:53:25.180]  housing bubble and we had the Nasdaq bubble and now now we have other
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:28.220]  bubbles we still have another stock market bubble and there's another housing
[02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:31.500]  bubble going on but the big bubble I think is in the bond bubble it's been
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:36.580]  going on for 35 years taking interest rates from 21 percent down to actually
[02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:41.660]  negative and they've been getting away with it so this means distortion not
[02:53:41.660 --> 02:53:45.140]  only is there money involved but it distorted all the investment over these
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:48.860]  periods of time and the biggest distortion that it encourages debt
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:54.020]  encourages debt for a lot of people but in particular government and as long as
[02:53:54.020 --> 02:53:59.660]  our government is able to print the reserve currency it's going to limp
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:03.300]  along even though our economy is limping along but that will come to an end and
[02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:08.220]  right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming apart I mean we look
[02:54:08.220 --> 02:54:13.020]  at Detroit as an example we see what's happening in Greece they're worrying
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:17.780]  about what's going to happen you know after Greece is recognized as actually
[02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:22.060]  totally bankrupt there'll be other countries this distortion has been going
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:26.420]  on for so long most people think that when governments print money that the
[02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:30.940]  only thing that happens is that prices go up as a consequence of inflation and a
[02:54:30.940 --> 02:54:34.380]  lot of that is true and it's a serious problem and destroys the middle class
[02:54:34.380 --> 02:54:40.500]  and the poor but to me the bigger distortion is the lack of pricing for
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:45.540]  money and causing people to do dumb things and that's why they overbuild and
[02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:49.740]  overinvesting governments overspend and then you have the Keynesians still in
[02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:55.060]  charge that says the solution for this is just to spend more money and
[02:54:55.060 --> 02:55:01.620]  print more money and that's coming to an end the day of reckoning is is a hand the
[02:55:01.620 --> 02:55:06.700]  day of reckoning is at hand Governor Venturi you did a whole special banking
[02:55:06.700 --> 02:55:10.780]  report on this I guess about four years ago one of your hit TV program episodes
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:13.860]  went to Wall Street interviewed the experts they even admitted that we were
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:18.820]  right about this now Puerto Rico says they're going bankrupt most counties are
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:23.900]  bankrupt most cities are people aren't self-sufficient I mean government's
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:27.580]  digging in elites are moving to armored redoubts what does Jesse Ventura and his
[02:55:27.580 --> 02:55:33.020]  gut think is really going on well you know it's a bad situation because we've
[02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:38.420]  allowed this debt to run wild as Congressman Paul said I mean the last
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:46.660]  time I heard a child born today starts his life off $50,000 in debt now that's
[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:53.540]  ridiculous obscene and that child's not even going to get a job for 18 years how
[02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:58.780]  far in debt will that child be 18 years after being born with the way that we
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:03.340]  have ignored and who's to blame for all this the Democrats and Republicans
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:08.420]  because they've been in charge for 150 years and they are responsible I've
[02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:12.460]  said it before if they would run their home finances like they ran the
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:18.620]  governments they'd be street people living out of bags but that this is what
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:23.100]  it's turned into I think the biggest problem is this debt is going to come
[02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:28.060]  home to roost and when it does I don't know what the results are going to be
[02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:34.060]  Alex I know this it's got me guaranteed one to get a place even further out in
[02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:38.260]  the country and thank God for the second amendment Jesse Ventura appeal fund
[02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:42.860]  they're trying to 33 to Goliaths are trying to stop him and overturn his
[02:56:42.860 --> 02:56:47.140]  victory against Chris Kyle and the fable he told according to the jury
[02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:51.180]  totally made up jury found it judge wrote a big 20-something page opinion
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:59.340]  saying dead on PO box 10629 White Bear Lake Minnesota 55110 and look we're
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:01.900]  gonna lose everything there's so many middle-class and wealthy people who
[02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:05.900]  aren't globalist who sit back on the sidelines you're not safe doing that
[02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:10.340]  it's all coming down you got to be all in or we're gonna lose it and we got more
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:14.940]  calls for it I have to go Jesse Ventura our guest info wars.com of

[02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:53.100]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[02:58:53.100 --> 02:58:56.740]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[02:58:56.740 --> 02:59:01.300]  info wars dot com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[02:59:01.300 --> 02:59:05.260]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[02:59:05.260 --> 02:59:09.860]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:15.500]  about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms dot com
[02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:19.780]  own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans
[02:59:19.780 --> 02:59:23.420]  their patriots their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:27.220]  broadcast it's always about security whether it's for yourself your wife

[02:59:54.420 --> 02:59:56.980]  show
[03:00:01.660 --> 03:00:07.460]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:17.540]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network being steadfast being
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:22.940]  loyal being honorable what built this free civilization that's now rotting I
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:26.580]  tell you when stuff hits rock bottom being honorable having a good name it's
[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:31.420]  gonna be the most valuable thing in the world as Ron Paul said we're going into
[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:36.100]  a collapse the great threat is that they'll use the great collapse to bring
[03:00:36.100 --> 03:00:41.020]  in total tyranny we must mobilize maximize to come out of the collapse of
[03:00:41.020 --> 03:00:46.500]  freer people I get chills when I talk about it we have reached a legendary
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:51.620]  epic over-the-top important moment I want to finish up with some of the
[03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:55.140]  highlights of the powerful the most powerful Ron Paul interview I've ever
[03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:59.580]  done that we're gonna be posting in full the next few hours in full wars calm
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:05.980]  but here's Ron Paul on the day of reckoning and then we will why they
[03:01:05.980 --> 03:01:09.900]  over build and over invest in governments overspend and then you have
[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:15.340]  the Keynesians still in charge this as this is the solution for this is just
[03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:19.940]  to spend more money and print more money and that's coming to an end the day of
[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:25.180]  reckoning is is at hand so the governments will lie to us they'll get
[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:29.740]  away with it for a long time there will be an illusion and a false trust and we
[03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:33.540]  will benefit tremendously because we have a military might and because we have
[03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:37.900]  this privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world but you know the
[03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:42.700]  the obligations that we have the unfunded obligation over two trillion
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:47.300]  dollars you know 200 trillion dollars that is not going to be paid and the
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:51.500]  only arguments that goes on with these countries like in Greece other is who's
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:55.340]  going to get stuck and the bankers are worried they're going to get stuck and
[03:01:55.340 --> 03:02:00.300]  that's what they argue about but the debt will not be paid and we cannot pay
[03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:05.060]  our debt it's just a matter of time but people say well tell me when tell me when
[03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:10.220]  well nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event but you can tell when the
[03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:15.180]  foundation has eroded and the foundation not only of our economic system but the
[03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:19.540]  world financial system like no other time in history has been eroded and
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:23.380]  there's going to be serious problems because there will have to be a
[03:02:23.380 --> 03:02:27.580]  correction of this and you can't correct it with more spending and more debt
[03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:32.100]  which is what they're trying to do well yes at the bottom is falling out and
[03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:40.780]  this is the the big problem because it's unsustainable and eventually that the
[03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:46.420]  people will have to you know recognize this and something else has to change
[03:02:46.420 --> 03:02:53.500]  the the system is not viable but there's always this willingness to try to
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:59.980]  profit up like we did in 08 and 09 we we propped it up but the debt is illiquid
[03:02:59.980 --> 03:03:04.860]  it's not worth anything the sooner you liquidate the debt is better you cannot
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:10.660]  preserve the debt my argument is and you alluded to this is the fact that you
[03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:14.180]  know this is big problems for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of
[03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:19.580]  wealth and even some wealthy people are going to lose out but everybody has to
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:23.420]  adjust to the fact that there will be a change and there will be a liquidation
[03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:27.780]  and there will be a living beneath our means we've lived way beyond our means
[03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:32.660]  but it's what we do about it if we keep doing the wrong things it'll last too
[03:03:32.660 --> 03:03:36.940]  long this is already this recession which is really a depression is lasting
[03:03:36.940 --> 03:03:44.620]  too long so if if we do this what we have to preserve is our liberty because if
[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:48.980]  we do if we eliminate all our wealth and had our liberties where you just
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:52.220]  eliminate all those things you just listed here what our government's going
[03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:55.980]  to do we would be back on our feet rather shortly but that's where the real
[03:03:55.980 --> 03:04:01.020]  crisis is now if we don't build our strength on those individuals who know
