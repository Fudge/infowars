[00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.360]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.123]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:10.885]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.467]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.030]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:22.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:54.367]  Get this, the TSA is announcing, when I first saw them talk about being their dream back in 2002, they're announcing, outside of law, like everything else now that happens, comes from the executive branch, the bureaucracy of the courts, forget legislation, forget laws, they're announcing, we're going to play this news clip coming up, that if your state doesn't have the federally approved national ID card,
[00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:00.561]  And many states have not adopted it.
[00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.664]  That you will not be allowed to fly.
[00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:11.270]  And the feds are also saying states have to comply with every federal edict, or they'll kick them out of the federal ID program.
[00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.658]  Where it still is a Texas driver's license, or a California driver's license, or a New York driver's license, or a Florida driver's license, or a Colorado driver's license, but it's really federal.
[00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:27.931]  And so this is how using the cashless society they can kill the right to travel, the right to buy and sell.
[00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:34.797]  I think I read about that when I was really young in Sunday school when they would get into Revelations.
[00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:45.366]  But whether Revelations is real or not, is it a good idea to give governments the power that science fiction writers, if you believe that from that perspective 2,000 years ago,
[00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:52.353]  Envisioned as the ultimate nightmare scenario that the devil incarnate would want?
[00:01:52.353 --> 00:02:03.163]  I mean, regardless, the devil character, thousands of years ago, wanted you to have to have a mark to buy and sell.
[00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:03.884]  And now it's here.
[00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:20.197]  Might want to investigate it, might want to be against it, whether you're a Christian, a Muslim, an atheist, an agnostic, an animist, a tooth fairy worshipper, a Santa Claus lover, whatever the case is.
[00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:30.339]  But that dovetails nicely with the illegals of the Supreme Court ruling three days ago that they don't have to have a license or proof to vote.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.382]  And states all over the country are issuing illegal driver's licenses.
[00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:39.604]  I mean, all I'm saying is, I can't go to Mexico.
[00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:45.047]  I can't go to Nigeria and just show up and get free health care and get a driver's license and vote.
[00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.408]  I mean, they'd laugh at you.
[00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:57.133]  If I walked into a Nigerian or in the Philippines or I walked into Mexico or I walked into the Czech Republic or wherever and said, hi, I'm here to vote.
[00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.033]  They said, OK, who are you?
[00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:02.585]  Igor Stryker.
[00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:05.788]  They're like, OK, let us see an ID.
[00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:08.430]  You don't look like Igor Stryker.
[00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.951]  You don't sound like Igor Stryker.
[00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:12.874]  You sound like a yank.
[00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:15.976]  But see, using their common sense would be called discrimination.
[00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:16.376]  No, no, no.
[00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:18.098]  They would say, here, you're allowed to vote.
[00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.200]  No, of course they wouldn't.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.723]  My name is Juan Gonzalez, and I'm here to vote.
[00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:25.003]  Really?
[00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:25.944]  We need to see his proof of ID.
[00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:29.787]  That's what you show in Mexico.
[00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:30.228]  Not here.
[00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.334]  Because this country is a joke.
[00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:38.837]  And the reason this country is a joke is we're the television nation.
[00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:43.000]  We consume the most media except for South Koreans.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.222]  And we're basically vegetables.
[00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:49.585]  And we've got a new powerful Mark Dice video that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:51.947]  It's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:55.089]  DrudgeReport.com and PrisonPlanet.com has it as well.
[00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.271]  Where he went out, he shows everybody they interviewed.
[00:03:58.356 --> 00:03:59.877]  Good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.018]  Two people say they like the red, white, and blue.
[00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:02.558]  And what is it?
[00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:08.921]  Eight others don't know why we have the Fourth of July.
[00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:10.962]  Two people know why.
[00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:16.084]  One foreigner, I guess one American.
[00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.085]  No one else knows.
[00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:24.848]  And of course, the one American just quasi knows that it has to do with the founding of the country in 1776.
[00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:25.408]  They get the year wrong.
[00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.542]  And of course a few days ago he was out there and most Americans want to ban the American flag.
[00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.226]  I mean ban it, not just get rid of it.
[00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:36.887]  They want it banned.
[00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:41.327]  So the video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:44.429]  Americans have no idea why they are celebrating 4th of July.
[00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.111]  This is why we're in so much trouble.
[00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:57.638]  Because we have a scientifically rewired, brain-damaged population that is completely servile, and quite frankly, not even conscious, not even human.
[00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:10.767]  Although the government admits it has no credible evidence of a potential terror attack taking place over the 4th of July holiday, the FBI has moved to establish command centers around the country.
[00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:19.315]  These command centers will integrate local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies so officials can gauge the threat level and respond quickly.
[00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:25.781]  Let's be real, the target of this apparatus is not ISIS and foreign jihadist terrorists, but the American people.
[00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:34.566]  Command centers and so-called fusion centers around the country are routinely used to monitor political activists, not supposed terrorists.
[00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:44.671]  And these command centers will certainly be convenient during the upcoming Jade Helm exercise, despite the fact that most Americans are sick and tired of endless terror warnings that don't pan out.
[00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:52.094]  These threats will continue to be used as a pretext to build and expand the surveillance grid in the United States.
[00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:59.258]  Read more about how the FBI is exploiting baseless 4th of July terror threats to establish command centers at InfoWars.com
[00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:16.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.093]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:24.336]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:26.017]  Hdfirearms.com.

[00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:06.888]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.132]  From FEMA Region 6.
[00:07:58.132 --> 00:08:12.226]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.388]  We come to you live.
[00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:16.210]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:22.074]  It is Thursday, the second day of July 2015.
[00:08:22.074 --> 00:08:29.459]  We'll be live tomorrow on the Friday edition and we'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:34.262]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:45.228]  1776 marked in a big way the demarcation line between the age of
[00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:59.034]  Kings, the age of oligarchies, the age of conquest, and the beginning of the age of enlightenment.
[00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:01.816]  That's at least how it was built.
[00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:07.559]  And to a great extent, that enlightenment was attained.
[00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:11.702]  Freedoms were expanded, human creativity was turned loose,
[00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:19.598]  The dynamic human spirit was unchained to an extent never before seen.
[00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:24.759]  But only a fraction of the dream was realized.
[00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:34.941]  But that fraction of freedom created so much wealth, so much technology, that we are now drowning.
[00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:41.662]  We are now drowned to a certain extent in that prosperity and have become decadent
[00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:48.447]  Disconnected demonic slobs.
[00:09:48.447 --> 00:09:58.170]  I'm going to break down right now, actually, what 1776 and what our republic and what the American flag stands for.
[00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.332]  We're going to put all the glory, the stars and stripes up behind me if you're a TV viewer.
[00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:05.653]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feeds.
[00:10:05.653 --> 00:10:09.174]  If you want to watch on your phone or home computer or whatever.
[00:10:11.186 --> 00:10:26.214]  It's important to add that because I'm always talking about put this on screen, put that on screen and we still get emails every day saying why are this a radio show and I'm listening to you and say Kansas City or Chicago or wherever and you're talking about look at this, look at that.
[00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:28.034]  We should probably announce every segment.
[00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:32.517]  We are radio slash TV in every sense of the word.
[00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:40.681]  I was probably the first major talk show host to start a webcam about 18 years ago and others followed suit.
[00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:49.109]  But for at least a decade, we've been a full TV production, and we've expanded on the quality of that over the years.
[00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:51.072]  And here we are today.
[00:10:51.072 --> 00:10:53.555]  And they say necessity is the mother of invention.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.180]  It is.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.581]  I got tired of saying I went to the Grand Canyon and showed the U.N.
[00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.261]  signs and then I would read the U.N.
[00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.922]  treaty saying it meant that the U.N.
[00:11:03.922 --> 00:11:13.144]  owns that land and all the land around it for up to 100 miles in all directions and that the park rangers threatened to arrest me for videotaping the U.N.
[00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:19.125]  sign and radio listeners would have trouble believing it back then.
[00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:26.372]  And so I said, that's it, I've got to start making films.
[00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:30.612]  And that grew into what we have here today, because back then, folks were in denial.
[00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:36.133]  They thought Ron Paul was lying, that the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:39.474]  They thought that there was no plan for a world government.
[00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:43.075]  They thought that NAFTA and GATT really was just a trade deal.
[00:11:43.075 --> 00:11:45.015]  At least some Americans believed it.
[00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:49.176]  Now everybody pretty much knows we're going under global corporate government.
[00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:50.036]  And that's a good thing.
[00:11:52.611 --> 00:12:09.898]  The bad thing is, the general public has been so dumbed down, and so distracted, and have had their values set on things that don't matter, that they don't even understand why that's a bad thing.
[00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:16.041]  Coming up, heartbreaking scene unfolds as Greek banks and pensioners clamor for cash.
[00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:16.441]  Their money.
[00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:37.937]  That ties into the leader of Greece, who got into power claiming he'd fight austerity and the EU takeover, saying that, well, now he's not going to listen to the referendum, even if the people vote to not go along.
[00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:52.276]  With the continued accelerated taxes and regulations that are designed to bankrupt them, that even if they vote against it, the government's now going to not go with the vote and is going to follow the EU edict.
[00:12:52.276 --> 00:13:03.926]  And already it was in the news yesterday, and today, that in Greece,
[00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:28.297]  Multinational banks that own the EU, Federal Reserve, that have taken over the country through fraud, are withholding PayPal and other credit card payments through the fulfillment merchant accounts to major Greek resorts and hotels
[00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:36.233]  Killing terrorism, which is an act of economic piracy outside of law, an act of terrorism.
[00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:47.637]  Similar things were done at first against Iceland five years ago when they refused to pay the debts, but it turned out 90 plus percent of which were not their debts.
[00:13:47.637 --> 00:13:51.398]  And so the Greek military says they're prepared to put down the public.
[00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.039]  They're going to ignore their vote.
[00:13:54.625 --> 00:14:03.533]  And they are going to put in a VAT tax over all the other taxes designed to fully bankrupt what they have left and consolidate the nation.
[00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:07.496]  But the globalists aren't waiting.
[00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:17.045]  They are going ahead with grabbing your money that you've paid for your Greek vacation and stealing it.
[00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:22.730]  This is the cashless society.
[00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.592]  This is why they want us doing everything online.
[00:14:25.592 --> 00:14:30.514]  This is where the world's going when they have full control.
[00:14:30.514 --> 00:14:41.800]  In fact, I will get into why America had been different, why it was so special to bottom of the hour and play the latest video that's on DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.344]  That went up last night.
[00:14:51.344 --> 00:15:00.452]  In fact, I'm going to have it reposted at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:07.118]  Citizens don't know what country we seceded from on July 4th, 1776.
[00:15:07.118 --> 00:15:15.226]  In fact, the people they talked to in California thought that it was secession from the South.
[00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:22.955]  When the Civil War was the opposite of that from the perspective of the North.
[00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:29.897]  I mean, they're doubly ignorant, doubly wrong, violently ignorant, violently stupid.
[00:15:29.897 --> 00:15:35.858]  And by violently, this type of ignorance is what emboldens our enemies.
[00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:43.220]  This is the ocean in which these megalodons of oppression swim.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.621]  We have a plague of corruption that is upon us.
[00:15:49.684 --> 00:15:52.927]  We're like a body that has no immune system.
[00:15:52.927 --> 00:15:54.828]  And we're not living in a bubble.
[00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:59.352]  We're living in a world full of political diseases.
[00:15:59.352 --> 00:16:00.432]  And all over the U.S.
[00:16:00.432 --> 00:16:11.481]  there are flag burnings of the Stars and Stripes going on as calls to ban the American flag spread.
[00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:12.242]  With the leftist
[00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:15.540]  All over the country, burning American flags.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.461]  They're coming out of the woodwork.
[00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:18.801]  They don't know who they are.
[00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:20.362]  They don't know what planet they're from.
[00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:26.924]  They can hardly talk, but they can say, racist, racist, racist.
[00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:33.887]  I told you two weeks ago, burn the rebel battle flag.
[00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:35.328]  Burn the American flag next.
[00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:41.867]  And make no mistake, the globalists hate the rebel flag because it symbolizes rebellion against central power.
[00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:43.608]  It was never about slavery.
[00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:46.650]  And any racist can adopt any symbol they want.
[00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.833]  If somebody wears a cross around their neck and goes and kills people, do we ban it?
[00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:58.498]  If somebody wears a star around their neck, do we ban the image of a star?
[00:16:58.498 --> 00:17:01.119]  It's total totalitarianism.
[00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:01.380]  TT.
[00:17:05.953 --> 00:17:12.736]  When someone else does something and then you get blamed for it as a collective group.
[00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:31.603]  But speaking of the cashless society that's almost in place, and the globalists can control everything you do, track everything you do, raise taxes, nowhere to escape, in their own words, they admit they're setting this up, they will feed everything into the collapsing global derivatives by design, on the other side, a global cashless society.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.885]  We're now being fed through the meat grinder, through the wood chipper.
[00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:41.650]  We're now entering the New World Order.
[00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.752]  Feet first into a wood chipper.
[00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:48.297]  If you like feeling your feet chopped off, wait till it gets up to your chest.
[00:17:48.297 --> 00:17:52.602]  Wait till it gets up to your neck.
[00:17:52.602 --> 00:17:54.044]  Wait till your family's fed through it.
[00:17:55.711 --> 00:18:07.730]  And then all around you, if you talk about freedom and transparency and the Constitution and restoring checks and balances, you'll be screamed at that you're a racist by dim-witted, dull-eyed dullards.
[00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:13.392]  Who, for all intents and purposes, aren't even human or conscious.
[00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.813]  They have had their humanity sucked out of them.
[00:18:15.813 --> 00:18:25.798]  They are wickedly stupid and wear it like a magisterial crown scepter signet on a gold throne.
[00:18:25.798 --> 00:18:30.721]  The ignorant giggle and snicker and laugh.
[00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:35.624]  Every time they don't know it, Mark Dice, they revel in it.
[00:18:35.624 --> 00:18:37.205]  They revel in their time.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:19:06.251]  Living off all the hard work of the past, living off the honor of great men and women, spitting on it decadently, squatting on it as the seized, captured government beats the war drums with all the memos and files and movies and TV shows and propaganda newscasts, demonizing the founders, demonizing property, demonizing self-defense, demonizing strong men, demonizing families, demonizing classical women.
[00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:15.677]  Demonizing health choice, demonizing sovereignty, demonizing borders, demonizing wealth, except in their hands.
[00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:22.663]  As the great storm of ignorance, the great hordes, the howl of the mob,
[00:19:24.927 --> 00:19:43.369]  And born on its back is royalty, and Rothschilds, and Rockefellers, and George Soros, and Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton, and all these scum, tax-exempt, above the law, with diplomatic immunity on red carpets, lavish jets, and palaces, laughing at us!
[00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:52.698]  As society hurls towards total collapse and national ID cards internally to travel, we have that mainstream news coming up.
[00:19:52.698 --> 00:19:57.663]  For all you slobs that laughed all these years, get ready for Great Depression.
[00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:58.264]  FEMA can't.
[00:20:00.453 --> 00:20:06.678]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:53.709]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:12.369]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:12.369 --> 00:21:19.497]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:21:19.537 --> 00:21:20.298]  We're good to go.
[00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:39.611]  Lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:50.440]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:58.047]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:21:59.707 --> 00:22:01.509]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:03.370]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.851]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:04.851 --> 00:22:06.393]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:12.558]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:15.780]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.321]  What is that?
[00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:26.168]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID that transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:26.168 --> 00:22:34.895]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:35.516]  Wow!
[00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:36.837]  That sounds scary!
[00:22:36.837 --> 00:22:41.280]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold Shielded Wallet.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.101]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:43.062]  No.
[00:22:43.062 --> 00:22:50.750]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:51.931]  Sounds great!
[00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:54.574]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:58.639]  I want to be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:00.099]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:01.920]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.680]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.641]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:11.642]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[00:23:15.283 --> 00:23:17.243]  Don't go another moment without a Berkey system.
[00:23:17.243 --> 00:23:20.364]  Over the last 10 years, we've helped thousands drink clean, purified water.
[00:23:20.364 --> 00:23:23.605]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:23:23.605 --> 00:23:23.785]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:35.278]  KDArmor.com is your one-stop shop for the most affordable body armor period.

[00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:57.867]  Come and take it!
[00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:03.902]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:09.625]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:15.348]  Now the University of Wisconsin's come out and said that complimenting anyone of color is racism.
[00:24:15.348 --> 00:24:26.014]  See, everything is racism when the high priest directed so that everyone is guilty and can be politically disappeared, demonized at any time.
[00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:29.560]  Brown paper bags are racist.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.242]  Criticizing Obamacare is racist.
[00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:33.003]  Not turning your guns in is racist.
[00:24:33.003 --> 00:24:34.424]  Being nice to people is racist.
[00:24:36.772 --> 00:24:38.393]  This is what we understand now.
[00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:48.898]  This is our culture, is being mentally ill and obsessing over things that don't exist, while the globalists consolidate total control over society.
[00:24:48.898 --> 00:24:54.640]  The video report detailing the new racism being nice to people of color.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.801]  See, there's no way to prove you're not evil.
[00:24:56.801 --> 00:24:58.862]  You are inherently bad because of your color.
[00:24:58.862 --> 00:25:00.843]  You are white.
[00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:02.544]  The opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:10.106]  But it doesn't matter because we now have an ignorant public that doesn't know any better.
[00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:16.773]  And we have this newscast piece dealing with the announcement of the TSA.
[00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:24.760]  Kind of like Obama announces more power plants to be shut down outside of law, or Obama announces he's going to stop deportations of felons even.
[00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:30.960]  Obama just announces what he's going to do with ISIS.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.241]  Well, now the agencies are the same.
[00:25:33.241 --> 00:25:39.365]  TSA to demand real ID licenses, that means federally approved state IDs.
[00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:46.068]  And you'll not be allowed to travel, and they will say it's not for federal official use.
[00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:55.954]  Now, I've witnessed this many, many times, and it even came out in the news last year confirming it, that illegals can fly without any ID.
[00:25:57.765 --> 00:26:05.250]  If they're from Mexico, it's selectively enforced, and the illegals line up.
[00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.513]  I'll hear them talking, they'll have no ID.
[00:26:08.513 --> 00:26:08.813]  Nothing!
[00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.311]  They'll show them a letter from the Mexican Consulate, something like that, boom right through.
[00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:18.711]  Citizens, I don't care what color you are, you're trained to be a slave.
[00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:24.292]  It's about breaking your will, training you to be a prisoner in this new economy.
[00:26:24.292 --> 00:26:26.453]  And I'm not just saying that rhetorically.
[00:26:26.453 --> 00:26:30.653]  That's really what's happening.
[00:26:30.653 --> 00:26:40.315]  So let's go to this piece because Ron Paul's warned of this, and by the way, he's coming up today in the second hour, so is Jesse Ventura, and more.
[00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:46.666]  And so remember this 4th of July, land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:47.226]  Are you kidding?
[00:26:47.226 --> 00:26:56.793]  By every benchmark, by every yardstick, by every historical comparison, the apparatus of total oppression is in place.
[00:26:58.988 --> 00:27:03.171]  And the finishing touches are being fast-tracked in.
[00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:14.519]  And you notice every major agency, every major corporate group, not just here but all over the world, they're announcing forced inoculations from Australia to the United States to England to the UK.
[00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:17.402]  They are just announcing open borders.
[00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.723]  They are just announcing increased taxes.
[00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:24.767]  They are announcing that banks will grab money out of your account whenever they want and keep it themselves.
[00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:25.367]  Why not?
[00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:27.049]  They already got away with everything.
[00:27:29.724 --> 00:27:32.785]  Why not if you had a Greek vacation booked for months?
[00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:35.346]  One of the best places to go in the world.
[00:27:35.346 --> 00:27:36.347]  Ultra beautiful.
[00:27:36.347 --> 00:27:37.207]  Cool people.
[00:27:37.207 --> 00:27:38.248]  Great food.
[00:27:38.248 --> 00:27:42.309]  Amazing culture.
[00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:44.550]  Super successful 20 years ago.
[00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.951]  Under globalism, under the Euro.
[00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:49.202]  being sucked dry.
[00:27:49.202 --> 00:27:51.303]  Ireland was the big success story.
[00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:52.464]  Now suddenly they're not.
[00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:53.765]  They just entered the EU.
[00:27:53.765 --> 00:27:56.346]  Within three years, they're getting screwed.
[00:27:56.346 --> 00:27:58.287]  It's an admitted plan.
[00:27:58.287 --> 00:28:03.070]  But illiteracy about globalism is what's causing this.
[00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.532]  So here it is to TSA.
[00:28:06.532 --> 00:28:11.754]  This is a global ID card, not just a national ID card.
[00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:13.896]  You either have a national ID card or you don't travel.
[00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:14.236]  Here it is.
[00:28:15.771 --> 00:28:20.252]  Which is important to know before you get here, as it can be a bit of a hassle.
[00:28:20.252 --> 00:28:27.595]  I've been here twice, and I gotta be sent home one more time because my passport's expired and I don't have the stamp on my marriage license.
[00:28:27.595 --> 00:28:31.036]  So I gotta go to, I said, my still box and find that.
[00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:36.937]  But Darlene says the wait has actually been short, and this will all simplify things for her later on.
[00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:42.359]  She's right about that, and that's the case for anyone who uses their license instead of, say, a passport.
[00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:44.000]  It's a choice.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.123]  You don't have to get a real ID card, but if you want to get on an airplane after 2016 or sometime in there, you're going to have to have a real ID card.
[00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:54.523]  Or a passport.
[00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:56.284]  So, what is a real ID card?
[00:28:56.284 --> 00:29:03.106]  Well, it looks a lot like your driver's license, but that star and the gold circle around it show that the DMV has checked out your background.
[00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:04.167]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:12.275]  At this current point, Texas did comply, but doesn't comply, because the feds can always add more, and then refuse the state.
[00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:15.838]  Like you heard, if they didn't make the speed limit of 55, they would hold highway funds?
[00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:16.639]  Same deal.
[00:29:16.639 --> 00:29:21.224]  This is how they federalize you an internal passport.
[00:29:21.224 --> 00:29:25.628]  Another absolute hallmark jewel in the crown!
[00:29:26.843 --> 00:29:31.245]  That you are in a hardcore fascist or totalitarian state.
[00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:32.645]  I mean, they're going down the list.
[00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:34.066]  Every one of them's checked.
[00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:41.048]  The black uniforms, the cameras, the NSA, the FEMA camps, the army admitting they're training to round up Tea Partiers.
[00:29:41.048 --> 00:29:42.909]  And that'll start a civil war.
[00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:49.431]  All run by Soros as they sit back offshore and laugh, roasting hot dogs as this country burns.
[00:29:49.431 --> 00:29:50.812]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.812 --> 00:29:53.353]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.353 --> 00:29:56.014]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.912 --> 00:30:04.818]  Have you ever come across someone on the internet that you suspected was a paid government troll?
[00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:08.002]  Well, there's a very good chance that you were not imagining things.
[00:30:08.002 --> 00:30:18.836]  Thanks to Edward Snowden, we now have solid proof that paid government trolls are using psychology-based influence techniques on social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:29.563]  Some of these techniques include uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote distrust, fake online resources such as magazines and books to provide inaccurate information.
[00:30:29.563 --> 00:30:34.006]  They also set up Facebook groups that encourage and monitor discussion on a topic.
[00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:47.175]  They can also set up fake trade sites that can take a person's money and personal information, as well as send those customers degraded or spoofed products, like sending computers overseas that are already equipped with a backdoor for the NSA.
[00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:51.861]  All of this is just more proof that it's actually the government engaging in cybercrime.
[00:30:51.861 --> 00:30:56.687]  Of course, it's all an effort to ramp up a non-existent threat to take our freedoms.
[00:30:56.687 --> 00:30:59.831]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.758]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:32:12.053 --> 00:32:19.138]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:32:19.818 --> 00:32:22.299]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:32:22.299 --> 00:32:28.902]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.

[00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.291]  The British are coming!
[00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:06.132]  The British are coming!
[00:33:06.132 --> 00:33:14.618]  Now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear, and the shock at Lexington heard round the world.
[00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:20.741]  When the British fired in the early dawn, the war of independence had begun.
[00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:22.943]  The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled.
[00:33:25.307 --> 00:33:29.913]  And on to Concord, marshed the foe, to seize the arsenal, there you know.
[00:33:29.913 --> 00:33:32.776]  Waitin' folks, searchin' all around.
[00:33:32.776 --> 00:33:41.607]  Till our militia stopped them in their tracks, at the old North Bridge, we turned them back, to chase those Redcoats back to Boston Town.
[00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:08.848]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple.
[00:34:08.848 --> 00:34:10.991]  And Paul went down there to look.
[00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:14.595]  And sure enough, there was the light, burning brighter and day.
[00:34:15.385 --> 00:34:18.928]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[00:34:18.928 --> 00:34:22.171]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[00:34:22.171 --> 00:34:23.372]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:29.057]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine.
[00:34:29.057 --> 00:34:32.319]  Feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:35.982]  Paul holding on for dear life and hollering at the top of his lungs.
[00:34:35.982 --> 00:34:38.885]  He says, the British is coming, the British is coming.
[00:34:38.885 --> 00:34:41.347]  Get you a gun, we gonna have us a revolution.
[00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:46.759]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:48.140]  Minute men, they's called.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.381]  What's minute men?
[00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:50.482]  Minute men?
[00:34:50.482 --> 00:34:52.904]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[00:34:52.904 --> 00:35:01.330]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:08.575]  And when the British come a-prancing along all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:09.916]  It was a sight to see.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.141]  And then it happened.
[00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:14.802]  They fired the gun!
[00:35:14.802 --> 00:35:16.803]  They fired the gun.
[00:35:16.803 --> 00:35:22.906]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[00:35:22.906 --> 00:35:25.547]  Oh, get out!
[00:35:25.547 --> 00:35:31.670]  That's the way this country started.
[00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.332]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:35.492]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:35:35.492 --> 00:35:37.413]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:35:37.413 --> 00:35:40.395]  I'm not trying to be negative as we approach this July 4th.
[00:35:41.937 --> 00:35:46.258]  Well this country's been around 239, 240 years.
[00:35:46.258 --> 00:35:48.519]  How many is it now?
[00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:50.120]  Founded July 4th, 1776.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:36:01.463]  And we did this a few years ago and went out and about half the Austinites we talked to didn't know what the 4th of July was about.
[00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:09.346]  Mark Dice has gone out and he's done these reports as well and I think it's 7 out of 10 have no idea
[00:36:10.256 --> 00:36:19.460]  Two people do, one of them's from Italy, and one of them thinks that it was the war between the states.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.043]  Or the war of northern aggression, as it's seen in the South.
[00:36:24.043 --> 00:36:32.827]  And you can only get responses like this in a trendy area, a university, a liberal area.
[00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:34.608]  And folks know I'm non-partisan.
[00:36:34.608 --> 00:36:38.730]  The Republican leadership is just as bad as the Democrats, but the constituents
[00:36:40.222 --> 00:36:49.446]  of the Democratic Party are some of the most culturally, historically ignorant people of the planet.
[00:36:49.446 --> 00:36:51.847]  They're scary.
[00:36:51.847 --> 00:36:57.749]  And they're very self-satisfied in their ignorance.
[00:36:57.749 --> 00:37:01.250]  And they're very totalitarian.
[00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.193]  He goes out in California, out to Venice Beach and other areas, and these are not edited.
[00:37:09.673 --> 00:37:15.916]  And by that, he's not cherry-picking the stupid people talking to 50 folks and finding, you know, finding 10 and showing it.
[00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:19.979]  He's showing you everyone he talked to.
[00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:20.899]  We've been out there with him.
[00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:22.400]  We've done it too.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.921]  It's frightening.
[00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:32.666]  You go to a blue-collar working area, and almost everyone knows who he declared independence from.
[00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:36.140]  You go to a wealthy area, everybody knows.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.041]  You go to an area where folks actually have jobs, they know.
[00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:42.962]  You can go to an area and talk to people that are immigrants, I've noticed, and they know.
[00:37:42.962 --> 00:37:49.024]  Because that's interesting that we had a war with the British Empire and won.
[00:37:49.024 --> 00:37:58.386]  But if you talk to trendies, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, I don't care, they are so stupid you can hardly believe it.
[00:37:58.386 --> 00:38:00.127]  And they're proud of it.
[00:38:01.815 --> 00:38:04.296]  They're proud of not caring about their neighbors or themselves.
[00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:07.637]  They're proud of not knowing how to find their butt with both hands.
[00:38:07.637 --> 00:38:09.998]  They like it.
[00:38:09.998 --> 00:38:15.240]  And the reason I say they're not people, and I've not dehumanized them, they've dehumanized themselves.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:25.884]  The reason they're not people is that from birth they've been in front of a television and they're not creative.
[00:38:25.884 --> 00:38:27.444]  They have no innate spark.
[00:38:27.444 --> 00:38:28.585]  They don't even have their instincts.
[00:38:30.216 --> 00:38:34.258]  For survival and building a better world and being creators.
[00:38:34.258 --> 00:38:43.824]  Their free will has been erased to where they just absorb whatever they're told and then regurgitate it.
[00:38:43.824 --> 00:38:48.567]  If you ask them about the rebel flag, they can tell you it was racist and evil and needed to be banned.
[00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:52.569]  If you ask them about Kim Kardashian or her stepdad, they know all about it.
[00:38:52.569 --> 00:38:53.450]  If you ask them about
[00:38:54.261 --> 00:38:58.424]  The different flavors of energy drinks, they could tell you.
[00:38:58.424 --> 00:39:01.726]  If you ask them about the NFL, they could tell you.
[00:39:01.726 --> 00:39:10.272]  If you ask the women about different sexual positions, they'd know.
[00:39:10.272 --> 00:39:14.134]  But they don't have any idea even where they are.
[00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:21.980]  Most Americans now, in big college polls they have every year, the majority, don't know the three branches of government, don't know their state capital.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.481]  They are helpless.
[00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:28.005]  Except for one thing, they're basically reanimated dead.
[00:39:28.005 --> 00:39:32.429]  They have no mind, basically their soul is a shadow of its former self.
[00:39:32.429 --> 00:39:36.814]  They're just filling space until they physically die.
[00:39:36.814 --> 00:39:44.703]  But they can be animated like a zombie army by the mainstream media to do anything they're told.
[00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:52.280]  As long as they feel like they're being powerful and are on a winning team.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.741]  Because they don't care about really not being racist.
[00:39:54.741 --> 00:39:56.542]  They don't really care about charity.
[00:39:56.542 --> 00:40:05.326]  They've had major studies that show this, that liberals are six times, self-identifying modern liberals, are six times more likely to steal as London Guardian.
[00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.934]  And just as many times likely, six times, not to give in charity.
[00:40:12.934 --> 00:40:23.682]  Conservatives and libertarians and classical liberals, which you would call a right-wing extremist, are the majority of givers.
[00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:26.164]  But don't want to be told where to give.
[00:40:26.164 --> 00:40:29.307]  And don't go around advertising it.
[00:40:29.307 --> 00:40:32.049]  So what you've got is neo-fascist posers.
[00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:37.287]  Who are sickeningly stupid.
[00:40:37.287 --> 00:40:38.268]  And they are victims.
[00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:43.972]  They were raised by weaker individuals who probably still had some soul.
[00:40:43.972 --> 00:40:52.198]  And then now they've been so marinated in this false culture, in this synthetic culture, that they're gone.
[00:40:52.198 --> 00:40:56.722]  And let me tell you something, they're not coming back.
[00:40:56.722 --> 00:40:58.343]  And they think we're a democracy.
[00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:04.403]  We're 51% can vote to enslave the other 49.
[00:41:04.403 --> 00:41:09.788]  No, we're a constitutional republic.
[00:41:09.788 --> 00:41:13.231]  The truest sense in our charter.
[00:41:13.231 --> 00:41:14.913]  Doesn't mean we ever lived up to it.
[00:41:14.913 --> 00:41:17.876]  But what we did do was better than everybody else.
[00:41:17.876 --> 00:41:19.357]  That's why everybody came here.
[00:41:19.357 --> 00:41:20.158]  Proof is in the pudding.
[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:26.972]  It's why we had the most inventions and the most innovation and the most exploration and trailblazing.
[00:41:26.972 --> 00:41:36.415]  We were exceptionally amazing, exceptionally strong, exceptionally smart, exceptionally brave, exceptionally murderous.
[00:41:36.415 --> 00:41:40.256]  Oh, we've got a dark side too.
[00:41:40.256 --> 00:41:50.379]  Every major military historian for 240 years, from the French to the Japanese to the Russians to the British, that recorded the behavior of Americans
[00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:59.692]  Was once you got in a fight with the Americans, they would never, ever, ever, ever give up.
[00:41:59.692 --> 00:42:07.595]  And they would work around the clock to kill you and then basically give you no mercy once they'd gotten the upper hand.
[00:42:07.595 --> 00:42:12.377]  And that's why this country was feared and didn't need to run around building empires.
[00:42:12.377 --> 00:42:13.938]  People wanted to trade with us.
[00:42:13.938 --> 00:42:20.641]  They wanted to be involved with us because we were truly noble compared to other nations.
[00:42:21.786 --> 00:42:29.215]  We were still freebooting and barbarous and wicked as the day is long.
[00:42:29.215 --> 00:42:39.328]  But if mountains reach into the sky and towards the heavens, we were the greatest mountain in a range of corruption.
[00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:53.408]  And now the forced inoculations, and your children belong to the state, and national ID cards and internal ID cards to travel, and banks taking money out of your account outside of law.
[00:42:53.408 --> 00:43:03.310]  A criminal global combine, globally above the law, ready to have its way with you and your family as an act of total domination.
[00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:11.131]  The lowest of the low, the opposite of the Renaissance, the opposite of free will, the opposite of a free republic.
[00:43:12.392 --> 00:43:36.410]  In a republic, if 51% vote to make the other 49 slaves, or to give you a national religion, or to force you into conscription, it can't hold up because it violates the Bill of Rights, which only points out unalienable, unblockable, unchangeable rights that are there in an innate, sentient, free creature.
[00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:51.300]  And so we see American flags from New York to Austin, Texas in the last day to California being burned by the George Soros funded Black Lives Matter crowd.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:44:04.430]  That's basically just a communist recruiting house using the excesses of federalized paramilitary police to build the counter-revolution that's meant to spark off the larger revolution that brings in the collapse of the country.
[00:44:07.193 --> 00:44:10.195]  And that's only one possible corridor they're going down.
[00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:26.643]  It doesn't mean they'll implement that fully, but it's certainly being looked at and engaged and levered up, levered up to the highest level ever.
[00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:30.505]  And so, yes, the American flag has flown over neocolonialism.
[00:44:30.505 --> 00:44:34.427]  Yes, the American flag has flown over massacres, from Wounded Knee to
[00:44:37.233 --> 00:44:40.574]  Things that happened in Vietnam, to Iraq.
[00:44:40.574 --> 00:44:48.315]  But don't put the American flag up there as the living creature that committed these crimes.
[00:44:48.315 --> 00:45:02.558]  The crimes were committed by the globalists that have seized control of this nation and that are using our country, our treasure, our power, our blood to build their planetary government while we take the blame and their own agents
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:13.464]  Then blame the Republic for everything they've done.
[00:45:13.464 --> 00:45:14.825]  Don't worry.
[00:45:14.825 --> 00:45:21.028]  Super PACs just this year alone, from George Soros, have given $24 million to Hillary.
[00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:23.870]  And Hillary's campaign head was Zet Bilderberg.
[00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.353]  No one else's campaign head was, showing you who the aide-de-camp is.
[00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:33.676]  They've got Trump running as the ringer, in my view.
[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:42.993]  Against Jeb, who's the second ringer for Hillary.
[00:45:42.993 --> 00:45:55.919]  And I predict they're going to put Trump and Jeb as the frontrunners by giving them the attention, making a fight between them worthy of WWF that Trump's gone out and been part of WWF before.
[00:45:55.919 --> 00:46:01.281]  I remember seeing it on a clip on the news.
[00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:04.583]  And then he will bow out to Jeb at the last minute.
[00:46:05.973 --> 00:46:10.636]  And then Jeb will fall to Hillary.
[00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:19.041]  Only in America could you have such synthetic, made-up, fake political garbage.
[00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:27.646]  But America stands for free market, and the right to due process, and the right to self-defense, and the right to private property, and the right to be left alone.
[00:46:27.646 --> 00:46:30.707]  That's what the flag symbolizes, and why it was loved.
[00:46:30.707 --> 00:46:34.950]  A bunch of out-of-control globalists that have overrun our country, it does not symbolize.
[00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:42.452]  But I'll tell you this, if we let them fully take over the country and blame the flag worldwide for what they've done, we deserve it.
[00:46:42.452 --> 00:46:45.193]  To be the slaves, we will become fully.
[00:46:45.193 --> 00:46:57.176]  And the flag will be captured and will be another trinket, another war prize, another trophy of the globalist conquest of this planet.
[00:46:57.176 --> 00:47:01.517]  But their attempt to use this country as their juggernaut could be their downfall.
[00:47:02.921 --> 00:47:08.624]  A battle for planetary freedom is being fought in the United States more than anywhere.
[00:47:08.624 --> 00:47:15.127]  We are exceptional yet again, even in the midst of our drugged out, mind controlled state.
[00:47:15.127 --> 00:47:22.550]  Let's go to Mark Dice's latest report, see the full video at InfoWars.com and the left hand side of DrugsReport.com if you guys can
[00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:26.340]  What country famously broke away from England to start their own country in the late 1700s?
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.220]  I have no idea, man.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:27.521]  I don't know.
[00:47:27.521 --> 00:47:29.321]  What are we celebrating on the 4th of July?
[00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:30.662]  Our independence.
[00:47:52.759 --> 00:47:54.761]  A little more specific.
[00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:57.723]  It's the day that we overtook the South.
[00:47:57.723 --> 00:48:00.846]  And it's the day that, um, it's our independence.
[00:48:00.846 --> 00:48:01.846]  That's why we had the fire.
[00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:02.547]  From the South.
[00:48:02.547 --> 00:48:03.748]  From the South, exactly.
[00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:05.549]  So it was the victor of the Civil War?
[00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:06.590]  Yes.
[00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:07.611]  Fourth of July?
[00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:10.273]  Yes.
[00:48:10.273 --> 00:48:14.237]  The Declaration of Independence was signed by who?
[00:48:14.237 --> 00:48:19.201]  I don't know.
[00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:20.302]  Just name one person.
[00:48:22.507 --> 00:48:23.808]  Abraham Lincoln?
[00:48:23.808 --> 00:48:26.809]  I don't know!
[00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:27.569]  Sorry.
[00:48:27.569 --> 00:48:28.409]  Not?
[00:48:28.409 --> 00:48:31.711]  What year was that Declaration of Independence?
[00:48:31.711 --> 00:48:34.832]  Was it 1964?
[00:48:34.832 --> 00:48:34.852]  84?
[00:48:34.852 --> 00:48:35.132]  1980?
[00:48:35.132 --> 00:48:35.332]  84?
[00:48:35.332 --> 00:48:36.773]  They revel in it.
[00:48:36.773 --> 00:48:37.353]  I don't know.
[00:48:37.353 --> 00:48:38.213]  They're proud of it.
[00:48:38.213 --> 00:48:38.994]  1864?
[00:48:38.994 --> 00:48:41.295]  It's their identity.
[00:48:41.295 --> 00:48:41.895]  I don't know.
[00:48:41.895 --> 00:48:44.596]  And they will vote, take your guns, everything.
[00:48:44.596 --> 00:48:46.157]  Your children, everything.
[00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:50.538]  What country did we declare our independence from?
[00:48:50.538 --> 00:48:51.419]  Help me, baby.
[00:48:51.419 --> 00:48:51.939]  Nope, just you.
[00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.852]  You're on your own.
[00:48:54.852 --> 00:48:57.035]  California.
[00:48:57.035 --> 00:48:57.395]  From.
[00:48:57.395 --> 00:48:58.496]  Oh, from?
[00:48:58.496 --> 00:49:01.119]  I don't have no idea.
[00:49:12.998 --> 00:49:13.859]  Yes.
[00:49:13.859 --> 00:49:17.001]  But you don't know what you're celebrating.
[00:49:17.001 --> 00:49:18.022]  You're right, you're right.
[00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:21.305]  That's tonight's homework.
[00:49:21.305 --> 00:49:34.716]  Back in the late 1700s when Jesse Ventura and John Wilkes Booth and the other founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, what year was that exactly?
[00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:38.138]  Sometime in the 1700s, I'm not sure.
[00:49:38.138 --> 00:49:41.901]  How many stars on this flag?
[00:49:41.901 --> 00:49:42.522]  Uh, 50-something?
[00:49:44.113 --> 00:49:49.418]  Well, what country did we declare independence from back in the 1770s?
[00:49:49.418 --> 00:49:52.240]  I don't know!
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:52.961]  You don't know?
[00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:53.661]  No!
[00:49:53.661 --> 00:49:55.663]  It's kind of the reason we celebrate the 4th of July.
[00:49:55.663 --> 00:49:56.964]  I have no idea.
[00:49:56.964 --> 00:49:58.445]  No idea, but you're still going to be celebrating.
[00:49:58.445 --> 00:49:59.826]  I'm still going to celebrate.
[00:49:59.826 --> 00:50:03.229]  Well, you should have your celebration revoked.
[00:50:03.229 --> 00:50:03.830]  Because I don't know.
[00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.431]  You're not allowed to celebrate.
[00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:07.873]  I'm banning you now from celebrating the 4th of July.
[00:50:07.873 --> 00:50:09.635]  Well, I'm terrible.
[00:50:10.772 --> 00:50:13.933]  What are we celebrating on the 4th of July exactly?
[00:50:13.933 --> 00:50:16.453]  Independence Day?
[00:50:16.453 --> 00:50:18.814]  Specifically?
[00:50:18.814 --> 00:50:22.495]  Our... I don't know.
[00:50:22.495 --> 00:50:24.756]  I'm so bad at this.
[00:50:24.756 --> 00:50:25.416]  That's enough.
[00:50:25.416 --> 00:50:30.277]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.160]  And this is not cherry-picked.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:43.763]  Anyone pretty much young or in a liberal-trendy area, I don't care if it's Wisconsin or New York or Texas or California, this is the enemy.
[00:50:43.763 --> 00:50:45.123]  And notice they always laugh.
[00:50:45.123 --> 00:50:46.823]  They love it.
[00:50:46.823 --> 00:50:49.284]  They have no creativity, no curiosity.
[00:50:49.284 --> 00:50:50.704]  Hey, what's Independence Day?
[00:50:50.704 --> 00:50:55.725]  I mean, I knew what Independence Day was when I was three years old.
[00:50:55.725 --> 00:50:57.786]  Three years old, I knew more than these people.
[00:51:00.288 --> 00:51:06.533]  So Mark and his wife came over to see my wife and me, and he began talking about the 4th of July, Independence Day, you know?
[00:51:06.533 --> 00:51:11.037]  And he said, Guns80.com's having a really awesome special for the 4th of July.
[00:51:11.037 --> 00:51:13.639]  Celebrate your independence with the pistols now.
[00:51:13.639 --> 00:51:15.841]  The pistol kit's $4.99.
[00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:17.482]  That's right, $4.99.
[00:51:17.482 --> 00:51:21.406]  And the Hillary special is backed by popular demand, you remember?
[00:51:21.406 --> 00:51:24.388]  230 round mags, all that.
[00:51:24.388 --> 00:51:25.449]  Guns80.com.

[00:51:34.474 --> 00:51:37.396]  How about a motor that charges batteries at the same time?
[00:51:37.396 --> 00:51:41.599]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?
[00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:47.124]  Come to our Renaissance Charge Conference Workshop on August 15th and 16th in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:53:29.093 --> 00:53:30.333]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:34.835]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:40.517]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:44.078]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:53:44.078 --> 00:53:46.799]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:46.799 --> 00:53:51.801]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:54:03.581 --> 00:54:05.062]  We are back live.
[00:54:05.062 --> 00:54:06.563]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is coming up.
[00:54:06.563 --> 00:54:10.826]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura and other surprise guests today.
[00:54:10.826 --> 00:54:14.988]  Ron Paul is talking about the collapse he's been predicting being very, very close.
[00:54:14.988 --> 00:54:17.129]  Quote, day of reckoning.
[00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:20.391]  Boy, we have a lot of news on that front.
[00:54:20.391 --> 00:54:22.573]  What day is Mexican Independence Day from Spain?
[00:54:22.573 --> 00:54:24.054]  Is it September something?
[00:54:24.054 --> 00:54:24.374]  What is it?
[00:54:27.788 --> 00:54:30.390]  September 16th, I believe.
[00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.993]  But I know when people say, what's Mexican Independence Day?
[00:54:33.993 --> 00:54:39.637]  I know it's from Spain, another colonial power.
[00:54:39.637 --> 00:54:48.463]  And of course, then Santa Ana basically took over and was a tyrant, screwed everything up, so Mexico lost Guatemala and Texas.
[00:54:48.463 --> 00:54:55.629]  But what's frustrating is, I don't get any pleasure out of how ignorant my fellow Americans are.
[00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.731]  I mean, I know about French Independence Day and the Bastille.
[00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:01.311]  I know what Bastille Day is.
[00:55:01.311 --> 00:55:04.291]  I know about the different independence movements in England.
[00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:05.532]  I know about Magna Carta.
[00:55:05.532 --> 00:55:06.892]  I know about the Parliament Act.
[00:55:06.892 --> 00:55:08.312]  Because this is important stuff.
[00:55:08.312 --> 00:55:11.793]  It's interesting, too.
[00:55:11.793 --> 00:55:21.114]  But I talk to historians and people, and I'll know more than they do in general, because they'll be specialists on the Byzantines, or on the Japanese, or on Mesoamerica.
[00:55:21.114 --> 00:55:24.435]  It's just so scary that general knowledge is not there.
[00:55:25.396 --> 00:55:35.245]  I thought growing up that my parents were just normal folks, just constantly telling me what this was and what that was, and reading me books, and showing me news articles, and taking me to the Smithsonian.
[00:55:35.245 --> 00:55:48.316]  But I'm on one end of this, and then you've got these people over here that really believe, because I've heard that before, that Independence Day is over the South, like the South is the enemy.
[00:55:48.316 --> 00:55:50.999]  Most of the generals against the British came from the South.
[00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:52.280]  George Washington, you name it.
[00:55:53.547 --> 00:56:05.612]  General Lee, what Lee's grandfather, wasn't his dad, I keep saying his dad, Light Horse Lee, the South and the North got along really well, up until the Civil War.
[00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:06.952]  It wasn't about slavery.
[00:56:06.952 --> 00:56:13.675]  But you've got an ignorant public that can be told lies about it, and they believe it!
[00:56:13.675 --> 00:56:19.017]  And I told you two weeks ago, if they could take down the battle flag, the Confederate battle flag,
[00:56:20.418 --> 00:56:23.020]  It's not even the Confederate flag, they just call it that.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.542]  That's how ignorant the public is.
[00:56:25.542 --> 00:56:27.624]  That's a whole other flag.
[00:56:27.624 --> 00:56:30.226]  If they can do that, they can pull down everything.
[00:56:30.226 --> 00:56:33.869]  And now it's dig up the old generals, take down the American flag.
[00:56:33.869 --> 00:56:35.070]  What are we going to replace it with?
[00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:42.688]  Meanwhile, Obama, in the TPP it's come out, will not try to stop countries involved in modern slavery.
[00:56:42.688 --> 00:56:46.030]  A whole bunch of Arab countries actually import real slaves today.
[00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.171]  There are African countries that still have slaves.
[00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:51.732]  But no one ever criticizes Muslims for having slaves, because that's cute!
[00:56:51.732 --> 00:56:52.773]  That's trendy!
[00:56:52.773 --> 00:56:54.774]  That's fun!
[00:56:54.774 --> 00:56:57.795]  And I'm not even a Muslim basher.
[00:56:57.795 --> 00:57:01.376]  Muslims that want their women to be free, like the Kurds, are under attack.
[00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:02.797]  Or the Syrians are under attack.
[00:57:05.333 --> 00:57:09.359]  Our government's bankrolling the worst radical Muslims there are.
[00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.981]  Because it's not our government.
[00:57:10.981 --> 00:57:16.449]  It's a group that's decided to be as evil as you can be.
[00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:18.292]  But watching that Mark Dice video...
[00:57:21.479 --> 00:57:27.102]  Just makes me want to slap those people upside the head and grab them and say, do you know how much trouble we're in, idiot?
[00:57:27.102 --> 00:57:32.266]  And that all your free lunch and all your welfare and all your crud is about to come to an end, jackass?
[00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:36.908]  You were only given all these freebies to turn you into jellyfish for the takeover, scum!
[00:57:36.908 --> 00:57:43.272]  What is it about that you don't get through your stinking head?
[00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:47.515]  And stop coming after my guns and my kids and all of it, you fools!
[00:57:48.524 --> 00:57:49.644]  You're idiots!
[00:57:49.644 --> 00:57:51.925]  The government at the top is not your friend.
[00:57:51.925 --> 00:57:55.666]  Now, at the low level, it could be our friend and used to get legitimate government back.
[00:57:55.666 --> 00:58:01.028]  That's why they want to start a war with the low-level government to kick off a civil war!
[00:58:01.028 --> 00:58:03.348]  How much other stuff have I talked about come true?
[00:58:03.348 --> 00:58:06.589]  Long before this civil war crap started, I told you it was coming.
[00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:12.611]  Because they've been billing Obama as the second coming of Lincoln since before he even ran.
[00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:15.192]  Briefly, we're going to sell out of the new
[00:58:16.417 --> 00:58:20.659]  Brain Force that is the most powerful brain formula ever with the best ingredients.
[00:58:20.659 --> 00:58:25.141]  A bunch of them are prescription in Europe that absolutely naturally boost the brain.
[00:58:25.141 --> 00:58:26.361]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:26.361 --> 00:58:29.722]  It will sell out by Monday and it'll be months until we get it unfortunately.
[00:58:29.722 --> 00:58:35.085]  It was too successful and we will be sold out by next week on that limited supply of X2 nascent iodine that came in.
[00:58:35.085 --> 00:58:36.545]  Your purchase supports the show.

[00:58:53.389 --> 00:59:01.634]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:01.634 --> 00:59:07.057]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:07.057 --> 00:59:09.579]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:20.763]  Alex Jones here.
[00:59:20.763 --> 00:59:30.029]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:33.852]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:59:33.852 --> 00:59:42.178]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:55.062]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.953 --> 01:00:10.776]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.776 --> 01:00:12.377]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.377 --> 01:00:13.918]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.918 --> 01:00:18.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.363]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.363 --> 01:00:30.128]  We've got incredibly important news on the world economy with Von Mies Institute fellow, former Congressman Medical Doctor Ron Paul.
[01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:35.231]  Joining us via video feed from his TV studios in Houston.
[01:00:36.462 --> 01:00:39.844]  He'll be joining us.
[01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:43.306]  We've got so much other news we're going to be getting into today.
[01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:54.352]  Before I go any further, I did a 30-second plug in the last hour, and I'm proud of the fact that we do about a minute of plugging, two minutes of plugging an hour on average.
[01:00:54.352 --> 01:00:56.854]  The average talk show host does it about four or five minutes.
[01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:59.495]  That's where you really get the big effect is live, on-air plugs.
[01:00:59.495 --> 01:01:01.036]  Everybody knows that.
[01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:03.197]  And in TV, they have product placement, you name it.
[01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:04.478]  And about once every two weeks,
[01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:10.903]  Sometimes once a week we do 30 minutes or so that's kind of infomercially just to try to pay the bills around here.
[01:01:10.903 --> 01:01:12.024]  It's what we do.
[01:01:12.024 --> 01:01:20.270]  But it's even more important to support our local AM and FM affiliates, to spread the word about them, and to become sponsors or to support local sponsors and let them know why you are supporting them.
[01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.771]  It's absolutely integral.
[01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:24.753]  That's why we're getting more and more affiliates and God bless you.
[01:01:24.753 --> 01:01:32.919]  But selling high-quality non-GMO seeds, shortwave radios, Patriot apparel, books, films, knives, firearms,
[01:01:34.252 --> 01:01:36.553]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:01:36.553 --> 01:01:42.435]  If I use a cook stove and love it, a little miniature cook stove, we buy it and start selling it.
[01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:49.437]  If I like a particular brand of shortwave radio that's inexpensive, I call up and find out who owns the company and become a distributor eight years ago.
[01:01:50.897 --> 01:01:56.060]  If I separately test water filters, we send them off ourselves.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.841]  It's not very expensive, a couple hundred bucks to get each filter tested.
[01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.342]  We found the actual best and carry it.
[01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:03.303]  ProPure G2.
[01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.984]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:02:04.984 --> 01:02:06.705]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[01:02:06.705 --> 01:02:11.447]  And I don't mean superstitious about walking under ladders and things like that.
[01:02:11.447 --> 01:02:13.468]  Though I don't like it when a black cat runs out in front of me.
[01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:14.329]  Okay, I am superstitious.
[01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:15.389]  I'm not calling wood and all sorts of stuff.
[01:02:15.389 --> 01:02:17.190]  But I'm not super bad.
[01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:18.491]  I'm not a superstitious person, but I am.
[01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:18.911]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:22.251]  But let me tell you, it's called God-fearing.
[01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:24.016]  I don't do things to people...
[01:02:26.252 --> 01:02:37.102]  Even when I've worked in restaurants and stuff back in college, and somebody was really rude and really mean to me, and somebody would say, let's stick a, you know, a roach leg in their food, and I'd be like, no, because I don't want that done to me.
[01:02:37.102 --> 01:02:40.626]  So whatever we sell and promote here, I believe in.
[01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:46.651]  If you hear me endorsing it, the network has its own sponsors, I can't vet them, I'm not saying they're bad, they can't vet mine.
[01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:50.215]  Just if you hear me endorsing it, I have tested it, I believe in it.
[01:02:52.639 --> 01:03:03.743]  We spent over a year, over a year trying to come up with the ultimate brain formula of known things that naturally without getting you like sped up and burnt out would boost you.
[01:03:03.743 --> 01:03:07.504]  I have a bottle of this at home, forgot to take it this morning, took it right before the show.
[01:03:07.504 --> 01:03:09.205]  It hit 20 minutes ago.
[01:03:09.205 --> 01:03:12.646]  It's like a rush of energy, clarity, recall.
[01:03:12.646 --> 01:03:20.208]  And the problem is we only ordered a limited amount of this because it's expensive to manufacture because two of the ingredients are prescription in Europe.
[01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:22.149]  We went over this with Anthony two days ago.
[01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:28.549]  And CJ during the break was saying, oh, I saw you pop that brain force 30 minutes ago.
[01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:29.430]  I can see it's hitting.
[01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:37.837]  Because it's amazing, and it will sell out by Monday, so it's the best of times, worst of times.
[01:03:37.837 --> 01:03:39.237]  People are really excited about this.
[01:03:39.237 --> 01:03:43.138]  Once you try it, I know that it's going to really help fund our operation.
[01:03:43.138 --> 01:03:44.478]  Praise God.
[01:03:44.478 --> 01:03:47.439]  CJ, you guys in there are bouncing off the walls.
[01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:49.100]  You've tried all the nutraceuticals.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.760]  You say some positive things, but you guys are really excited about this.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.361]  What has been your experience with BrainForce?
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.581]  Well, I stole one of your pills yesterday.
[01:03:56.581 --> 01:04:04.008]  I didn't do it today, so you don't run out, but it's by far the most effective feeling after taking any of the supplements.
[01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:14.257]  DNA Force gives you some tingle in your nerves as the nerves are basically regenerating, which is awesome, but Secret 12 basically gives you more fuel to expend energy.
[01:04:16.122 --> 01:04:25.086]  I'm not a morning person, but I can take one and I'm clear, I've got energy, I don't feel like I've taken any supplement.
[01:04:25.086 --> 01:04:27.688]  It just happens to wake me up.
[01:04:27.688 --> 01:04:29.148]  It's incredible.
[01:04:29.148 --> 01:04:36.252]  Have you ever, because I just want you to repeat what you said yesterday, have you ever used any type of brain booster that came near this?
[01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:36.352]  No.
[01:04:37.598 --> 01:04:43.986]  Taking ginseng, taking ginkgo, and you don't notice any difference.
[01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:45.188]  This is noticeable.
[01:04:45.188 --> 01:04:48.992]  Yeah, well, I mean, I've tried stuff and you just get a speed feeling off of it, which I don't like.
[01:04:48.992 --> 01:04:50.134]  This is clear.
[01:04:50.134 --> 01:04:51.335]  This is calm.
[01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:53.137]  This is almost euphoric.
[01:04:53.137 --> 01:04:55.000]  This is sickeningly good.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.341]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:05:00.037 --> 01:05:07.842]  Today's example of terror porn is brought to you by the FBI, whose agents are telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations.
[01:05:07.842 --> 01:05:08.903]  And you know what that means?
[01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:15.547]  That means if you're an FBI informant, or a friend of an FBI informant, you better not go anywhere this weekend because you're probably going to be set up.
[01:05:15.547 --> 01:05:16.628]  Why do I say that?
[01:05:16.628 --> 01:05:20.971]  Back in 2012, the New York Times published an article, Terrorist Plots Hatched by the FBI.
[01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:27.155]  Which details how FBI informants were recruiting people for terror plots, which were then busted by the FBI.
[01:05:27.155 --> 01:05:33.340]  And remember, back in February, an FBI official said, we need to keep fear alive to justify terror budget.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:42.227]  The quote is from a documentary entitled The Newburgh Stink, which tells how the Feds convinced four poverty-stricken New York men to become involved in an informant-led terror plot.
[01:05:42.227 --> 01:05:47.691]  The paid FBI informant is alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million dollars to execute an attack.
[01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:52.193]  We'll be talking about this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[01:05:52.193 --> 01:05:59.297]  So celebrate the 4th of July, but not if you're an FBI informant.
[01:05:59.297 --> 01:06:01.918]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:01.918 --> 01:06:03.399]  Check it out today.
[01:06:03.399 --> 01:06:11.804]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:17.767]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[01:06:17.827 --> 01:06:18.288]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:40.250]  We're good.
[01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:00.050]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:00.610]  Good, brother.
[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.571]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:07:02.571 --> 01:07:04.272]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:08.293]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:07:08.293 --> 01:07:09.073]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:13.354]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:07:13.354 --> 01:07:21.317]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:21.517 --> 01:07:24.761]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:26.303]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:29.246]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:30.988]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:07:30.988 --> 01:07:36.354]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:07:36.394 --> 01:07:37.695]  We're good to go.
[01:08:02.256 --> 01:08:13.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.486 --> 01:08:25.498]  Joining us from his television studios in the great state of Texas, former congressman, medical doctor, veteran, Ron Paul joins us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:08:27.105 --> 01:08:32.310]  Instituteforpeaceandprosperity.org is his powerful think tank website.
[01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:36.333]  He of course does his daily TV and radio show vignettes.
[01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:39.616]  And he's got a new book coming out, Swords into Plowshares.
[01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:42.759]  We'll obviously have him on as soon as that comes out.
[01:08:42.759 --> 01:08:49.085]  But more active, probably more effective now than anybody else in the world fighting collectivism.
[01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:57.669]  He'll go down in history undoubtedly as greater in the fight for liberty than even an Alexander Schultz and a modern Thomas Jefferson.
[01:08:57.669 --> 01:09:06.181]  And he's a humble man and he won't say those things about himself and even the movement won't say those things because libertarians are humble.
[01:09:06.181 --> 01:09:07.143]  Conservatives are humble.
[01:09:07.563 --> 01:09:08.744]  Patriots are humble.
[01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:23.110]  But we have to celebrate our leaders and celebrate that he was Dr. No 20-something years ago, never won anything, never got co-sponsors, and then by the time he left Congress, much of the Tea Party movement had adopted his Americana ideas.
[01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:25.631]  That said, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:26.952]  I want to cover the waterfront
[01:09:28.778 --> 01:09:38.143]  First off, a few weeks ago you put out an alert saying that get ready for serious crises in the stock market.
[01:09:38.143 --> 01:09:41.265]  You talked about problems in the bond market.
[01:09:41.265 --> 01:09:43.386]  You said a day of reckoning was coming.
[01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:45.187]  We're getting closer to the big event.
[01:09:45.187 --> 01:09:56.313]  In your own words, being a Von Mise Institute fellow, being on the banking committee, understanding the inside baseball, is the day of judgment for the Federal Reserve and other private central banks coming?
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.103]  Yeah, I think for that not to come would be a surprise to me.
[01:10:04.103 --> 01:10:06.124]  And you've been involved in this a long time.
[01:10:06.124 --> 01:10:09.687]  I mean, it wasn't like you didn't know what was happening with the housing bubble.
[01:10:09.687 --> 01:10:12.048]  And we had the NASDAQ bubble.
[01:10:12.048 --> 01:10:14.109]  And now we have other bubbles.
[01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:15.750]  We still have another stock market bubble.
[01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.592]  And there's another housing bubble going on.
[01:10:17.592 --> 01:10:19.813]  But the big bubble, I think, is in the bond bubble.
[01:10:19.813 --> 01:10:24.236]  It's been going on for 35 years, taking interest rates from 21% down to actually negative.
[01:10:26.457 --> 01:10:28.019]  And they've been getting away with it.
[01:10:28.019 --> 01:10:30.082]  So this means distortion.
[01:10:30.082 --> 01:10:34.868]  Not only is there money involved, but it distorted all the investment over these periods of time.
[01:10:34.868 --> 01:10:37.892]  And the biggest distortion that it encourages is debt.
[01:10:37.892 --> 01:10:41.196]  It encourages debt for a lot of people, but in particular, government.
[01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:50.284]  And as long as our government is able to print the reserve currency, it's going to limp along, even though our economy is limping along.
[01:10:50.284 --> 01:10:52.365]  But that will come to an end.
[01:10:52.365 --> 01:10:56.229]  And right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming apart.
[01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:59.231]  I mean, we look at Detroit as an example.
[01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:00.953]  We see what's happening in Greece.
[01:11:00.953 --> 01:11:07.799]  They're worrying about what's going to happen, you know, after Greece is recognized as actually totally bankrupt.
[01:11:07.799 --> 01:11:08.940]  There'll be other countries.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.542]  This distortion has been going on for so long.
[01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:19.329]  Most people think that when governments print money, that the only thing that happens is that prices go up as a consequence of inflation.
[01:11:19.329 --> 01:11:23.493]  And a lot of that is true and it's a serious problem and destroys the middle class and the poor.
[01:11:24.634 --> 01:11:32.596]  To me, the bigger distortion is the lack of pricing for money and causing people to do dumb things.
[01:11:32.596 --> 01:11:36.597]  And that's why they overbuild and overinvest and governments overspend.
[01:11:36.597 --> 01:11:44.699]  And then you have the Keynesians still in charge that says that the solution for this is just to spend more money and print more money.
[01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:45.939]  And that's coming to an end.
[01:11:45.939 --> 01:11:48.260]  The day of reckoning is at hand.
[01:11:51.736 --> 01:11:56.579]  Undoubtedly, the Day of Reckoning came a long time ago for Greece and areas of Africa and Latin America.
[01:11:56.579 --> 01:12:09.145]  There seems to be this arrogant idea that it can't ever happen here, but if you look at the real numbers, 0.2 growth, that's what the Cook numbers, for most Americans we've been in a very long recession.
[01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:26.180]  Yes, and you know, even the figures that came out today on the employment, you know, unemployment down to 5.3%, not recognizing or admitting, you know, that 646,000 dropped out of the workforce.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:32.184]  And we have more people, 93 million people unemployed and out of the workforce.
[01:12:32.184 --> 01:12:35.807]  And that if you look at full-time jobs, it's a disaster.
[01:12:36.187 --> 01:12:45.269]  Even though they claim there were a lot of new jobs, but they were part-time jobs, so there's a few new jobs, and then they fudge the unemployment figures, but it's all, you know, in the system.
[01:12:45.269 --> 01:12:55.631]  And even the people who know these are fudge figures still play along because they know that the majority will play along, and they think there's another buck to be made, you know, in trading.
[01:12:55.631 --> 01:13:01.472]  But the markets are more powerful than the Fed and in governments, and markets will rule.
[01:13:02.152 --> 01:13:07.256]  A lot of people would always say, you know, keep an eye on the Fed on what they're doing.
[01:13:07.256 --> 01:13:12.340]  But the Fed needs to keep an eye on the market because the market eventually will take over.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.823]  Just like the market finally took over when they claimed that the dollar was worth $35.
[01:13:19.205 --> 01:13:21.507]  An ounce, and that was not true.
[01:13:21.507 --> 01:13:35.120]  So the governments will lie to us, they'll get away with it for a long time, there will be an illusion and a false trust, and we will benefit tremendously because we have a military might, and because we have this privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:45.725]  But you know, the obligations that we have, the unfunded obligations over $2 trillion, you know, $200 trillion, that is not going to be paid.
[01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:51.487]  And the only argument that goes on with these countries like in Greece and others, is who's going to get stuck?
[01:13:51.487 --> 01:13:55.569]  And the bankers are worried they're going to get stuck, and that's what they argue about.
[01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:59.971]  But the debt will not be paid, and we cannot pay our debt.
[01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:01.632]  It's just a matter of time.
[01:14:01.632 --> 01:14:03.753]  But people say, well, tell me when, tell me when.
[01:14:04.113 --> 01:14:27.629]  Well, nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event, but you can tell when the foundation has eroded, and the foundation, not only of our economic system, but the world financial system, like no other time in history, has been eroded, and there's going to be serious problems because there will have to be a correction of this, and you can't correct it with more spending and more debt, which is what they're trying to do.
[01:14:29.178 --> 01:14:36.121]  And then we add the Puerto Rico situation, then we've got thousands of counties that are on the edge or already bankrupt.
[01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:41.323]  We've got multiple states that fiscally are worse off than Greece.
[01:14:41.323 --> 01:14:41.984]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:14:41.984 --> 01:14:44.865]  really is on the same death path as Greece.
[01:14:44.865 --> 01:14:47.586]  And my concern is the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[01:14:47.586 --> 01:14:48.987]  It seems like this bubble is so
[01:14:50.107 --> 01:14:55.548]  Mega-massive that when it does implode, and we're so non-self-sufficient.
[01:14:55.548 --> 01:15:02.090]  Back when your parents, and I guess you as a young man, went through the Great Depression, people were much more resilient.
[01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:05.011]  Now people are not agrarian.
[01:15:05.011 --> 01:15:08.332]  We were 90% rural, 10% urban.
[01:15:08.332 --> 01:15:11.453]  Now we're 90% urban, 10% rural.
[01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:16.674]  If we have a real depression in this country, I just absolutely fear for my children.
[01:15:19.074 --> 01:15:24.739]  There's reason to be fearful because the work ethic is not with us at all.
[01:15:24.739 --> 01:15:27.261]  People believe that they are owed a living.
[01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:38.992]  People in Greece, you sympathize with them to a degree because the banks have ripped off the system for so long, but that doesn't eliminate the responsibility of the individuals who have benefited from this.
[01:15:39.192 --> 01:15:44.339]  Free money, whether it's student aid or houses and these sort of things.
[01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:49.968]  It's been there for a long time and right now there's many people in Greece who are really determined.
[01:15:49.968 --> 01:15:51.650]  They hate this austerity thing.
[01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:53.593]  Of course, I can't stand the idea that...
[01:15:54.454 --> 01:15:57.855]  The IMF is running the show, or the European Union is running the show.
[01:15:57.855 --> 01:16:00.116]  It should be liquidated.
[01:16:00.116 --> 01:16:04.257]  But they're retiring at the age of 56 at full benefits.
[01:16:04.257 --> 01:16:06.098]  And we have that same problem here.
[01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:08.619]  This is what brought Detroit down.
[01:16:08.619 --> 01:16:11.580]  And I imagine every state has a problem.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.421]  Unemployment is a big problem, but it's the retirement funds.
[01:16:15.421 --> 01:16:22.524]  In our retirement system, our social security system is not solvent, nor is the medical care system.
[01:16:22.984 --> 01:16:23.905]  It sounds great.
[01:16:23.905 --> 01:16:25.086]  We're going to take care of you.
[01:16:25.086 --> 01:16:27.087]  It's an affordable care system.
[01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:33.672]  Well, you know, the medical system we're having shoved down our throats is an unaffordable care system.
[01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:39.436]  But the market will eventually rule, and people will have to face up to their predicament.
[01:16:39.436 --> 01:16:46.361]  And right now, people are getting a little more nervous about the fact, you mean those poor people in Greece, they went along with it.
[01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:54.883]  And now all they want to do is get a hundred bucks out a month to live on, and the government has, you know, capital controls, how much money you can take out.
[01:16:54.883 --> 01:16:57.204]  That has never worked in the past.
[01:16:57.204 --> 01:17:09.067]  It just causes the next country to try to beat the system, so there'll be other countries, including this country, people will try to get out of the system and maybe get their money out of the banks.
[01:17:09.067 --> 01:17:11.228]  Well, for me, that's what really shows
[01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:23.738]  Us that we're getting close to the big event that you've been warning about coming closer is that all over the West, elites are hoarding cash, holding gold, trying to restrict the public from doing it.
[01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:32.745]  The TSA announced next year if the states don't have real ID, federally approved IDs, you won't be able to fly an internal passport.
[01:17:32.745 --> 01:17:37.850]  We now have, speaking of medical tyranny, forced inoculations bill signed in California
[01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:42.636]  We've got the Supreme Court now legislating from the bench, clearly.
[01:17:42.636 --> 01:17:46.001]  It seems like the bottom is falling out.
[01:17:46.001 --> 01:17:47.563]  A, do you agree with that?
[01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:49.606]  And then B, where does it go from here?
[01:17:53.308 --> 01:18:11.272]  Well, yes, the bottom is falling out, and this is the big problem, because it's unsustainable, and eventually the people will have to, you know, recognize this, and something else has to change.
[01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:21.354]  The system is not viable, but there's always this willingness to try to prop it up, like we did in 2008 and 2009, we propped it up.
[01:18:21.914 --> 01:18:24.236]  But the debt is illiquid.
[01:18:24.236 --> 01:18:25.677]  It's not worth anything.
[01:18:25.677 --> 01:18:28.219]  The sooner you liquidate the debt, the better.
[01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:31.241]  You cannot preserve the debt.
[01:18:31.241 --> 01:18:40.828]  My argument is, and you alluded to this, is the fact that, you know, this is big problems for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of wealth and even some wealthy people are going to lose out.
[01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:50.331]  But everybody has to adjust to the fact that there will be a change, and there will be a liquidation, and there will be a living beneath our means.
[01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:53.992]  We've lived way beyond our means, but it's what we do about it.
[01:18:53.992 --> 01:18:56.873]  If we keep doing the wrong things, it'll last too long.
[01:18:56.873 --> 01:19:01.414]  This is already, this recession, which is really a depression, is lasting too long.
[01:19:01.894 --> 01:19:08.099]  So if we do this, what we have to preserve is our liberty.
[01:19:08.099 --> 01:19:19.108]  Because if we do, if we eliminate all our wealth and have our liberties, where you just eliminate all those things you just listed here and what our government is going to do, we would be back on our feet rather shortly.
[01:19:19.108 --> 01:19:20.709]  But that's where the real crisis is.
[01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:35.221]  If we don't build our strength on those individuals who know and understand what liberty is all about, we're going to lose our wealth, we're going to further lose our liberty, and all that is going to be available is some guy walking in with a white horse and saying, I'm in charge now.
[01:19:35.221 --> 01:19:39.885]  If you listen to what I'm going to do, I will deliver you from all the tragedy that exists.
[01:19:39.885 --> 01:19:42.427]  And it's not a man on a white horse that's going to save us.
[01:19:42.427 --> 01:19:47.572]  It's somebody who understands and gets that 8 or 9 percent that's necessary to lead us
[01:19:48.292 --> 01:19:51.375]  Uh, in the ways of, uh, a more free society.
[01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:52.475]  Because that's what counts.
[01:19:52.475 --> 01:19:57.519]  So people shouldn't be discouraged and say, oh, this is overwhelming, how are you going to get 51% to give up their benefits?
[01:19:57.519 --> 01:19:59.040]  No, you're not going to.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:11.890]  But you could get more people in leadership positions, and that's where I think we're making some progress, but we have a tough job ahead because we have to convince the majority of people that they cannot find their answers in more government.
[01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:15.163]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[01:20:15.163 --> 01:20:17.265]  Instituteforpeaceandprosperity.org.
[01:20:17.265 --> 01:20:19.107]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:20:19.107 --> 01:20:21.169]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:25.933]  Looking at this, I've brought up the whole issue and you brought up the issue of the financial crisis being front and center.
[01:20:25.933 --> 01:20:35.562]  But as you mentioned, historically, totalitarianism comes out of a collapse and then the countries never emerge out of their hellish existence.
[01:20:36.443 --> 01:20:41.245]  If we have some of our liberties intact, we can quickly bounce back.
[01:20:41.245 --> 01:20:52.409]  But also war follows that, and we have just extreme examples of funding radicals against Syria, funding radicals against Russia in Crimea, really aggressive
[01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:56.870]  Megalomaniacal, reckless actions by the governing elite.
[01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:58.531]  You've been up in Congress for many years.
[01:20:58.531 --> 01:20:59.991]  You serve the military.
[01:20:59.991 --> 01:21:05.133]  Is it just that we know more about it now, so it seems like the government's more out of control?
[01:21:05.133 --> 01:21:06.694]  Or is the government more out of control?
[01:21:06.694 --> 01:21:12.396]  Because it seems like on every front they're just power grabbing as fast as they can.
[01:21:12.396 --> 01:21:14.736]  Texas is grabbing its gold from the Federal Reserve.
[01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.157]  The Germans want it back.
[01:21:16.157 --> 01:21:19.578]  I mean, if you look at what's going on, it looks like they're getting ready for something big.
[01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:23.760]  Yeah, they are.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.002]  And I think the worse things get, the more of this you'll see.
[01:21:28.002 --> 01:21:30.584]  Because they won't admit the problem.
[01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:37.147]  They won't admit that they don't have enough wealth and money to bribe everybody and give them benefits.
[01:21:37.147 --> 01:21:39.469]  And that's when it's coming to an end.
[01:21:39.469 --> 01:21:41.830]  And right now we are facing that.
[01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:46.613]  And I think it is obviously going to be very, very serious.
[01:21:46.613 --> 01:21:50.695]  The governments will do what is necessary to maintain their control.
[01:21:51.155 --> 01:21:52.896]  But it can come out better.
[01:21:52.896 --> 01:21:56.078]  I know what you're talking about, how so often this leads to war.
[01:21:56.078 --> 01:22:00.581]  As a matter of fact, you know, many people say, ah, thank goodness for FDR.
[01:22:00.581 --> 01:22:03.863]  He had this World War II and got us out of the Depression.
[01:22:03.863 --> 01:22:05.884]  What nonsense is that?
[01:22:05.884 --> 01:22:16.190]  But we had a revolution, and it's one of the rare things in history where the people who were involved in the revolution to beat the authoritarians actually ended up with more liberty.
[01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:26.476]  But if you look at, you know, what happened after World War I and the Depression and Hitler coming in charge and opening up the doors to communism.
[01:22:26.476 --> 01:22:30.998]  But the 20th century has proved that fascism and communism, you know, has failed.
[01:22:30.998 --> 01:22:37.562]  I think it's more apparent to the world that communism of the Stalin type has failed and nobody's advocating that.
[01:22:37.562 --> 01:22:41.805]  But I'm frightened by the people who are carelessly drifting into this
[01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:48.370]  Well, we need big government, big drug companies, big medicine, everybody in partnerships with the government.
[01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:54.836]  And that is where our biggest problem is and too many people are going along with this because you find that in both political parties.
[01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.117]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:56.117 --> 01:23:06.845]  In closing, looking at election 2016, Rand Paul in all the early polls and at CPAC year after year and in New Hampshire and other areas,
[01:23:07.646 --> 01:23:19.590]  Was leading, but by ignoring him and then the guy behind him, Ted Cruz, they have now basically in new polls focused on Jeb and Trump.
[01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:28.292]  And I think Trump clearly will get a bunch of more libertarian support and then drag it away from other candidates and then drop out for Jeb.
[01:23:28.292 --> 01:23:31.253]  And then Hillary's campaign head was at Bilderberg.
[01:23:32.194 --> 01:23:34.055]  In Austria this year, we were there covering it.
[01:23:34.055 --> 01:23:36.518]  No one else from other candidates.
[01:23:36.518 --> 01:23:40.922]  So it looks like she's the one that they're pushing for.
[01:23:40.922 --> 01:23:51.992]  Is there any way you see in this upcoming election to reach out to the public and explain to them how they're being conned so that we can get a Senator Rand Paul?
[01:23:51.992 --> 01:23:54.274]  And I know he's your son, but Ted Cruz supported
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.144]  TPP, and I'm really upset with him about that.
[01:23:58.144 --> 01:24:04.671]  And your son, of course, valiantly didn't, and so they're doubling down on money against him, both Republicans and Democrats.
[01:24:04.671 --> 01:24:12.380]  I know you don't want to get involved in the election, you want to stay neutral on that, but just as an American, watching another sickening spectacle.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.782]  I mean, imagine President Hillary.
[01:24:16.533 --> 01:24:29.159]  Well, it's going to be a disaster, and they're pretty much in charge, and Rand is the alternative to the whole system, because he's the only one that's suggesting that we should have a less militaristic foreign policy.
[01:24:29.159 --> 01:24:38.383]  He's been on the right side of challenging the Federal Reserve System, and he's been good on civil liberties, but the establishment is very, very powerful.
[01:24:38.863 --> 01:24:41.286]  But, uh, and we have to recognize that.
[01:24:41.286 --> 01:24:50.855]  But eventually, though, the only thing that really counts is reaching out and changing people's hearts and minds, and then the political system will reflect those changes.
[01:24:50.855 --> 01:24:57.322]  Right now, there are too many Americans who either don't care, don't pay attention, or think these wars are wonderful.
[01:24:57.802 --> 01:25:06.026]  You mentioned the wars that are going on, and that contributes tremendously to our bankruptcy and tremendously to building enemies around the world.
[01:25:06.026 --> 01:25:12.249]  And when we get in worse financial shape, believe me, they're not going to be bashful about coming back at us.
[01:25:12.249 --> 01:25:21.033]  So right now, with all the candidates except Rand, they're only going to make things much worse as far as I'm concerned.
[01:25:21.698 --> 01:25:29.530]  It must be amazing after all your hard work and success promoting Liberty to see your son being the only person out of a field of like 11 candidates.
[01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:35.287]  Who is being called radical just because 50 years ago he'd be called middle-of-the-road.
[01:25:35.287 --> 01:25:41.531]  He's just promoting basic, sane, Americana ideas and I hope and pray that we can get him the nomination.
[01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:45.815]  But regardless, running, he'll help educate people just like you did.
[01:25:45.815 --> 01:25:48.957]  Tens of millions of the young people are waking up as well.
[01:25:48.957 --> 01:25:55.802]  Former Congressman Ron Paul, congratulations on your successful TV and radio shows and great job your crew down there.
[01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:56.683]  Thank you for all your time.
[01:25:58.797 --> 01:25:59.898]  Thank you, good to be with you.
[01:25:59.898 --> 01:26:01.199]  Have a great fourth.
[01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:07.863]  Wow, well what a great present to the InfoWars audience to have Ron Paul, his first live video interview.
[01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:11.345]  He's been on with us since 1996, hundreds of times.
[01:26:11.345 --> 01:26:16.168]  First time he's been on with us live via video from his amazing studios.
[01:26:16.168 --> 01:26:17.949]  So just so exciting to have him on.
[01:26:17.949 --> 01:26:23.453]  Again, I don't get giddy when I meet professional football players or basketball players or even movie stars.
[01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:29.736]  I know some of the biggest movie stars out there, and it's interesting, it's fun, especially if you're a fan of them.
[01:26:29.736 --> 01:26:34.798]  But, Ron Paul, I mean, that's founding father material right there.
[01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:37.319]  That's the real deal.
[01:26:37.319 --> 01:26:41.021]  Just a decent, honorable person.
[01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:42.742]  Look how good he looks at almost 80.
[01:26:42.742 --> 01:26:48.344]  If you're watching via the free feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:26:48.344 --> 01:26:51.246]  I mean, just a blessed man with a whole bunch of grandkids and
[01:26:51.889 --> 01:26:59.415]  You know, standing up, working harder now than he ever did, his mind sharper than ever.
[01:26:59.415 --> 01:27:05.541]  And then you compare that to the slobs at the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership that are selling this country out.
[01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:12.126]  And Ron Paul speaks every week to packed halls of sometimes 20,000 young people, on average about 5,000.
[01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:15.709]  I mean, he's come to Austin and spoke outside when 20,000 people show up.
[01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:22.573]  That's the antidote to the young people that don't know what planet they're on.
[01:27:22.573 --> 01:27:24.094]  And I want to play again this clip.
[01:27:24.094 --> 01:27:26.515]  Mark Dice is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:27:26.515 --> 01:27:30.157]  Citizens don't know what country we seceded from in 1776.
[01:27:30.157 --> 01:27:32.278]  Here it is.
[01:27:32.278 --> 01:27:34.880]  What are we celebrating on the 4th of July?
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.781]  Our independence.
[01:27:36.781 --> 01:27:38.882]  A little more specific.
[01:27:38.882 --> 01:27:41.863]  It's the day that we overtook the South.
[01:27:41.863 --> 01:27:42.624]  And it's the day that
[01:27:43.942 --> 01:27:44.963]  It's our independence.
[01:27:44.963 --> 01:27:45.963]  That's why we have the flag.
[01:27:45.963 --> 01:27:46.664]  From the South.
[01:27:46.664 --> 01:27:47.865]  From the South, exactly.
[01:27:47.865 --> 01:27:49.666]  So it was the victor of the Civil War?
[01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:50.746]  Yes.
[01:27:50.746 --> 01:27:51.727]  Fourth of July?
[01:27:51.727 --> 01:27:54.389]  Yes.
[01:27:54.389 --> 01:27:58.331]  The Declaration of Independence was signed by who?
[01:27:58.331 --> 01:28:02.474]  I don't know.
[01:28:02.474 --> 01:28:03.535]  That's good.
[01:28:03.535 --> 01:28:04.996]  Fast forward to the last guy.
[01:28:06.257 --> 01:28:13.999]  They talked to an Italian guy, he didn't look like a professor, he's just a hip guy, and he goes, your revolution against Britain, against the colonials.
[01:28:13.999 --> 01:28:15.639]  We all love this.
[01:28:15.639 --> 01:28:17.620]  The world loved it!
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.720]  Nobody had kicked the British's butt.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.581]  They'd beaten everybody.
[01:28:22.581 --> 01:28:26.082]  We defeated them.
[01:28:26.082 --> 01:28:30.703]  Because it basically was, the colonies were British and German and basically Dutch folks.
[01:28:31.894 --> 01:28:32.835]  And Irish and others.
[01:28:32.835 --> 01:28:38.858]  But the point was, is that they'd been in a bunch of wars, and then the British tried to enslave everybody, and they said, no way.
[01:28:38.858 --> 01:28:43.521]  And the whole world marveled at that, and now Americans don't know why you have the fourth.
[01:28:43.521 --> 01:28:45.643]  Talk about dummies!
[01:28:45.643 --> 01:28:49.605]  But that's a group, and those are the Democrats, and that's who they've got on their side.
[01:28:49.605 --> 01:28:53.147]  I guarantee every one of those idiots is a hardcore Obama supporter.
[01:28:53.147 --> 01:28:54.688]  They just go with whatever's trendy.
[01:28:54.688 --> 01:28:55.709]  They love death panels.
[01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:57.150]  They love forced abortion.
[01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:58.651]  They love having their prices increased.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:05.824]  When Obama says 2 plus 2 equals 5, he's talking to his morons, his brain-dead zombies.
[01:29:05.824 --> 01:29:06.664]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:29:30.373 --> 01:29:32.454]  Don't laugh.
[01:29:32.454 --> 01:29:35.314]  Don't laugh.
[01:29:35.314 --> 01:29:37.395]  Because this is what they do to people in the public schools.
[01:29:37.395 --> 01:29:38.475]  They don't let the teachers teach.
[01:29:38.475 --> 01:29:39.555]  Don't blame them.
[01:29:39.555 --> 01:29:40.856]  This is what they teach.
[01:29:40.856 --> 01:29:49.378]  This is what they teach, is ignorance.
[01:29:49.378 --> 01:29:50.699]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.699 --> 01:29:53.219]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.219 --> 01:29:55.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:04.852]  Have you ever come across someone on the internet that you suspected was a paid government troll?
[01:30:04.852 --> 01:30:08.036]  Well, there's a very good chance that you were not imagining things.
[01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:18.870]  Thanks to Edward Snowden, we now have solid proof that paid government trolls are using psychology-based influence techniques on social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:29.577]  Some of these techniques include uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote distrust, fake online resources such as magazines and books to provide inaccurate information.
[01:30:29.577 --> 01:30:34.020]  They also set up Facebook groups that encourage and monitor discussion on a topic.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:47.209]  They can also set up fake trade sites that can take a person's money and personal information, as well as send those customers degraded or spoofed products, like sending computers overseas that are already equipped with a backdoor for the NSA.
[01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:51.894]  All of this is just more proof that it's actually the government engaging in cybercrime.
[01:30:51.894 --> 01:30:56.720]  Of course, it's all an effort to ramp up a non-existent threat to take our freedoms.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.243]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:01.145]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:01.145 --> 01:31:06.128]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:08.750]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:15.835]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:15.835 --> 01:31:18.657]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:18.817 --> 01:31:21.778]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:21.778 --> 01:31:23.798]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:23.798 --> 01:31:26.759]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:26.759 --> 01:31:32.441]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:32.441 --> 01:31:35.962]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:31:35.962 --> 01:31:38.943]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:31:38.943 --> 01:31:43.304]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:46.366]  For every modern, independently minded household.
[01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:49.589]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[01:31:49.589 --> 01:31:56.014]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system.
[01:31:56.014 --> 01:31:56.575]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.659 --> 01:32:16.307]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:32:16.307 --> 01:32:19.829]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:32:20.169 --> 01:32:24.231]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:24.231 --> 01:32:25.771]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:25.771 --> 01:32:29.072]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:32:29.072 --> 01:32:34.194]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:34.194 --> 01:32:38.136]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:40.517]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:40.517 --> 01:32:44.918]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:32:44.918 --> 01:32:48.300]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.040]  Whatever you do,
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.646]  Get your Head Down firearm today.
[01:32:52.646 --> 01:32:57.314]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:57.314 --> 01:32:58.256]  HDFirearms.com
[01:33:27.654 --> 01:33:29.455]  We've been out on the road for 40 days.
[01:33:29.455 --> 01:33:32.457]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:33:32.457 --> 01:33:33.137]  In the heart.
[01:33:33.137 --> 01:33:34.698]  In the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:34.698 --> 01:33:35.299]  Crank it up!
[01:33:35.299 --> 01:33:38.821]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.821 --> 01:33:46.566]  18 years since we've run that line.
[01:33:46.566 --> 01:33:49.968]  We take you now to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:33:49.968 --> 01:33:52.269]  In the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:00.002]  Because we knew Texas would be the center of the resistance.
[01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:02.623]  We got Ron Paul.
[01:34:02.623 --> 01:34:07.984]  We've got Governor Abbott, who we know is fully aware of the New World Order and against it.
[01:34:07.984 --> 01:34:09.145]  We've got the Liberty Movement.
[01:34:09.145 --> 01:34:13.666]  We've got the gold being taken back from the Federal Reserve by Texas.
[01:34:13.666 --> 01:34:16.867]  We've got the state waking up, and it's happening all over the country as well.
[01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:26.220]  And make no mistake, that's why the globalist listed Texas as hostile during Jade Helm was to test the waters and see what the public would do.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:30.105]  All an elaborate criminal psyop.
[01:34:30.105 --> 01:34:33.549]  But it's not going to work.
[01:34:33.549 --> 01:34:36.732]  Briefly, when we come out with a new product, we do a limited run.
[01:34:38.956 --> 01:34:46.419]  Because obviously we've come up with products before where it sits there on the shelf for five, six months, and the way we work is we don't have a bunch of extra capital.
[01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:51.461]  As we sell t-shirts, books, videos, we never know what's going to be really hot.
[01:34:51.461 --> 01:35:00.344]  When we have a good idea, and then we get a limited supply, and then try to get a bigger order in the next time.
[01:35:00.344 --> 01:35:03.225]  And then sometimes it sells, sometimes it doesn't.
[01:35:03.225 --> 01:35:06.346]  There's no judging the public's taste, but brain force
[01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:17.308]  Worked so good a few months ago when we got in the final formula that I've been taking it quietly just one pill a day or I bounce off the walls.
[01:35:17.308 --> 01:35:23.513]  It's got two different formulations in it that are prescription in Europe, not prescription here yet.
[01:35:23.513 --> 01:35:31.019]  We've got a video at InfoWarsLife.com in the brain force section where we break it all down and read over the ingredients and tell you what they do.
[01:35:33.052 --> 01:35:49.905]  And it's got all the classic stuff known to cleanly give your brain what it needs, but it's got these other high-tech things, and it's all on record as safe, but still, if you want to talk to your healthcare provider... I just wanted to come on and say brain health on air, and that I really like it.
[01:35:49.905 --> 01:35:53.928]  And then I knew once people tried it, they'd love it, and be repeat customers and fund our operation.
[01:35:53.928 --> 01:35:56.050]  A win-win-win, 360 win.
[01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:59.833]  But then, the crew, unbeknownst to me, I wondered why this bottle
[01:36:00.762 --> 01:36:02.603]  It wakes you up without getting jitters.
[01:36:02.603 --> 01:36:06.645]  I noticed myself talking faster because I didn't have to think.
[01:36:06.645 --> 01:36:09.107]  I didn't have to recall things because that part of my brain was awake.
[01:36:31.317 --> 01:36:32.518]  It's excellent.
[01:36:32.518 --> 01:36:38.982]  Like I said, the most effective product, first off, that I've witnessed, you come out with.
[01:36:38.982 --> 01:36:44.965]  And you described, you know, the Methicobalamin Vitamin B12, Secret 12, as giving you a little bit of pep, feeling good.
[01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:52.370]  Well, it makes my energy last longer because it's what your body needs in order to metabolize calories.
[01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:54.691]  What are the other products done for you and then versus this?
[01:36:57.933 --> 01:37:00.615]  Really helped me get better skin health.
[01:37:00.615 --> 01:37:10.020]  I didn't have as many acne breakouts, which even as an adult male, you still get if you have a certain skin type.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:15.644]  So I noticed that, I noticed... Yeah, it makes your hair grow faster for me, better fingernails, stuff like that.
[01:37:15.644 --> 01:37:24.008]  I took out some greys, actually let hair get some more color as I'm aging, but... And that's usually from the deficiency, absolutely.
[01:37:24.008 --> 01:37:24.549]  Oxy powder.
[01:37:25.774 --> 01:37:27.355]  Obviously effective.
[01:37:27.355 --> 01:37:28.215]  Big time.
[01:37:28.215 --> 01:37:34.877]  But this is, you feel good, but you don't feel like you're on any kind of medication or drug.
[01:37:34.877 --> 01:37:45.641]  Yeah, I've never been able to take the energy drinks and I've never been able to take even the stuff that I've got at GNC because it makes me irritable or afterwards I crash the next day.
[01:37:45.641 --> 01:37:46.642]  If I forget to take this,
[01:37:47.981 --> 01:37:50.122]  Which I constantly forget to take my vitamins and stuff.
[01:37:50.122 --> 01:37:51.563]  I'm getting better about it.
[01:37:51.563 --> 01:37:54.644]  I don't feel bad the next day.
[01:37:54.644 --> 01:37:56.865]  That's what is amazing about it.
[01:37:56.865 --> 01:38:00.426]  And it's because it doesn't artificially stimulate your brain.
[01:38:00.426 --> 01:38:04.908]  It just gives your brain all these cofactors that are needed together to supercharge it.
[01:38:04.908 --> 01:38:13.152]  This probably is undoubtedly the best nutraceutical neural activator that's natural out there.
[01:38:13.152 --> 01:38:14.332]  Experience it for yourself.
[01:38:14.332 --> 01:38:16.073]  But the problem is,
[01:38:17.498 --> 01:38:26.805]  Limited run, you will see, this is not a gimmick, just like we're sold out of five things right now, and we'll be for like eight weeks with some of them, we're gonna sell out by Monday.
[01:38:26.805 --> 01:38:30.088]  Probably sooner of Brain Force.
[01:38:30.088 --> 01:38:32.650]  I've already told them to hold back some bottles for us.
[01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:34.752]  And it could be four to eight weeks.
[01:38:34.752 --> 01:38:36.553]  They claim four weeks.
[01:38:36.553 --> 01:38:40.516]  We've put in a double order.
[01:38:40.516 --> 01:38:42.398]  But it could be eight weeks till we get more.
[01:38:43.308 --> 01:38:46.410]  By the way, we're going to sell out a Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine.
[01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:47.891]  A limited supply was left.
[01:38:47.891 --> 01:38:52.734]  He thinks he's gotten a hold of the Deep Earth Crystal Source to remake more.
[01:38:52.734 --> 01:38:59.838]  That's going to be sold out, so if you want that, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:59.838 --> 01:39:09.885]  But when we went to one of the biggest organic manufacturers in the country, who it looks like they're going to allow us to have their top chemist on, they were jumping up and down for this formula.
[01:39:10.916 --> 01:39:17.038]  They were jumping up and down and saying, we wish our other customers would do something like this.
[01:39:17.038 --> 01:39:22.879]  And we're talking about... Well, I'm not supposed to say who.
[01:39:22.879 --> 01:39:25.680]  But... Why is it so cheap?
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.101]  Well, I mean, it's organic that they're supplying to some of these big stores.
[01:39:29.101 --> 01:39:30.102]  It is organic.
[01:39:30.102 --> 01:39:32.682]  It's just low levels of it are only one thing.
[01:39:32.682 --> 01:39:36.924]  This all together is just, it's just absolutely awesome.
[01:39:36.924 --> 01:39:38.344]  My problem is I want to eat more of them.
[01:39:41.096 --> 01:39:43.557]  And that could be an issue, so use responsibly.
[01:39:43.557 --> 01:39:48.499]  It's not like coffee, which has some good effects, some bad effects.
[01:39:48.499 --> 01:39:51.240]  I like coffee in the morning, but I drink it at night, it gives me a headache.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.141]  This is simply amazing.
[01:39:53.141 --> 01:39:56.902]  Because I've never been a stimulant guy, this isn't a stimulant, folks.
[01:39:56.902 --> 01:39:59.804]  This just gets your brain firing the way it's supposed to.
[01:39:59.804 --> 01:40:01.344]  Very exciting.
[01:40:01.344 --> 01:40:02.885]  Joe Jennings, did you want to say something?
[01:40:03.385 --> 01:40:12.228]  Sure, I'd like to say, I'd like to say, so I took one pill yesterday morning after breakfast and it had no effect on me.
[01:40:12.228 --> 01:40:15.870]  I was very tired and I was going, well, okay, maybe it doesn't work.
[01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:17.971]  But if you have a slow metabolism like me,
[01:40:18.996 --> 01:40:28.743]  My gosh, I took the second pill after lunch and it just seemed like everybody else was super unproductive.
[01:40:28.743 --> 01:40:33.025]  To my detriment, we did the Nightly News last night and I was a bear.
[01:40:33.025 --> 01:40:36.708]  I was like, why is it taking so long to do everything?
[01:40:36.708 --> 01:40:39.110]  Why are you guys not... What is going on?
[01:40:40.032 --> 01:40:47.456]  And it's amazing because it just, I was completely focused and like, okay let's get it done, let's get it done, let's get it done.
[01:40:47.456 --> 01:40:49.177]  Come on guys, we can do it, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:40:50.273 --> 01:40:52.675]  So, it's truly, truly amazing.
[01:40:52.675 --> 01:41:00.039]  Two of the ingredients, our prescription in Europe, thank you for your testimony, and brain force, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:00.039 --> 01:41:04.702]  And again, I talked to the medical doctors, I talked to the chemists, I talked to the nutritionists.
[01:41:04.702 --> 01:41:11.586]  I will not sell something that's a bunch of herbs that just speeds you up and artificially manipulate the brain.
[01:41:11.586 --> 01:41:14.208]  That's not what these ingredients do.
[01:41:15.902 --> 01:41:21.125]  They chain reaction together for your regular brain metabolism.
[01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:26.168]  It's got the compound in it the brain is made of.
[01:41:26.168 --> 01:41:27.469]  I mean, it's just got stuff like that.
[01:41:28.311 --> 01:41:34.334]  It's basic building blocks for your brain to fire and operate, I guess, the way God intended.
[01:41:34.334 --> 01:41:39.517]  I'm done plugging Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:39.517 --> 01:41:46.781]  And then you mix it with things like Beyond Tangy Tangerine from Infowarshealth.com and other basic building blocks you need that fire with it.
[01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:48.002]  It just gets better and better.
[01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:49.343]  And the more I remember
[01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:59.887]  To take my six or seven vitamins and minerals a day, to take my Beyond Tangy Tangerine, to take my Iodine, get a sore throat, take a little silver, don't go get antibiotics.
[01:41:59.887 --> 01:42:01.488]  I mean, it's just my life gets better and better.
[01:42:01.488 --> 01:42:04.069]  And it's because these things aren't in our environment.
[01:42:04.069 --> 01:42:05.409]  They're supposed to be naturally.
[01:42:05.409 --> 01:42:08.210]  They're not in the modern diet.
[01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:09.191]  I'm Doug Blugge.
[01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:10.351]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:10.351 --> 01:42:12.532]  Now, he hadn't been on in a long time.
[01:42:18.892 --> 01:42:21.961]  And there will be a two-minute infomercial at the end of the interview.
[01:42:21.961 --> 01:42:24.086]  That's not why Ted Anderson is on.
[01:42:24.086 --> 01:42:26.312]  He is the owner of the GCN Radio Network, the parent.
[01:42:28.072 --> 01:42:32.135]  You know, company, working with Midas Resources.
[01:42:32.135 --> 01:42:38.900]  Ted was a sponsor for this show 19 years ago when I was a local radio host as a reputable gold and silver company.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:41.962]  And then he started his own network, Genesis, 18 years ago.
[01:42:41.962 --> 01:42:44.944]  So I've been syndicated in this time slot.
[01:42:44.944 --> 01:42:47.806]  Well, 17 years in this time slot.
[01:42:47.806 --> 01:42:50.108]  One year I was on at night with him when I first got syndicated.
[01:42:50.888 --> 01:42:53.669]  Because they were simulcasting on my local show.
[01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:54.549]  But he joins us.
[01:42:54.549 --> 01:42:58.390]  Ron Paul was just on talking about the basically imminent financial meltdown.
[01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:02.692]  No one knows the exact time, but globalists are headed towards the exits.
[01:43:02.692 --> 01:43:06.733]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is joining us to cover the waterfront and more.
[01:43:06.733 --> 01:43:09.454]  And new attacks on free speech coming up.
[01:43:09.454 --> 01:43:15.936]  But I wanted to get Ted on because this is things... He was on 10 years ago talking about naked short
[01:43:16.892 --> 01:43:19.794]  Going on against gold and silver to artificially drive down the price.
[01:43:19.794 --> 01:43:27.118]  He was on breaking down universities and governments hoarding gold while having, you know, tungsten-coated gold bars.
[01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:29.760]  He was talking about Germany winning its gold back before it was in the news.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.521]  He has a lot of top sources.
[01:43:31.521 --> 01:43:35.944]  He's in the top ten gold companies in the United States, probably the top five.
[01:43:35.944 --> 01:43:38.606]  But shows there's a lot of inside baseball sources.
[01:43:39.486 --> 01:43:42.887]  And I just wanted to get him on.
[01:43:42.887 --> 01:43:46.108]  China wants its gold back from the U.S.
[01:43:46.108 --> 01:43:56.472]  Bloomberg reports Texas has asked for its gold back, saying they believe the government could collapse and that the Federal Reserve is private and that they don't trust it being there.
[01:43:59.044 --> 01:44:08.571]  The governor basically said, hey listen, Texas is unique, it's stable, it's strong, and we can show that by letting our states and individuals know this, yes, Texas has a billion dollars worth of gold.
[01:44:08.571 --> 01:44:10.352]  Does your state have a billion dollars worth of gold?
[01:44:10.352 --> 01:44:12.074]  So it's definitely a move against the globalists.
[01:44:12.074 --> 01:44:13.535]  Germany wants their gold back.
[01:44:13.535 --> 01:44:15.896]  Bloomberg reports they won't give it back.
[01:44:15.896 --> 01:44:21.961]  The gold now getting released is covered in gold, but it's constant.
[01:44:21.961 --> 01:44:24.682]  Ron Paul says the stock market day of reckoning is near.
[01:44:25.914 --> 01:44:32.477]  So all of this is happening, and I haven't really plugged gold in about two years.
[01:44:32.477 --> 01:44:47.843]  Because I've had the guest on, and it's come out, just like interest rates and currency rates are staged, it's been in the news, and just like it's come out that home loans have been rigged at the central bank level, it's all rigged.
[01:44:47.843 --> 01:44:49.463]  Even the Rolling Stone reports that.
[01:44:49.463 --> 01:44:50.564]  London Guardian reports that.
[01:44:51.502 --> 01:45:03.468]  And yes, now they admit that the big banks have been naked shorting, putting paper in the market as physical gold, selling it for prices way below what it's worth, but never actually selling the gold to drive down the price.
[01:45:03.468 --> 01:45:12.292]  It'd be like if people started selling Ferrari Ferraris, the million and a half dollar, thousand horsepower Ferrari for $10,000.
[01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:18.411]  Or the Enzo.
[01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:26.096]  If they started selling it for $10,000, suddenly you'd see the market on Ferraris go from a million and a half for the top Ferrari down to half a million.
[01:45:26.096 --> 01:45:29.218]  Now, no real Ferraris were sold for $10,000.
[01:45:29.218 --> 01:45:32.600]  But if the market started doing that, it would drive down the price.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.062]  This is the game they play while they're busy hoarding it.
[01:45:37.023 --> 01:45:40.007]  Universities around the world are getting billions in gold.
[01:45:40.007 --> 01:45:42.690]  UT holds several billion that they just got.
[01:45:42.690 --> 01:45:47.596]  But I've been quietly buying a few coins here, some silver there, while the price has been lower.
[01:45:47.596 --> 01:45:51.722]  Used to be $300, went up to $2,000, gone down to $1,200 or whatever.
[01:45:51.722 --> 01:45:52.322]  Doesn't matter.
[01:45:52.322 --> 01:45:54.125]  I hold it as an emergency backup.
[01:45:54.125 --> 01:45:55.206]  But I believe now
[01:45:56.047 --> 01:46:04.033]  Here's the time to get back into gold and silver, and the safest time for me to be able to promote it and really feel like it's going to be going back up.
[01:46:04.033 --> 01:46:07.115]  I've always known it will, because this thing will come down at some point.
[01:46:08.396 --> 01:46:14.622]  Even if there's a depression in real assets, it'll come back up down the road for long-term holders.
[01:46:14.622 --> 01:46:19.506]  But now I feel safe, after two years of not promoting it, to have Ted back on.
[01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:21.548]  And he didn't even ask to come on.
[01:46:21.548 --> 01:46:23.910]  I just said, I think we ought to get Ted on to plug some gold and silver.
[01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:27.593]  But that'll be two minutes at the end of the talk, here in like 10-15 minutes.
[01:46:27.593 --> 01:46:28.494]  I've had him on hold for 15.
[01:46:28.494 --> 01:46:29.815]  I apologize.
[01:46:29.815 --> 01:46:32.237]  Ted, I'm kind of ranting, making your case here for you.
[01:46:33.318 --> 01:46:36.383]  What do you make of Texas and others wanting their gold back?
[01:46:36.383 --> 01:46:40.829]  All this other behavior we see runs on banks in Greece.
[01:46:40.829 --> 01:46:42.672]  Similar regulations coming in.
[01:46:42.672 --> 01:46:46.477]  The Fed's announcing internal passports to travel next year.
[01:46:46.477 --> 01:46:47.439]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:46:48.544 --> 01:46:49.885]  Well, you're right about that, Alex.
[01:46:49.885 --> 01:46:56.690]  I can tell you what, the reason why Texas wants to get their gold back is because they don't trust the Federal Reserve System to hold it for them, and I don't blame them.
[01:46:56.690 --> 01:46:59.152]  I wouldn't have them do it either.
[01:46:59.152 --> 01:47:06.378]  With Greece falling apart and everything that's happening in the United States, Puerto Rico trying to file bankruptcy, you would think gold would be going up right now.
[01:47:06.738 --> 01:47:08.759]  Obviously, there's manipulation.
[01:47:08.759 --> 01:47:13.721]  Obviously, the Fed would like to see people stay on the paper assets.
[01:47:13.721 --> 01:47:17.023]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been skyrocketing.
[01:47:17.023 --> 01:47:21.265]  Gold has been the loser for the last couple of years.
[01:47:21.265 --> 01:47:24.486]  But fundamentally, you would think that it would be going up like crazy.
[01:47:24.486 --> 01:47:29.829]  In 2008, 2009, Greece falling apart like it has, we'd have gold shooting up like a rocket.
[01:47:30.249 --> 01:47:33.891]  Right now, Janet Yellen is wondering, well, do we raise interest rates yet?
[01:47:33.891 --> 01:47:37.972]  Maybe we should wait until people get better, you know, wage increases should come out first.
[01:47:37.972 --> 01:47:47.736]  You know, it's a big manipulative game, and that's why people in Texas want to get their gold home rather than having it stored over there.
[01:47:47.736 --> 01:47:48.897]  The bottom line is, is that
[01:47:49.597 --> 01:47:58.987]  You know, when the House of Cards falls apart, like Ron Paul was talking about, when everything falls apart, it's the United States debt, it's the national debt, it's the world debt.
[01:47:58.987 --> 01:48:06.154]  I mean, I don't know, I just... Counties, cities, state, local, private, it is a hellstorm of debt.
[01:48:06.154 --> 01:48:08.156]  The world's never seen anything close to this.
[01:48:08.917 --> 01:48:10.319]  I know, it's just amazing.
[01:48:10.319 --> 01:48:10.900]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:13.704]  I went back, just, I haven't looked at this in a long time.
[01:48:13.704 --> 01:48:16.487]  I'm looking at the National Debt Clock online.
[01:48:16.487 --> 01:48:17.969]  And this thing is ticking away.
[01:48:17.969 --> 01:48:20.172]  It looks like a time bomb ready to go off.
[01:48:20.172 --> 01:48:23.397]  It looks like a science fiction film or something out of James Bond.
[01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:24.698]  Well, we are in a science fiction movie.
[01:48:25.766 --> 01:48:27.007]  That's the whole thing, Alex.
[01:48:27.007 --> 01:48:33.231]  So how in the world can we expect to see no problems, no catastrophe, no consequences?
[01:48:33.231 --> 01:48:35.253]  Well, everywhere else hell is breaking loose.
[01:48:35.253 --> 01:48:35.733]  That's the thing.
[01:48:35.733 --> 01:48:37.835]  And we're still here thinking everything's fine.
[01:48:37.835 --> 01:48:41.037]  But as Ron Paul said 30 minutes ago, we're really in a depression.
[01:48:41.037 --> 01:48:42.458]  Every indicator shows a depression.
[01:48:43.733 --> 01:48:47.556]  And yet still, here we are looking at $1,165.50 gold.
[01:48:47.556 --> 01:48:49.537]  It's down $3.80.
[01:48:49.537 --> 01:48:51.318]  I have the feeling if they took a U.S.
[01:48:51.318 --> 01:48:56.041]  Eagle and strapped jet rockets on it and lit it off, that thing wouldn't make it off the ground.
[01:48:56.041 --> 01:48:58.342]  It just can't be pushed upward.
[01:48:58.342 --> 01:48:58.823]  It's just amazing.
[01:48:58.823 --> 01:49:01.344]  But meanwhile, the elites are buying it faster than ever.
[01:49:01.344 --> 01:49:06.087]  That's even admitted, as now Spain tries to ban physical holding of gold.
[01:49:06.087 --> 01:49:08.348]  Well, we know what happened during the Great Depression.
[01:49:08.348 --> 01:49:10.910]  First they banned it, and a year later increased the price.
[01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:11.931]  Explain how this works, Ted.
[01:49:12.631 --> 01:49:13.391]  Well, that's what they did.
[01:49:13.391 --> 01:49:16.152]  Of course, they even did that in 1933.
[01:49:16.152 --> 01:49:22.014]  When they confiscated gold from the United States citizens in 1933, they did it at $26 an ounce.
[01:49:22.014 --> 01:49:24.955]  They raised it to $36 the year afterwards.
[01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:29.757]  When they take all the waste, they have the ability to manipulate the gold prices.
[01:49:29.757 --> 01:49:33.458]  They can quietly buy the gold prices, keep the interest rates low.
[01:49:34.518 --> 01:49:52.277]  Make make equities look really attractive Meanwhile while they're quietly sopping up all the precious metals if for their own ownership Then things break loose all of a sudden the prices start to go up I mean you even see Warren Buffett getting into silver and gold at this time, and I just need to say this reminds me of
[01:49:52.637 --> 01:50:05.546]  Of like 1982 and the year 2006, when we had gold trading at about $250 an ounce, silver was trading just right around $3,350, and all of a sudden it starts to go up from there.
[01:50:05.546 --> 01:50:11.831]  But for some reason, while the market is down like this, it's almost impossible to convince people to get in.
[01:50:11.831 --> 01:50:16.854]  But here we are sitting here after inflationary dollars, we're looking at the same pricing, and
[01:50:18.595 --> 01:50:21.997]  People should be getting involved in the market while it's soft like this.
[01:50:21.997 --> 01:50:32.682]  You bet, when the market starts to rise and everything starts to run, the quantities and the supply of what's available in the marketplace is going to dry up, premiums are going to explode again, and everybody's going to need it.
[01:50:32.682 --> 01:50:38.966]  Well, Chad, you know, because I bought all my gold from you because you have the best prices out there from my experience, just as an average basis.
[01:50:41.954 --> 01:50:44.256]  I don't call you in golds going up buying gold.
[01:50:44.256 --> 01:50:46.118]  I call you now when it's low.
[01:50:46.118 --> 01:50:47.339]  And that's what I'm doing now.
[01:50:47.339 --> 01:50:49.741]  And people just do not listen to the common sense.
[01:50:49.741 --> 01:50:51.903]  At least most of them don't.
[01:50:51.903 --> 01:50:57.708]  All the indicators are that it's almost impossible for them to keep holding down gold and silver.
[01:50:57.708 --> 01:50:58.189]  We'll be back.
[01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.609]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.367 --> 01:51:04.468]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:04.468 --> 01:51:07.649]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:07.649 --> 01:51:09.050]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:12.611]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:14.132]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:32.197 --> 01:51:33.998]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:33.998 --> 01:51:35.639]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:35.639 --> 01:51:38.481]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:38.481 --> 01:51:40.762]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:40.762 --> 01:51:45.265]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:52:26.399 --> 01:52:27.259]  Survivalist Camps.
[01:52:27.259 --> 01:52:29.380]  Providing your basic needs to survive.
[01:52:30.265 --> 01:52:39.169]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:40.269]  Silver Lungs.
[01:52:40.269 --> 01:52:47.573]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[01:52:47.573 --> 01:52:53.595]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:52:53.595 --> 01:52:57.717]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:57.717 --> 01:52:59.438]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:53:00.066 --> 01:53:01.848]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[01:53:01.848 --> 01:53:03.710]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.211]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:06.733]  Mine has fallen apart.
[01:53:06.733 --> 01:53:12.999]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[01:53:12.999 --> 01:53:16.142]  I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[01:53:16.142 --> 01:53:16.663]  What is that?
[01:53:16.963 --> 01:53:26.506]  Well apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[01:53:26.506 --> 01:53:35.229]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.849]  Wow!
[01:53:35.849 --> 01:53:37.169]  That sounds scary!
[01:53:37.169 --> 01:53:41.611]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[01:53:41.611 --> 01:53:42.431]  Are they more expensive?
[01:53:42.871 --> 01:53:43.392]  No.
[01:53:43.392 --> 01:53:51.079]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[01:53:51.079 --> 01:53:52.260]  Sounds great!
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.902]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[01:53:54.902 --> 01:53:58.966]  I want to be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:10.992]  We're good to go.
[01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:40.920]  Ted, it's crazy.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.187]  I'm talking to Ted Anderson here, owner of the GCN Radio Network that you're listening to right now.
[01:54:45.187 --> 01:54:46.830]  He also owns Minus Resources.
[01:54:49.482 --> 01:54:59.910]  Classic case of a kid who started right out of high school working at a gold and silver company and then starting his own, now one of the most successful in the world because of low prices and good service, MidasResources.com.
[01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:05.375]  I'm going to do a brief plug here for a gold and silver special and some other stuff that's a great deal today.
[01:55:05.375 --> 01:55:15.283]  Just very briefly here, because I don't expect people to actually do the smart thing for whatever reason and buy at what I believe is the bottom of the market.
[01:55:16.087 --> 01:55:17.948]  When we know they're manipulating it down.
[01:55:17.948 --> 01:55:20.309]  When we know the paper is so dangerous.
[01:55:20.309 --> 01:55:24.932]  I expect people though to remember this, this fall, when it starts racing up.
[01:55:24.932 --> 01:55:26.212]  I believe it will.
[01:55:26.212 --> 01:55:29.734]  Not a prediction, it's just what I believe.
[01:55:29.734 --> 01:55:33.016]  And if they can continue to suppress it, I'll be surprised.
[01:55:33.016 --> 01:55:38.799]  But regardless, I'm not just going to be all in paper and all in stuff they can take and grab out of my bank account.
[01:55:40.103 --> 01:55:46.287]  I've got to be able to go to a safety deposit box, go wherever, cash some stuff in, and meet payroll if I have to.
[01:55:46.287 --> 01:55:53.291]  This cashless society is about total control, and everything we warn people about is now starting to happen.
[01:55:53.291 --> 01:56:02.596]  I mean, Ted, it's scary to see Greeks having their bank account money kept, and they can only get out, first it was 66 euros a day, now it's 100 a month.
[01:56:02.596 --> 01:56:08.720]  And then they started holding Americans' and Europeans' money that they paid into PayPal and other systems,
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.922]  Central banks started taking the money from the resorts and just stealing people's money.
[01:56:14.922 --> 01:56:18.123]  Did you see that in the news yesterday as a punishment to Greece?
[01:56:18.123 --> 01:56:22.204]  It shows how these mega banks are completely criminal and will do anything.
[01:56:22.204 --> 01:56:24.925]  And they're trying to push around Greece because they want their way.
[01:56:24.925 --> 01:56:27.046]  They want them to stay in the European Union.
[01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:29.867]  They want them to continue on making their debt payments.
[01:56:30.367 --> 01:56:32.108]  Which just enslaves the people.
[01:56:32.108 --> 01:56:35.490]  The people are saying, no, we want to get away from this system.
[01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:36.631]  And it's a tug of war.
[01:56:36.631 --> 01:56:37.352]  It's a fight.
[01:56:37.352 --> 01:56:40.714]  And it's going to be, God knows what the end result is going to be.
[01:56:40.714 --> 01:56:42.595]  It could be a war even, you know.
[01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:48.259]  It's just ridiculous what these banks will do in order to keep control of a country.
[01:56:48.539 --> 01:56:50.261]  And the people that they serve.
[01:56:50.261 --> 01:56:52.222]  It's just amazing.
[01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:52.823]  Exactly!
[01:56:52.823 --> 01:56:57.987]  And now the TSA announces a national ID card through your state driver's license.
[01:56:57.987 --> 01:57:00.769]  If your state doesn't adopt it, you won't be able to fly next year.
[01:57:00.769 --> 01:57:02.050]  That's an internal passport.
[01:57:02.050 --> 01:57:04.973]  We knew that was coming.
[01:57:04.973 --> 01:57:08.596]  They're talking about not letting us have cash here.
[01:57:08.596 --> 01:57:10.598]  IMF orders U.S.
[01:57:10.598 --> 01:57:13.780]  tour operators to withhold payments to Greek hotels.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.181]  Boom!
[01:57:14.181 --> 01:57:15.021]  People go.
[01:57:15.021 --> 01:57:16.302]  That's a Paul Watson article.
[01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:25.114]  You go buy your trip, and then the tour operator's told, don't pay it to the Greek hotels.
[01:57:25.114 --> 01:57:28.056]  I mean, that is, that's what they tried on Iceland, Ted.
[01:57:30.184 --> 01:57:36.087]  But, you know, you shouldn't be surprised by this, because this stuff has been going on for years.
[01:57:36.087 --> 01:57:48.813]  You're going to have manipulation, you're going to have forced manipulation, and when you take a look at what the central banks did, even in World War II, by supporting Hitler, and also supporting the European countries that were being attacked.
[01:57:48.813 --> 01:57:49.233]  It's crazy.
[01:57:49.673 --> 01:57:52.154]  You know, it gets beyond the pale here.
[01:57:52.154 --> 01:57:53.535]  There's no question about it.
[01:57:53.535 --> 01:57:55.156]  And Ron Paul talks about liberty.
[01:57:55.156 --> 01:57:58.297]  I mean, my God, you want to have liberty, get away from their currency.
[01:57:58.297 --> 01:57:58.937]  That's the answer.
[01:57:58.937 --> 01:57:59.458]  I agree, Ted.
[01:57:59.458 --> 01:58:00.518]  Get away from their currency.
[01:58:00.518 --> 01:58:05.660]  I'm going to hold you for five more minutes, but you told me you have something really special today for listeners who call 800-686-2237.
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:05.861]  What is it?
[01:58:09.022 --> 01:58:13.105]  Buy the recognizable, tradable items, like the old dimes.
[01:58:13.105 --> 01:58:17.088]  They're trading for $2,055 per bag of 1,000.
[01:58:17.088 --> 01:58:19.770]  Walking Liberty halves are $1,105 right now.
[01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:26.374]  There's a lot of things that you can get into, but you need to have something that's recognizable and something that can be used as money.
[01:58:26.374 --> 01:58:28.035]  So you've got the old silver dimes.
[01:58:28.035 --> 01:58:29.016]  That's an amazing deal.
[01:58:29.016 --> 01:58:30.057]  You've got Walking Liberty.
[01:58:30.057 --> 01:58:31.298]  You've got a lot of stuff.
[01:58:31.298 --> 01:58:34.480]  When folks call 800-686-2237, Midas Resources, the parent company of GCN.
[01:58:41.414 --> 01:58:49.837]  Without Ted, I'd be successful regardless, but I've been with one home and he's helped us get all this done.
[01:58:49.837 --> 01:58:58.919]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:58:58.919 --> 01:59:07.022]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:07.322 --> 01:59:12.208]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:12.208 --> 01:59:18.996]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:18.996 --> 01:59:26.064]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:59:26.144 --> 01:59:33.188]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:59:33.188 --> 01:59:37.671]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:59:37.671 --> 01:59:47.357]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:47.357 --> 01:59:51.839]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.839 --> 01:59:54.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.407 --> 02:00:05.967]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.967 --> 02:00:07.248]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.248 --> 02:00:09.029]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.029 --> 02:00:10.791]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.791 --> 02:00:12.372]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:13.913]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.913 --> 02:00:18.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.096 --> 02:00:28.843]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.843 --> 02:00:32.065]  Ted Anderson, owner of GCN.
[02:00:32.065 --> 02:00:33.406]  Live.com is our guest.
[02:00:35.046 --> 02:00:39.410]  Dad, let's just finish up with a little pitch for folks for gold and silver.
[02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:43.795]  When they do buy it from you, they get a good price, good service, and it helps the whole network and the rest of it.
[02:00:43.795 --> 02:00:46.918]  But I mean, I really got you on today to talk about...
[02:00:48.345 --> 02:01:07.473]  How surreal it is, for me at least, I want to get your take, to watch Texas and all these universities cashing in cash and getting gold, like UT, Harvard, you name it, Berkeley, other governments, the Chinese government, they're all hoarding gold while telling people you don't need gold and silver.
[02:01:07.473 --> 02:01:12.695]  I mean, I don't see them being able to suppress the price forever, and I just go with my gut.
[02:01:12.695 --> 02:01:16.957]  I think I've had you on once in two years, and I had you on just as a guest, I've had you on about
[02:01:17.961 --> 02:01:25.652]  Other news in radio a few times, but I just have a gut feeling, maybe I'm wrong, because they could come up with some new manipulation.
[02:01:25.652 --> 02:01:31.160]  I just don't know how they're going to suppress gold prices while the elites themselves are gobbling it all up.
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:31.361]  Ted?
[02:01:32.498 --> 02:01:39.843]  Well, truth be told, I suppose we have a couple of more months where things are going to piddle around where it is right now.
[02:01:39.843 --> 02:01:44.306]  I would suspect that we'll have prices go up like it usually does in the fall.
[02:01:44.306 --> 02:01:47.908]  However, the last couple of falls it hadn't happened.
[02:01:47.908 --> 02:01:56.413]  We did have quite a bull market and the bear market swing came along, but you go through that cycle and now we're sitting here at the bottom side of the market.
[02:01:56.413 --> 02:01:58.855]  There's so many problems that are out there.
[02:01:59.535 --> 02:02:14.470]  We are going to have continued problems in the future, and you take a look at that debt clock, you look at what's going on in Europe, you look at what's going on here in the United States, and like you're saying, UT, the state of Texas, all these different places.
[02:02:17.012 --> 02:02:18.213]  Warren Buffett, for one.
[02:02:18.213 --> 02:02:19.715]  The central banks.
[02:02:19.715 --> 02:02:27.082]  Why would the central banks be buying gold when it's their own currency that they can have for free?
[02:02:27.082 --> 02:02:31.747]  The reason why they're doing that is because they know that there's no value in their money.
[02:02:31.747 --> 02:02:35.690]  And as the debt rises, the supply of money increases.
[02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:37.092]  It drives the value of their
[02:02:37.532 --> 02:02:38.614]  They're papered down.
[02:02:38.614 --> 02:02:39.495]  It just does.
[02:02:39.495 --> 02:02:43.480]  Well, Ted, I don't know if this is going to happen, but I've always been told this by top folks.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.842]  It's been proposed at Davos.
[02:02:44.842 --> 02:02:45.623]  You know that.
[02:02:45.623 --> 02:02:49.628]  But now they're starting to float a global SDR, strategic drawing right.
[02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:53.994]  That's how when I ship packages overseas with USPS, it's already denominated in SDRs.
[02:02:55.476 --> 02:03:05.682]  They admit they want to have 10% to 30% gold-backed or a spectrum of metals-backed global new currency when the dollar and others go down.
[02:03:05.682 --> 02:03:13.826]  You'll still have dollars, you'll still have yens, yans, euros, but they'll be tied to that global unified SDR.
[02:03:13.826 --> 02:03:18.909]  And when that happens, gold's going to go up like a rocket and the elites will be positioned with it.
[02:03:18.909 --> 02:03:19.990]  What's your intel on that?
[02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:27.471]  Well, isn't it just enough to hear that when the dollar drops in value, they'll have something that holds more value?
[02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:32.512]  That strategy alone should put people into precious metals, or at least make them think twice about it.
[02:03:32.512 --> 02:03:33.352]  I get it.
[02:03:33.352 --> 02:03:35.953]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been running up.
[02:03:35.953 --> 02:03:38.433]  It's hard to get out of that market when you're making money.
[02:03:38.433 --> 02:03:39.393]  It's tough.
[02:03:39.393 --> 02:03:42.854]  It's really hard to sell something that's up and making you money.
[02:03:42.854 --> 02:03:44.434]  You want to stay with it.
[02:03:44.434 --> 02:03:48.035]  And you definitely do not want to move into something that has not been producing.
[02:03:48.035 --> 02:03:49.815]  But you don't want to get left with a hand grenade
[02:03:49.855 --> 02:03:51.296]  They're passing it around.
[02:03:51.296 --> 02:03:51.917]  Exactly.
[02:03:51.917 --> 02:04:07.209]  Well, if you can get out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, even take 10% out of that market, and move into precious metals that's down right now, I mean, all of the newsletter writers and the forecasters and the people that are experts are saying, you have to diversify in this way.
[02:04:07.209 --> 02:04:08.970]  It's called balancing your portfolio.
[02:04:08.970 --> 02:04:11.372]  They're saying the ultimate you-know-what storm is here.
[02:04:11.372 --> 02:04:14.174]  I mean, Ted, how much crazier can it get?
[02:04:14.174 --> 02:04:16.676]  How much bigger can the bubble get till it pops?
[02:04:16.676 --> 02:04:17.958]  I mean, it is ginormous.
[02:04:18.678 --> 02:04:22.359]  I know, and it already baffles me that it is where it is.
[02:04:22.359 --> 02:04:28.501]  But here you have Yellen talking about raising the interest rates, and she knows that her back is up against the wall.
[02:04:28.501 --> 02:04:34.644]  Interest rates go up, the United States debt goes crazy, we can't afford it no more, things collapse.
[02:04:34.644 --> 02:04:35.524]  That's the bottom line.
[02:04:36.451 --> 02:04:37.732]  And then what happens to gold?
[02:04:37.732 --> 02:04:42.755]  I mean, some argue it'll drive it down because of a depression, but if the currency's being devalued, it would go up.
[02:04:42.755 --> 02:04:51.640]  I mean, it just... Bottom line, when you don't know what's going to happen, you need to have a basket of things so that something goes up, something goes down, you're not left with your butt hanging out.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:54.681]  You don't want to be a one-crop economy in the stock market, folks.
[02:04:54.681 --> 02:04:55.602]  Midas Resources, 800-686-2237.
[02:04:55.602 --> 02:04:56.922]  Ventura, straight up.
[02:04:59.813 --> 02:05:10.539]  Although the government admits it has no credible evidence of a potential terror attack taking place over the 4th of July holiday, the FBI has moved to establish command centers around the country.
[02:05:10.539 --> 02:05:19.104]  These command centers will integrate local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies so officials can gauge the threat level and respond quickly.
[02:05:19.104 --> 02:05:25.568]  Let's be real, the target of this apparatus is not ISIS and foreign jihadist terrorists, but the American people.
[02:05:26.048 --> 02:05:34.357]  Command centers and so-called fusion centers around the country are routinely used to monitor political activists, not supposed terrorists.
[02:05:34.357 --> 02:05:44.469]  And these command centers will certainly be convenient during the upcoming Jade Helm exercise, despite the fact that most Americans are sick and tired of endless terror warnings that don't pan out.
[02:05:45.089 --> 02:05:51.877]  These threats will continue to be used as a pretext to build and expand the surveillance grid in the United States.

[02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:12.903]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.534 --> 02:08:41.997]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[02:08:41.997 --> 02:08:44.658]  Won't Get Fooled Again, what a great song.
[02:08:44.658 --> 02:08:45.219]  The Who.
[02:08:45.219 --> 02:08:46.599]  Crank it up right here.
[02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:12.109]  Let's pray to Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.
[02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:13.550]  They'll save us.
[02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:17.453]  Bankrolled by the exact same offshore banks.
[02:09:17.453 --> 02:09:26.760]  And the entire Republican field supports the TPP to hand over all of our sovereignty to foreign, unelected boards.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:34.347]  Turns out there's a clause in there to allow slavery, sweatshops, actual people that are held prisoner around the world, but that's okay.
[02:09:35.836 --> 02:09:41.462]  Obama can criticize the rebel flag all day as a diversion.
[02:09:41.462 --> 02:09:43.384]  Talk about meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[02:09:43.384 --> 02:09:46.488]  The only Republican that's not supporting it is Rand Paul.
[02:09:46.488 --> 02:09:52.755]  Ron Paul was on with us earlier saying he believes the collapse is accelerating and basically could be imminent.
[02:09:54.121 --> 02:09:59.565]  But we're gonna pull a clip from that interview last hour and play it for Ventura coming up a little bit later.
[02:09:59.565 --> 02:10:04.189]  We can also probably open the phones up and take a few calls for Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:07.731]  But the reason he's on is he's under attack.
[02:10:07.731 --> 02:10:11.014]  And I was the person who got a call
[02:10:12.546 --> 02:10:13.347]  At 6 a.m.
[02:10:13.347 --> 02:10:23.835]  on my cell phone, when I'd just woken up a few years ago, from the Opie and Anthony Show, said, I want you to come on and defend your buddy Ventura that got, you know, beaten up or whatever.
[02:10:23.835 --> 02:10:24.936]  I said, what are you talking about?
[02:10:24.936 --> 02:10:30.741]  They go, you didn't hear Chris Kyle yesterday, blah, blah, blah, and turned out he'd been on Fox News and said it.
[02:10:30.741 --> 02:10:32.862]  So I called Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:32.862 --> 02:10:35.444]  He was in Mexico, and he didn't believe it at first.
[02:10:35.444 --> 02:10:37.286]  He said, man, don't joke around, Alex.
[02:10:37.286 --> 02:10:38.927]  You don't normally do that.
[02:10:38.927 --> 02:10:39.828]  You're kidding, right?
[02:10:41.618 --> 02:10:46.960]  Like I would go to a Navy SEAL event where I was at the commencement and say, I'm glad Navy SEALs are dead.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.280]  That's just sickening.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.862]  Plus I'd be physically attacked.
[02:10:51.862 --> 02:10:57.404]  It was done to defame him because they knew he could probably win running for president.
[02:10:57.404 --> 02:11:00.505]  It was political assassination.
[02:11:00.505 --> 02:11:04.166]  And one problem is, as Jim Garrison said, if they can do that, next they physically kill you.
[02:11:05.842 --> 02:11:10.585]  So if they can destroy Ventura, whether you love him or hate him or in between, they can bring anybody down.
[02:11:10.585 --> 02:11:12.246]  Well, he spent millions of dollars.
[02:11:12.246 --> 02:11:15.328]  I'm not allowed to say the amount, but he spent most of his money.
[02:11:15.328 --> 02:11:19.591]  He's a humble guy, private guy, but I know a lot of the inside baseball.
[02:11:19.591 --> 02:11:23.173]  Consulted on his TV shows, traveled around the country with him, been in two seasons.
[02:11:23.173 --> 02:11:25.134]  Knew him before that.
[02:11:25.134 --> 02:11:28.036]  When he came out investigating 9-11, took a lot of courage there.
[02:11:28.036 --> 02:11:29.938]  They're scared of him.
[02:11:29.938 --> 02:11:35.141]  He's had the CIA visit him, basically, and, you know, ask, you know, if he's going to play ball.
[02:11:37.987 --> 02:11:42.669]  Years ago, when he first got elected governor, and the truth is he hasn't played ball with them.
[02:11:42.669 --> 02:12:04.176]  And so now, 30 plus, 30 plus top media organizations have filed suit to try to overturn his guilty verdict in the slander defamation libel trial that he won last year against Chris Kyle.
[02:12:04.176 --> 02:12:06.637]  The estate has made tens of millions of dollars.
[02:12:08.482 --> 02:12:13.326]  The media combine, the books made over 100 million, Ventura can give you all the latest numbers.
[02:12:13.326 --> 02:12:16.028]  The movie hundreds of millions profit.
[02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:19.171]  Thank God they cut out the part or didn't put the part in about Ventura.
[02:12:19.171 --> 02:12:26.697]  I have nothing against Chris Kyle, but the, and I debated him on opening Anthony's show about all this by the way.
[02:12:26.697 --> 02:12:28.158]  God rest his soul.
[02:12:28.158 --> 02:12:29.259]  But it wasn't true.
[02:12:31.283 --> 02:12:43.229]  And so if they're allowed to lie about people and get away with it, they can come out and say, I'm a methamphetamine dealer, or I'm a child molester, and then I sue them, and I'm not litigious.
[02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:50.933]  I've not really shared this on air, but I've sued people for defamation twice, and I've won twice.
[02:12:50.933 --> 02:12:56.316]  Once they settled out of court, the other time I went to court and I won because it was so cut and dry.
[02:12:58.339 --> 02:13:00.680]  But then they basically apologized and disappeared.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.323]  They were harassing my sister that was in high school at the time.
[02:13:04.323 --> 02:13:08.345]  It was a media person saying where she was, that people should go get her.
[02:13:08.345 --> 02:13:09.426]  They were saying things about me.
[02:13:09.426 --> 02:13:10.126]  I sued them.
[02:13:10.126 --> 02:13:11.647]  I won.
[02:13:11.647 --> 02:13:16.470]  The other time they settled and stopped, you know, saying things about me on air.
[02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:22.594]  And I had to because I had people calling me, you know, saying, is it true you're a drug dealer?
[02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:24.435]  I mean, I don't even use illegal drugs.
[02:13:25.383 --> 02:13:29.464]  Is it true that, you know, stuff like this.
[02:13:29.464 --> 02:13:39.766]  Now imagine now, if this ruling, and they overturn Ventura, versus, you know, Chris Kyle and News Corp.
[02:13:39.766 --> 02:13:47.447]  If they overturn that, like the New York Times and Fox News and CNN and, you know, all the rest of them, Hope, Hearst Publishing, the list goes on and on.
[02:13:47.447 --> 02:13:52.868]  If they win, they can come out and say, Jesse Ventura
[02:13:55.934 --> 02:14:05.462]  X and then he can't go uphill, win the battle, basically win an amount of money that doesn't even really pay what it cost him.
[02:14:06.724 --> 02:14:16.067]  And then they can destroy the entire right to defend yourself in this country and basically legalize lying and destroying people in this country.
[02:14:16.067 --> 02:14:17.827]  It truly is frightening.
[02:14:17.827 --> 02:14:24.489]  And Jesse has spent almost all his money, all his retirement, all his savings on this.
[02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:26.729]  And this is a fight for all of us.
[02:14:26.729 --> 02:14:32.131]  I think people should donate to Jesse Ventura's defense fund for us all.
[02:14:33.507 --> 02:14:33.647]  So
[02:14:55.398 --> 02:15:07.181]  I mean, he's been through a lot and been blackballed over this, and so if we don't support his appeal and bet on this winner, this champion for us all, we deserve what we get.
[02:15:07.181 --> 02:15:10.382]  So this is a platform to support patriots that are fighting.
[02:15:10.382 --> 02:15:15.183]  And I expect if anything ever happens to me and I'm in trouble, people to support me.
[02:15:15.183 --> 02:15:16.984]  So write your checks to P.O.
[02:15:16.984 --> 02:15:17.204]  Box.
[02:15:19.781 --> 02:15:23.605]  10629 White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:15:23.605 --> 02:15:26.247]  We'll put it on screen.
[02:15:26.247 --> 02:15:29.810]  Jesse Ventura, Aura.tv forward slash Off The Grid.
[02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:31.212]  This is a TV show.
[02:15:31.212 --> 02:15:33.033]  Jesse Ventura Appeal Fund, P.O.
[02:15:33.033 --> 02:15:35.055]  Box 10629 White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:15:41.291 --> 02:15:44.092]  Jesse Ventura, Appeal Fund, P.O.
[02:15:44.092 --> 02:15:49.334]  Box 10629, White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:15:49.334 --> 02:15:54.916]  And I would call it, Stop Political Assassination Fund.
[02:15:54.916 --> 02:15:58.558]  Or, you know the headline last week we put on the video was,
[02:15:59.676 --> 02:16:02.838]  Mainstream media asked courts to allow them to lie.
[02:16:02.838 --> 02:16:10.761]  I mean, this is unprecedented in thousands of years of common law, where you can't get in trouble if you lie about somebody.
[02:16:10.761 --> 02:16:13.603]  And believe me, this is all going to be selectively enforced.
[02:16:13.603 --> 02:16:16.664]  This is so big media can get up there on TV.
[02:16:16.664 --> 02:16:22.567]  Well, they've already said that I influence the Boston Bombers and that I'm deeply racist.
[02:16:22.567 --> 02:16:25.308]  And my lawyer said, yeah, you can spend a million and a half dollars.
[02:16:25.308 --> 02:16:26.929]  We'll win.
[02:16:26.929 --> 02:16:28.009]  Then we'll have to appeal.
[02:16:28.009 --> 02:16:28.670]  They won't pay.
[02:16:30.064 --> 02:16:31.185]  Well, thank you, Alex, very much.
[02:16:31.185 --> 02:16:36.269]  And it's a difficult thing for me to do, but I'm kind of backed against the wall.
[02:16:36.269 --> 02:16:39.571]  But what this amounts to in the end is that it could be a business for them.
[02:16:59.284 --> 02:17:06.369]  Because the more people that they would defame and the more profit that they make from that defamation would earn them money.
[02:17:06.369 --> 02:17:12.313]  It would be equivalent to, Alex, you and I go out and rob the bank.
[02:17:12.313 --> 02:17:17.877]  So we get prosecuted for robbing the bank and they sentence us to say three years for that.
[02:17:17.877 --> 02:17:19.518]  That would be the defamation part.
[02:17:20.362 --> 02:17:32.388]  But the unjust enrichment part is, after we would get out of jail in three years, we'd get to keep all the money that we robbed and got illegally through our illegal act.
[02:17:32.388 --> 02:17:41.713]  What they're asking for is the ability to defame someone, make profit from it, and the person who's defamed has no right
[02:17:42.381 --> 02:17:48.603]  They get to keep all their profits, so it could become a profitable business for them defaming people.
[02:17:48.603 --> 02:17:54.244]  Because the more they would defame and be able to make money off the defamation, the more money they'd make.
[02:17:54.244 --> 02:17:58.825]  It's kind of like, remember when Howard Stern was on regular radio?
[02:17:58.825 --> 02:17:59.646]  Yes.
[02:17:59.646 --> 02:18:03.206]  And Howard, of course, would say things and he'd get a $10,000 fine from the FCC.
[02:18:05.687 --> 02:18:14.016]  Well, the station would, in essence, let Howard get away with that, because on the flip side, Howard would make them $100,000.
[02:18:14.016 --> 02:18:19.681]  So they'd pay the $10,000 and be able to walk away with $90,000 profit.
[02:18:19.681 --> 02:18:21.103]  And that's what they want.
[02:18:21.103 --> 02:18:27.589]  They want the courts to legalize crime and to make a business out of destroying people.
[02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:28.150]  It's incredible.
[02:18:28.621 --> 02:18:37.125]  Yeah, and that they can profit from that business, and the person defamed is, for lack of term, blank out of luck.
[02:18:37.125 --> 02:18:39.086]  You know, you're judged too bad for you.
[02:18:39.086 --> 02:18:45.530]  For our listeners that just joined us, again in about a minute or two before we go to break, describe how they're appealing, what they're doing.
[02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:48.891]  Well, it's in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal right now.
[02:18:48.891 --> 02:18:50.912]  First, they got three extensions.
[02:18:50.912 --> 02:18:54.274]  I mean, the trial was completed last July and August.
[02:18:55.194 --> 02:19:02.557]  They filed for three extensions, which strung it out over another nine-month period, drawing it out.
[02:19:02.557 --> 02:19:06.518]  And apparently the courts of appeals don't work in the summer.
[02:19:06.518 --> 02:19:12.120]  I don't know much about that at the federal level, but they don't do cases June, July, and August.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:21.623]  And then they ramp up again in September, and that's when I'm due to go in front and in the interim, these 33 major media conglomerates, I mean, you name it,
[02:19:22.203 --> 02:19:40.347]  New York Times, Washington Post, everybody, you know, every major media conglomerate signed on to a lawyer who submitted, they got technical names for it to overturn my judgment.
[02:19:40.347 --> 02:19:46.549]  The Motion Picture Association, all of them, Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor, is our guest.
[02:19:47.862 --> 02:19:49.887]  He dared to expose the FEMA camps.
[02:19:49.887 --> 02:19:52.132]  He dared to expose the government drug dealing.
[02:19:52.132 --> 02:19:55.740]  And now they're trying to destroy him by defaming him.
[02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:57.545]  If they can bring him down, they can bring us all down.
[02:20:00.083 --> 02:20:04.744]  Have you ever wondered if you could make electric, light, or heat in your home for free?
[02:20:04.744 --> 02:20:07.645]  How about a motor that charges batteries at the same time?
[02:20:07.645 --> 02:20:11.867]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?
[02:20:11.867 --> 02:20:17.568]  Come to our Renaissance Charge Conference Workshop on August 15th and 16th in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:20:59.511 --> 02:21:03.737]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:03.737 --> 02:21:04.358]  It's true.
[02:21:04.358 --> 02:21:08.525]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:08.525 --> 02:21:10.908]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:10.908 --> 02:21:15.375]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:21:59.315 --> 02:22:01.077]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:22:01.077 --> 02:22:02.959]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:22:02.959 --> 02:22:04.440]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:05.982]  Mine has fallen apart.
[02:22:05.982 --> 02:22:12.168]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:22:12.168 --> 02:22:15.371]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:22:15.371 --> 02:22:15.912]  What is that?
[02:22:16.212 --> 02:22:25.759]  Well apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:22:25.759 --> 02:22:34.465]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:22:34.465 --> 02:22:35.106]  Wow!
[02:22:35.106 --> 02:22:36.407]  That sounds scary.
[02:22:36.407 --> 02:22:40.870]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:41.691]  Are they more expensive?
[02:22:42.131 --> 02:22:42.632]  No.
[02:22:42.632 --> 02:22:50.318]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:22:50.318 --> 02:22:51.518]  Sounds great!
[02:22:51.518 --> 02:22:54.361]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:22:54.361 --> 02:22:58.224]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!

[02:23:58.025 --> 02:24:06.487]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[02:24:06.487 --> 02:24:07.207]  Nothing.
[02:24:07.207 --> 02:24:10.367]  I mean nothing, honey, if it ain't free.
[02:24:20.589 --> 02:24:21.730]  You know what's really big here?
[02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:23.952]  I was just talking to Governor Ventura during the break.
[02:24:23.952 --> 02:24:25.834]  He was on with us a week and a half ago.
[02:24:25.834 --> 02:24:42.407]  Not one news story, and normally when he comes on there's always stories about it, not one news story about 33 of the biggest media companies filing a suit to overturn his ruling so that they can lie about people.
[02:24:42.407 --> 02:24:43.688]  This is a huge story.
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:47.661]  Well, you know, the thing is, is how much money they've made already.
[02:24:47.661 --> 02:24:51.864]  I mean, a year ago at my trial, HarperCollins, the book company itself, had made over $40 million on the book.
[02:25:14.631 --> 02:25:23.636]  Uh, the Kyle Estate had made around $6 million, and then the movie, I don't know what that went to, about $300 million I heard on that deal.
[02:25:23.636 --> 02:25:32.100]  And I know the Kyle Estate is getting 5% of the net revenue, you know, whatever that comes out to.
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:35.582]  I don't know if there'll be Hollywood bookkeeping in there or what'll happen on that end.
[02:25:36.303 --> 02:25:40.027]  And you know, Taya Kyle's out doing speaking engagements for $100,000 a pop.
[02:25:40.027 --> 02:25:47.056]  And not that I begrudge her any of that, but they've misled the public.
[02:25:47.056 --> 02:25:50.641]  She and her family and the estate has not had to pay one cent.
[02:25:51.361 --> 02:25:52.842]  It's upside down world.
[02:26:13.288 --> 02:26:14.828]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:14.828 --> 02:26:23.651]  You know, and the point of the matter is, is that the bottom line to all of this comes down to how our moral compass is flipped upside down.
[02:26:23.651 --> 02:26:25.911]  The truth now is considered a negative.
[02:26:25.911 --> 02:26:29.232]  If you tell the truth, you're a bad person.
[02:26:29.232 --> 02:26:36.434]  This country seems to prefer liars because we make liars into heroes and truth tellers go to prison.
[02:26:36.434 --> 02:26:40.935]  I remember I had on the CIA guy, John, I forget his last name, starts with a K, I think.
[02:26:41.698 --> 02:26:51.642]  Who was the guy who exposed the torturing and he ends up going to prison for three and a half years and the guys who actually tortured got nothing.
[02:26:51.642 --> 02:26:57.885]  The guys that exposed it goes to jail and the guys that torture get nothing out of the deal.
[02:26:57.885 --> 02:26:59.666]  And see that's the problem.
[02:26:59.666 --> 02:27:02.707]  Our country right now is morally upside down.
[02:27:02.707 --> 02:27:07.909]  We're making liars into heroes and we're taking truth tellers and putting them in prison.
[02:27:09.517 --> 02:27:11.238]  That's the way tyranny works.
[02:27:11.238 --> 02:27:14.621]  And to be fair, there was no article since you were on.
[02:27:14.621 --> 02:27:19.605]  There was one article back in May in the Star there in Minneapolis, St.
[02:27:19.605 --> 02:27:24.529]  Paul, that did report that, oh, this paper intends to sue Ventura.
[02:27:25.430 --> 02:27:35.476]  And they ran the headline that the major media and scholars side with Kyle's wife against Jesse Ventura.
[02:27:35.476 --> 02:27:37.177]  I mean, talk about a spin headline.
[02:27:37.177 --> 02:27:42.580]  I mean, it should be, you know, major media to sue Ventura's to legalize lying.
[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:44.462]  Yeah, what are these scholars?
[02:27:44.462 --> 02:27:45.943]  Who are these scholars?
[02:27:45.943 --> 02:27:47.844]  What scholars are they talking about?
[02:27:47.844 --> 02:27:51.766]  You mean they're paid people?
[02:27:51.766 --> 02:27:53.267]  The people that are on the payroll?
[02:27:58.769 --> 02:28:00.771]  Where does it go from here, Jesse?
[02:28:00.771 --> 02:28:04.614]  Well, you know, now I just hold on and wait.
[02:28:04.614 --> 02:28:08.337]  I've had, I think, five settlement conferences that have gotten nowhere.
[02:28:08.337 --> 02:28:10.139]  I mean, literally nowhere.
[02:28:10.139 --> 02:28:10.559]  Hardly.
[02:28:10.559 --> 02:28:14.563]  And they haven't even offered to pay what I've invested in this.
[02:28:15.573 --> 02:28:19.014]  So, you know, I don't expect a settlement.
[02:28:19.014 --> 02:28:22.055]  September, the 8th Circuit Court will convene.
[02:28:22.055 --> 02:28:34.139]  If they rule in my favor, then I'll finally get the money that'll just, it'll pay off my lawyers, basically, out of the ordeal of what I won initially in court.
[02:28:34.139 --> 02:28:38.900]  Well, people are always wanting patriots that are under attack to sue.
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:39.640]  Sue, sue, sue.
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:40.421]  Well, you've done it.
[02:28:40.421 --> 02:28:42.441]  You've won.
[02:28:42.441 --> 02:28:44.742]  And they don't like the fact that you sued this myth.
[02:28:45.629 --> 02:28:48.210]  You know, to me, that's what it all comes down to, Alex.
[02:28:48.210 --> 02:28:51.872]  Are we a country that's going to stand for truth?
[02:28:51.872 --> 02:28:54.833]  You know, the old saying, truth... I think it was on Superman.
[02:28:54.833 --> 02:28:56.213]  Truth, justice, and the American way.
[02:29:13.755 --> 02:29:17.737]  Are we going to support the truth, or do we prefer lying?
[02:29:17.737 --> 02:29:23.459]  And, uh, you know, when you look at our government, our leaders, lying is an acceptable business.
[02:29:23.459 --> 02:29:25.160]  They lie all the time.
[02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:28.942]  And that's one of the reasons I don't think I'd make a good president, Alex.
[02:29:29.878 --> 02:29:30.878]  I tell the truth.
[02:29:30.878 --> 02:29:32.259]  You're not a congenital liar.
[02:29:32.259 --> 02:29:42.343]  I say that not tongue-in-cheek, but I think today the president has to be able to get on television, look at the American people, and freaking lie.
[02:29:42.343 --> 02:29:43.623]  More on that when we come back.
[02:29:43.623 --> 02:29:47.525]  We'll cover world news with Jesse Ventura and open the phones up to take your calls.
[02:29:47.525 --> 02:29:49.345]  You need to support him.
[02:29:49.345 --> 02:29:50.746]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.746 --> 02:29:53.287]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.287 --> 02:29:55.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.003 --> 02:30:07.808]  Today's example of terror porn is brought to you by the FBI, whose agents are telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations.
[02:30:07.808 --> 02:30:08.889]  And you know what that means?
[02:30:08.889 --> 02:30:15.513]  That means if you're an FBI informant, or a friend of an FBI informant, you better not go anywhere this weekend because you're probably going to be set up.
[02:30:15.513 --> 02:30:16.594]  Why do I say that?
[02:30:16.594 --> 02:30:20.937]  Back in 2012, the New York Times published an article, Terrorist Plots Hatched by the FBI.
[02:30:21.417 --> 02:30:27.141]  Which details how FBI informants were recruiting people for terror plots, which were then busted by the FBI.
[02:30:27.141 --> 02:30:33.325]  And remember, back in February, an FBI official said, we need to keep fear alive to justify terror budget.
[02:30:33.325 --> 02:30:42.211]  The quote is from a documentary entitled The Newburgh Sting, which tells how the Feds convinced four poverty-stricken New York men to become involved in an informant-led terror plot.
[02:30:42.211 --> 02:30:47.635]  The paid FBI informant is alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million dollars to execute an attack.
[02:30:48.559 --> 02:30:52.192]  We'll be talking about this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[02:30:52.192 --> 02:30:55.061]  So celebrate the 4th of July, but not if you're an FBI informant.
[02:30:59.247 --> 02:31:01.889]  Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:11.758 --> 02:31:19.365]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:31:19.565 --> 02:31:21.986]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[02:31:21.986 --> 02:31:28.607]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:28.607 --> 02:31:39.490]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:40.210]  We're good.

[02:32:28.949 --> 02:32:29.950]  Alex Jones here.
[02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:39.236]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:32:39.236 --> 02:32:43.039]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:33:00.609 --> 02:33:01.510]  Paul, guess what?
[02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.910]  What?
[02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:04.450]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[02:33:04.450 --> 02:33:06.671]  You see, we took the mic and we hit it up in the cell window.
[02:33:06.671 --> 02:33:07.931]  Wait a minute.
[02:33:07.931 --> 02:33:09.092]  What are you talking about?
[02:33:09.092 --> 02:33:11.432]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[02:33:11.432 --> 02:33:12.372]  You what?
[02:33:12.372 --> 02:33:14.473]  We bugged the cell with Arnold's tape recorder.
[02:33:14.473 --> 02:33:15.493]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[02:33:15.493 --> 02:33:16.353]  I can't listen to that.
[02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:18.534]  But Paul... Opie, I can't listen to that.
[02:33:18.534 --> 02:33:19.894]  I'm not permitted.
[02:33:19.894 --> 02:33:21.194]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[02:33:21.194 --> 02:33:23.275]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[02:33:24.255 --> 02:33:26.196]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[02:33:26.196 --> 02:33:27.897]  But, Paul, this is different.
[02:33:27.897 --> 02:33:29.598]  Yes, it's worse.
[02:33:29.598 --> 02:33:32.920]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:34.720]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:38.582]  But, Paul, if you just listen to this... Alfie, I can't listen.
[02:33:38.582 --> 02:33:39.843]  Paul, you're erasing the tape!
[02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:43.065]  That's what I mean to do.
[02:33:43.065 --> 02:33:47.287]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[02:33:47.287 --> 02:33:51.009]  Now, that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[02:33:51.579 --> 02:33:52.479]  But Pa!
[02:33:52.479 --> 02:33:53.740]  No buts!
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:55.681]  But if it helps the law?
[02:33:55.681 --> 02:34:00.503]  Opie, the law can't use this kind of help.
[02:34:00.503 --> 02:34:01.504]  What's his name?
[02:34:01.504 --> 02:34:03.544]  This is an emergency transmission.
[02:34:03.544 --> 02:34:13.349]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in the Occupy
[02:34:24.517 --> 02:34:26.218]  There is a war.
[02:34:26.218 --> 02:34:28.079]  It's happening now.
[02:34:28.079 --> 02:34:30.460]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:33.041]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:34:33.041 --> 02:34:34.942]  We are the resistance.
[02:34:34.942 --> 02:34:36.523]  We are the Infowar.
[02:34:43.351 --> 02:34:44.932]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:34:44.932 --> 02:34:46.473]  It's very, very simple.
[02:34:46.473 --> 02:35:09.265]  If you ask champions, a Ron Paul, a Jesse Ventura, whoever it is, to go out and to fight against the globalists, to fight against the open world government we're seeing, to fight against our water being stolen from the Great Lakes, to fight against the NAU being set up, the TPP, GMO, globalism, the government funding ISIS, then when people come after them, you've got to support them.
[02:35:11.304 --> 02:35:12.985]  And I think we're betting on a winner.
[02:35:12.985 --> 02:35:14.145]  He's already won once.
[02:35:14.145 --> 02:35:20.748]  I don't think that the courts are going to overturn the entire system of letting people get redressed in court.
[02:35:20.748 --> 02:35:26.231]  Because then people can argue that they're allowed to take it to the street.
[02:35:26.231 --> 02:35:33.314]  I mean, if you're going to let the media sit up there... I mean, I've had people in media before say I'm a drug dealer and a child molester.
[02:35:33.314 --> 02:35:34.434]  Two different media outfits.
[02:35:34.434 --> 02:35:36.755]  I sued them both.
[02:35:36.755 --> 02:35:37.836]  And I didn't want to sue them.
[02:35:39.192 --> 02:35:41.953]  But I had to get them to admit they were lying.
[02:35:41.953 --> 02:35:45.173]  Get them to stop saying it.
[02:35:45.173 --> 02:35:49.754]  People that are jealous of you, hate you, whatever, want to bring you down, they can't beat you.
[02:35:49.754 --> 02:35:55.295]  It's like if you have a better restaurant than the one across the street, they'll just say you feed dog meat or roaches.
[02:35:55.295 --> 02:35:57.436]  It's not true, you gotta sue them.
[02:35:57.436 --> 02:35:59.736]  Or they won't stop saying there's roaches in your food.
[02:35:59.736 --> 02:36:01.377]  Or rat turds.
[02:36:01.377 --> 02:36:02.717]  This is what losers do.
[02:36:02.717 --> 02:36:04.417]  This is how they operate.
[02:36:04.417 --> 02:36:07.618]  They think it's okay to sit there and lie about people,
[02:36:09.810 --> 02:36:11.690]  And then they want to be protected.
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:12.851]  I'm up here.
[02:36:12.851 --> 02:36:17.051]  I'm saying the things I say every day.
[02:36:17.051 --> 02:36:25.933]  And, knock on wood, I've never been sued, except for a copyright thing that got thrown out, for defamation.
[02:36:25.933 --> 02:36:28.494]  Never been sued for any of that because I watch what I say.
[02:36:28.494 --> 02:36:33.555]  May sound wild, but it's there.
[02:36:33.555 --> 02:36:35.335]  If I make a little mistake or something, I correct it.
[02:36:36.892 --> 02:36:42.474]  There's no malice of forethought with intent to do harm like what was done by the media to Jesse Ventura.
[02:36:42.474 --> 02:36:46.635]  They're coming after him and I'll tell you why.
[02:36:46.635 --> 02:36:49.376]  I would support a Rand Paul for president if he was going to get the nomination.
[02:36:49.376 --> 02:36:57.258]  They're fixing it where more and more it's looking like they're going to have Trump come in, pull votes away from libertarian type folks, libertarian republicans.
[02:36:57.258 --> 02:37:00.559]  We're going to go to Jesse Ventura on this in just a moment.
[02:37:02.697 --> 02:37:05.439]  And then that will catapult Jeb to the head.
[02:37:05.439 --> 02:37:08.600]  But Hillary's people are at Bilderberg, it looks like she's who they're planning on.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:13.023]  They're going to play the whole feminist card that if you don't like her, you don't like women.
[02:37:13.023 --> 02:37:15.344]  That type of baloney.
[02:37:15.344 --> 02:37:21.988]  But regardless, if there's a Jeb Bush, or there's a Hillary Clinton, I will support a third party move in this country.
[02:37:21.988 --> 02:37:25.430]  Because those people work together, they're CIA, it's all staged.
[02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:29.933]  Some would argue, hey, don't get libertarians running, don't get a strong candidate, it'll pull away from conservatives.
[02:37:31.974 --> 02:37:34.476]  And then the Democrats will win.
[02:37:34.476 --> 02:37:39.138]  Well, I mean, if it's the baners of the world, we don't need them.
[02:37:39.138 --> 02:37:44.041]  They give Obama more support than the Democrats do.
[02:37:44.041 --> 02:37:49.765]  So, regardless, just as be done by the heavens fall, Jesse Ventura needs to be supported.
[02:37:49.765 --> 02:37:59.711]  People need, we'll put the PO Box up on screen, so folks can send him checks, send him cash, whatever, and 100% of it will go towards the defense of his win.
[02:38:01.792 --> 02:38:06.118]  Show that he doesn't have to sell his house and basically be bankrupt and then they win.
[02:38:06.118 --> 02:38:08.521]  A lot of us giving a little bit can help this guy.
[02:38:08.521 --> 02:38:10.965]  That's what we're here to do, is a platform to help other patriots.
[02:38:12.381 --> 02:38:14.022]  We hang together, we hang separate.
[02:38:14.022 --> 02:38:15.383]  Appeals Fund, P.O.
[02:38:15.383 --> 02:38:17.944]  Box 10629 White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:38:17.944 --> 02:38:18.185]  P.O.
[02:38:18.185 --> 02:38:20.706]  Box 10629 White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:38:20.706 --> 02:38:23.828]  You can also go to aura.tv forward slash off the grid.
[02:38:32.313 --> 02:38:34.454]  And if I was them, I would set up a PayPal.
[02:38:34.454 --> 02:38:35.215]  Maybe they've already done it.
[02:38:35.215 --> 02:38:36.796]  That's where you really get the donations.
[02:38:36.796 --> 02:38:37.697]  I'd do a Kickstarter.
[02:38:37.697 --> 02:38:39.418]  I haven't had time to tell Ventura what I do.
[02:38:39.418 --> 02:38:40.238]  I'll just sit on air.
[02:38:40.238 --> 02:38:43.540]  I'd start a Kickstarter or something else.
[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:52.526]  And I would, you know, I'd say just to stop the Goliath media from, you know, legalizing lying.
[02:38:52.526 --> 02:38:53.667]  You know, a fund to stop them.
[02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:56.513]  A fund for justice.
[02:38:56.513 --> 02:38:57.433]  A fund for everybody.
[02:38:57.433 --> 02:39:04.899]  I would do that, I would have a PayPal immediately, but for now, PO Box 10629, White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:39:04.899 --> 02:39:16.007]  And I'd also email this video, once it's up tonight or tomorrow, from the radio slash TV show, to every media outlet and say, especially ones that are involved in this, to say, oh, we noticed you're not reporting
[02:39:16.687 --> 02:39:23.051]  On how an unprecedented case to overturn libel and slander laws and defamation laws in this country.
[02:39:23.051 --> 02:39:26.613]  I mean, this is an important story regardless.
[02:39:26.613 --> 02:39:29.115]  So, I would support Jesse Ventura.
[02:39:29.115 --> 02:39:31.416]  I know I'm going to write a check.
[02:39:31.416 --> 02:39:35.919]  We might even do a little fundraiser here ourselves because we hang together or we hang separate.
[02:39:35.919 --> 02:39:37.941]  Okay, Governor.
[02:39:37.941 --> 02:39:40.642]  The toll-free number to join us, take a few calls in the last segment, 800.
[02:39:42.142 --> 02:39:49.166]  259-9231-800-2599231 for quick questions for the Governor.
[02:39:49.166 --> 02:40:06.517]  But shifting gears to just the state of the world and everything that's happening at Election 2016, you told me bombshell political news that I think if we train it onto everything else that's happening and get some attention to why they're trying to politically assassinate you right now.
[02:40:06.517 --> 02:40:10.160]  And so I hope you'll go ahead and share that story right now on air.
[02:40:10.805 --> 02:40:21.834]  Well, through my son, apparently, a person fairly high up in the Libertarian Party is encouraging me to attend their convention, which they hold June of 2016.
[02:40:21.834 --> 02:40:24.876]  See, the Libertarians are brilliant.
[02:40:24.876 --> 02:40:25.957]  They don't waste money.
[02:40:26.978 --> 02:40:29.441]  They don't make their nomination until June.
[02:40:29.441 --> 02:40:41.697]  I mean, right now, these people are spending hundreds of millions of dollars spinning their wheels when, if you're like me, I truthfully, the election doesn't start until the summer before November.
[02:40:41.697 --> 02:40:43.039]  Basically, Labor Day on.
[02:40:43.599 --> 02:41:00.568]  But the Libertarians have put out a gesture to me to come to their convention and that I would have a very good chance of getting their nomination for president and that I would be on their, the Libertarians virtually have ballot access I think pretty well across the whole United States, every state.
[02:41:01.348 --> 02:41:03.829]  But one thing we'll have to be clear on.
[02:41:03.829 --> 02:41:06.250]  I do not want to join them as a party.
[02:41:06.250 --> 02:41:13.413]  If they endorse me, I want it to be clear they're endorsing me, they're giving me the nomination if I so choose to go after it.
[02:41:13.413 --> 02:41:24.998]  But I want to be able to have the armament, Alex, of being the first presidential president elected since George Washington, who does not belong to a political party.
[02:41:24.998 --> 02:41:27.459]  I need that from them, that they won't
[02:41:28.163 --> 02:41:36.069]  Require me to be in their party to receive their nomination because that's firepower that I think you could win the election with.
[02:41:36.069 --> 02:41:37.731]  It's that simple thing.
[02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:44.396]  If you could be the first president who does not belong to a political party since the father of our country, George Washington.
[02:41:44.756 --> 02:41:45.856]  Well, that makes sense.
[02:41:45.856 --> 02:41:54.460]  People should nominate whoever's the best for the job and who has integrity at these conventions anyways, not someone who's been a party hack for 50 years.
[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:55.760]  Not just that alone.
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.442]  We need to break the stranglehold of these two political, as Ralph Nader called them,
[02:42:01.363 --> 02:42:04.567]  You could run on destroying the fraudulent two-party system.
[02:42:04.567 --> 02:42:07.451]  And you've already done it as a mayor and a governor.
[02:42:19.566 --> 02:42:21.527]  But that's what you gotta do.
[02:42:21.527 --> 02:42:24.870]  The key to me, and the advantage is in our favor.
[02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:26.651]  Look at the last national election.
[02:42:26.651 --> 02:42:31.354]  64% of the people failed to turn out to vote.
[02:42:31.354 --> 02:42:34.036]  Well, those are my potential customers.
[02:42:34.036 --> 02:42:36.197]  Those are my potential voters.
[02:42:36.197 --> 02:42:41.041]  If I can rejuvenate them to come back and watch their vote count, you win.
[02:42:41.781 --> 02:42:44.962]  Sure, well your son works at News Media.
[02:42:44.962 --> 02:42:47.483]  Your son works at News Media, that's how they were able to contact him.
[02:42:47.483 --> 02:42:50.824]  I can get a hold of the President of the Libertarian Party, probably today.
[02:42:50.824 --> 02:42:54.106]  Do you want me to call him and get them on the phone with you?
[02:42:54.106 --> 02:42:54.466]  No, not yet.
[02:42:54.466 --> 02:42:54.726]  Not yet?
[02:42:54.726 --> 02:43:03.649]  Because I don't want to, Alex, I don't want to get in too early.
[02:43:03.649 --> 02:43:06.010]  I want to wait until it's down to two.
[02:43:06.010 --> 02:43:08.591]  Let the pikers jump in there now.
[02:43:08.591 --> 02:43:10.932]  I don't want nothing to do with it until June of next year.
[02:43:13.669 --> 02:43:16.592]  It's all in the timing.
[02:43:16.592 --> 02:43:19.956]  Well, we'll deal with that.
[02:43:19.956 --> 02:43:21.818]  We're dealing with that right now.
[02:43:21.818 --> 02:43:26.302]  If we succeed on that level, it'll open the door for me next June.
[02:43:26.302 --> 02:43:29.506]  If I fail, then close the door on next June.
[02:43:29.506 --> 02:43:31.268]  There's another alternative.
[02:43:31.268 --> 02:43:35.212]  If I fail in this lawsuit, you can forget about next June.
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:48.676]  Well, I'll tell you this, I've got a lot of Republican friends that are Libertarians, they're trying to take over the Republican Party, and we've seen the Tea Party do that partially, but still, Boehner just came in with everybody else's steamroll with the TPP and the rest of it.
[02:43:48.676 --> 02:43:50.879]  I mean, I'm of one school of thought that
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:52.400]  Exactly.
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:52.801]  It is anyway.
[02:44:13.909 --> 02:44:19.133]  The corporate powers have paid off both of these parties, Alex.
[02:44:19.133 --> 02:44:22.356]  And it's like going to the Super Bowl and you bet on both teams.
[02:44:22.356 --> 02:44:25.758]  You can't lose then, can you?
[02:44:25.758 --> 02:44:29.481]  No, the establishment... but I mean, they really own Hillary and Jeb.
[02:44:29.481 --> 02:44:31.843]  I mean, it's sick.
[02:44:31.843 --> 02:44:37.748]  They'll own everybody, any candidate that comes out of these two parties.
[02:44:37.748 --> 02:44:40.590]  I'll be interested to see what happens with Bernie Saunders.
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:48.287]  Because he's not, he's building momentum and he's not going to get the Democratic, will he continue with the race?
[02:44:48.287 --> 02:44:51.430]  Or will he then step aside and let Hillary have it in the end?
[02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:55.114]  Yeah, he can still have a Democrat vote, I love that idea.
[02:44:55.114 --> 02:44:58.137]  I don't know, I don't know what will happen on that end.
[02:44:58.137 --> 02:45:02.962]  But, you know, all I know is that I want more than two choices.
[02:45:02.962 --> 02:45:04.384]  I want more than Coke and Pepsi.
[02:45:07.401 --> 02:45:08.322]  Well, we know this.
[02:45:08.322 --> 02:45:12.166]  The country is in dire, dire straits.
[02:45:12.166 --> 02:45:14.849]  TPP is in place, basically, now.
[02:45:14.849 --> 02:45:16.350]  What would you do as president?
[02:45:16.350 --> 02:45:21.796]  If you were elected president, under your constitutional powers, what would you do in the first month?
[02:45:21.796 --> 02:45:29.024]  Well, first of all, I'd have to have good people with me to tell me exactly what my constitutional powers are.
[02:45:30.149 --> 02:45:39.951]  And then once learning that, what I would do, some of the first things I would do, I would pull us out of the Middle East.
[02:45:39.951 --> 02:45:42.432]  We would not be fighting a war over there anymore.
[02:45:42.432 --> 02:45:44.872]  Would you put Ron Paul in your cabinet?
[02:45:44.872 --> 02:45:46.573]  If he wanted to be, absolutely.
[02:45:46.573 --> 02:45:49.814]  I'd love to put him in charge of the banks.
[02:45:49.814 --> 02:45:51.354]  Secretary of Treasury?
[02:45:51.354 --> 02:45:51.614]  Yeah.
[02:45:52.515 --> 02:46:04.961]  I'd laugh off to put Ron Paul, because he's a brilliant guy and when it comes to the central bank stuff, there's not a guy I know that knows better than him.
[02:46:04.961 --> 02:46:05.762]  Very exciting.
[02:46:05.762 --> 02:46:06.562]  What else would you do?
[02:46:06.562 --> 02:46:09.504]  Would you continue like Obama's done, the war on marijuana?
[02:46:10.294 --> 02:46:12.174]  No, that's another thing I would do.
[02:46:12.174 --> 02:46:15.735]  I would stop the entire war on drugs.
[02:46:15.735 --> 02:46:20.856]  It's a miserable failure, and my belief is this.
[02:46:20.856 --> 02:46:25.937]  Addiction should not be treated criminally, it should be treated medically.
[02:46:25.937 --> 02:46:28.137]  You can be addicted to caffeine.
[02:46:28.137 --> 02:46:35.278]  How many people out there that listen to you, Alex, have to get up and have a morning cup of coffee to get their caffeine going?
[02:46:35.278 --> 02:46:38.339]  What's the difference between that and all the other ones?
[02:46:38.559 --> 02:46:41.462]  Hey, these energy drinks are like cocaine or something.
[02:46:41.462 --> 02:46:44.485]  You're damn right, and the point is nothing.
[02:46:44.485 --> 02:46:52.193]  My point is that the government, that you should not be convicted of anything that you do with your own body.
[02:46:52.193 --> 02:46:53.774]  That's your business.
[02:46:53.774 --> 02:46:58.179]  You talk about the Fourth Amendment, illegal search, a reasonable search and seizure.
[02:46:58.659 --> 02:47:03.683]  How is it reasonable for them to check your body for what you want to put into it or ingest it?
[02:47:03.683 --> 02:47:05.705]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[02:47:05.705 --> 02:47:10.869]  If you take drugs and go rob the bank, I will prosecute you for robbing the bank.
[02:47:10.869 --> 02:47:13.752]  I don't give a damn what you took that made you do it.
[02:47:13.752 --> 02:47:16.895]  You'll get prosecuted for the crime.
[02:47:16.895 --> 02:47:18.496]  Oh yeah, they use drugs as an excuse.
[02:47:18.496 --> 02:47:19.437]  I'm sick of that.
[02:47:19.437 --> 02:47:22.840]  I would completely end the war on drugs right now.
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:26.723]  Colorado's making a billion dollars this year selling marijuana.
[02:47:27.702 --> 02:47:32.724]  The budget for the judiciary in Washington has already dropped 15 percent.
[02:47:32.724 --> 02:47:34.525]  That's massive.
[02:47:34.525 --> 02:47:36.826]  Because of their legalization just of marijuana.
[02:47:36.826 --> 02:47:38.986]  Yeah, they're not prosecuting people and they're taxing it.
[02:47:38.986 --> 02:47:39.887]  Let's take a call.
[02:47:39.887 --> 02:47:45.509]  Elijah in California listening on KOMY 1340 AM.
[02:47:45.509 --> 02:47:46.409]  They're in Santa Cruz.
[02:47:46.409 --> 02:47:47.270]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:49.491]  Welcome.
[02:47:49.491 --> 02:47:52.572]  Now, I want to know what you're going to do with the TPP thing.
[02:47:53.536 --> 02:47:59.362]  Senator Paul is the only one, sadly, to say that it come out against it.
[02:47:59.362 --> 02:48:02.666]  Now, if you and him link up, what do you think about that?
[02:48:02.666 --> 02:48:03.987]  That's a good question, Jesse.
[02:48:03.987 --> 02:48:05.049]  What would you do to the TPP?
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:06.980]  Well, it'd be difficult.
[02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:13.302]  I mean, if they pass it through and they sign it, you know, you've got to abide by contracts or whatever.
[02:48:13.302 --> 02:48:15.202]  I would do everything to end it.
[02:48:15.202 --> 02:48:18.103]  Well, you could bully Colpin against it and get Congress to repeal it.
[02:48:18.103 --> 02:48:24.584]  Yeah, because to me, these trade agreements, it's one thing if it's a level playing field, but it never is.
[02:48:24.584 --> 02:48:34.646]  And in the case of this thing, you're looking at sweatshops, you're looking at slave labor, you're looking at the very things that this country has fought for hundreds of years to get rid of.
[02:48:35.904 --> 02:48:39.283]  And it ties directly into our own country's assault on the unions.
[02:48:39.992 --> 02:48:41.853]  Now, can unions be bad?
[02:48:41.853 --> 02:48:42.794]  Of course they can.
[02:48:42.794 --> 02:48:44.335]  They're run by people.
[02:48:44.335 --> 02:48:47.777]  And when bad people get power, bad things happen.
[02:48:47.777 --> 02:48:52.639]  But unions are still the backbone that created the middle class in this country.
[02:48:52.639 --> 02:48:54.440]  Collapsible bargaining.
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:58.443]  But they got taken over and, I mean, remember the unions supported Naftan Gantt.
[02:48:58.443 --> 02:49:00.224]  That's suicide!
[02:49:00.224 --> 02:49:01.805]  Let's go ahead and, but you're right.
[02:49:01.805 --> 02:49:04.246]  I mean, it is good to have a checks and balances.
[02:49:04.246 --> 02:49:05.707]  Let's go to Robert in Missouri.
[02:49:05.707 --> 02:49:06.307]  You're on the air.
[02:49:06.307 --> 02:49:07.388]  Go ahead, Jesse Ventura.
[02:49:08.925 --> 02:49:23.814]  Hey, uh, guys, uh, I think the only feasible way, Jesse, if you're really serious about running for, as an alternative candidate to the two parties, is to basically consolidate a few of the parties together, such as Libertarians, the Constitution Party... Well, let me explain.
[02:49:23.814 --> 02:49:25.375]  That doesn't work.
[02:49:25.375 --> 02:49:29.097]  I tried when I was governor of Minnesota to bring we had four or five
[02:49:30.177 --> 02:49:32.958]  Political parties other than the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:49:32.958 --> 02:49:35.159]  I held a meeting at the governor's residence.
[02:49:35.159 --> 02:49:37.100]  I brought the leaders all together.
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.201]  It was like herding cats.
[02:49:39.201 --> 02:49:40.561]  They all got their ego.
[02:49:40.561 --> 02:49:42.682]  They all got their main issue.
[02:49:42.682 --> 02:49:47.224]  And the one thing we could all agree upon was campaign finance reform.
[02:49:47.224 --> 02:49:49.264]  None of us took dirty money.
[02:49:49.264 --> 02:49:52.866]  And I said, can't we start from there and build and have one candidate?
[02:49:53.426 --> 02:49:56.267]  It was, like I said, herding cats.
[02:49:56.267 --> 02:49:57.607]  It did no good.
[02:49:57.607 --> 02:50:01.988]  So I ended it right there because at the end of the day we accomplished nothing.
[02:50:01.988 --> 02:50:07.429]  Everybody wants to be in charge and nobody will listen to anybody else.
[02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:08.069]  That's right.
[02:50:08.069 --> 02:50:12.250]  My show, I'm trying to build a coalition of people that are against being conquered by these foreign banks.
[02:50:12.250 --> 02:50:18.912]  I mean, while we're all fighting with each other over petty issues, we've been conquered and now they're getting rid of the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:50:20.356 --> 02:50:22.238]  Let's go to Chad in Washington.
[02:50:22.238 --> 02:50:24.239]  Chad, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[02:50:24.239 --> 02:50:26.161]  We're skipping this network break.
[02:50:26.161 --> 02:50:27.162]  Go ahead, Chad.
[02:50:27.162 --> 02:50:29.724]  Hey guys.
[02:50:29.724 --> 02:50:33.587]  Yeah, I just wanted to know what you plan on doing about Geoengineering.
[02:50:33.587 --> 02:50:37.650]  Because I know you had Kim Caldera on a while back.
[02:50:37.650 --> 02:50:38.311]  Yes, Governor.
[02:50:38.311 --> 02:50:39.292]  Kim trailing.
[02:50:39.292 --> 02:50:42.294]  These secret programs, I admit, are going on but are classified.
[02:50:42.294 --> 02:50:43.355]  What would you do as President?
[02:50:44.062 --> 02:50:51.273]  Well, to me, everything should be declassified after a certain length of time because we are the boss.
[02:50:51.273 --> 02:50:52.875]  The American people.
[02:50:52.875 --> 02:50:58.564]  And how dare them use our tax dollars to do things and not tell us what they do with it?
[02:50:58.564 --> 02:50:59.365]  It's that simple.
[02:50:59.965 --> 02:51:03.927]  I and you have the right to know what our taxes are spent on.
[02:51:03.927 --> 02:51:08.270]  We have every right to know that, and to me, that is a major right.
[02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:17.375]  You have the major right to know what they're spending your money on, and if they're spending it on chemtrails, we need to know why, how, and what for.
[02:51:17.375 --> 02:51:19.696]  Okay, let's talk to Trish in Canada.
[02:51:19.696 --> 02:51:22.658]  Trish, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[02:51:22.658 --> 02:51:23.578]  Good day, gentlemen.
[02:51:23.578 --> 02:51:24.859]  How are you today?
[02:51:24.859 --> 02:51:25.059]  Good.
[02:51:27.239 --> 02:51:33.141]  Governor, would you comment on Blue Gold, our planet's water supply?
[02:51:33.141 --> 02:51:41.704]  Well, it's in trouble, because you can see the big guy in Texas bought all that land, I forget his name now, by the aquifer in Oklahoma.
[02:51:41.704 --> 02:51:43.505]  They got the funny name down there.
[02:51:43.505 --> 02:51:44.845]  Yeah, T-Bone Pickens.
[02:51:44.845 --> 02:51:45.746]  Yeah, there you go, T-Bone.
[02:51:45.746 --> 02:51:46.806]  I always forget.
[02:51:46.806 --> 02:51:48.286]  Yeah, he bought all that land.
[02:51:48.286 --> 02:51:51.968]  Plus, a fifth of the world's fresh water is the Great Lakes.
[02:51:54.229 --> 02:51:57.631]  You're not allowed to take water from the Great Lakes.
[02:51:57.631 --> 02:51:59.853]  But, as usual, they left an out.
[02:51:59.853 --> 02:52:01.174]  They left a loophole.
[02:52:01.174 --> 02:52:04.976]  You can go to a tributary and suck out all the water you want.
[02:52:04.976 --> 02:52:08.518]  So the Great Lakes are falling at a drastic rate.
[02:52:08.518 --> 02:52:10.760]  The other thing... They ship it to China!
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:11.841]  Well, it's true.
[02:52:11.841 --> 02:52:13.882]  The other thing is this fracking.
[02:52:13.882 --> 02:52:17.825]  A lot of people think it's wonderful that we got fracking to get oil.
[02:52:17.825 --> 02:52:21.267]  No, it's not, because they trade water for oil.
[02:52:21.987 --> 02:52:25.710]  Well, Common Core says 2 plus 2 equals 5, so I guess you drink the oil.
[02:52:48.702 --> 02:52:51.165]  Unfortunately, I picked the water.
[02:52:51.165 --> 02:52:56.750]  As we all know, you can't survive drinking oil.
[02:52:56.750 --> 02:52:58.872]  I was being sarcastic, absolutely.
[02:52:58.872 --> 02:53:07.239]  I want to play a short piece of what Ron Paul said about an hour and a half ago here on the broadcast with us about the state of the world economy and get your take on that.
[02:53:07.239 --> 02:53:09.001]  Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[02:53:09.001 --> 02:53:10.002]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:53:10.888 --> 02:53:15.571]  Yeah, I think for that not to come would be a surprise to me.
[02:53:15.571 --> 02:53:17.712]  And you've been involved in this a long time.
[02:53:17.712 --> 02:53:20.674]  I mean, it wasn't like you didn't know what was happening with the housing bubble.
[02:53:20.674 --> 02:53:23.496]  And we had the Nasdaq bubble.
[02:53:23.496 --> 02:53:25.577]  And now we have other bubbles.
[02:53:25.577 --> 02:53:27.218]  We still have another stock market bubble.
[02:53:27.218 --> 02:53:29.040]  And there's another housing bubble going on.
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:31.281]  But the big bubble, I think, is in the bond bubble.
[02:53:31.281 --> 02:53:35.644]  It's been going on for 35 years, taking interest rates from 21% down to actually negative.
[02:53:37.925 --> 02:53:39.486]  And they've been getting away with it.
[02:53:39.486 --> 02:53:41.587]  So this means distortion.
[02:53:41.587 --> 02:53:46.329]  Not only is there money involved, but it distorted all the investment over these periods of time.
[02:53:46.329 --> 02:53:49.310]  And the biggest distortion that it encourages is debt.
[02:53:49.310 --> 02:53:53.212]  It encourages debt for a lot of people, but in particular, government.
[02:53:53.212 --> 02:54:01.735]  And as long as our government is able to print the reserve currency, it's going to limp along, even though our economy is limping along.
[02:54:01.735 --> 02:54:03.036]  But that will come to an end.
[02:54:03.796 --> 02:54:07.658]  And right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming apart.
[02:54:07.658 --> 02:54:10.680]  I mean, we look at Detroit as an example.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.401]  We see what's happening in Greece.
[02:54:12.401 --> 02:54:19.245]  They're worrying about what's going to happen, you know, after Greece is recognized as actually totally bankrupt.
[02:54:19.245 --> 02:54:20.926]  There'll be other countries.
[02:54:20.926 --> 02:54:23.007]  This distortion has been going on for so long.
[02:54:23.007 --> 02:54:30.671]  Most people think that when governments print money, that the only thing that happens is that prices go up as a consequence of inflation.
[02:54:30.911 --> 02:54:31.171]  A lot
[02:55:01.531 --> 02:55:04.493]  The day of reckoning is at hand.
[02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:11.276]  Governor Ventura, you did a whole special banking report on this, I guess about four years ago, on one of your hit TV program episodes.
[02:55:11.276 --> 02:55:12.937]  Went to Wall Street, interviewed the experts.
[02:55:12.937 --> 02:55:15.218]  They even admitted that we were right about this.
[02:55:15.218 --> 02:55:17.999]  Now Puerto Rico says they're going bankrupt.
[02:55:17.999 --> 02:55:19.360]  Most counties are bankrupt.
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:21.080]  Most cities are.
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:22.681]  People aren't self-sufficient.
[02:55:22.681 --> 02:55:24.502]  I mean, government's digging in.
[02:55:24.502 --> 02:55:26.443]  Elites are moving to armored redoubts.
[02:55:26.443 --> 02:55:28.764]  What does Jesse Ventura in his gut think is really going on?
[02:55:29.557 --> 02:55:35.981]  Well, you know, it's a bad situation because we've allowed this debt to run wild.
[02:55:35.981 --> 02:55:46.066]  As Congressman Paul said, I mean, the last time I heard a child born today starts its life off $50,000 in debt.
[02:55:46.066 --> 02:55:49.348]  Now, that's ridiculous, that's obscene.
[02:55:49.348 --> 02:55:51.789]  And that child's not even going to get a job for 18 years.
[02:55:53.473 --> 02:56:00.077]  How far in debt will that child be 18 years after being born with the way that we have ignored?
[02:56:00.077 --> 02:56:01.778]  And who's to blame for all this?
[02:56:01.778 --> 02:56:03.499]  The Democrats and Republicans.
[02:56:03.499 --> 02:56:08.362]  Because they've been in charge for 150 years and they are responsible.
[02:56:08.362 --> 02:56:09.763]  I've said it before.
[02:56:09.763 --> 02:56:16.267]  If they would run their home finances like they ran the government's, they'd be street people living out of bags.
[02:56:17.256 --> 02:56:20.118]  But this is what it's turned into.
[02:56:20.118 --> 02:56:24.741]  I think the biggest problem is this debt is going to come home to roost.
[02:56:24.741 --> 02:56:30.385]  And when it does, I don't know what the results are going to be, Alex.
[02:56:30.385 --> 02:56:31.185]  I know this.
[02:56:31.185 --> 02:56:34.908]  It's got me guaranteed wanting to get a place even further out in the country.
[02:56:34.908 --> 02:56:36.809]  And thank God for the Second Amendment.
[02:56:36.809 --> 02:56:44.634]  Jesse Ventura Appeal Fund, they're trying to... 33 to Goliaths are trying to stop him and overturn his victory against Chris Kyle.
[02:56:45.615 --> 02:56:48.597]  And the fable, he told, according to the jury, totally made up.
[02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:49.497]  Jury found it.
[02:56:49.497 --> 02:56:52.619]  Judge wrote a big 20-something page opinion saying, dead on.
[02:56:52.619 --> 02:56:58.822]  PO Box 10629, White Bear Lake, Minnesota 55110.
[02:56:58.822 --> 02:57:00.023]  And look, we're going to lose everything.
[02:57:00.023 --> 02:57:04.706]  There's so many middle class and wealthy people who aren't globalists who sit back on the sidelines.
[02:57:04.706 --> 02:57:06.406]  You're not safe doing that.
[02:57:06.406 --> 02:57:07.427]  It's all coming down.
[02:57:07.427 --> 02:57:09.908]  You've got to be all in or we're going to lose it.
[02:57:09.908 --> 02:57:10.949]  And we've got more calls for you.
[02:57:10.949 --> 02:57:12.190]  I know you have to go, Jesse Ventura.
[02:57:13.169 --> 02:57:14.871]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'll say this.
[02:57:14.871 --> 02:57:18.014]  If you want me on more weekly or every other week, I'm happy to do it.
[02:57:34.983 --> 02:57:39.124]  Please, please get a PayPal or a Kickstarter, because that's how you're really going to get support.
[02:57:39.124 --> 02:57:42.846]  I'm just happy to come on with you and keep talking and waking people up.
[02:57:42.846 --> 02:57:43.346]  Oh, I know!
[02:57:43.346 --> 02:57:46.627]  I mean, I go on your show, you invite me on your TV and radio show, I want to do it.
[02:57:46.627 --> 02:57:52.069]  I understand you're saying that you want to come on just to talk, but I'm saying I want to raise a bunch of money to help you win this thing, brother.
[02:57:52.609 --> 02:58:03.543]  Well, I'll get to all that, but you know, that's important, but the important thing is making vigilant citizens out there and waking people up and taking our country back.
[02:58:03.543 --> 02:58:05.646]  And we can do it at the ballot box.
[02:58:05.646 --> 02:58:06.968]  We still have that power.
[02:58:08.014 --> 02:58:11.755]  And I just like to finish and say thank you, Alex, for all your support.
[02:58:11.755 --> 02:58:13.296]  You've been terrific.
[02:58:13.296 --> 02:58:16.477]  And we'll keep the fight going as long as we possibly can.
[02:58:16.477 --> 02:58:20.559]  I mean, I'm in for the duration and we'll see what happens on this deal.
[02:58:20.559 --> 02:58:23.040]  But thanks to all your listeners out there.
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:25.080]  And I really, really appreciate it.
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:27.961]  And always remember, the truth will set you free.
[02:58:27.961 --> 02:58:32.083]  The truth is still an ultimate good thing, no matter what they tell you.
[02:58:32.483 --> 02:58:34.284]  Alright, let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:58:34.284 --> 02:58:35.085]  Absolutely.
[02:58:35.085 --> 02:58:38.007]  And not only is this cause just, when I'm somebody's friend, I'm their friend.
[02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:39.488]  So I stand with Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:39.488 --> 02:58:40.489]  Please stand with him, with me.
[02:58:40.489 --> 02:58:41.950]  This is a very important fight.
[02:58:41.950 --> 02:58:43.471]  He's taking on the whole beast.
[02:58:43.471 --> 02:58:44.311]  We'll be back in Overdrive.
[02:58:44.311 --> 02:58:45.172]  I'm gonna say bye to the Governor.
[02:58:49.730 --> 02:59:09.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:59:09.486 --> 02:59:13.890]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:59:14.130 --> 02:59:14.751]  We're good.
[02:59:36.493 --> 02:59:38.355]  You pick it up at the local sporting goods store.
[02:59:38.355 --> 02:59:42.719]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[02:59:42.719 --> 02:59:47.403]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[02:59:47.403 --> 02:59:52.307]  HDFirearms.com.
[02:59:52.307 --> 02:59:54.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.515 --> 03:00:09.160]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:09.160 --> 03:00:12.122]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.348 --> 03:00:21.969]  Being steadfast, being loyal, being honorable is what built this free civilization that's now rotting.
[03:00:21.969 --> 03:00:29.931]  And I tell you, when stuff hits rock bottom, being honorable, having a good name is going to be the most valuable thing in the world.
[03:00:29.931 --> 03:00:32.531]  As Ron Paul said, we're going into a collapse.
[03:00:32.531 --> 03:00:37.372]  The great threat is that they'll use the great collapse to bring in total tyranny.
[03:00:37.372 --> 03:00:42.373]  We must mobilize, maximize to come out of the collapse a freer people.
[03:00:43.373 --> 03:00:45.296]  I get chills when I talk about it.
[03:00:45.296 --> 03:00:50.502]  We have reached a legendary, epic, over-the-top important moment.
[03:00:50.502 --> 03:01:00.075]  I want to finish up with some of the highlights of the powerful, the most powerful Ron Paul interview I've ever done, that we're going to be posting in full in the next few hours to InfoWars.com.
[03:01:00.075 --> 03:01:01.717]  But here's Ron Paul on the day of reckoning.
[03:01:04.810 --> 03:01:09.415]  And that's why they over-build and over-invest and governments over-spend.
[03:01:09.415 --> 03:01:17.523]  And then you have the Keynesians still in charge that says the solution for this is just to spend more money and prep more money.
[03:01:17.523 --> 03:01:18.764]  And that's coming to an end.
[03:01:18.764 --> 03:01:21.126]  The day of reckoning is at hand.
[03:01:22.888 --> 03:01:36.982]  So, the governments will lie to us, they'll get away with it for a long time, there will be an illusion and a false trust, and we will benefit tremendously because we have a military might, and because we have this privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world.
[03:01:36.982 --> 03:01:43.728]  But you know, the obligations that we have, the unfunded obligations over $2 trillion, you know, $200 trillion,
[03:01:45.450 --> 03:01:47.112]  That is not going to be paid.
[03:01:47.112 --> 03:01:52.878]  And the only arguments this goes on with these countries like in Greece and others, is who's going to get stuck?
[03:01:52.878 --> 03:01:56.942]  And the bankers are worried they're going to get stuck, and that's what they argue about.
[03:01:56.942 --> 03:02:01.366]  But the debt will not be paid, and we cannot pay our debt.
[03:02:01.366 --> 03:02:03.008]  It's just a matter of time.
[03:02:03.008 --> 03:02:05.150]  But people say, well, tell me when, tell me when.
[03:02:05.490 --> 03:02:29.004]  Well, nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event, but you can tell when the foundation has eroded, and the foundation, not only of our economic system, but the world financial system, like no other time in history, has been eroded, and there's going to be serious problems because there will have to be a correction of this, and you can't correct it with more spending and more debt, which is what they're trying to do.
[03:02:29.404 --> 03:02:47.375]  Well, yes, the bottom is falling out, and this is the big problem, because it's unsustainable, and eventually the people will have to, you know, recognize this, and something else has to change.
[03:02:47.375 --> 03:02:57.461]  The system is not viable, but there's always this willingness to try to prop it up, like we did in 2008 and 2009, we propped it up.
[03:02:58.021 --> 03:03:00.324]  But the debt is illiquid.
[03:03:00.324 --> 03:03:01.765]  It's not worth anything.
[03:03:01.765 --> 03:03:04.308]  The sooner you liquidate the debt, the better.
[03:03:04.308 --> 03:03:07.332]  You cannot preserve the debt.
[03:03:07.332 --> 03:03:16.942]  My argument is, and you alluded to this, is the fact that, you know, this is big problems for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of wealth and even some wealthy people are going to lose out.
[03:03:17.583 --> 03:03:26.434]  But everybody has to adjust to the fact that there will be a change, and there will be a liquidation, and there will be living beneath our means.
[03:03:26.434 --> 03:03:30.098]  We've lived way beyond our means, but it's what we do about it.
[03:03:30.098 --> 03:03:32.981]  If we keep doing the wrong things, it'll last too long.
[03:03:32.981 --> 03:03:37.527]  This is already, this recession, which is really a depression, is lasting too long.
[03:03:37.987 --> 03:03:44.191]  So if we do this, what we have to preserve is our liberty.
[03:03:44.191 --> 03:03:55.198]  Because if we do, if we eliminate all our wealth and have our liberties, where you just eliminate all those things you just listed here and what our government is going to do, we would be back on our feet rather shortly.
[03:03:55.198 --> 03:03:56.778]  But that's where the real crisis is.
[03:03:57.759 --> 03:04:11.305]  If we don't build our strength on those individuals who know and understand what liberty is all about, we're going to lose our wealth, we're going to further lose our liberty, and all that is going to be available is some guy walking in with a white horse and saying, I'm in charge now.
[03:04:11.305 --> 03:04:16.627]  If you listen to what I'm going to do, I will deliver you from all the tragedy that exists.
[03:04:16.627 --> 03:04:19.829]  That's former Congressman Ron Paul warning us of a dictatorship.
[03:04:19.829 --> 03:04:22.670]  That's what the man on the white horse says.
[03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:26.392]  Just incredibly important information, and we're getting so much closer to it.
[03:04:27.108 --> 03:04:28.329]  Spain's already there.
[03:04:28.329 --> 03:04:29.670]  Greece is already there.
[03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:31.351]  Ireland's already there.
[03:04:31.351 --> 03:04:33.373]  Latin America is already there.
[03:04:33.373 --> 03:04:35.874]  Mexico's permanently there.
[03:04:35.874 --> 03:04:38.556]  You fall, you fall hard.
[03:04:38.556 --> 03:04:41.719]  I want to say the radio crew did a superlative job
[03:04:43.035 --> 03:04:44.236]  Today.
[03:04:44.236 --> 03:04:45.698]  We'll be in the old radio studio tomorrow.
[03:04:45.698 --> 03:04:45.978]  We do that.
[03:04:45.978 --> 03:04:46.799]  We have a skeleton crew.
