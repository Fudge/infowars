[00:30.000 --> 00:45.000]  Pop the enemy number one, jailbreak and our smoking done
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  You won't believe the things I've done, and the killing is just for fun
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  Pop the enemy number one, a storm card, I'm on the run
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  Through the night till the rising sun, and the trouble's just begun
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  Rose this on your grave, I'll be on my way
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  I'm invincible, you might say despicable
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  Punishments reciprocal, public enemy number one
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  I'm unbeatable, my mind is not treatable
[01:36.000 --> 01:54.000]  Crimes unrepeatable, public enemy number one
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  Public enemy number one, watch the authorities come undone
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  Would defy standoff that I've won, flirting death is just for fun
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Public enemy number one, born of fugitive father's son
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  Another heist of a blank is done, and the trouble is just begun
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  Rose this on your grave, I'll be on my way
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[02:33.000 --> 02:57.000]  I'm insensible
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[03:05.000 --> 03:17.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[03:17.000 --> 03:27.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[03:27.000 --> 03:37.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[03:37.000 --> 04:05.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[04:05.000 --> 04:33.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies I've made
[04:33.000 --> 05:01.000]  There's no time to stay, with the enemies
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  And on its ashes, constructing world government
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[05:42.000 --> 05:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic

[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  The crazy part is he's usually right
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.000]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  And it's a real eye-opener
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.000]  I can't stress this enough
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  Big Brother
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Big Brother
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Mainstream Media
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  Government Cover-Ups
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  You want answers?
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  Well, so does he
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  It's Alex Jones
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  On the GCN Radio Network
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  Our eyes for the next 25 minutes or so
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  Dave Mustaine joins us
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Of course he was on Jimmy Kimmel
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  A few nights ago and brought down the house
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  His new album kicked off November 1st
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  And has raced to the top of the charts across the board
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  The new album is 13
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  He has the single public enemy
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Number 1, we opened up the start of the show with
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  Coming up before he leaves us
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  We'll play at least part of We the People
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  I think my favorite piece off of the new album
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  Will give you the websites and more
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  Of course it's been put out by Roadrunner
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Records Dave Mustaine joins us from his home in San Diego
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  Dave, great to have you here with us again
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Thanks, good to be here
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  Wow, the big four
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  The biggest concert in the world right now
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  I mean, am I wrong or is
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  Megadeth turbocharged right now?
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  Yeah, we're completely turbocharged in it
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  I mean, you guys are taking it up to the next level
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  So much is going on
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  What is on Dave Mustaine's mind right now?
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  Well, we leave Monday for South America
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  We've got Gigantor coming up next year
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  I've got this incredible new thing
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  From a company called Rock Prodigy
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  Coming out of the guitar application
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  That basically I'm inside of your
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  iPad or your iPhone
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Teaching you how to play guitar
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  That's going to be coming out next week
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And it's got public enemy in that
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  Couple other really great Megadeth songs
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  Holy Wars and tornado of souls too
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  Stuff like that
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And then we're going to be heading over
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Next year to Europe to make up what we missed out
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  You know, doing the big four thing was so huge
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  There's a lot of little cities
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Got skipped in between that we like to play
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  So we've got a lot of things we've got to make up
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Tell us about the big four
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  Are we going to see more of that?
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  I hope so, I hope so
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  You know, that was totally unplanned
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  Something that came out of the book
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Just like my book
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  You know, the success of that was mind blowing too
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  So having all these things happen
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  It's just really, it's foreign for me
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  So having an opportunity to go and play
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  Again, another big four show
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  Yeah, of course you could do it
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  The problem is that the four outfits
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  All four of us are so thick that
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  To get all four groups free
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  In the same neck of the woods
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  And able to do this
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's a big undertaking
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Well, it is
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  I mean, you're trying to get four hugely successful
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  You know, top metal bands together
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  At the same time, that's got to be rough
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  When you guys are all in such demand
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  Across the world, you know
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.000]  Looking at the numbers
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  I mean, Megadeth is probably
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  My favorite rock band of all time
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  But when you look at the entire genre
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  It seems that heavy metal itself
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  Is even more popular now outside of the United States
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  Is that fair to say, Dave?
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  You know, it's funny, Alex
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  Because when times are rough people
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  They buckle down and heavy metal
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Is, I believe, the anthem
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Of people, the underdog
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  And persevering
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  A lot of the lyrics that we talk about
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  Has to do with the fight and the good fight
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  And a lot of the music
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Has that double-charged feeling
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  You were talking about
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  It gives us something to look forward to
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  Sometimes, you know
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  A lot of people work out
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  To metal and stuff like that
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  But especially politically
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  When we're in times like we are
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.000]  Right now, globally
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  In our own country
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  In some of our own cities
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  You know, heavy metal is just
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  When you say that's really popular
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  With the feelings that everybody's
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Experiencing right now
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  Well, it is
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  Getting into the album itself
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  What is your favorite track
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  If you had to pick one
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  And tell us about a few of the songs
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  That are on the new album
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  You know, I hate to sound cliche
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  But it changes from day to day
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  You know, depending on
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  What part of the day to
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Sometimes I like to
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  To the really aggressive stuff
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  In the morning when I'm working out
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  And other times
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  The last thing I want to do
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  Is wake up and listen
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  To something like Never Dead
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  Because it's just
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  Alright, let's go!
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  But for me
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  Probably politically
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  The song
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  The people you were talking about
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  It's really, really a touch
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  It's home for me
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  13 is important too
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  That was pretty much putting
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Again, putting my life story
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  Into one song
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  And it's so hard to do that
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  I was looking at all the songs
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  I wrote the other day
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Yesterday, actually
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  When we launched our new
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Version of our website
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  Called our new record
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  I looked at this list of all the songs
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  That I'd written
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  And it was overwhelming
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  To think each one of us
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  Was actually something
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  I sat down and put pen to paper
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  And pen melodies and stuff like that
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  Because you only think about
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  The whole body of work
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  If you're not concentrating on it
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  It just kind of goes past
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  I mean, let's measure it
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  Self-obsessed
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  Well, I noticed that
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  You've got some of the same themes
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Along the Liberty Line
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  That you've always discussed
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  In the lyrics
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  But you've got titles
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Like We The People
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  Of course, the last album in-game
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Getting into global extermination
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  And things beyond mega-death
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  But politically right now
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  I mean, obviously there's a message
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  In this record
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  And I think that's why
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Out of the gates
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  It's gone to the top of the charts
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  What's your view on
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Occupy Wall Street
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  All the things that are happening
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  In the world right now
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  The microphones they're putting
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  In street lights
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  What's Dave Mustaine's view on that?
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  You know, I didn't hear anything
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  About the street lights
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  Being outfitted with microphones
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  Just yesterday
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  So it doesn't surprise me
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  You know, I read 1984
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  When I was really young
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  I also read Animal Farm
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  Which is I'm sure
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Somehow ties into our present
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Also, but you know
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  All of this stuff
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  I've sang about for years
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  And I don't consider myself
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  A prophet by any means
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  I read books and paid attention
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  When I was supposed to
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  So a lot of the things
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  I've learned and that I sing about
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Is stuff we've all heard
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  Stuff you hear in Sunday school
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Stuff that you hear growing up
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  In public school
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  Or private school
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  If you're so fortunate
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  And I think that this record
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  When you look at all the stuff
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  That I've written about it
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  I try and stay away from the political side
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  But it just happens
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  You know, it's kind of like you believe it
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  You start writing it
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  And then all of a sudden
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  It goes from a love song
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  Into a political song
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Well, that was a case that came out today
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  Where a guy went to Walmart
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  With a baseball bat
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  And told some old veteran
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  They wanted money
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  And he wouldn't give it to him
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  So they beat him over the head
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  I mean, I saw your quote
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  On the Australian radio show
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Where you talked about the fact
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  That you never thought you'd see
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  A president playing groups
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  Off against each other
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Like is happening right now
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  I mean, this is desperate class warfare
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  But then I see the White House
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  And the Republicans to a great extent
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  Bought and paid for by the
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  More corrupt elements of Wall Street
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  That have gotten rich off bailout money
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  I mean, we already pay
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  A record amount of taxes
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  When is this going to end?
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  I don't know
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  I mean, I have my own philosophy
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  Based on my faith
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  But that's personal to me
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  And I don't want to get into it on the air
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Because I'm sure there's a lot of listeners
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  That don't agree with me
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  So I don't want to piss anybody off
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  But for me, I know how it will begin
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  And I know I'm on the winning side
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  So I'm cool with all that
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  And even if I'm wrong
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  I'm definitely living better today
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  Than it was before
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  I changed my approach towards faith
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  I look at the statement that I made
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  About this device
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  And this is happening
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  You know, it's real easy
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  When you're the most powerful man in the world
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  To say enough
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  Guys, let's put it into this
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I don't understand for the life of me
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  It's like the more I pay attention to politics
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  The more I don't want to pay attention to it
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  And the more it seems like
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  Sarah Connor knew what she was doing
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  Yeah, run to the hills
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  Yeah, it's funny
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  And the more that you talk to people on the street
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  The more people are preparing for
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  Some kind of almost like a final battle
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  Or something
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  It's really weird
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  I'm not talking to a bunch of factions
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  Or anything like that
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Cults out here or anything like that
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  Not by any means
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  But just talking to people that are scared
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  They're scared
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Well, people should be
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  And when a hurricane is coming in
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Days before it even forms
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Or an earthquake
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Birds, mice, animals
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  They know something's coming
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  Humans have that same discernment
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  Six cents, wherever you want to call it
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  And government itself is digging in
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  Is building bunkers
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  And I saw an ABC News article last week
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  About middle-class people now in mass
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  Setting up dooms, steds and things
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.000]  Even though the government's saying
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  Everything's fine
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  We're not in a depression
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Go back to sleep
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  People instinctively or spiritually
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Are gearing up for something
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  And I know that I have never really geared up for stuff
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  And now I've been doing it myself, Dave
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  Well, I think a lot of people need to
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  Rely on media for all of their information
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  And now, even though the internet
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  Is full of a bunch of controversy
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  And it's rife with misinformation
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  And disinformation
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  I know that it's also an outlet
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  For a lot of people to be able to
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Pervade the truth
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  And people who, maybe not
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  People that would know me at all
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  So they don't appreciate what I got to say
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  But, you know, when you have the elite
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  That are paying for the media
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  You know, they pay what you want to hear
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  And I know that when I go overseas
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  And I see the other TV
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  Like, for example, the difference
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Between CNN and America
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  And CNN overseas
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  It's like two totally different networks
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  And, you know, when you're over in St. Japan
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  For example, and you're watching the news
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  They are totally different
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  Totally different than what they show us
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  It is, it is
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  You can see that the system is putting out
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  Different flavors of propaganda
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  Depending on what population
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  They're talking to and targeting
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  Why did you...
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  I mean, we know why you picked
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  The name of the last album, Endgame
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  Why the iconography of 13
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  And you've got the Megadeth corporate
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Skullman with the
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  Three monkeys
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  But he's turned around
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  Staring into some type of abyss
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  Can you break down your vision
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  Because I know you're always
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  You basically come up with the covers
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  The vision we're seeing here
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  In this album cover
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  For the new album 13 by Megadeth
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  It's not that clever, really, Alex
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  It's the 13th record in my career
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  I started playing when I was 13
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  I was born on the 13th
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  People think that the number 13 is bad
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  Well, it wasn't for me
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  My life started on that day
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  And I know that the association with the
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  Superstition and the bad side of 13
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  Had to do with the Templar Knights
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  Or something like that
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Yeah, that's when the Catholic Church
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Rounded him up and killed a bunch of them
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  Yeah, you're right
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  So, I mean, as far as I'm concerned
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  I know that 13 shows up all over the place
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  And it's funny how much now
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  Even more so that we've used this number
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  It's like when your old lady gets pregnant
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  All of a sudden you see pregnant women everywhere
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  Or you buy a Volkswagen
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  And you realize everybody's got the same old Volkswagen
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  As soon as I leaned on 13
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  It all started popping up everywhere
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  And then the actual logo itself
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  With the word 13
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  And the number 13 inside of it
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  That was our artist, John, when I came up with that
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  When I first saw that I went, wow, that's really clever
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  Now, Dave, we've only got about 10 minutes left
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  With you here and I appreciate your time
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  I know you've been talking a ton and singing
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  And you're about to go on the road
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  And I don't want to burn you out here
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  But there's so many questions I want to go over
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  Hopefully you will come back with us
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Maybe even in studio here in Austin
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  In the next few months when you get back
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  From your South America tour
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  Yeah, that would be fun
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  Well, it was great actually seeing you up there
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  In person in Dallas, I guess a year and a half ago
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  How time flies now
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  I think because of time constraints
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  After you leave us, I'm going to come back
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  And actually play my favorite new tune
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  On the album, We the People
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  But specifically, what are you talking about here?
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  I mean, the lyrics speak for themselves
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  But what are you saying in We the People?
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Wow, I think it's...
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  I'm saying what everybody's saying right now
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  That they're pissed, you know?
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  What happened to all the things
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  That our grandparents worked for and set up?
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  I mean, you know, you watch the Dollar Plumbing
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  You see Social Security and all of these benefits
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  That people had taken away
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  You watch these corrupt bankers take people's life savings
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  And it disappears into a vapor
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  And then you have people like Madoff saying
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  That he's happier, he's in jail
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  And that people look up to him there
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Well, you know, I mean, the only difference between him
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  Is that the criminals are wearing jump suits
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  Instead of three-piece suits, you know
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  It's all the same, right?
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  And to think about all these people
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  Who their lives have changed forever because of this
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  You know, the people who were defense
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  That's the thing that pissed me off
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  And while we were watching everything that was going on
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  With just the...
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  I didn't even know the word that I want to say
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  But just the immovability of the people in Congress
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  And the people in the Senate
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  And the White House is all frozen right now
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  And it's mind-boggling
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Somebody has to be something
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  There's got to be an American up there somewhere
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  There's got to be
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  Looking at the Euro crisis that we predicted
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  In the Obama deception
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  Engineered implosion
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  And now they're setting up a banking dictatorship
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  And did you see it last week
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  When the Pope called for global government?
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  Yeah, I did. I saw that
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  For the global currency, too
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Wow, I mean, how could you
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  At 20 years old
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  I mean, I remember 25, 30 years ago
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  Listening to your stuff
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Before you were even in Metallica
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  Because I was...
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  I mean, I had neighbors that were all
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Into speed metal, thrash metal
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  I was like nine years old
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  I'm only 37
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  How were you writing about things like this?
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Because I mean, people ask how I was politically formed
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  Some of it was listening to megadeath
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  I thank you, I think
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Look what you've done, Dave
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  Yeah
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  Frankenstein
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  You know the great thing about
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Helping people at least
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  At the time to become three thinkers
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  Is that the world is a fascinating place
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.500]  It's a fascinating place and we're so capable of doing so much good and sometimes people
[23:34.500 --> 23:41.000]  don't agree with us and I think in mistake, you know, what we do, you know, include sometimes
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  the enemy, it's great.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.720]  But you know, for me doing this kind of music, singing these kind of songs, having these
[23:47.720 --> 23:54.160]  kind of lyrics, I guess in some way I'm just doing my part, I believe, to make the world
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.760]  better place through heavy metal music, even though that sounds, you know, like you should
[23:57.760 --> 24:02.120]  be having some kind of a nursery rhyme in the background or something or some circus music
[24:02.120 --> 24:05.680]  or something, you know, it's true.
[24:05.680 --> 24:11.280]  I don't know how to play another type of music, this is what I was given and it's what I love
[24:11.280 --> 24:15.280]  and being able to educate people is great.
[24:15.280 --> 24:19.240]  I mean, I know you know when you've talked to one of your listeners or you've met somebody
[24:19.240 --> 24:24.000]  out on the road and they get that aha moment where their eyes just dial it and all of a
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  sudden they're like, I get it.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  I love that feeling.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.640]  Now, that's the real magic in the world.
[24:29.640 --> 24:31.720]  You know, they say the root of all evil is money.
[24:31.720 --> 24:32.720]  No, it's not.
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.800]  You know, this world system gives people to sell out for money they create out of nothing.
[24:38.800 --> 24:42.320]  What the system is really after is trafficking in the souls of men.
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.440]  This ruling Illuminati system from my deep research is interested in our minds and our
[24:47.440 --> 24:48.440]  souls.
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.440]  It wants to program us.
[24:49.440 --> 24:51.680]  What's your take on that statement, Dave?
[24:51.680 --> 24:55.280]  Well, coming back to that, that scripture actually the love of money is the root of
[24:55.280 --> 24:56.280]  all evil.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.280]  Yes.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.280]  So it's kind of incomplete.
[24:58.280 --> 25:04.760]  As far as the Illuminati and the elite and everything like that, it's hidden in plain
[25:04.760 --> 25:05.760]  sight.
[25:05.760 --> 25:09.880]  You know, it's all of the maneuvering that's going on and you know, all anybody has to
[25:09.880 --> 25:16.840]  do if they're curious is look, you know, when you saw people talking about the New World
[25:16.840 --> 25:17.840]  Order.
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.160]  The reason the New World Order is on this new record was because when I sang about it
[25:22.160 --> 25:29.600]  you know, 12 years ago, it was the demo song and it never got released officially and because
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.200]  of the content in the song, I had to sing that song on this new record, so New World
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.240]  Order is on 13 and you know, watching that stuff happen as the little kid is having
[25:39.240 --> 25:43.120]  people say, oh, one day, you know, there's going to be the cataclysmic end to the world
[25:43.120 --> 25:47.280]  and it's going to happen when you see all this stuff going on in Israel and in the Middle
[25:47.280 --> 25:53.320]  East and all this stuff where everybody can agree and have one dollar and one church and
[25:53.320 --> 25:56.480]  one boss and it's like, wow, is that possible?
[25:56.480 --> 25:57.480]  And now you see it.
[25:57.480 --> 25:58.480]  They're even talking about it.
[25:58.480 --> 26:01.280]  Who would have even imagined talking about that?
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.000]  Who would imagine the Pope coming out and saying, one world currency, global government,
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.080]  bank of the world, well, it was the official church organ put that out.
[26:11.080 --> 26:13.480]  I mean, that is just incredible, Dave.
[26:13.480 --> 26:14.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.560]  Like I said, you know, this is a very incredible world we live in and we have a lot of power.
[26:20.560 --> 26:22.200]  People can rise up and say no.
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.280]  Well, look at the testament to how many people you've reached and again, that's God's plan.
[26:28.280 --> 26:31.800]  Different people hit different sectors of society and your whole life has been a journey
[26:31.800 --> 26:36.480]  to bring you to where you are now and there's a lot more ahead, hopefully, from Dave Mustain
[26:36.480 --> 26:37.480]  and Megadeth.
[26:37.480 --> 26:43.800]  Folks can go to Megadeth with an E in the death, Megadeth.com or just type in Dave Mustain
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.320]  or Megadeth into your search engine.
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.200]  The first thing that leads you to their site, you can get the book, Mustain, A Life and
[26:49.200 --> 26:50.200]  Metal.
[26:50.200 --> 26:54.000]  Dave, I want to have you back after you're done touring for a respite for a full hour
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  on the book.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  I've actually ordered a copy.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.720]  I'm going to read it and I'm really enjoying the new album.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.960]  I think it's even better than Endgame.
[26:59.960 --> 27:06.240]  I thought Endgame was extremely powerful, especially the lyrics, but man, this new album
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.680]  feels like vintage Megadeth, but with something even better added to it.
[27:11.680 --> 27:14.960]  I agree, thanks.
[27:14.960 --> 27:18.960]  In the time we've got, after we're going to come back here and play with the people
[27:18.960 --> 27:26.040]  after you're gone, Dave, Metallica, it is so good to see you, of course, who was right
[27:26.040 --> 27:30.680]  there at the beginning of Metallica and influence it so much and that's obviously another amazing
[27:30.680 --> 27:34.640]  band who I admire and grew up listening to and with all its political lyrics, Justice
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.760]  for All, all of that, but it's good to see you on the big four tour with them and hearing
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.240]  that you guys have really gotten to be good friends again.
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.120]  We always had a friendship, although a lot of times it was strange.
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.520]  That was a lot to do with the media.
[27:51.520 --> 27:58.800]  Lars and I were doing an interview over in Europe recently and he had said, we have these
[27:58.800 --> 28:04.000]  two relationships, the ones that we have and then the one that the press thinks we have.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  It's unfortunate because we had such an incredible thing that we created, change the world.
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.960]  There's not a guitar player that I know that plays the heavy metal riff that their life
[28:18.960 --> 28:25.360]  hasn't been touched by what me and James did on guitar.
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.600]  It's really neat to be able to, at the end of the day, know that you've done such an
[28:29.600 --> 28:30.600]  incredible thing.
[28:30.600 --> 28:38.160]  I mean, yeah, sometimes it's a little hard, you know, there's the toughness of work.
[28:38.160 --> 28:42.720]  I wish that none of that stuff had ever happened and that it was still on the band, but we
[28:42.720 --> 28:50.440]  got two great bands now and James and I are close, Lars and I are close and who knows?
[28:50.440 --> 28:52.120]  I'm hoping there's more big four stuff.
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.760]  I personally think that we've done the East Coast and the West Coast now to do a big four
[28:56.760 --> 29:01.200]  smack dab right in the middle around Dallas or Austin, maybe.
[29:01.200 --> 29:03.080]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[29:03.080 --> 29:08.760]  Well, Dave, again, look forward to speaking to you in the future, boy Vaj and be safe
[29:08.760 --> 29:13.280]  down in South America and then, of course, more tour dates coming up after that next
[29:13.280 --> 29:15.280]  year here in the United States, correct?
[29:15.280 --> 29:23.000]  Yes, we've got Gigantor starting at the beginning of January, actually, I think it's towards
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.720]  the latter part of January, yeah, but you can find that at gigantor.com.
[29:26.720 --> 29:32.160]  You can find it at gigantor.com, too, with part of head, fold feet and look at the coil.
[29:32.160 --> 29:33.160]  Wow.
[29:33.160 --> 29:34.160]  That could be in the States.
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.160]  Amazing.
[29:35.160 --> 29:36.160]  Dave, I'll see you by the theater in the break.
[29:36.160 --> 29:39.520]  Thank you for all the time and hopefully you'll be in studio with us sooner rather than later.
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.680]  That's Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, the new album, 13, available everywhere iTunes, you
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.760]  name it, but right there at megadeth.com.
[29:45.760 --> 29:50.200]  Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura is coming up and a lot more, stay with us.
[29:50.200 --> 29:53.920]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:53.920 --> 29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.360]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.120]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[30:08.120 --> 30:09.120]  risk.
[30:09.120 --> 30:10.360]  Saving means to make money.
[30:10.360 --> 30:14.560]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[30:14.560 --> 30:20.120]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[30:20.120 --> 30:25.840]  It's made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[30:25.840 --> 30:27.520]  or antibacterials.
[30:27.520 --> 30:33.040]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[30:33.040 --> 30:35.440]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[30:35.440 --> 30:38.720]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[30:38.720 --> 30:40.800]  to do something you've never done before.

[31:01.640 --> 31:06.120]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[31:06.120 --> 31:10.200]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[31:10.200 --> 31:12.920]  listeners to do three things right away.
[31:12.920 --> 31:15.320]  Number one, study the past.
[31:15.320 --> 31:17.600]  History really does repeat itself.
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.480]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[31:22.480 --> 31:25.320]  Number three, take decisive action.
[31:25.320 --> 31:29.400]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[31:29.400 --> 31:34.320]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves,
[31:34.320 --> 31:38.480]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[31:38.480 --> 31:41.800]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[31:41.800 --> 31:46.280]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[31:46.280 --> 31:50.320]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[31:50.320 --> 31:51.320]  half.
[31:51.320 --> 31:55.880]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[31:55.880 --> 32:00.880]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[32:00.880 --> 32:05.200]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[32:05.200 --> 32:09.800]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[32:09.800 --> 32:13.640]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[32:13.640 --> 32:16.320]  anywhere in or on the body.
[32:16.320 --> 32:21.080]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[32:21.080 --> 32:25.680]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[32:25.680 --> 32:30.320]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[32:30.320 --> 32:33.840]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[32:33.840 --> 32:40.040]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[32:40.040 --> 32:41.720]  digestive system.
[32:41.720 --> 32:48.960]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[32:48.960 --> 32:52.080]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[32:52.080 --> 33:22.040]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:22.080 --> 33:51.920]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[33:51.920 --> 34:21.760]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[34:51.920 --> 35:21.760]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[35:21.920 --> 35:51.760]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[35:51.920 --> 36:16.080]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, one world, government, one world, everything, that's
[36:16.080 --> 36:23.200]  only part of, we the people, they've got 13 tracks on 13, and the whole thing basically
[36:23.200 --> 36:25.560]  exposes the New World Order and tyranny.
[36:25.560 --> 36:33.000]  And I'm hearing this more and more, with Muse, and with the Foo Fighters, and with Rush,
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.880]  they are all speaking out against the New World Order and tyranny now, but if you go
[36:36.880 --> 36:43.040]  back, Megadeth was talking about all this stuff 20 years ago, hard to believe 30 years
[36:43.040 --> 36:44.040]  ago.
[36:44.040 --> 36:47.040]  How old was I when I was about 10?
[36:47.040 --> 36:57.120]  Yeah, that's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about for 25, 30 years, talking
[36:57.120 --> 36:58.120]  about those issues.
[36:58.120 --> 37:01.880]  I don't normally like to have a big guest right at the start of the show, but Dave and
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.200]  I talked some, and he'd been talking about some time popping into town and just being
[37:06.200 --> 37:10.720]  in studio, but he just got too booked to do it a few weeks ago.
[37:10.720 --> 37:17.080]  And so I kind of forgot about getting him on when the album came out, we discussed that,
[37:17.080 --> 37:20.600]  and then boom, I called him yesterday, I didn't know he'd been on Jimmy Kimmel, dressed up
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.640]  like Frankenstein, anything like it, and woke him up at about 9 a.m. his time, and then
[37:25.640 --> 37:27.920]  he set up the interview today.
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.400]  And let me tell you, all of these top musicians and people, I'll guarantee you, I'll just
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.360]  leave it at that, have people pressuring him, you know, not to cover certain subjects, but
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.440]  you notice Dave still does.
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.440]  And boy, he really knows a lot.
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.480]  Someday I want to do a hardcore interview where he really lets it all hang out and shows
[37:46.480 --> 37:47.760]  you the real Dave Mustaine.
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.520]  I mean, you saw the real Dave Mustaine in the interview some, but he really is smart,
[37:52.520 --> 37:55.760]  he really knows his stuff, he really studies the New World Order.
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.080]  Well, hell, he named his last album after in-game, my film, let me give you an idea.
[38:00.080 --> 38:06.320]  But this new one, I got to say, I wish that the album that is named after one of my films
[38:06.320 --> 38:11.080]  was better than 13, but 13 is far better.
[38:11.080 --> 38:18.360]  I mean, in-game is a great album, but this is powerful, good to see Megadeth churning
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.240]  some stuff out like that.
[38:20.240 --> 38:30.000]  Another signpost illustrating how awake people are getting across the world, and the fact
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  that people have been awake for a long time are now coming out in a bold way against tyrants.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.800]  Now, just so happened the Dave Mustaine was on today, and this is the day Jesse Ventura
[38:38.800 --> 38:40.960]  can come on.
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.160]  So we're going to get Ventura on with us.
[38:45.160 --> 38:51.240]  He scheduled for the entire next hour, and we'll get into a host of interesting issues.
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.360]  I don't know how much he'll get into on air.
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.440]  Like I said, I wish you, I mean, Ventura is the real Ventura.
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.880]  He's one of the most bona fide, legit, real people that I know, but maybe I shouldn't
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.280]  get Ventura saying some, and get him going on some subjects, but just amazing.
[39:09.280 --> 39:15.480]  So Jesse Ventura is scheduled to be coming up.
[39:15.480 --> 39:18.640]  I didn't even know that, well, I'm not going to get into it.
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.920]  I'll just leave it at that.
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.040]  Interesting interview with Dave Mustaine, again, another signpost illustrating the
[39:25.040 --> 39:31.480]  fact that the public is waking up when music like this is at the top of the charts, it's
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.880]  at the top of the metal charts, and it's in the last, I checked yesterday, like in the
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.600]  top 10 of the rock charts period, and that's good for an album that came out on the first
[39:42.600 --> 39:43.760]  day doing that.
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.800]  I actually noticed topping Metallica on some of their new stuff in the charts.
[39:47.800 --> 39:54.320]  So very, very exciting to have Dave Mustaine, who will reach hundreds of millions of people.
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.600]  I mean, he goes to Brazil in places, they'll have two, three million people chanting with
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.480]  the lyrics there, and you talk about 1776 worldwide.
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.720]  You talk about the liberty and freedom movement worldwide.
[40:08.720 --> 40:15.160]  People like Dave Mustaine really getting hardcore in the fight for liberty is a powerful tool
[40:15.160 --> 40:17.720]  in awakening this planet to the globalist.
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.080]  I mean, you just heard those lyrics, or if you're not somebody that's attuned to listening
[40:22.080 --> 40:27.160]  to music like that and weren't quite making them out, it's talking about world government,
[40:27.160 --> 40:32.760]  global everything, total tyranny, and a global declaration of independence against it.
[40:32.760 --> 40:39.360]  That is so incredibly exciting to have things like that going on.
[40:39.360 --> 40:46.000]  And again, I can only commend Dave Mustaine and the rest of his great band and crew for
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.240]  their courage in doing what they're doing.
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.240]  And you notice no guts, no glory.
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.760]  This album is now going to surge up to number one, and is surging up to number one because
[40:54.760 --> 41:01.000]  it is hardcore and people want the truth, so don't keep your light hidden under a bushel
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.400]  as they say.
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.880]  Now, I shot a video driving home last night because I'm having to get geared up for the
[41:07.880 --> 41:13.600]  24-hour plus live transmission that kicks off tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.080]  And I was driving home, Aaron Dyches was doing the nightly news, but I went ahead and just
[41:18.080 --> 41:23.000]  shot an iPhone video and uploaded it up, and the guys put it at the beginning of the nightly
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  news.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.040]  And it had the headline, Grease on the Verge of Collapse.
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.400]  And I saw the classic COINTELPRO, who were there within seconds of one of our videos
[41:32.400 --> 41:37.040]  going live on YouTube, and we took that and put it on the start of the nightly news.
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.520]  Within seconds, they give it negative votes, even though it always ends up being about
[41:40.520 --> 41:46.560]  95% positive, 5% negative, sometimes 99% positive, 1% negative.
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.040]  The haters are waiting, dozens of them, full-time paid assets, and the government admits they
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.520]  have these megaphone programs, and the sock puppet programs is also what they call it,
[41:57.520 --> 42:03.360]  where they popped in immediately and said, you're a fair monger, you're full of baloney,
[42:03.360 --> 42:04.920]  nothing's going to collapse.
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.400]  I had stacks of mainstream news articles, in fact, I've got it over here in my stack,
[42:09.400 --> 42:15.880]  headline, Euro on the Verge of Collapse, Grease on the Verge of Collapse, talking about firing
[42:15.880 --> 42:21.520]  their Joint Chiefs of Staff, first they were going to have a referendum on giving up all
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.400]  their sovereignty and going into austerity in the Euro.
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.120]  Then they weren't going to do it, then they were, then they weren't.
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.160]  Stock markets gyrating wildly, and there's that Co and Tell Pro saying, Alex is exaggerating,
[42:34.160 --> 42:35.920]  it's not on the Verge of Collapse.
[42:35.920 --> 42:42.480]  Here's the New York Times, this morning, give me a document camp shot, I'll show folks,
[42:42.480 --> 42:47.280]  Greek cabinet backs call for referendum on debt crisis.
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.560]  There was zero heads that first broke yesterday that they had not spiked it, as Papandreou
[42:52.560 --> 42:53.680]  was saying.
[42:53.680 --> 42:56.680]  With the government teetering on the Verge of Collapse, the Greek cabinet offered its
[42:56.680 --> 43:02.400]  full support early today to Prime Minister George A. Papandreou for his surprise plan
[43:02.400 --> 43:04.800]  to call a referendum on the Greek financial crisis.
[43:04.800 --> 43:10.680]  Again, with the government teetering on the Verge of Collapse, that's why I said, and
[43:10.680 --> 43:13.280]  then if it doesn't collapse, they go, look, you're wrong.
[43:13.280 --> 43:21.600]  I said, teetering on the Verge, teetering on the Verge is our headline, teetering, it's
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.480]  like if I'm teetering on a cliff, doesn't mean I'm going to fall off.
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.880]  I give you real analysis, I give you real information, I told you they'd announced a
[43:30.880 --> 43:34.320]  bank of the world in the global currency as the solution of the European crisis in the
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.280]  Obama deception three years ago.
[43:36.280 --> 43:40.360]  I told you that 15 years ago, because I'm reading globalist documents that are public.
[43:40.360 --> 43:45.240]  I told you they're adding sterilants to the vaccines because I have the documents.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.800]  My job is really quite easy.
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.560]  I actually listen to what the globalists are saying, and I'll take out some more articles.
[43:50.560 --> 43:53.840]  I forgot to do it because I was busy talking to Dave before he went live.
[43:53.840 --> 43:57.640]  I've got the articles from yesterday about, in fact, just type it into the search engine.
[43:57.640 --> 44:02.200]  Euro on the Verge of Collapse, Euro could collapse within days.
[44:02.200 --> 44:05.840]  This is what the world really is in this position.
[44:05.840 --> 44:12.680]  Now, two and a half weeks ago, Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst, Bob Baer, former top
[44:12.680 --> 44:20.800]  CIA black op commander, George Herbert Walker Bushes and George W. Bushes, top Iran specialist.
[44:20.800 --> 44:28.440]  All of them came out and said, Iran did not do this use car salesman wanting to kill the
[44:28.440 --> 44:30.960]  Saudi ambassador and blow stuff up in DC.
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.120]  This has got to be fake as a political stunt to launch a war on Iran.
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.120]  Yeah.
[44:36.120 --> 44:37.120]  There it is.
[44:37.120 --> 44:39.880]  Greek government may collapse on Friday.
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.680]  That's mainstream news, Berlusonis Coalition on the Verge of Collapse.
[44:45.680 --> 44:49.960]  You can pull up the articles about, pull up Euro on the Verge of Collapse, and you'll
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.400]  get dozens of, you know, times of London financial times.
[44:54.400 --> 44:57.640]  No, you did put in Euro on the Verge of Collapse.
[44:57.640 --> 44:59.080]  It's just bringing up the Greek stuff.
[44:59.080 --> 45:00.080]  You can look deeper.
[45:00.080 --> 45:01.080]  It'll come up.
[45:01.080 --> 45:06.240]  What it says is that all of this is happening, all of this is going on, and this is real.
[45:06.240 --> 45:09.120]  Now, let me continue.
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.560]  All of my sources, day one, and my own research, said they're getting ready to deliver bunker
[45:14.560 --> 45:17.440]  busters and cluster bombs to Israel.
[45:17.440 --> 45:20.080]  Israel thinks Iran's building a nuke.
[45:20.080 --> 45:26.840]  They attacked in 81 the Iraqi nuclear power plant and blew it up.
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.040]  They attacked in 2007 the Syrian secret facility.
[45:31.040 --> 45:37.200]  After that, and I said, look, the word we've got, and I've had families been sent to Kuwait.
[45:37.200 --> 45:39.920]  I talked to an Air Force officer on the plane last Tuesday.
[45:39.920 --> 45:45.360]  I've got all these other sources, and they all, well, my cousin wouldn't say, but he,
[45:45.360 --> 45:51.440]  the point is, all these sources are saying, yes, Israel is intending to strike Iran.
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.040]  And I said, within two weeks is what I've been told, and now it's been two weeks, or
[45:57.040 --> 45:59.920]  as others have said before, the deep winter kicks in the next month.
[45:59.920 --> 46:01.040]  I don't know.
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.800]  All I know is we're on the verge of seeing a strike on Iran, and all the craziness that
[46:05.800 --> 46:06.840]  comes from that.
[46:06.840 --> 46:08.120]  What is in Sky Television?
[46:08.120 --> 46:11.080]  That's Fox News of England, of Europe.
[46:11.080 --> 46:15.080]  Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[46:15.080 --> 46:19.080]  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to rally support in his cabinet for
[46:19.080 --> 46:22.440]  an attack on Iran according to government sources.
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.480]  And see, they tried this stage deal, whether you're a fore attacking Iran or not.
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.240]  Once admitted, it was staged that the Iranian, who it turned out was working for the Iranian
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.360]  opposition groups in Washington, they were the ones that set him up.
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.080]  Even if you believe he was really an idiot, Patsy, who thought he was going to do this.
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.360]  And the known pothead drug dealer, idiot, reportedly, is that they're trying to set it
[46:43.360 --> 46:45.280]  up right now.
[46:45.280 --> 46:48.320]  They're trying to get it right now.
[46:48.320 --> 46:51.280]  They're trying to get this system through.
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.240]  That fell on its face because a bunch of elements of the Pentagon, like Colonel Shaffer, who
[46:55.240 --> 46:58.960]  came out and said it was all a pretext to attack Iran, are coming out and saying it's
[46:58.960 --> 47:04.840]  bull, hundreds of analysts total, Steve Pachennick, the list goes on and on.
[47:04.840 --> 47:07.760]  The green light is on.
[47:07.760 --> 47:10.960]  Now it dimmed down to almost nothing.
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.240]  But then the White House said, well, we've got more people saying that there's other
[47:15.240 --> 47:16.880]  plots by Iran to attack us.
[47:16.880 --> 47:24.640]  And so Netanyahu is now publicly in the Knesset, he is now publicly in the Knesset and his
[47:24.640 --> 47:27.160]  cabinet trying to get his own cabinet.
[47:27.160 --> 47:28.160]  He fired.
[47:28.160 --> 47:30.040]  He got rid of the old head of the Mossad over this.
[47:30.040 --> 47:38.080]  He got rid of the defense minister earlier this year or late last year, overall of this.
[47:38.080 --> 47:41.480]  I mean, this is really going on.
[47:41.480 --> 47:43.760]  This is really happening.
[47:43.760 --> 47:46.400]  This is really unfolding.
[47:46.400 --> 47:49.600]  And so there you have it right there.
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.360]  This is Sky News Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.480]  He's going before the Knesset and the parliament asking for it and saying they're preparing
[47:58.480 --> 47:59.480]  to do it.
[47:59.480 --> 48:00.480]  No kidding.
[48:00.480 --> 48:05.000]  They just released a thousand Palestinians out of their jails, the Washington Times sources
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.600]  who know people inside his cabinet said Netanyahu thinks that he's going to end up being like
[48:09.600 --> 48:13.440]  Churchill against Hitler and that he's going to strike him.
[48:13.440 --> 48:14.960]  I mean, what more do you need?
[48:14.960 --> 48:23.000]  The point is, Cheney came within inches, within inches of being able to stage an attack on
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.840]  U.S. ships and the Strait of Hormuz to blame it on Iran.
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.600]  That came out in New Yorker magazine, Sy Hirsch, Pulitzer Prize winner.
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.920]  The system is galloping towards this now.
[48:35.920 --> 48:38.440]  Does that mean it's going to happen?
[48:38.440 --> 48:39.440]  No.
[48:39.440 --> 48:42.880]  Just because you're on the edge of a cliff doesn't mean you're going to fall off.
[48:42.880 --> 48:48.080]  We need to pull back from this three times in the last six years.
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.360]  There's been imminent war with Iran and the public got the word out.
[48:51.360 --> 48:53.540]  The public said no.
[48:53.540 --> 48:56.080]  The majority of Israelis don't want this attack.
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.240]  His own military advisors don't want this attack.
[48:59.240 --> 49:01.040]  The Mossad has told him not.
[49:01.040 --> 49:09.320]  I mean, the Mossad certainly doesn't shrink from a fight or greenlighting a war.
[49:09.320 --> 49:20.040]  Three weeks ago, Norman Panetta, Leon Panetta, excuse me, the director of the Defense Department,
[49:20.040 --> 49:27.840]  he came back and he said Israel is totally isolated now and may basically attack Iran.
[49:27.840 --> 49:30.520]  Again, it's all over the news.
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.160]  So we're not saying there's going to be an attack.
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.360]  What we're saying is he is in the Knesset trying to get authorization for it.
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.680]  And still in this military mind control system, people say, oh, there's not even a discussion
[49:45.680 --> 49:46.680]  of an attack.
[49:46.680 --> 49:47.680]  Be quiet.
[49:47.680 --> 49:48.680]  Those are operatives, folks.
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.440]  They don't want the American people having a debate about the imminent attack because
[49:52.440 --> 49:56.440]  they know you're against it on average and that you're going to stand up and say no to
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.360]  Congress, put pressure on Israel, not to do this.
[50:00.360 --> 50:04.040]  So they just say at Waco and they're ramming a tank into the building and burning it down.
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.600]  This is not an assault.
[50:05.600 --> 50:06.600]  Mars attacks.
[50:06.600 --> 50:08.720]  The margins are shooting people saying, don't run.
[50:08.720 --> 50:11.320]  We are your friends and people stopping it shot.
[50:11.320 --> 50:13.080]  This mind control doesn't work on me.
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.840]  Regardless of what you want to say about Alex Jones, Benjamin Netanyahu is up there trying
[50:17.840 --> 50:23.280]  to get permission to preemptively strike Iran, OK?
[50:23.280 --> 50:24.280]  That's real.
[50:24.280 --> 50:26.760]  No, he got up in front of the Knesset and called for it.
[50:26.760 --> 50:27.760]  OK?
[50:27.760 --> 50:28.760]  He gave a speech.
[50:28.760 --> 50:29.760]  We can play it here.
[50:29.760 --> 50:30.760]  David and Hebrew.
[50:30.760 --> 50:33.280]  I mean, I can sit there and play it for you.
[50:33.280 --> 50:34.680]  Let's get past Alex Jones.
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.120]  They are openly wanting to do this right now, and I can't believe there's so much mind control
[50:40.120 --> 50:41.120]  out there.
[50:41.120 --> 50:45.720]  Now, if we stop this from happening, I will then be attacked and told I said there was
[50:45.720 --> 50:47.080]  going to be a war with Iran 100%.
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.240]  No, I said it's green-lighted, they're going ahead with it if they can shell it.
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.320]  But the whole fake terror thing with the used car salesman blew up in their face pun intended,
[50:56.320 --> 50:59.480]  so they're trying to green-light it again right now.
[50:59.480 --> 51:01.160]  Face the issue.
[51:01.160 --> 51:05.400]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[51:05.400 --> 51:06.400]  filtration.

[52:04.920 --> 52:09.160]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth and getting
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.680]  ashes everywhere?
[52:10.680 --> 52:16.000]  Why, when you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by LeSig?

[52:21.920 --> 52:27.440]  replacement cartridges, you'll get all the satisfaction of smoking, but no smoking hazards.

[52:40.240 --> 52:45.160]  That's 870-518-4307 LeSig e-cigarettes.
[52:45.160 --> 52:50.560]  For today's modern smoker, warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance
[52:50.560 --> 52:53.960]  known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.440]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.
[52:57.440 --> 52:59.960]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[52:59.960 --> 53:02.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.960]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.560]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[53:07.560 --> 53:11.600]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[53:11.600 --> 53:12.600]  or gold?
[53:12.600 --> 53:15.920]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and
[53:15.920 --> 53:18.160]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[53:18.160 --> 53:22.720]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[53:22.720 --> 53:23.720]  seeds.
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.640]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[53:28.640 --> 53:30.480]  food for you and your family.
[53:30.480 --> 53:31.600]  And here's the best part.
[53:31.600 --> 53:35.800]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[53:35.800 --> 53:38.280]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[53:38.280 --> 53:41.520]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[53:41.520 --> 53:48.320]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[53:48.320 --> 53:52.440]  That's 877-327-0365.
[53:52.440 --> 53:57.320]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[53:57.320 --> 54:13.800]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[54:13.800 --> 54:16.240]  David Cameron came out yesterday.
[54:16.240 --> 54:19.560]  I had that article in my stack, the Prime Minister of England, and said, it's time to
[54:19.560 --> 54:25.080]  start censoring the Internet because of the global crisis, can't have the people exposing
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.920]  his criminality, not letting the Brits, or people in the U.K. period, have a vote on
[54:29.920 --> 54:33.400]  whether they're brought into the Europe.
[54:33.400 --> 54:34.720]  And here's the London Guardian.
[54:34.720 --> 54:39.120]  U.K. military steps up plans for Iran attack amid fresh nuclear fears.
[54:39.120 --> 54:44.120]  British officials consider contingency options to back up possible U.S. action as fears mount
[54:44.120 --> 54:46.080]  over Tehran's capability.
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.760]  Okay, here is Sky Television.
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.680]  Here's Alternet.
[54:52.680 --> 54:53.880]  Here's Reuters.
[54:53.880 --> 54:57.000]  Real test fires missile as Iran debate rages.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.320]  Who was right again two and a half weeks ago that the green light, my sources off-record
[55:03.320 --> 55:05.560]  said they've told us to be ready in two weeks.
[55:05.560 --> 55:12.920]  I said green light two weeks, basically again, not attack within two weeks, that any time
[55:12.920 --> 55:15.920]  after two weeks from now, it's on.
[55:15.920 --> 55:21.000]  Now, we can back this off, Netanyahu goes before the Knesset, says I want permission
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.480]  to attack Iran preemptively, because they know how illegal that is a strike.
[55:25.480 --> 55:27.000]  The Brits are getting ready.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.640]  In our news, it's reported that the government is testing shutting down communications during
[55:31.640 --> 55:32.640]  crises.
[55:32.640 --> 55:33.640]  What day is it this month?
[55:33.640 --> 55:34.640]  I forgot.
[55:34.640 --> 55:40.000]  Guys, look at Watson's article, EAS Alert November, where this month they're going to
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.680]  practice taking over all radio and TV, even if you don't want them to.
[55:45.680 --> 55:49.240]  Before you had to tune to the FEMA frequency when it ordered it to, but it's always since
[55:49.240 --> 55:51.280]  96 been wired in to take over.
[55:51.280 --> 55:54.960]  Now they're testing that coming up later in the month.
[55:54.960 --> 55:58.160]  Are you starting to get how crazy this is?
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.040]  But if we're awake to what's happening and speak out against all these wars and takeovers,
[56:03.040 --> 56:05.520]  they may back off.
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.600]  Microphones in street lights listening to you?
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.200]  Yeah, give me the date of that, because we've been covering it forever.
[56:16.200 --> 56:17.200]  It's November 25th?
[56:17.200 --> 56:18.200]  No, no, no.
[56:18.200 --> 56:20.720]  I don't want the date of the article about it.
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.840]  I want the date of the EAS takeover drill.
[56:23.840 --> 56:24.840]  Thanks.
[56:24.840 --> 56:25.840]  There it is.
[56:25.840 --> 56:26.840]  FEMA press release right there, that green link.
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.200]  That'll take you to it right there.
[56:30.200 --> 56:31.200]  November 9th.
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.000]  Oh, what's Israel saying right now?
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.160]  They could strike them any day.
[56:37.160 --> 56:43.200]  And now here we are November 2nd.
[56:43.200 --> 56:46.640]  And the government saying they'll take over with the EAS Alert system.
[56:46.640 --> 56:48.520]  We covered it, of course, back in February.
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.720]  Beck was freaking out about it last week.
[56:51.720 --> 56:56.200]  November 9th at what, two o'clock Eastern?
[56:56.200 --> 56:58.440]  One o'clock Central.
[56:58.440 --> 57:05.120]  So I guess during my show on AM and FM stations, while you're listening, it doesn't matter.
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.000]  You're going to hear the feds come on.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.520]  And you know, they're so dumb.
[57:09.520 --> 57:13.640]  They could even attack Iran on that date and then set off nukes here in the U.S. and say
[57:13.640 --> 57:16.880]  Iran did it, bring in martial law, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but things
[57:16.880 --> 57:20.440]  like that are a possibility with this group of criminals in control.
[57:20.440 --> 57:25.200]  And no one will ask, why'd you have a drill already set for that day?
[57:25.200 --> 57:27.400]  And then it all happened on that day.
[57:27.400 --> 57:36.080]  By the way, if you looked at the November 9th, 11, 9, 11, and reversed that, the globalists
[57:36.080 --> 57:37.280]  are totally obsessed.
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.100]  And I'm not saying something's going to happen on that date because talking about it can
[57:41.100 --> 57:42.600]  stop them from doing it.
[57:42.600 --> 57:45.400]  But then they have the takeover drill that day and attack Iran a week later.
[57:45.400 --> 57:54.040]  The point is, he's in the Knesset, Benjamin Yatenyahu calling for this, 2 p.m. Eastern
[57:54.040 --> 57:55.040]  standard time.
[57:55.040 --> 58:00.320]  That's the FCC's website, emergency alert nationwide test November 9th, 2011, 2 p.m.
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.440]  Eastern.
[58:02.440 --> 58:05.800]  My show will be preempted by Big Brother.
[58:05.800 --> 58:09.680]  On AM and FM's, you'll be able to hear this happen.
[58:09.680 --> 58:12.560]  And they're sticking their hands down our pants at the airport now setting up warrantless
[58:12.560 --> 58:16.080]  checkpoints on the road, and Netanyahu says he's getting ready to strike them, and England
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.520]  says they're getting ready, that the U.S. is getting ready.
[58:18.520 --> 58:21.640]  But I'm the conspiracy theorist, I shouldn't be concerned about any of this, no.
[58:21.640 --> 58:25.680]  They want to deny it's happening as they admit it's happening so you won't get upset, get
[58:25.680 --> 58:27.120]  involved, and get ready.
[58:27.120 --> 58:31.080]  Don't forget, the Money Bombs coming up tomorrow, 11 a.m., 24-hour plus transmission with an
[58:31.080 --> 58:32.560]  incredible lineup of guests.
[58:32.560 --> 58:37.520]  You just heard Dave Mustaine, Jesse Ventura is coming up, and tons of key news, stay with
[58:37.520 --> 58:43.520]  us.
[58:43.520 --> 58:48.160]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:48.160 --> 58:52.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[58:52.560 --> 58:57.680]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation, is in need of help due to the shattered

[58:58.680 --> 59:03.200]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.

[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:23.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:28.480]  Well, for the next hour, we're joined by Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.120]  He's not doing any media right now, so we're extra lucky to have him with us for the next
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.120]  hour.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120]  We're going to get into the TSA.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.640]  Where's this case going on that front?
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.920]  Can't get into much of it, though, because the judge hadn't ruled yet.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.280]  We're going to get into the open calls here.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.160]  Israel does say they're getting ready to strike Iran.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.160]  I got that headline here.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.560]  We're going to get into a host of issues with Jesse Ventura here today.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.200]  Gov, great to have you with us.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.200]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.720]  Always a pleasure to be here.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:03.280]  Well, I tell you, so much is happening, but let's talk about the TV show first.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280]  How's that going?
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]  Well, it's going well.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.480]  You know, we had to change it a bit this year.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.920]  We've got some new personnel on board, and of course, that ties into my lawsuit with
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.480]  the TSA, so I can't fly anymore, or at the moment, I can't fly.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:26.000]  And so anywhere I go, I have to drive, and so that limits the ability I have to get around
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  the country naturally.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.120]  So I have to do it in segments where I'll take off, like the last one where you and
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.400]  I saw each other.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.160]  That was a two-week run for me in my RV, driving around the country, and it's rough.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160]  It's very tiring.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:47.800]  It's a lot of fun, but it's also very difficult, and you don't realize how convenient the world
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.160]  is with the airlines today until you've got to get back driving again.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.040]  But I've got to tell you something in all honesty, Alex.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.880]  I don't miss the airports because I so despise the fact that there's somewhere in this country
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.840]  that if I go there, I'm treated completely like a criminal.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.880]  And so, you know, and in fact, one of the guests on my shows, it was interesting, an
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:15.920]  elderly gentleman that used to work at NASA and was involved in various high-level government
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.280]  projects, including Star Wars and things of that nature.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.280]  He had to interview with me in Vegas because he lives in Salt Lake, and it was too far
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.640]  for him to drive from Salt Lake to Minneapolis.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.320]  And the interesting thing is, he's following my lead.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.880]  He refuses to fly also, you know, for the same reason.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.280]  He said, in the United States of America, I do not believe that I should go anywhere
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.240]  where I'm treated like a criminal, and you are today at the airport, you're treated
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.240]  like criminals.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.560]  Well, I've talked to bus drivers, and I've talked to truck drivers and others.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.640]  I went and looked the numbers up a few months ago when I was first told this.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.800]  Did you know that people on buses in the list the last five years has more than doubled?
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.840]  And now you see passenger buses everywhere, it's become a booming business, and when
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.160]  people are surveyed, it's because of the TSA.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.680]  They do not want to be groped.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.880]  Well, it's the whole concept of it, Alex.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.440]  It's a place where, in a free country, if you want to learn what it's like to be put
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:18.720]  under martial law, go to the airport, because that'll give you an exact feeling of being
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.520]  put under government, complete surveillance.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.800]  You pad it down in your search, your X-rayed.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.800]  There's nothing you can do out there, basically, until you don't fall under some type of government
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.200]  oppression, for lack of better words.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.320]  So it's a place where people should go and learn from it, because the more they give
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.600]  up their freedoms, the more our country is going to turn into that.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.920]  And so I urge people, go to the airports, and notice how they're run, and notice everything
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.400]  that goes on, and notice the government control, and the whole thing about it, because the
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:01.280]  more we give up our freedoms, the more we will be living under that type of jurisdiction.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280]  Well you're right, Timon.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.080]  I guess you're getting at the point that it acclimates everybody.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.480]  It sets the parameters for this to be normalized behavior.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.920]  Well, it's a cancer, Alex.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.600]  It's just like toll roads on highways.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.480]  The minute you put the first toll road on a highway, it spreads like cancer, because
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.240]  then any time government needs money, they're going to put a toll on on a road.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.120]  And this is the same thing.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.240]  When governments start eroding your freedoms away, they're going to do it in a slow manner.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.240]  But it's like a slow spreading cancer.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.840]  It will start with the airports, and then it's going to move on to other things once
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.720]  they're secured down, then you're going to see more and more.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:48.200]  I mean, when I drive across country now, I have to down in Southwestern United States.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.480]  You have to come to immigration halls out in the middle of the desert.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]  Stay there.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]  Stay there, Gav.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.480]  Gav, we've got to go to break.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.360]  Let's come back and get back into the TSA, the domestic checkpoints, the border patrol,
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.440]  all of us try to have a just even durable.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.120]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.840]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:21.920]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:30.280]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.120]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.080]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.560]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.880]  Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.440]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.400]  ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.520]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.960]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.200]  Terany is here.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.800]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.520]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.040]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.320]  on earth.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.120]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.960]  expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.640]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.880]  shadow state.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.080]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.520]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.600]  Police cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.600]  corner.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.800]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.840]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.840]  It's here.

[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.960]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.960]  risk.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.240]  What is saving means to make money?
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.480]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.000]  fashion real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.760]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.440]  or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.960]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.320]  and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.640]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.560]  to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:48.800]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:09.120]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]  We are live.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:22.880]  It is, of course, Wednesday, the second day of November 2011 on this live Wednesday edition.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.240]  We're going to do a 27-hour broadcast kicking off 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.120]  We'll tell you more about that after Governor Jesse Ventura leaves us.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.480]  We're going to have three audio streams of all of it.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.920]  That's all posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.600]  Dave Mustaine was on with us at the first 30 minutes of the show today, of course, one
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.880]  of the biggest rock bands ever.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.640]  When he heard I had Jesse Ventura coming on during the break when I was saying bye to
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.240]  him, he said, do me a favor, thank Governor Ventura for his stand and what he's doing
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.240]  with the TSA and other issues.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.920]  I thought I would raise that to the governor.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.360]  A lot of people appreciate your lawsuit and where that's going.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.120]  Before we get into that, Governor, in the last little segment, you were getting into
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.800]  the TSA and you were talking about 100 miles into the U.S., that's most of the country
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.640]  now, all the way around the nation.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.640]  They have Constitution Free Zones.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.960]  In fact, we'll put a map of it up if the guys can find it.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.720]  Just Google Constitution Free Zone, where the Border Patrol searches your vehicle.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:22.440]  I had them try this twice in the last month and literally had to have verbal stand-downs,
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.200]  stand-offs with them, Gov.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.400]  So you were getting into that point.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:32.000]  Well, yeah, people need to understand, again, going back, that our freedoms, if they continue
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.520]  to erode them, they're going to go like cancer.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:41.120]  It'll be a slow process, but it'll eventually lead to the death sentence to democracy and
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  freedom.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:48.240]  You drive around the country like I do now because I don't fly because of my situation
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:55.080]  with the TSA and my pending lawsuit, and you come up to these immigration checkpoints
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:01.720]  and it seems our country is so concerned over illegal Mexican immigrants that they're willing
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:09.320]  to give up our freedoms and our Constitution to stop them, which I think is absurd and
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.320]  ridiculous.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.720]  These checkpoints, you come up to them like in Arizona and California, and they're 50
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.880]  to 100 miles from the border.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.240]  The last one I pulled up, too, I rolled my window down and the guy comes up and he says,
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.520]  you're a U.S. citizen, and I looked at him and I said that you don't have the constitutional
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:34.280]  authority to ask me that young man, and he said, well, that's what we're required to
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280]  do.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.240]  And so, you know, when I realize the guys that are doing it, they need to look at their
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.720]  conscience, too, because they're out there violating the Constitution of the United States
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.720]  because what the superiors are telling them to do, and it's their jobs.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:57.200]  Well, at some point, you have to measure your job against your own beliefs, and so I understand
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.240]  they're the knuckle-draggers, they're the guys on the ground.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.080]  But I still ask them, Michael, how do you feel knowing that you're defying the United
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.080]  States Constitution?
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:12.160]  You're racially profiling and you're asking me to prove my citizenship when the Constitution
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.840]  tells me I don't have to do that within the United States, now if I were at the border,
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  that's different.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.720]  You're crossing into the country, then, but these places are 100 miles from the border
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.920]  and we seem to be okay with them.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:33.840]  I heard now that Obama not changing the subject, but I heard Obama is now going to start reading
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.000]  the medicinal marijuana places in California.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They've been writing them.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Well, that's outrageous.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.720]  Whatever happened to the people's vote, the people of that California voted that they
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:53.160]  wanted medicinal marijuana to be prescribed by doctors as needed, and the federal government
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.160]  is ignoring the people's vote.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.320]  I'm outraged over that, and if we don't start taking our country back at the ballot box,
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.920]  then we're to blame for it.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.720]  And when I say take it back at the ballot box, stop voting for Democrats and Republicans.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.920]  They're destroying our nation right before your very eyes.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920]  Governor, I want to go back through what you've just said here, and it's on record.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.360]  They actually let the illegals through at these 100-mile-deep checkpoints.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.320]  Homeland security has put a freeze on deportations, including felons, and Congress has now announced
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  a subpoena.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.320]  So, it's purely about domestic checkpoints, and I got an RV because I want to stop flying
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:43.160]  as much when I travel, and twice, 98 miles into Texas, I pull up, they go, are you a
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.160]  U.S. citizen?
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.560]  I'm like, do I look like one?
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560]  Yes.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.000]  And they said, pull over, we're searching you, and I got in a big confrontation.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.320]  The next time I said, I'm not going to be smart and mouth about it, basically, I'm going
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.760]  to actually say yes, I am.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  And then they said, pull over, we're searching you, and they had a drug dog, and I said,
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.760]  it's unconstitutional.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.800]  It's one thing to check my, because I've looked at the Supreme Court ruling, to ask if I'm
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.000]  a citizen.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.480]  And it's another to have a drug dog, and he said, it's not for drugs, it's for narcotics,
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]  the same thing.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.720]  So, these are domestic checkpoints, but we were in Las Vegas, and you were about to do
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.720]  an interview, and I'm sitting there, and I said, hey, gov, did you hear this week?
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.560]  They announced TSA checkpoints all over the country, and you're like, and I understand
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.160]  why you're like, you got to be kidding, because that is such Nazi Germany, such Soviet Russia.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.760]  You said, oh, come on, Alex.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.360]  So I showed you on my iPhone, mainstream news, you took about 20 minutes and read a few articles
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  about it.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:40.160]  Now that you know that you're suing them for your rights, you haven't, the judge hasn't
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160]  ruled yet.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.560]  I want you to talk about that on whether or not you can go forward with the suit.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.680]  All this is happening, and now they're announcing all over Florida, Tennessee, you name it,
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.200]  you pull up to a TSA checkpoint with local police under their command.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200]  Where's the 10th Amendment?
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.520]  You know about that as a governor, and they want to come on board and search trucks and
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.440]  passenger vehicles, and they're saying they may even search your person.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440]  I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.400]  And they're doing this in lieu of what?
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]  Terrorism?
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.640]  So they think that we're so, I mean, if the country doesn't wake up to the fact that
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.640]  terrorism is a fraud, and now granted, there are groups in the world that do bad things,
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:31.840]  but for our country, to put such a focus on, it's a fraud, it's a red herring.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.560]  You're absolutely right, Alex, if this is going on, which I see it, you know, like I
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.880]  said, I drive around the country, and I come up to these points, and I think that every
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.680]  driver that comes up to these points should ask these people why they're violating the
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680]  Constitution.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680]  Be polite.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.680]  But ask them that.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:58.920]  Ask them why they're violating your constitutional rights, you know, these guys right on the
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.720]  ground, because they need to be made aware of what they're doing, too, if they don't
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720]  know it already.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.400]  Well, behind the scenes gov, they're giving a manual saying, if you raise the Constitution,
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.320]  or you got a Ron Paul sticker or a libertarian sticker, you're a bad guy, that's the Mayak
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:21.200]  Report, and it's total, but I mean, imagine, terrorists could attack a random cornfield
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.960]  in South Dakota or in North Texas.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.760]  I mean, do we have to have a, somebody in a black uniform randomly anywhere?
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.040]  If terrorists attack shopping malls, are they going to have TSA there?
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.040]  They're saying yes.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.560]  They're now announcing they're going to have TSA in shopping malls, Governor.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.400]  Well, it's getting that bad.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:45.760]  I mean, I went to Minnesota Lynx basketball games this summer, and I walked up to Gillian.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.880]  I have a front row ticket, I'm the former governor of Minnesota, and I had a security
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.480]  guy stop me and asked me to empty my pockets because my wallet and my keys were in one
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.200]  pocket that was bulging.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.760]  And I looked at the guy and I said, I'm the former governor, you got to be kidding me.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:09.120]  I said, do I have to sue you too as well as the TSA?
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  And so it's happening.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.960]  Now, maybe they have more right to do it there because it's a building that's run by private
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.600]  industry, the NBA or the WNBA, and I suppose they can set up any rules they want.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.600]  I don't know about all that, but it's getting sick me, where you as a citizen have to walk
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600]  around and worry about what's next.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.040]  They're going to throw us up against layers and pat us down because we might walk funny
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]  down the street.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.440]  Well, it's like something out of the movie Red Dawn, a fictitious movie about a Soviet
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.040]  takeover of the West Coast.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:50.800]  I'm sure you know, NFL-wide they've now instituted from the ankle to the neck, and they admit
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.960]  they squeeze your wife's breast, they grab your genitals, and this is freedom now.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.480]  The Green Bay Packers rebelled.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.600]  They said, this has actually hurt our ticket sales.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.600]  We're not going to do it.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.600]  But I mean, the ID-
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:09.600]  Remember, the Green Bay Packers are the only NFL team that's publicly owned.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.360]  See, always remember that, and you'll never see it again.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.000]  The Green Bay Packers are grandfathered in, but they are owned basically by the people
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.800]  of Green Bay, Wisconsin.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.280]  Oh, I'd forgotten that.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.280]  That's why-
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280]  They're all shareholders.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.280]  They're the only publicly held professional sports franchise to my knowledge.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280]  That's a great idea.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]  We should do something.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280]  That's how it should be run.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280]  Absolutely.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.280]  That way you wouldn't get teams holding up like Minnesota right now.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.800]  They're bending over backwards, they're going to raise taxes, they're going to violate treaties
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:55.720]  with the Native Americans and bring in more gambling to build the Vikings a new stadium.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.560]  And it'll happen because here's the deal, Alex.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.760]  No governor of these career politicians, regardless of who they are, if a pro sports
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:12.080]  team leaves their state during their governorship, that's the only thing they'll be known for.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:18.560]  And so none of these career politicians want that on their resume, so therefore they will
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.120]  always give in and give the professional sports teams their new stadiums, regardless
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.320]  of the financial status of the state.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:33.480]  I mean, the state of Minnesota just got through balancing over a $5 billion deficit over what
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:40.000]  they did to me back in 03 when they overrode my budget and passed there, the Democrats
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  and Republicans teamed up and passed their own budget.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Well, the chickens came home to roost, they were betting that the economy would get better
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  and save them.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.720]  Well, it didn't happen, it got worse, and they ended up $5 billion, which is a great
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720]  deal of money in Minnesota.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:01.520]  That's like almost a fifth or a quarter of the budget in deficit, which they had to fix
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520]  this year.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.720]  Now they're going to take the taxpayers' money and build the Vikings a new stadium.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.720]  Amazing.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.520]  Well, that was my next issue I wanted to get to, we're about to go to break, but the Occupy
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.840]  Wall Street folks on average are calling for wealth redistribution.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.480]  It's not a question of more taxes, it's where's the money going, a billion bucks for Jerry
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.040]  Jones' stadium in Dallas, he could have paid for that.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.320]  Instead, the taxpayers pay for it.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.480]  This Formula One outside Austin, meanwhile, I don't get these tax breaks, I don't get
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.600]  buildings built for me, and we see the whole country going bankrupt, we're going to come
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.600]  back with Jesse Ventura and get into Occupy Wall Street.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.040]  We're going to get into his lawsuit with the TSA.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:45.760]  Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura said it on this show a few months ago, he said, Ron Paul, go to
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.480]  a third party.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.040]  And Ron Paul's announced now that if he doesn't win the Republican nomination, well, no one
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.360]  just three, four months, if he's got a shot, he's going to go to a third party, probably
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360]  the Libertarians.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:02.480]  So very exciting news, could it be a Ventura-Paul ticket, stay with us.

[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.320]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes

[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.840]  Is capitalism always Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.200]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.040]  Well short segment right now, long segment coming up, Jesse Ventura.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.960]  I've got a laundry list of things to talk to the gov about and by the way this is probably
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.760]  the last interview he's doing before he pulls up stakes here in the next month or so and
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.240]  heads down to the Baja for some surfing and getting away from I guess the new Soviet states
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]  of America.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:45.680]  You know Alex, we laugh over that but we actually start shedding the tear because it's like
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.840]  that's what we're turning into today.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.840]  That's gallows humor.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:54.240]  And you know what gets me is the public's comfortable with it.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.240]  I know it's...
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.120]  You know you got this, well they're keeping me safe attitude, well they'll keep me safe.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.000]  I got news for the people out there, safety is called freedom.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.920]  When you lose your freedom you're no longer going to be safe anymore.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.840]  Well that's a great bumper sticker, safety is called freedom.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  Exactly.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840]  Safety is called freedom.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:26.320]  It isn't when the government puts you under martial law and keeps you safe because unfortunately
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.800]  that's what I see happening in this country and we seem to be sitting back and allowing
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.800]  it.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:37.960]  Who are for the last street protesters, you know I'm solidly behind them.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.600]  Now I want to get into that, in fact let's just start getting into that right now.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.840]  I understand they're angry at Wall Street but a general attack on the free market system
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.000]  what we have is not a free market, you just alluded to these sports stadiums being taxpayer
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  backed and financed.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.880]  What Wall Street, Wall Street is not protesting the free market system, these protesters.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.760]  What they're protesting Alex and people need to be clear on this, what they're protesting
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.600]  is that all of our politicians are owned by Wall Street.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  Yes.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.600]  That's what they're protesting.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.600]  They're saying that 1% of the population is controlling everything.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]  No you're right.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.600]  They're the other 99% and that's what they're protesting.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:31.600]  The fact that Wall Street controls the government, the Federal Reserve controls the government.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.600]  That's why Ron Paul is the only presidential choice.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  Well I want to get back into Occupy Wall Street, the TSA everything is I've got so many questions
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.120]  but specifically that is the true message of most of the folks but the media has spun
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.520]  it and just focused on collectivist and communist or homeless people.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.320]  I've confirmed in Austin they arrest homeless that are drunk and won't let them sleep on
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.800]  the street but they tell them you're only allowed to go stay at the Occupy Wall Street
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.680]  staying by the city council and it's the same thing all over the country.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.800]  They're shipping the mentally ill and the homeless and the alcoholics to the Occupy
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.800]  Wall Street areas to make them look like bombs.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]  Well you know what?
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.800]  Guess what?
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.480]  They're American citizens too so maybe it'll be good to see them to show the underbelly of
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.800]  our country and how low we think.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.880]  Maybe they'll backfire on them Alex.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:33.080]  When people start, if people start opening their minds up a little bit and realize that
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.480]  we're the richest country in the world and yet we have so many homeless and let's remember
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.400]  something about the homeless people.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  What is it?
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.800]  Nearly one-third or one-half of them are veterans?
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.920]  I run into a lot of homeless people.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.920]  Astronomical.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.840]  I can't remember off the top of my head right now but the number of homeless people, the
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:01.680]  number of them that are veterans is astronomical so when you see a homeless person, remember
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.080]  that may have been a person that had to go fight George Bush's wars for him.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  Oh absolutely.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:12.480]  Listen, gov, to be clear, I'm pointing out that they're sending the really bad whinoe
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.560]  type down there all the time.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.080]  Those whinoe types could be veterans too after all.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.040]  We don't take care of our veterans when they come home, Alex.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]  No, no, I agree.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.480]  I was about to say whenever I'm out in public at a rally or something, homeless people show
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:34.880]  up and some of them are like in super good shape veterans all the time on bikes saying,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.320]  yeah, I'm living under a bridge or camping out and you could tell I'm former special
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.320]  forces this, I'm former special forces that, they're black, they're white and so yes,
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.200]  we're seeing a new type of homeless person out there who is a veteran and is actually
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.200]  living in a tent trying to save money.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:29:01.640]  Well, the point is that we're too busy fighting wars to worry about what's happening here
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.640]  at home.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:08.600]  If we would get out of these wars once and for all and stop sticking our nose into the
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:15.680]  world's business like we do, let's shut down all our military bases throughout the world.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.680]  Why?
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.680]  Why are we an empire?
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:25.560]  We're like the Roman Empire and we're going to run the same fate as the Roman Empire.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.760]  I got to tell you, gov, I think this is the most powerful interview I've ever done with
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]  you.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760]  You were on fire today.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.760]  Stay right there.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.760]  I've got question after question.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.280]  I'm going to try to just ask the question and then sit back and let you roll.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.560]  I want to ask you about a ticket with Ron Paul.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.440]  He is saying you might go third party now.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.960]  Big news on that front.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:42.960]  More on the TSA.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  Where's your suit going?
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.960]  The TV show.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  I want to ask you about Libya.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:46.960]  I want to ask you about Obama.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.960]  I want to ask you about everything.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.960]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600]  you to have.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600]  It's true.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.280]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.600]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:36.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.520]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.720]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.960]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.520]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:06.080]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.800]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.080]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.600]  of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.800]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.120]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.360]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.360]  small-owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.720]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:35.800]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.960]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.480]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.120]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:52.040]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.680]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.400]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:16.800]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800]  Hey!
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.400]  A little less conversation, a little more action, please.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.400]  Talk about action.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.040]  All this aggravation is satisfaction in me.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:32.200]  It's Jesse Ventura suing the TSA, we'll tell you where that lawsuit is going in a minute.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:38.600]  And as Elvis says, a little less talk, a little more action, let's get back to Jesse Ventura.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:43.480]  God, there's so many points here, but since during the break, you know, I said, what a
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.600]  great quote, freedom is safety.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.440]  That's as good as Ron Paul's legalized freedom, and you went on to say, well, in your own
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.600]  words, I'd rather face the danger than live on my knees, and then you pointed out, look
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.800]  how many people prescription drugs kill, look how many people honeybees kill.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.240]  I mean, I mean, to claim we've got to have armed men everywhere, putting us in shackles
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.440]  to keep us safe from turbaned men, it's, it's ridiculous.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.080]  Well, what's ridiculous is we're, we're accepting it.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.080]  That's what's ridiculous, Alex, is that the United States people are accepting this.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.600]  How naïve are we?
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.720]  All the guys naïve out there.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.800]  How many of you sit back today and look at the Vietnam war and say, gee, that was a
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.800]  mighty good idea.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.800]  Where the hell are we out there today?
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:35.640]  We're a part of, I don't know, maybe it's the fluoride in the water, Alex.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:41.160]  Maybe the POSAC in the water has gotten everybody so numb in the head that they just accept
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.960]  this without any problems.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:44.960]  I don't know.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:50.960]  Now, that is it, Governor, the sodium fluoride does give a seven-fold increase in cancer.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.080]  It does reduce aggression in males.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.280]  The GMO and rats does basically feminize them.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280]  This is-
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.280]  It's POSAC.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.280]  It's POSAC in the water.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.280]  Call it what it is.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  It is.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.280]  You're right.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.560]  Unfortunately, I've drank low water, not the majority of my life, so I haven't got my
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560]  dose.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.080]  So that must be why I am like I am.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.160]  Man, I grew up in Dallas where it was like 2 percent, two parts per million, which is
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.160]  off the chart.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.160]  And I don't know how.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.160]  I'm still aggressive.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  But I mean-
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160]  I imagine what you'd be without it.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160]  Oh, man.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.560]  Well, listen, I'm not putting up with it.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.000]  You're not putting up with it.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.400]  Let's talk about your lawsuit.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.280]  I mean, wow, they haven't even ruled it and go forward, do they?
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.960]  Well, the good thing is this is the longest they've ever taken out of ruling of this nature
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.960]  and my attorney told me that.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.880]  Every other one that's brought a suit against the TSA or against Homeland has been ruled
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:53.560]  upon in less time than mine has now, so maybe that's a good sign.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560]  I don't know.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.080]  I'm waiting to hear, you know, can I go to court or can't I?
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080]  And my-
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080]  I cannot be able to go to court.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.240]  This is the United States of America.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.760]  It's supposed to be.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:10.040]  Can't I have judgment by my peers?
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.280]  And gov at that critical juncture, your phone cut off for just a moment, can you repeat
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  what you just said?
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.320]  Well, I'm getting another call that I'm ignoring right now, so bear with me.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.760]  But what I'm stating is why can't I put in judgment by my peers?
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.000]  That's all I ask for.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.040]  I want my day in court in front of a jury and let a jury decide if Jesse Ventura poses
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.040]  a threat.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:38.760]  Well, as a citizen, absolutely you should have your day in court.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.600]  And only should they find this to be a federal power grab, 10th Amendment violation, 4th
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.120]  Amendment violation, due process violation.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.720]  I mean, it literally is martial law in their own internal manuals.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.600]  That's what they're actually getting us ready for.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.600]  That's now coming out in the news in just the last few days that this is to be on the
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.600]  streets.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.600]  It is a takeover.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.440]  But how could you not have your lawsuit go forward?
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.440]  I mean-
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.920]  If she throws it out or if she does what the government wants, they want it to go straight
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:14.720]  to the Court of Appeals, three judges paid by them, instead of in front of a jury.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.400]  I want it in front of a jury.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.240]  Now, you've alluded to me privately and you said you're going to have a big press conference
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.960]  if they don't hear your case.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.120]  You want a hint to folks or what's going on in your mind if they don't let you have your
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.120]  day in court?
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.480]  Well, if they don't let me have my day in court, then what you heard today will be mild.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.560]  Let me put it that way.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.360]  What you heard on your show today will be mild compared to the press conference I'll have
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.360]  if they don't let me go to court.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.360]  I gotta-
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.200]  That's where that's at, Alex.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:54.000]  The other thing that irks me, did you see that thing on painkiller prescription drugs
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.640]  and how many people it kills every year?
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640]  More than 20,000.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640]  Yeah.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.640]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:06.200]  We banned marijuana, yet the Obama administration is going to raid marijuana dispensaries in
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.280]  California and they allow prescription drugs.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:13.720]  Marijuana's never killed anybody.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:22.000]  I had a football buddy and I had a girlfriend who years later in high school died on taking
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.160]  too many pain pills.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.040]  I mean, I know people currently who've died.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.920]  I mean, this is a scourge, 300,000 a year die from prescription interactions.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.440]  Well, let's face it, Rush Limbaugh was addicted to pain-killing drugs.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:43.480]  Now, if it can addict a great American like Rush, and of course, I'm being a bit sarcastic,
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.480]  I hope you get that.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:53.320]  I mean, if Rush Limbaugh, and yet they're out there busting for marijuana, they're busting
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.760]  Willie Nelson, oh yeah, we were hanging out with Willie a while back.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:00.680]  I'm sure you've seen since then twice he's been grabbed.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.680]  It's horrible.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:10.400]  Why aren't we taking marijuana and people need to remember that the Constitution and
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.880]  the flag are made of marijuana?
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:21.160]  By the way, you know, it was an internal checkpoint that he ran into last in South Texas, 100
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.000]  plus miles into the country, and they said, you're Willie Nelson.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Do you have marijuana?
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  And he said, what do you think?
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.360]  I mean, isn't that ridiculous that, obviously Willie Nelson's got marijuana?
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360]  Well, and who cares?
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  Does it affect Willie's singing?
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360]  No.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360]  Does it affect Willie's popularity?
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360]  No.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  Does it make Willie feel better?
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]  Probably yes.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  Why is that against the law?
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:49.360]  He's almost 80 and still jogs two or three miles every morning.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.560]  And the point, hey, you know, the point of the matter is let's take control of our country,
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.360]  let's get our hats on straight, and let's figure out what needs to be against the law
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.160]  and what shouldn't be against the law, and marijuana should not be against the law.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.880]  If they have prescription painkillers that kill thousands of people every year, multi-thousands,
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.680]  prescribed, and I just saw a show where the kids, the teenagers now, they're not taking
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.600]  pot, they're taking prescription painkillers, that's the drug of choice now amongst the
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  young people.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.720]  I don't know how they take it, I broke my leg once, not for surgery, they gave me pills
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.320]  and I get nauseous when I eat one of those opiates.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:38.080]  Governor shifting gears into the election, you said three, four months ago and then again
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:43.000]  a month or so ago, here on this radio show that Ron Paul should leave the Republican
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.840]  party and should run as a libertarian because they've got ballot access in at least 48 states,
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:55.000]  maybe 50, they debate those last two, I made the point on air and also made it to the Ron
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.480]  Paul campaign that if he doesn't look like he's going to get the nomination by February
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.680]  March or so, then he should go over just so he can inject real issues into the campaign,
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.200]  but he's going to have a lot more support third party than Ross Perot will.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.880]  Now he announced last week, for those that don't know, you can just type it into Google,
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.480]  that he's looking at perhaps a third party run and that would probably be as a libertarian,
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:23.240]  the libertarians have said, let us know in the next three, four months, we'll give you
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:29.840]  obviously the nomination, Jesse A, what's your view on that and Ron Paul basically responding
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.280]  to you and would you run as his VP?
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:38.600]  Well, first of all, I think Ron Paul's handling this brilliantly because he needs to stay
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:45.000]  a Republican, to stay in the debates, to stay out there on television as much as possible.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.200]  So he should cling to the Republicans all the way till they make their choice.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.280]  That way he can get all the free air time, even though mainstream media ignores him.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:02.120]  Still, if people watch the debates and hear what Congressman Paul has to say, to me the
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.320]  Republican debates are virtually unwatchable.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.880]  I watch him for about 10 minutes and I'm so disgusted, but the other day I forced myself
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.800]  to watch because I wanted to hear whenever Congressman Paul spoke, and whenever he did,
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.640]  he clearly is the only one that makes any sense whatsoever out of the whole bunch of
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:27.680]  candidates up there, clearly by far and away, in my opinion, he's the heads above everyone
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.680]  else.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.920]  Now, he's playing it brilliantly, ride that Republican wagon all the way till they boot
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.400]  him off it, which you know they will, and then as soon as they boot him off it, which
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.080]  they choose their candidate, whatever, then he immediately should jump to the Libertarian
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080]  party.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.960]  He'll have ballot access in virtually every state.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:54.120]  He'll have the momentum of the Republican all the time on TV with them, and he should
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.240]  get numbers big enough to where they'll have to include him in the debates.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:04.080]  If they don't include him in the debates, we should start rioting in the streets.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.440]  Wow, what a statement from Jesse Ventura.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.080]  I guess it is getting down to the point where this government's acting about like the Red
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  Codes.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.120]  If you read the Declaration of Independence, everything in there is exactly what this out
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.800]  of control government hijacked by the Federal Reserve is doing.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:26.400]  Oh yeah, absolutely, and you notice that when Ron Tad brings up auditing the Federal Reserve,
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:32.520]  as those other candidates head for the hills, they don't speak a word about that.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:38.840]  Not one word from any other candidate up there, including the current front runner,
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  the Godfather at Godfather's Pizza, Cain.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.480]  By the way, he doesn't even touch it either.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.240]  By the way, his solution is new taxes on top of the income taxes.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:55.400]  Can you imagine, Governor, the feds involved in sales taxes and VAT, the hell of that?
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:01.760]  Well, you know, if it legitimately could be $9.99, I don't see nothing wrong with that
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.760]  really.
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:03.760]  That's less than I'm paying now.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.760]  Yeah, but you know they're going to jack it up.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.760]  Oh, of course.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.760]  And I would like, you know I'm an advocate of the national sales tax to abolish the
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:18.480]  income tax, which of course was never constitutionally passed in the first place.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.160]  Sure, sure, but only if you can completely get rid of the income tax and have an amendment
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.160]  against it.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:26.760]  Get rid of the income tax and go to a national sales tax.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:31.800]  I've been an advocate of that for 20 years now, you know, because my belief is clear.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.160]  My belief is wealth is not what you earn.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.080]  Wealth is determined by what you spend.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.080]  I agree with that.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.160]  It shouldn't penalize savings and investment.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:45.560]  Now, now expanding on that, but to be specific, putting you here on the hot seat.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.520]  If Ron Paul approached you about being his VP, because I happen to know there's been
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.120]  some scuttle but I'm concerning that.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.640]  If Ron Paul approached you, you know, running as a libertarian and said, Jesse, Governor,
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.920]  I'd like you to run as my VP.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920]  What would you say?
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.320]  Well, first of all, I would say this, that would be the best insurance policy Congressman
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:12.440]  Paul could ever have, because nobody's going to assassinate him and let me be in charge.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.440]  No, no.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.960]  So he definitely, if you want to look at it, would be the lesser of the two evils from
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.440]  their perspective.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.640]  So I would give it serious consideration.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.520]  I would not say right now whether yes or no, because naturally I would have to discuss
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.400]  it with my family before I would do any venture like that.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:38.400]  But if it were to come to pass next spring or next summer, when I get back from Mexico,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:44.560]  if the iron's hot, I don't know, you know, I guess I'll go to Mexico and think about
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  it this winter.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:49.600]  And by the time I get back, it ought to be time, if a decision has to be made, that'll
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.120]  be the time to make it.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.360]  Governor, what about this angle?
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.200]  If Ron Paul doesn't run, if he doesn't get the nomination, we should all push for that,
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.000]  obviously, using that machinery against it, you know, against it, power structure against
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.320]  itself.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.420]  And he doesn't for every reason, his wife's health, whatever, run as a libertarian.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:10.800]  What about Jesse Ventura seeking that nomination, even if he didn't win?
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.240]  And I know you don't do stuff to not win, but you would still win by being on the field
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:21.120]  injecting real issues and being in the national debate, I mean, my God, that would require
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.120]  the libertarians to come and ask me, wouldn't it?
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.120]  Yes.
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.160]  So, and the libertarians have never done that to me before, so I guess the ball would be
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.240]  in the libertarians' corner, wouldn't it?
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.720]  But if you got invited to that party, you would look at the invitation.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:45.120]  Well, I am a libertarian, you know, I've taken their exam, I pass it with flying colors,
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  you know, I am a libertarian, I just like to say small L.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120]  Sure.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.400]  You know, I believe there is a place for government, I believe that government has a place in an
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.480]  organized society that you must have it, where you have some libertarians that don't even
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480]  buy into that.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480]  Yeah, they're anarcho-capitalist.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:10.080]  And, you know, and so, you know, I consider myself a libertarian, small L, I'm physically
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.520]  conservative, I'm socially liberal, I don't believe that government should be in your
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.080]  private life whatsoever, they have no business there.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:20.880]  Well, regardless, you want to audit and abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.400]  What would you do as president?
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.240]  What's your view of Libya?
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.740]  He's won a peace prize, it would last days, not weeks, went on six months, forty-fifty-
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.800]  You know what I find, I'll tell you what I find bad about the Libyan situation.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:42.640]  Our media and our government have no problem showing us Gaddafi's dead body multiple, multiple
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  times, correct?
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.640]  Yes.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.320]  And yet they won't, they outlawed showing our task it's coming home from the war, didn't
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320]  they?
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.320]  That is the biggest piece of propaganda crap I've ever seen in my life.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320]  You're right.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  Listen, I got since...
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:07.160]  Gaddafi dead fifty times over, the quote-unquote Islamic enemy, but they won't show our boys
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.160]  coming home from these phony wars that shouldn't be fought.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.440]  By the way, I on YouTube, you know, the day, showed Walter Cronkite showing the little
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  girl with an A-palm with her skin burn off, and then I showed a modern girl with her
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:29.240]  jaw blown off in cert, and they blocked the video and called it obscene.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:35.000]  No, they're not letting the people see what these wars are doing in our name, that's obscene.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Exactly.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.600]  It's obscene to stick your head in the sand.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.920]  It's obscene as a citizen and a taxpayer in this country that your money pays for these
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.960]  wars, and yet you don't want anything knowledge of them.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:52.200]  You better wake up people out there, and you better start looking at these wars, and you
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:58.600]  better start to realize, Alex, that my country has been at war over half my life.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  Yes.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.160]  And I'm a post-World War II baby.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:08.720]  I was born in 51, and we've been at war for over half my life.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.400]  No other country in the world can come close to making that statement.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.840]  Plus, these aren't wars where we got attacked.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.920]  These are wars for the corporate interests that have taken our country.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920]  Totally.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.920]  Every war we've fought since World War II, I have yet to figure out what for, and what
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.400]  was which fought over.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:35.800]  It was fought over the phoniness of the Cold War, which we all now know is a setup on both
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.800]  sides.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.520]  If you do any historical reading on the other side or our side, or talk to people that live
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.320]  behind the Iron Curtain, they were getting told the same thing we were getting told.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.960]  They were getting told we have to stop the capitalist imperialists from taking over
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:53.960]  the world.
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:58.800]  While we were being told we have to stop the domino effect of communism.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  Meanwhile, the same...
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.960]  A lot of people were going to wake up Alex and realized all of that was planned.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.840]  It's come out, you're right, they released the KGB files and others, that both sides
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:13.240]  were being financed by the megabanks, who were actually playing both sides off against
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:19.320]  each other and using the crisis to create massive debt and authoritarian control just
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.760]  of different flavors in both hemispheres.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]  Absolutely.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.720]  And so the point to the matter is, again, it comes back to we as the people of the United
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.920]  States, are we going to stand for this or not?
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:39.240]  And the simplest way, if Ron Paul becomes a libertarian elected president, that's the
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.240]  only way.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.760]  If we keep electing Democrats and Republicans, we are going to get the same old, same old.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.800]  Why do you think these people are protesting out there?
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.560]  They're protesting because it's equal between both of these parties.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.840]  They are both completely controlled by Wall Street, both parties.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:03.400]  I mean, take a look, it doesn't matter what president we have, Democrat or Republican,
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:09.400]  our Department of Secretary of Treasury always comes out of Goldman Sachs in modern times.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]  Yes.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.400]  Every last one of them.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.400]  Now, is that happenstance?
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.400]  I don't think so.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:20.360]  All right, God, we've only got about eight, nine minutes left and I've got four or five
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.000]  points I want to throw out there at you.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.360]  But first off, we carry all of Jesse Ventura's books, all of the recent modern ones.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:32.920]  We have Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, that's available now in paperback.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.040]  We have Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, 63 documents the government doesn't want you
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040]  to read.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.600]  His newest, very powerful.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.040]  He has American conspiracies, excellent as well.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:45.640]  All of these books are great and they've all been New York Times bestsellers.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:50.640]  Alex, let me out to the TV show this year is going to be very interesting.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.640]  Yeah, let's talk a little bit about that.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:59.800]  Well, it's, we're going after some wild conspiracies this year, conspiracies that I never dreamed
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:06.040]  that I would ever pursue, but I got to tell you they've been very interesting, extremely
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.040]  interesting.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:12.600]  You know, and so I think people, they're going to find a change in the show this year,
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.200]  but as far as the women go, I think they're going to love the show because I'm working
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.080]  with two young men now that are going to knock their socks off.
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:23.920]  I don't know, maybe that's the direction they want to go, get all the women on our
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]  board for the show.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:31.840]  Well, you already had top ratings on two TV, but you know, and the show is going to cover
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:36.960]  some very interesting topics, as I said, it's going to cover some conspiracies that are
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:44.000]  completely new to me, but having done the show now and having in our third season, I'll
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.880]  tell you Alex, I'm open minded to almost anything these days.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.640]  I won't necessarily say I believe all the conspiracies, but they're still going to be
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.080]  very, very interesting and it's going to prove to be a very fun season.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.720]  Sure, most of these quote conspiracy shows they've had only cover Loch Ness Monster
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:04.520]  to Macabre and you're not doing that stuff, but instead you've done the FEMA camps, you
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.440]  had Congress and Homeland Security shut down one of the shows, harassment that I'm not
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:12.560]  even supposed to get into, the point is it's been pretty crazy and now you're doing some
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.600]  of the super hardcore patriot type stuff, but you're also looking into some other areas
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:19.080]  and always running into the globalist as well.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.600]  It's going to be extremely powerful and I'm honored to be part of the show as well.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.120]  We're doing one, I'll just say this and I won't say what it's about, but we're doing
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:36.720]  one conspiracy that if the conspiracy is real, let's say hypothetically it is, it will destroy
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.240]  religion as we know it.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.240]  That's powerful.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.200]  That is what's going on and I know there's a certain person I need to get you guys in
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:48.200]  contact with.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.520]  All right, continuing here, Governor, with some of the other loose ends, you're going
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.000]  to be gone now, probably the last interview folks will hear until it gets back.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.720]  Well, I don't know, you know, nobody wants, Alex, you're the only person who wants to
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.040]  talk to me anymore.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.040]  That's ridiculous.
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:06.280]  I've talked to your public system people, your phone's ringing 24-7, I can just call
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.280]  you up at home.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.280]  That's ridiculous.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.160]  Oh, Jesse, I'm just saying this is not part of your normally scheduled interviews for
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.160]  the books and stuff.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:16.160]  No, not at all.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.680]  In fact, like I said, I won't be having another book out that we're working on our next one,
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:25.480]  it'll be out probably next fall, but it'll be out in perfect timing for the elections.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.600]  Yeah, I can't wait because I have to know this.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:31.640]  It couldn't be better, it can't be, there won't be a better book for election time when
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:37.120]  it comes out, probably summer, it'll be out summer or late summer.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:40.200]  But we can't tell folks the title yet.
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  No.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.200]  Okay.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.200]  Not yet.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.200]  It's good though, it's the best title I've heard so far.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.720]  It's going to be a book that's very timely for what's happening for the election year.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.960]  Yeah, to say the least.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.960]  Okay, and the time we've got left here, gov, again, we're going to post this interview
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.520]  after it airs live today at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, I want to encourage all
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.080]  the viewers, get this out to everybody.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.120]  I think this is probably the dozens of interviews I've done with Ventura in the last six years,
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.360]  probably the most powerful and encompassing total interview.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.280]  In closing, you may not have seen it, but last week, the main papal council called for
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.440]  global government, global currency, a global bank of the world to punish the bankers, give
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.280]  the bankers total control.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.480]  Global government is now openly being announced and pushed as the solution.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.960]  I mean, we're here, Jesse, what's your view now on, from all your research on who runs
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.160]  the world, the global elite, and what's going to happen in the next few years?
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:37.160]  Oh, Alex, I hate to push it off, but your guess is probably better than mine.
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:45.160]  You know, I'm founded over, you know, is it inevitable, is it evolution, is it, I can't
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.400]  believe it would happen in my lifetime that there would be a move to globalize the world
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400]  like that?
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:56:02.200]  I think that, I just don't know how it could happen with all the weapons that are out there,
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:05.360]  between all the different countries and all that.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:12.520]  You know, unless there'll be rogue countries and they'll just be squashed, I don't know.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.000]  There's going to be interesting times coming up here in the next couple of years to see
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.840]  exactly what happens, Alex, and I'll tell you, I'm flabbergasted.
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.840]  I can't tell you what I see in the future, maybe it's because I'm not in a privy position
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:26.840]  to know.
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.720]  Well, your knowledge is increasing exponentially.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.760]  Everybody has different knowledge from their life experiences, but I've seen you in the
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:38.120]  last six years just more and more, you've even corrected me on fine minutiae of, you
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:42.840]  know, conspiracy world type stuff, so you're definitely exponentially growing and you're
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.440]  understanding, so don't be too humble there.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:49.600]  The London Guardian, Sky Television are all reporting that it looks like Israel is going
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:56.520]  to hit Iran, Benjamin Netanyahu today went before the Knesset, they say because they
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:01.240]  think they're building nuclear weapons, though there's no evidence of it.
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:06.320]  Yes, well, they're saying, he's asking permission from the Knesset, here's Sky Television, that's
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:11.240]  Fox in Europe.
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:13.000]  Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  What do you think about that, Gov?
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  I think it's horrible.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  The sooner we're out of these wars, the better it'll be for the whole world.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.960]  I just don't understand why we as a people haven't figured out for centuries and centuries
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.760]  that not much is really accomplished by war, except death and destruction, and this will
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:43.960]  be no different, and I always remember this, war happens when politicians fail, so whenever
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:51.480]  you see war out there, understand clearly that the politicians have failed miserably,
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.800]  and that's how they should be viewed pretty much, is a failure.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:03.800]  Real failure is the end result is war, when you have political failure.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.080]  You're right, we should all be thinking about our children right now, and what would have
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.520]  happened if JFK would have had nuclear war during the Kibble-Misson crisis?
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:16.920]  Well, you know, again, wars, wars is complete political failure.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.920]  It is.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.000]  Gov, it means your elected officials have failed to the max.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  It does.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.840]  Be safe in Mexico, look forward to seeing you again, it was great.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.840]  Thank you Alex.
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:32.680]  And my love to all the Americans out there, keep the chin up and support, support the
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.680]  movement.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.400]  Absolutely, support Ron Paul, we hope you run with him.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.400]  God bless you.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.400]  I will see.
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.400]  God bless Gov, we'll be right back, third hour.
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:57.000]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver, and deliver the solution directly
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:05.840]  into the bloodstream, by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.480]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:22.600]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.040]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:31.640]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.920]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.880]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[01:59:42.880 --> 02:00:02.160]  Silver Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:31.720]  Well, I'll tell you, that was a power-packed, first two hours, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth,
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.760]  then Jesse Ventura, I think it's one of the best interviews, not the best I've ever done
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:35.760]  with him.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:42.840]  We're going to open the phones up in this third hour, toll-free to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:47.400]  What do you think of the total Orwellian society, street lamps watching you, listening to you,
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:51.800]  TSA setting up checkpoints, sticking their hands down your pants, fluoride in the water,
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.400]  Israel's standing there getting ready to hit Iran, he's trying to get permission before
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:59.800]  the Knesset, and folks are like, shut up, they're not going to hit, just let us hit.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:04.800]  All that's happening, big, fast, and furious developments on that front, they're calling
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:09.920]  for gun bans and gun control because of their operation, Senator Feinstein and others, that's
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:15.760]  all coming up in this hour, a bunch of economic news, the incredible things happening in Greece,
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:25.000]  it's all coming up, and the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.320]  By the way, I haven't even really plugged the money bomb once today.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:35.000]  Usually we start a money bomb a month before promoting it, we usually raise about one fourth
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.120]  of the money before we even launch it, this year we haven't raised one tenth of the money
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:46.440]  we need to raise to hire some more crew members, more equipment, syndication systems, a lot
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:51.040]  of things we need to put purely into the operation.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.600]  So if you've not donated yet, we need a strong start officially kicking off at 11 a.m. tomorrow,
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:01.120]  that's infowarsmoneybomb.com or just go to infowars.com and the whole top banner is the
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.400]  infowars money bomb, just click on that, we scroll down a little bit, you can see how
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.000]  much we've raised there, I think it's close to $30,000 which is great, but a lot of the
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:18.720]  equipment we need for TV, $36,650.93, we need to go to $500,000 because I've got a good
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:26.080]  $150,000 of equipment I need, I need to hire a second string of people for the nightly
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.640]  news because that's a stressful job where they work, I don't know, the guys are working
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:32.640]  about 14 hours a day right now and at a certain point with this technical stuff, you kind
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:38.440]  of get burnt out and punchy, we need to have where one crew does the show, you know, every
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:42.040]  day and runs it and the other crew is getting ready for the next day show with certain things
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.920]  and then kind of, you know, flip back and forth with who's actually on the deck of the
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:50.120]  aircraft carrier, they're doing the show every night so we can also beta test and always
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:56.160]  get it off at 7 as we don't do some nights because we produce so much, we need a second
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:01.680]  line here, our starters are always in the field, myself included, I've tried to groom
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:07.360]  people to sit here in the chair but I guess no one can wear a camouflage onesie like
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:13.280]  I do, it's one of the ridiculous crew, it's all deprecating Alex Jones around here, it's
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:23.000]  the only way I'd have it but the office uniform is a camouflage onesie, I don't know why
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.960]  that's so funny but it is ridiculous, Jaren says whenever I wear this camouflage shirt
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.480]  he just imagines that beneath here I'm wearing a camouflage onesie, you want a onesie, it's
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:35.840]  like you put on a toddler but hey, I will assure you, I'm wearing jeans, I'm not wearing
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.920]  a onesie, we don't want to start a new conspiracy theory, you know, I joke about stuff sometimes
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:46.920]  like yes, I'm a reptoid or yes, I'm this or that and it actually says he Jones, Jones
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:52.000]  admits it, he is a reptoid or he is a, Charlie Sheen and Alex Jones have come out and admitted
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.440]  they are Vatican assassins or oh, our pressure is getting to them, they came out and admitted
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:03.400]  they work for the Pope or whatever or they work for Israel, no, it's that it's funny,
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:10.160]  it's funny to say that I'm a black magic master assassin of the Pope, the guy that actually
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.960]  says that and I don't want to give him attention just because it's so nasty but I probably should,
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:18.600]  I actually found a video clip where the guy that says I'm a Vatican assassin warlock commander
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:24.840]  ruler of the 12th goblin fleet says that the atomic bombs, you ought to ask him, I'm not
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:30.800]  kidding, that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nakasaki were Jesuit priests
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:40.640]  up in Foo Fighter flying saucers doing black magic rituals, firing power beams down, yes,
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:47.320]  yes, now that's hilarious, that is hilarious man, I'm going to be honest right now, I admitted
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.920]  I was at, I'm actually 17 trillion years old, I'm actually a reptoid Vatican assassin and
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:56.520]  I was actually there at Hiroshima and Nakasaki out of the bottom of the flying saucer with
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:02.840]  lose fair con, firing mega beams down on him.
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:07.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.720]  chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.080]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.080]  at home.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:20.240]  I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:21.240]  shots.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.480]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:36.240]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.680]  is saying who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:48.720]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:49.720]  the republic.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:55.960]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:02.200]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:07.200]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.840]  Folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:13.560]  listeners to do three things right away.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.960]  Number one, study the past.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:18.240]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:23.080]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.960]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:30.040]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:35.200]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:39.120]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:42.420]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:46.920]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.760]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:51.760]  half.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:56.520]  And again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:00.600]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:06.080]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.800]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.160]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.760]  your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.760]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:22.120]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:26.320]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.320]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:31.680]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:35.760]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:38.960]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:40.440]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.080]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:47.320]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:54.640]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:08:24.600]  Watch the free video at www.EndofAmerica3.com, that's End of America 3.com.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:32.560]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are eight minutes into the third hour of transmission.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.760]  Coming up in the next hour during rebroadcast, we'll loop back into when I was live with
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:42.040]  Dave Mustaine in the first hour, and then Governor Jesse Ventura, I think the best
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.680]  interview I've ever done.
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:46.760]  I did one other couple of years ago that I thought was really powerful, but this one
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:49.440]  was really wide-ranging and he was on fire.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440]  Just amazing.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.920]  Now listen, I haven't plugged this today.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:56.640]  I mentioned we're going to broadcast 24 hours plus tomorrow.
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:02.840]  I mentioned that, but I have not pointed out why we're doing a money bomb.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:05.240]  And then I'm going to go to your calls in the news.
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.200]  We'll get into Israel saying openly they're getting ready to strike Iran and what that
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:14.560]  means, the latest fast and furious, the economy, and more after I talked to Mike and Rick and
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:18.120]  Dan and Gonzalo and Joe and others.
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:24.120]  I'm doing the money bomb, A, because listeners, four years ago, it'll be the fourth anniversary
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:29.480]  coming up here tomorrow, because four years ago, listeners started one and I kind of
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.960]  ignored it and they said, why are you ignoring it?
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.680]  And I said, well, I don't want to grow.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:35.800]  I just want to stay at the same size and make films to a radio show.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.080]  I don't want to be a leader.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.960]  And they said, you've got to grow in the face of this.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:43.000]  You're already reaching so many people, you know, you're some of the best material and
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.320]  information out there.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.040]  We need you to stand up more.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:51.760]  And I used to get mad at that and I thought, you know what, it's true, I need to do more.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:52.760]  I need to do more.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:57.160]  And so we raised $300,000 and helped us move into this office a year later and get all
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:58.160]  the equipment.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:09:59.320]  We've had a couple of money bombs since then.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:04.600]  We expanded our space in the next office, built the whole studio, launched the nightly
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:05.600]  news.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.600]  It's in beta testing now.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  I need to hire, I don't know, three or four more crew members, some reporters, some behind
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.280]  the scenes people to direct and run the show, researchers.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:18.960]  I need another great researcher like Aaron Dykes.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.280]  Problems also finding people.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:24.360]  A lot of great people out there, it's just got to be the right fit.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:30.600]  And so all of that going on, and we're in the face of the new world order, we're destroying
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:31.600]  the globalist.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.040]  We're having the biggest effect for how little we are.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.920]  We need to grow and go to the next level.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.440]  And into this depression, I have to spend so much of my time just trying to get the
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.760]  capital together to continue to expand our operation or just keep it where it's at.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.040]  I remember back in 2008, a well-known media person privately said, what are you doing
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.040]  expanding?
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:52.680]  What are you doing expanding your office during this, what's going to be a depression?
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:55.920]  I said, that's why I've got to expand in the face of this.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:59.840]  That's why I've got to go ahead and, I used to, I didn't even try to track down sponsors.
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:02.240]  I used to, I didn't even try to make money.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.680]  I have started in the last three, four years to try to make money.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.880]  And I've realized we need to be strong.
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.640]  I need to have operating capital for three, four, five months for this operation.
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:16.640]  I need to have backup ghost servers waiting secretly to be flipped on if something ever
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:17.640]  happens to us.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.600]  I mean, we have an important mission coming up on the night they've got a FEMA takeover
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:24.880]  of all communications, never before happened.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:28.680]  They're openly talking about internet censorship, internet kill switches, and Congress admits
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:32.880]  the end of free speech and the Prime Minister of England saying it and, and lamp posts that
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:38.600]  listen to you and warrantless checkpoints, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:44.200]  So it's really elementary and the cherry on top is I've never liked to even say by my
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:45.200]  videos.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.040]  You know, I pioneered 16 years ago, giving my films out for free.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.320]  I pioneered because I just wanted it to be seen.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:57.680]  I pioneered, you know, so much of this, not even knowing when I was pioneering.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.880]  I was just trying every system I could to get the word out.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:08.560]  And so here I am all these years later, reaching 3 million people a day, conservatively, 15
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.880]  million people a week.
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:18.600]  We estimate the different algorithms and Google analytics and others that 5 million of those
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:25.080]  a week are new people that just passively come through and only a small percentage end
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.800]  up staying and finding out more.
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:31.680]  But one or two brushes with this is enough with the seeds to wake you up down the road.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:35.120]  I mean, that's devastating to the enemy.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:41.680]  I mean, and look, we, I know, I'm not saying, oh, look at me, I'm big, I'm great.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:44.120]  Every night I go to bed going, man, what a responsibility.
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:45.360]  I am not that good on here.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.080]  I am not that great of a person.
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.840]  I don't have all the answers to things.
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:57.800]  I'm smart in ways and uncannily intuitive and discernment, but others, I'm dumb.
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:02.280]  So my point is, is that we're stepping up to the plate.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:06.200]  And when you spread the word about the show, when you buy the books and videos and t-shirts,
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:15.160]  when you support our sponsors, local AM and FM sponsors, when you get an XM membership
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:20.360]  or subscription, you support us on channel 166, three hours live every day.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:26.720]  When you do all of that, it literally votes with your dollars and supports liberty.
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:31.600]  And now that all of this is coming down right now, now that all of this is happening and
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:38.680]  everything we've talked about is now unfortunately unfolding, people are ready to listen.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.520]  And I believe our greatest work is still yet to come.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:47.000]  I know that, that, that you think 15 million is a lot a week.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.120]  I'm, I know that we're going to reach 30 million a week.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.280]  And then potentially if they don't kill me or whatever, we're going to reach 100 million
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:54.280]  a week.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.940]  But they know the signal's already out there and they stop me flattered in a pancake.
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:04.480]  It will water the tree of liberty and make people only go out there and look at the tens
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.040]  of thousands of videos and audios and films and material.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.080]  I mean, my gosh, you think my footprint, our footprint together as the info warriors is
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:14.280]  big now.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:19.040]  We need to be a powerful organization just like Ron Paul, we support him just like Aaron
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.000]  Russo when I supported his film.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.760]  Have you noticed I support everybody.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.960]  This is a platform for everybody.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.200]  We've always had an open door.
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.400]  We've been stabbing the back a lot because of it, but it doesn't matter.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.640]  We're always here to try to give people a boost.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.880]  Ron Paul said three and a half years ago on the show without my prompting, he said on
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:45.200]  air, you know, Alex, half my support has come from your audience in donations and on the
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.200]  street.
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.560]  People tell me.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  Think about that.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:56.440]  The original launch of Ron Paul out of Texas, half of it came from you, this audience when
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:59.560]  nobody hardly knew who he was, maybe 1% of the country.
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.240]  Now more than half knows who he is and has heard those alternative ideas.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:05.920]  Even if he doesn't win, he wins.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:08.240]  If Ron Paul doesn't win, don't feel down.
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.280]  Now the Federal Reserve is revealed.
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.120]  Now the global is to expose.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.160]  Now all this exciting stuff is happening.
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:21.160]  So if you've not donated an infowarsmoneybomb.com, you can do it by Visa Mastercard, wherever
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:24.440]  system you want PayPal.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:27.960]  You can also write to us and we'll end up tabulating that in as the moneybomb kind of
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:30.240]  trails off into next week.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:35.160]  You can write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:39.240]  We're also going to, and if I'm going to do it, I've got to do it tonight.
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:42.640]  I'm going to do some acrylic paintings and pen and inks that we're going to auction off
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.640]  on eBay.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:47.280]  I'm going to auction off Tierney Crusher 2, the bullhorn we've used in the last two
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:50.000]  years and all these events.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.160]  I'm going to auction off the sledgehammer I used to knock the hole in the wall and go
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.080]  into the next office.
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:59.240]  A bunch of stuff to get us to that goal of $500,000.
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.040]  And again, that's only 15, 20% of our operating capital here.
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.520]  When you've got 30 plus employees and contractors and you've got giant bandwidth bills, it'll
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:14.440]  probably cost us tomorrow $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, I'm not sure, just to give you a
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:18.480]  free stream of PrisonPlanet.tv for the full 27 hours.
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:22.280]  That's why as a backup we've got Ustream, JustinTV and one other.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:26.800]  We've got that page, even if you can't donate it, infowarsmoneybomb.com and send this strong
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.840]  message to the tyrants of the strength of liberty.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:37.600]  Even if you can't do that, spread the word, go to infowars.com and we're leaving it on
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.600]  the front page.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.880]  It's down at the bottom now of the featured news area, infowars launches 24 hour plus
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:46.440]  offensive against Tierney.
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.800]  And you go to that page, in fact, we can even do that on air, you go to infowars.com and
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.640]  scroll down to the bottom of featured news.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.040]  We're also going to get this posted on the infowarsmoneybomb page.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.600]  You can see the live links there.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:08.800]  You've got the PrisonPlanet.tv stream we're sending out that's in an higher quality, free.
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:12.560]  And then under that you've got Ustream and some of the other systems.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:13.840]  I only see two options there.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.920]  I'm told we've already got four now, including ours.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:19.080]  So we're going to get all those links up there.
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:23.320]  And it is that link that you need to send out to everybody.
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:29.040]  The link that has the headline, infowars launches 24 hour plus offensive against Tierney because
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:37.160]  we've had live events that 3.4 to 3.5 million people tuned into.
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:43.520]  Our Bilderberg coverage on one little Justin TV channel, we don't even promote, three
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.120]  plus mill.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:49.960]  That's four plus mill there now because sometimes we put the show on there and it's had a few
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:56.280]  views since, but three plus million in three days on one little channel.
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:57.280]  I mean, think about that.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.280]  That's a big audience anywhere.
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.000]  They talk about Bill O'Reilly being king of the universe because he has 2 million viewers.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:10.120]  One little Justin TV, three plus mill, I think it's 3.4, 3.5, you can go look it up for yourself.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:12.640]  That's because of you spreading the word.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.120]  That's because of you getting the idea out there.
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:16.200]  And by the way, they're still lining up exactly who's on.
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.200]  It's a who's who.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.600]  George Norrie, David Ike, Fritz Springmeyer.
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.400]  It's a giant list out there and by tomorrow morning, probably even tonight, it's going
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:28.240]  to be linked in this article that breaks it all down.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.800]  So again, infowars launches 24 hour offensive against Tierney regardless, spread the word
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:35.480]  about the money bomb.
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.800]  And the cherry on top is the haters.
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.240]  They're not just angry at the idea that I ask for donations and get them and that we're
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:46.800]  building a strong organization that we're strong and robust and getting stronger thanks
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:50.320]  to your vision and understanding and working with us.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.720]  They're scared of the idea of patriots getting together and building up alternative media
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:59.960]  period and giving to Ron Paul and giving to any alternative system that promotes something
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:04.800]  other than globalist slavery and the high board collectivist dehumanizing eugenics
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:05.800]  agenda.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:11.400]  They are scared of you sponsoring the local AM and FM station to put on hardcore Patriot
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:12.640]  radio.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:14.600]  They are scared of you giving to Ron Paul.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:19.400]  They're scared of you subscribing to patriotic magazines and pro-liberty magazines.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.720]  They're scared of you visiting patriotic websites like infowars.com and awake websites.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:25.800]  They're scared.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:29.520]  They're openly saying they want to censor the internet and shut down alternative media.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.040]  Cass Sunstein saying it.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.120]  It's now in the news.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:36.240]  They now admit in CNET news and CBS it will censor the web.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.240]  They're scared of us.
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:38.240]  We're hurting them.
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.440]  We know they're criminals.
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:41.280]  They're scared from the fast and furious.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:42.440]  They're scared of it all.
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.920]  Be part of history.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.480]  Choose a side right now.
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.320]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com or spread the word about the 24 plus hour transmission coming
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  up tomorrow.

[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:53.800]  Then the Iran war.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.880]  Now we're getting close.
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:57.240]  We've got the fast and furious.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:58.640]  We've got the EU meltdown.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:19:59.640]  It's all coming up.
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:01.640]  It's incredible.
[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:04.040]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.

[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:41.080]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:42.080]  Yes.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:43.080]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:46.800]  Hey, I got a little bit of information about this fast and furious and about some of the
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:50.600]  big drug busts that have been going in southern Arizona recently.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:57.560]  Yesterday, on channel three of Phoenix Channel, their website, phaseyfamily.com, they said
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.560]  it was a billion dollar one.
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:03.360]  Well, they said it was 1.3 million dollars.
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:06.880]  No, but they're saying it's a billion dollar, they think cartel group.
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:07.880]  Yes.
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:11.920]  The guy that was caught, his name was Morales.
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:16.360]  He was arrested two weeks ago in this great big take down of this cartel.
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:19.320]  He's a known Sinaloa cartel member.
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.360]  He was turned over to ICE, he was deported because ICE said they had no evidence to hold
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  him.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:32.560]  Yesterday, he was headed south on Stanfield Road, went through a 15 mile an hour school
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:35.840]  zone at 50 miles an hour ice speed chase.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:41.160]  They caught him, I think he had like 100 pounds of heroin and meth, so much for your
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:42.160]  catch and release.
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:46.320]  Yeah, I saw that, they said they have no reason to hold him, but he's allowed to have all
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:47.320]  those drugs.
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:51.960]  Well, you know, Sinaloa, in fact, I should cover that tonight on The Nightly News, Sinaloa
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.000]  actually brought forward documents, as you know, in federal court and the government
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.440]  admitted it was true that they're allowed to bring an unlimited cocaine into the United
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.440]  States.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:01.840]  So how did he get busted to begin with?
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.440]  I guess one group didn't know what the other group was doing.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:07.720]  Something, something was going on out here though.
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:10.800]  There was taken down quite a bit of the stuff over there.
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:13.720]  In fact, give me that headline again, I'll have that on The Nightly News tonight, I actually
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:15.640]  saw that, but they don't have to find it again.
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.840]  I meant to cover that yesterday, I saw that, I think it was last night, or what was the
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:22.520]  headline on them getting him with all the drugs and letting him go?
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:27.360]  You know, I'm not sure what the headline was, but they were reporting at their website
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.840]  is azfamily.com.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.520]  You could do a search, the last name was Morales.
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:35.640]  Yeah, Morales released.
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.680]  Yeah, and then there was also a kind of tied into that at the same press conference for
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.080]  the sheriff baboon of Pinal County.
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:53.520]  He was also asked about these firearms that were seized in that raid two weeks ago.
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:58.040]  And when the feds came out, because they released all the evidence on Monday, couple
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:04.600]  days ago, that that was one of the questions that was posed to the DEA agent.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:09.880]  He basically said that he was sworn to secrecy and he couldn't reveal if any of the firearms
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:11.440]  that were seized in it.
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.080]  But yesterday baboon said that there were at least two of the firearms seized in those
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:20.280]  raids two weeks ago that were from fast and furious.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:25.520]  Yeah, now we have an article here by Paul Watson yesterday sheriff fast and furious bigger
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:30.400]  scandal than Watergate over two dozen Republicans called for holder to resign.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.520]  Holder got up and perjured himself again yesterday saying he knew nothing, but it's all on record.
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:35.520]  He did.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:38.920]  I mean, just incredible level of lying.
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:39.920]  And don't worry.
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:42.120]  I've got this article here.
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:49.560]  Diane Feinstein uses fast and furious to make case for national gun registry, isn't that
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.640]  just special, making a case for national gun registration.
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:59.040]  Senator Diane Feinstein said perhaps mistakes were made in the botched drug walking program
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:04.160]  known as fast and furious, but she said trying to assign blame misses the bigger problem.
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:07.720]  And she went on to say we just need to register everybody's guns as if we don't already have
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:09.440]  a national registry through next.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:11.960]  She means you have to come and turn yours in and have them registered.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.120]  This is a deep concern for me.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.480]  I know others disagree, but we already have very lax laws.
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.320]  It comes to guns Feinstein an advocate of gun control.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:19.880]  She means victim disarmament.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:24.680]  She likes to disarm her food said during I mean, nobody wants to eat a cow when it's
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:25.680]  on their table.
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:27.120]  You know, it's still the hooves and horns.
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:28.400]  I understand she's a vampire.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.560]  She wants to tie down said during Tuesday's hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.320]  on crime and terrorism.
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.720]  And she went on to say that again, they think we need to have a national gun registry.
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:41.760]  So amazing information there.
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.280]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.400]  Anything else you'd like to add Mike stand by your guns, man.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.920]  Don't ever give them up.
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:59.040]  Well look, the war for Texas independence started when folks had moved into Texas, an
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.760]  area that Mexico had never been able to hold Spain hadn't been able to control.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:08.640]  And a bunch of people that had been in wars with the natives who were ready for the fight
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:14.080]  came out of Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, places like that.
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:20.800]  My ancestors on both sides of my family came in and a few years later had the place under
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:27.480]  control and we're willing to get in the fights and the natives were fighting each other too.
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:31.720]  It was a standard operating procedure came in, conquered the area and then Santa Ana
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:36.600]  took over and said I'm coming to take your guns and they said come and get them.
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.880]  And it also started with the British when they said we're coming to take your guns.
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:42.960]  That's how 1776 started they said come and take them.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.560]  And so that's probably how it'll start again.
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.880]  I certainly don't hope for it.
[02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:46.880]  I don't wish for it.
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:50.800]  But once it starts, you'll see how cowardly the government is.
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:57.760]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:03.040]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:12.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:17.520]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:18.720]  on earth.
[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:23.560]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:25.400]  expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:29.640]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:31.280]  powerful shadow state.
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:35.560]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:39.960]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:49.280]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:51.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:52.320]  It's here.

[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:13.520]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:22.080]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:29.280]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:35.280]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:40.240]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:47.040]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:32:56.680 --> 02:33:14.120]  And gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:38.600]  Yeah, they call me the working man.
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:42.240]  The spirit of the radio is another great song they've got, the magic of the radio going
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:45.000]  out and all these people hearing it, it's just incredible.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.120]  I want to go back to Rick and then Gonzalo and who else has been holding the longest,
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:53.800]  Dan, Hector and others.
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:56.480]  Jim, we'll get to all of you.
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.520]  And I do need to get into some of this fast and furious, we already covered some of it
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:07.280]  and they've got a new geriatric terror group they busted, it's pretty ridiculous.
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.960]  The feds have come out and revised the economy's outlook to lower.
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:13.320]  We told you it's a design depression.
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:15.720]  We told you what would happen with precision.
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:19.160]  We told you they would announce a bank of the world as a solution.
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:23.320]  Look, this is all planned out by the Trilateral Commission in the 1970s.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:28.560]  I've been on here almost 17 years telling the same story because I know what I'm talking
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:32.240]  about because the globalist are real, world government is real.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:33.400]  It's now out in the open.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.920]  And a lot of yuppies are like, I don't care if it's out in the open.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:42.960]  You know what, they told me it didn't exist so it still doesn't exist.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:45.080]  Like it's fashionable to be stupid.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.680]  It's fashionable to be a sucker.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:48.160]  No, it's not fashionable.
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:49.160]  Okay?
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:50.160]  It's downright stupid.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:53.600]  Now, I'm going to go back to your calls in a moment, but if you're a prisonplanet.tv
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:56.080]  viewer, we'll put it up on screen.
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:03.320]  If you go to infowarsmoneybomb.com, infowarsmoneybomb.com, the easiest place to find the free screen
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:05.000]  of this daily TV show.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.880]  And tonight, we're going to have the nightly news free to everybody at infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:15.520]  seven o'clock, then it'll be re-streamed all the way until we're live, 11 a.m. tomorrow,
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:19.600]  and then broadcast for 27 hours straight.
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:23.560]  I'll broadcast for something like 15 or more of that 27 hours.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:26.640]  We got Aaron in for a few hours, the middle of the night, Paul Watson.
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:31.720]  We got Gerald Salente coming on, David Ike, George Norrie, the list goes on and on.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:35.720]  Of course, George Norrie at coast2coastam.com.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:39.920]  By the way, I'm on coast2coastam.com for three full hours Monday night.
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:43.960]  Very excited about that interview, we're going to cover some really powerful subjects.
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.760]  So excited about that coming up on Monday.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:50.240]  I pop in frequently every month or so, but I like the full big beefy interviews because
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:54.680]  George does such a great job at interviewing and bringing up questions with his understanding.
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:59.480]  But tomorrow, 27 hours kicks off, you go to infowarsmoneybomb.com, and there you can
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:01.600]  see me just a few seconds delayed.
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:08.840]  That's our high quality stream, and we estimate if 400,000 people watch this for more than
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.400]  about 10 minutes apiece, we're going to be paying about $20,000.
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.120]  That's why we have money bombs.
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:16.240]  People say, we'll make your whole nightly news show free.
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.960]  If I had millions of dollars for free bandwidth, I would, but that's why we're beta testing
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:25.600]  it with members, and it'll still be there for members, to put it on select TV systems
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:30.040]  that are already wanting to pick it up, that we've got to beta test it and get it all done.
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:35.480]  I'm not a TV guy, I started out on access TV 16 years ago, I'm self trained, but we're
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:38.320]  building the system, we're doing a great job, that's why we have the money bomb coming
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:39.320]  up.
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:44.200]  So again, infowarsmoneybomb.com, or there's links at the top of infowars.com, you see
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:49.960]  the big giant monster ad banner that kind of wraps the whole site, and you just click
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.600]  on that, it'll take you there to the video, and we're going to have a live updated page
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:37:00.120]  that also has the backup feeds as well in case ours goes kaput.
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:04.280]  You'll have to watch on a lower quality Ustream and just in TV, I'm not complaining, they're
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:10.680]  great services, that's just if we get 3.5 million viewers, our servers aren't staying
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:14.960]  up of 100,000 tune in, and that's a problem.
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:19.880]  So you may suddenly see, we have our guys watching it tomorrow, if it builds up, we
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:26.000]  start making other things slow, we'll have to hide that stream for folks that are already
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  on it, but new folks can't get on, then you'll have to go to the other three backups that
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:34.960]  we've deployed, but even just in TV at one point, we had like a million people on it
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:40.880]  once, went down, I mean, we crashed just in TV there in Bilderberg.
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:46.280]  So I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, you never know with these things, just spread
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:53.800]  the word about the money bomb transmission, 27 hours of power packed info, you definitely
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:56.920]  do not want to miss this information.
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:59.480]  Wow, look, it does that weird lensing effect.
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:06.720]  When you put the money bomb on the screen, then you can see it as it cycles through,
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:13.920]  like when you look at a mirror with a mirror behind it and creates that event horizon.
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:17.800]  There it goes, and it's weird how it takes a little while to do it, look, dude, dude,
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:23.920]  dude, just off into infinity, hey, blow that up, can you blow the screen up and show that?
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.440]  Again, if you're a radio listener, you can go right now to infowarsmoneybomb.com and
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:31.000]  you can watch what we're talking about there.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.360]  In fact, for folks that are going over there to watch it, we'll do it one more time at
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:38.400]  the end of the show where we go to the infowarsmoneybomb page and show the video player of us live
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.520]  and then it creates that crazy effect where it just fades off into the distance, like
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:45.200]  there it is doing it right there.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:51.600]  All right, that's, it's like some kind of hyper warped thing, look at that, looks like
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:39:00.000]  a high tech landing field for a star destroyer or something, look at that, wow, that's weird.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.320]  Okay, that's enough, I'm like a little kid, ladies and gentlemen, you haven't figured
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.320]  that out yet?
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:11.440]  I'm in here wearing my camo onesie, I mean, come on, that's, that's where it's at.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:15.280]  We got a lot of surprises, by the way, tomorrow during the money bomb, I may even wear a camo
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.160]  onesie on air because I'm broadcasting 27 hours straight, I'll have the, all right, I'm
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:23.960]  not going to get into humor now, I'm going to stop right now, I'm going to stop right
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:24.960]  now.
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:30.000]  This is not idiocracy, this is not idiocracy, by the way, I called all those other famous
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:35.160]  people to get them on, Dave Mustaine, Ventura, it was as easy as a phone call, I got to call
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:41.280]  judge, maybe I have him as a surprise guest, I need you to just make that call, don't I?
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:47.520]  We're going to go back to your phone calls, but I'm going to do this live on air here,
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:51.920]  where did my sharpie go, there it is, I'm going to do this live, this is tyranny crusher
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.760]  too, in its lore, we've only had this for three years, we already had it as a backup
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:01.480]  for the old tyranny crusher that I'd had for more than a decade, and then that baby
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:10.040]  went for $50,000 plus on the eBay auction, and then they tried to sabotage it, but somebody
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:14.680]  still came through and got it for $50,000, so no weapon formed against it, she'll prosper.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.720]  Starting at 11am tomorrow, we're going to have this also on the live feed and posted
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:21.720]  at infowarsmoneybomb.com, I'm going to have artwork, I'm auctioning off, problem is I
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:27.040]  don't want to sell any of my oil paintings or painting inks I've done, I just like them,
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:32.000]  but I guess for the cause I'll do it, some of my old stuff, and then I haven't been too
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.120]  busy, I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to go home tonight and just do a whole bunch
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:39.000]  of quick paintings and some drawings, we'll auction those off tomorrow too, but tyranny
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.760]  crusher too baby, here it is, give me a document cam shot on this, I'm going to sign this
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:52.320]  on air right now for everybody for posterity, camera right there, zoom right in, thank you,
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:41:00.120]  and there it is, I will sign it, oh look at this, look at this, this Sharpie is dry,
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:06.400]  here I'll draw like a little hound dog or something here, how's that, draw my French
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:10.640]  Bulldog, now it's more like a cat, that's not a very good job, this one gives me a better
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:14.240]  Sharpie, I'll do it, thank you, thank you sir, I don't know why I didn't check that
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:22.560]  one, and now I can finish the drawing, there we go, this does not look like my French Bulldog,
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.960]  it looks more like a bush with a face on it, doesn't matter here, now I will sign it, tyranny
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:33.120]  crusher too, right here, again for radio listeners you've got to go to infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:47.840]  you can watch the feed of all this, 2011 tyranny crusher two, TC two, that's it, oops, mess
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:55.280]  that up, it doesn't matter, makes it original, tyranny crusher two, so there you go ladies
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:04.640]  and gentlemen, that's your tyranny crusher two, 2011, and I will draw an image of who
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:09.360]  we're fighting on here, we're fighting the government pigs, so I'll draw you a little
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:20.560]  pig on here, there it is, as a little hoofs, a little tail, and there is the pig, kind
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:35.120]  of like a mouse too, and I'll say end the fed, there we go, now it is unoriginal, here
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:45.360]  I'll maybe I'll do an infowars.com on here, now I've gone completely insane, INFOWARS.com,
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:55.280]  2011, there you go ladies and gentlemen, tyranny crusher two, battling the pigs of the new world
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:00.400]  order, battling the Federal Reserve, oink oink, this is going to be an incredible transmission
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:06.560]  tomorrow, absolutely power packed, and you definitely want to join us for this event
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:12.720]  ladies and gentlemen, it's something you definitely don't want to miss, the launch pad
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:21.760]  is infowarsmoneybomb.com or find it at infowars.com or prismplanet.tv, okay now I am out of control,
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.160]  I'm always out of control, let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here, Rick in Wyoming,
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:33.600]  and then Gonzalo and others that have put up with me, go ahead, Alex, I'll offer a couple
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:39.840]  suggestions and tell you why I was throwing them jail as a disabled that last year during
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:48.560]  a Sturgis rally, so here it goes, you could offer some key rings and set up reps in every
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:56.400]  state and I would like to be the one for Wyoming, and you could also set up a link on your page,
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:02.560]  I have several thousand photos that I could submit to you that you could use for whatever you want.
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:09.840]  No, our reporters like the Green Lantern have a ring, oh that's even better, that's a great idea,
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:15.840]  we could turn into ring knockers of our own type. Yeah, and I don't know if you know it,
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:22.560]  but as the retired professional photographer, did you know the color red, the eye is drawn
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:29.360]  the red before any other color, so you could start printing your lettering in red, so it would be
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:38.400]  more noticeable for the people, and as I go to the Sheridan VA and I pass out your red pens and
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:44.320]  all I tell is the vets there, that this is a truth website and they should go check it out
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:50.880]  when they get online, if they are online. By the way, we have cut the prices on all
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:57.200]  of the bumper stickers, pens, all the stuff to get the word out, to cost, it is now to
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:01.360]  cost at infowars.com to launch an even bigger offensive against the globalist.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:14.800]  Okay, and last year I was approached by, who I call an insane person, I walk with a cane and he
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:21.920]  lived in a trailer court, I lived in South Dakota and he came up to me and I pointed a mace weapon
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:29.200]  at him, the safety was on, and he called the police and 12 cop cars and one motorcycle officer
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:35.680]  came in the trailer court and they arrested me, they did not read me my rights until I was put in
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:42.640]  jail, and I think it's CD about all of that about a month ago. I'll try to look for it,
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.000]  so much comes in, I guarantee you, somebody looked at it, I see a lot of the stuff, I'll go,
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  look the issue is, if somebody's menacing you in your face, you have a right,
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.240]  especially with a non-lethal weapon to to flash it, I mean that ends a lot of altercations right
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:45:59.280]  there, I mean what was the guy saying to you when you showed him the mace?
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:08.400]  He started, he is also treated at the Fort Meade VA when I was treated there, he'd jump in up and
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:14.560]  down and say, oh I got you now, I got you now, and they wouldn't take a statement from my wife,
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:19.520]  they took one from the neighbor, they threw me in jail, it went to court, and by the way,
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:25.520]  they don't use the Bible anymore when you swear upon something, and no, I know, I know, they're
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.120]  getting rid of all of it, I guess you just swear allegiance to the government and the lying and
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:34.400]  evil, well listen, here's the deal, especially somebody who's using a cane or disabled, that's
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:38.960]  why it's so good to still be young and be muscular and aggressive, sometimes I'll see kind of gang
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.240]  banger types, try to act menacing and see if they're scaring me at a gas station somewhere, and I
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:48.640]  can't help it, I enjoy kind of, you know, bugging my eyes out at them, especially with my kids,
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:51.520]  because you know, it's just, then I go into caveman mode and I'm literally thinking about
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.680]  ripping their heads off and things, but you know, going completely ape on them, literally the word
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:00.160]  ape, but I can't imagine what it's going to be like when I get old, because I've talked to
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:04.800]  old people how these punks mess with them, get in their face, do things to them, that's what guns
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:09.920]  are for, they're equalizers against thugs, but I appreciate your call, God bless you, I'll dig
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:15.760]  through the stuff and look for that desk. Now Gonzalo, in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:23.680]  Oh yeah, Alex, I've just been listening this whole year pretty much, I've been grabbing my silver,
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:30.960]  they're doing this thing downtown called Occupy Lansing, they got people living at the park pretty
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:36.880]  much right down the street, and on October 15th of this year, we all went down there, I even actually
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:41.440]  skipped class to make it there to attend, I took a whiteboard, because you know, that way I could
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:46.080]  save many things without having to carry around a bunch of poster boards, and I had my V for victory
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:50.160]  shirt on and all that, and other people, you know, approached me with the fluoride shirts, and there's
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:53.200]  a lot of people in Lansing are listening to you, Alex, just wanted to know that.
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:59.600]  Oh, I want to be clear Gonzalo, again, all over the country, it's in the fetters, it's anti-globalist,
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.640]  it's awake people, they've tried to co-opt that they were unable to, so then they just give attention
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.960]  to the collectivists to make it look bad to conservatives, so people don't get together
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:12.640]  across the board, regardless of politics, religion, race, whatever.
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:17.520]  That's why they're now cracking down on Occupy nationwide,
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:20.480]  that's why they're attacking them nationwide now and demonizing them,
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:24.720]  they went from three weeks ago, them being the darling, to now attacking them because the co-opting
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:30.480]  didn't work. Yeah, well, I'm here without their virtual material, and he was telling us that
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:36.240]  we give them hope and all that, and virtual material has been on CNN, yelling at all the
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.280]  news reporters and all that, letting them have it, and I just get so excited when I see people
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:44.000]  in the higher level than me fighting for us and stuff like that.
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:47.840]  Who was there? Who'd you see at the event in Michigan?
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:51.280]  Oh, it was Verge Manero, the mayor. Yeah, good.
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.880]  Yeah, he was there and he did a little speech and everything, and there was a lot of people,
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:00.160]  well, there wasn't really that many people out there, like I wish there was, but there was a
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:05.600]  lot more people at the General Assembly. And I'm going to tell you this, in 1800,
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:13.840]  there were probably 500 abolitionists, and in 1870 they'd won. So again, it's not about majorities,
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:21.040]  it's about being in the right. If 51% of America said kills the people who are age five who have
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:25.760]  black hair, it would be illegal. I don't care if they take the government over and say it's legal,
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:30.240]  they're now tyrants and criminals, and I don't follow what they say, just like with the Nazis
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:37.040]  and the Soviets. So great job. Anything else, Gonzalo? Oh yeah, also the the Orchid men are also
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:42.160]  spying on people who they go and, you know, disinfect past and whatever, and now they've
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:50.640]  got to report any marijuana smell or anything like that. And also the Board of Water and Light has
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:55.200]  reported that they admit that there's fluoride in the water, they tell you where it comes from,
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:59.920]  it's in their annual water report, but our water is the fourth best tasting in the world for all
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:06.720]  the other cities who participated in that. Well that's extremely, extremely exciting. Now all
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:10.880]  over the world they're removing fluoride from the water to the globalist chagrin. You know what
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.840]  their response in Arkansas was when a whole bunch of towns took it out because they've got one of
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:19.680]  the best aquifers in the world, they don't need anything added to it. Guess what happened? They
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:25.920]  just passed a law signed a month ago that it's the law in the state before it was a federal mandate.
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:30.800]  Now it's the law that sodium fluoride and all the other toxins that come with it
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:33.280]  are put in your water. I mean is that not incredible?
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:41.120]  Yeah, I think it's a load of bull and a few other cities in my state have got it removed and I'm
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:50.000]  hoping that we can do the same. And also I have a video on YouTube that sampled you and Governor
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:54.720]  Ventura of the Secret Society. Give us the name quick, we're almost out of time. What's the name
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:59.920]  of it? Illuminati by G-C-U-E. Okay great, we're out of time. More calls straight ahead, stay with us.

[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:06.320]  Hi, Jason Lewis here. Anybody who's been listening to my program knows how shaky the U.S. economy
[02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:12.000]  is right now. Will we have a V-shaped recovery or will it be a W-shaped one where the nation
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:16.720]  slips back into recession? Of course, if you think that Washington can spend or inflate its way out
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:21.760]  of a downturn, you've got nothing to worry about. But as you know, I have my doubts. So let me tell
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:27.920]  you about gold. Now, as my friend Ted Anderson from Midas Resources likes to say, gold like all
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:33.760]  commodity markets fluctuates in price and you could lose money, but it has never been worth zero.
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:38.240]  Give it some thought and if you're interested in converting your IRA to gold or would like to
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:45.920]  actually have it in your possession, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237. The U.S. dollar
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:50.880]  was once backed by gold, but has since lost 90% of its value and if things don't change,
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:58.720]  I'm afraid the trend will continue. Call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237 for gold and
[02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:05.440]  tell them Jason Lewis sent you. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:13.120]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind. We're going to go into
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:18.000]  re-streaming of the video and the audio from today's show at enforcemoneybomb.com,
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:23.360]  the easiest place to find it. When the show ends in five minutes and Dave Mustaine of
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:28.400]  Megadeth right out of the gates talking about the new rule order in Obama, then we had Jesse
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:32.400]  Ventura on for one of the best interviews ever. That is all coming up in the re-transmission.
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:36.560]  It'll all stream until the nightly news tonight. We're going to put that out free for everybody
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:42.080]  and that'll stream until the kickoff of the fourth annual Money Bomb, 27-hour transmission
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:47.680]  tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time. It's going to be a big event. Please spread that link
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:57.120]  out to everybody. Okay, let's go ahead now and let's go to the calls here. Let's go to Dan and
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:01.760]  then Hector Manoba have time for the others, but I want to talk to everybody. Dan in Colorado,
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:06.880]  you're on the air. Hey Alex, this is Dan in Vale of Colorado. Thanks for taking my call.
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:12.400]  Thank you for calling brother. What's on your mind? Well, a couple quick things. Our primary
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:18.720]  deadline for the Republican primary to be registered is approaching December 7th here in
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:24.080]  Colorado. I want to make that point and also around the country, people have to be registered
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:30.160]  for the primary to vote and support Ron Paul. It's a very important point. People get registered
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:36.960]  so they can support him. The other item was love to see you have Michael Tessarian on again. You
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:42.720]  had a great interview about three years ago. Loved it and like to see you can get him on again.
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:49.520]  And if possible, if George Norrie can plug your Money Bomb tonight, that would really
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:54.080]  there's a lot of crossover in your eye. But I mean, here's the deal. As a host myself, I don't
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:58.320]  like people asking me what to do and stuff. And I hear that's his own thing. I don't think
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:04.160]  so. So I don't even want to tell him to do that or ask folks to do it because then we'll just bug
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:09.440]  him. I'm on his show next Monday. That's huge support to overall message with his 16 million
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:15.040]  listeners. But thank you so much. It's an interesting idea. Hector in Texas, go ahead. You're on the
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:22.480]  year. Yeah. Yeah, I live in Laredo and the Scuttlebud is that there's a several cartel members
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:27.680]  specifically set the members who are just waiting for the call to activate and, you know, start their
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:35.120]  war here in our community. And I've heard it from several different people. And well, they're
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.920]  already doing it. I mean, they're already killing people. And the government, again, the government
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:44.800]  ships the drugs in, lets the drug king pins off, it takes your kid to jail for a marijuana cigarette.
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.080]  That's how it works. This is the sacrament of the government takeover.
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:52.240]  Understand that in our city, just a couple of weeks ago,
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:58.000]  our sheriff's deputy got caught with heroin, heroin, and he was trafficking heroin. And
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:02.720]  one of our, there's several instances of that that they've been caught dealing drugs, the cops
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.360]  themselves. But what I'm saying is now that we're actually going to feel it now, because
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:12.480]  that's what I'm hearing now more and more often. And I wanted to ask you a question about that,
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:17.760]  because on your South Texas tour, I think it was South Texas tour, you spoke with several
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:24.640]  individuals that gave you that information as well. And I wanted to know what your perspective
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:30.400]  on that is. Well, it's just the crime, the intimidation, the kickbacks that has taken
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:36.080]  Mexico down into a failed state is now coming here. And it's all because of the phony drug war
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:41.360]  that's destroyed Mexico and now destroying the United States. And it's just getting worse and
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:45.840]  worse. And it's all swept onto the rug, which allows it to only grow and grow and get worse.
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:53.120]  I mean, does that answer your question with? Yeah, I have another statement to make with
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:59.040]  fast and furious and Janet, Janet Napolitano. I mean, how insane is it that all this whole
[02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:03.600]  police state, you know, we're, you know, padded down, we're surveilled, there's surveillance for
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:08.560]  every civilian, every, you know, citizen, you know, watch your back, the terrorists might get you.
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:12.240]  But, you know, those who are in power, they can get away with anything.
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:18.000]  Janet Napolitano has been lying. Nobody suspects her. Exactly. That's what tyranny is. They're
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:22.400]  crooks. Crooks come into a bank and say, everybody get on the floor and they tie you down and they
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:27.040]  take the security guard's gun. Tyrants want to take your guns. They want to stick their hands down
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:33.680]  their, your pants. They want to train you to be a slave. It's that simple. I'm out of time. We'll
[02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:38.560]  see you at the night, seven o'clock. M4 Wars Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.TV. Free stream to
