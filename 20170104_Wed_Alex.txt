[00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:20.695]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.657]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:34.577]  We are live on this Wednesday, January 4th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:40.801]  Alex will be coming up with special reports throughout the show, the first of which will be aired after the break.
[00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:46.025]  For the first few minutes here, we want to concentrate on the breaking news, which is, of course, the mainstream media.
[00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:54.770]  Doubling down in its failed narrative that the American people completely don't believe that Russia hacked the election for Donald Trump.
[00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.451]  This is a headline up on USA Today.
[00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:09.839]  This is the flavor of the manipulative narrative that we're seeing once again today about Russia in the aftermath of Julian Assange's interview with Sean Hannity, which we're going to play clips from later in the show.
[00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.660]  This is USA Today, though.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.822]  Trump cites Assange's claim about Russia hacking
[00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:26.350]  When it comes to claims that Russia hacked Democratic officials during last year's election, President-elect Donald Trump is apparently taking the word of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over that of U.S.
[00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.531]  intelligence officials.
[00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:34.976]  So again, massive helping of butthurt from the mainstream media, from the Democratic Party establishment, that
[00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:55.586]  A. Donald Trump tweeted about what's in the news, how dare he do that, and that B. he took the side of Julian Assange when it came to Assange's denial, which again we're going to play later in the show, that he, the information, the leaks he received concerning John Podesta's email, the DNC leaks, didn't come from Russia.
[00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.228]  They didn't come from a state actor, because we know from what
[00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:06.635]  Assange has intimated in the past they most likely came from murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich.
[00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:20.188]  But again, they've stacked up Assange's credibility against the credibility of the mainstream media and the much vaunted US intelligence apparatus, which its entire raison d'etre is to lie and deceive people.
[00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.629]  Now this is pretty interesting.
[00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.190]  Pretty interesting, given what happened last week.
[00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.111]  And we can't talk about this enough.
[00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:35.996]  Which is the fact that the Washington Post, which has been lecturing everyone about fake news for the past God knows how many weeks...
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.862]  Completely faked a news story about so-called Russian hackers hacking into the US electrical grid.
[00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:54.704]  Remember they put out this story last week, in fact there's a good summary up at Liberty Blitzkrieg, which is here's the best summary of the Washington Post's latest fake news fiasco.
[00:02:54.704 --> 00:03:00.885]  So they painted this dire scenario of Russian hackers hacking into this utility grid in Vermont.
[00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:07.631]  Turned out within hours, within hours, to be absolute BS.
[00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:20.103]  Not only was the computer infected with this malware not connected to the US electric grid, the malware on the computer can be bought from the internet by anyone.
[00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:37.711]  In fact, this was so rubbish, this was so debunked, within hours of it being published by the Washington Post, that they then had to publish a second article admitting that there was no evidence whatsoever that Russia hacked the US electric grid.
[00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:47.176]  Just imagine for a second the gravity of that claim, backed up by absolutely zero evidence that there was this team of Russian hackers
[00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:52.099]  Scheming to plunge the entire United States into darkness.
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:58.443]  That was evidence that they had attempted to do so with the malware infection of this computer.
[00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:05.027]  Again, turned out to be absolute, unbridled, nonsense, fake news.
[00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:16.895]  This is the same publication that bangs on about Pizzagate, and this idiot gunman, who thankfully injured no one, going into a pizza parlor, and how that means fake news is so deadly.
[00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:30.400]  They literally put out an article accusing Russia of hacking the US electric grid with no evidence, completely fake news story, the kind of news story that could create international conflict.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.423]  They publish a retraction in the form of a second article and you know by this week everybody's forgotten about it.
[00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:57.625]  So yes, when Donald Trump tweets and says that WikiLeaks, which has a 10-year proven record of accuracy, is more reliable than the Washington Post and their fake news narrative and the US WMDs in Iraq fake intel community, then yes, it's sensible that we would believe Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
[00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.987]  We'll be back with Alex Jones live after the break.
[00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:06.640]  The Huffington Post says Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.523]  And they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of Trump right now, before the inauguration.
[00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:25.891]  In an article titled, Impeaching Trump, The Process Begins Now, Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says President-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even Richard Nixon.
[00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:26.712]  Whoa!
[00:05:26.712 --> 00:05:30.554]  And he expects Trump will immediately break the law and violate
[00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:31.975]  The Constitution.
[00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:40.901]  Therefore, the Huffington Post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin the first day Trump steps into office.
[00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:51.508]  The idea is to keep daily records of Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance with Vladimir Putin.
[00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:56.911]  More desperation from the lunatics on the far left.
[00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.573]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:09.101]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use, saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.642]  And now they say don't use holiday.
[00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:12.104]  Well, I got some news for them.
[00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:15.787]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using, and we're going to
[00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:16.287]  We're good.

[00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:07.449]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:20.222]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:24.085]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:31.072]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:43.943]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:07:43.943 --> 00:07:45.505]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:07:45.785 --> 00:07:52.169]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:58.632]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:20.065]  We have got two big guests with big breaking news coming up in the second and third hours, the first of which is Jason Kessler.
[00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:31.057]  He was the journalist who confronted the vice mayor there in Charlottesville who made these basically racist, misogynistic tweets, was then of course rallied round by his leftist colleagues.
[00:08:31.638 --> 00:08:32.758]  We've got him coming up.
[00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:36.359]  He's leading the campaign, spearheading focus on that issue.
[00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:42.301]  Then we've got Harlan Hill, who is a Fox News and a CNN contributor, to talk about the latest with Trump.
[00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:47.683]  The latest with the Russian hacking allegations, of course, off the back of this
[00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:51.145]  Julian Assange interview with Sean Hannity.
[00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:53.967]  We've also got key clips from that interview coming up.
[00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.448]  But here is Alex Jones.
[00:08:55.448 --> 00:09:00.111]  This is a powerful rant about how the power lies with you, the individual.
[00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:02.192]  And we'll be back in the next segment with more news.
[00:09:02.192 --> 00:09:06.015]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:08.957]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:09:08.957 --> 00:09:13.560]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.642]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:23.602]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:27.847]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[00:09:27.847 --> 00:09:30.149]  We have to be good.
[00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:31.010]  We have to be pure.
[00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.172]  We have to be strong.
[00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:33.994]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:36.497]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:44.278]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:52.384]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:58.929]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[00:10:17.306 --> 00:10:21.810]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.172]  Move, bitch!
[00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:24.693]  Get out of the way!
[00:10:32.076 --> 00:10:33.237]  The American flag!
[00:10:33.237 --> 00:10:37.379]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:40.621]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.222]  I will not let you down.
[00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:44.824]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:10:44.824 --> 00:10:46.905]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:48.966]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:55.690]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.431]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:58.152]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.291]  I get pretty emotional on air and people ask me, is it an act?
[00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.332]  And the answer is no, it's 100% real.
[00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:11.772]  It's 110% real.
[00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:18.294]  But I do basically let the dog off the leash.
[00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:25.376]  I do that on purpose because I just want to be completely honest with people about where I stand and how serious these issues are.
[00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:26.796]  And you can say whatever you want about it.
[00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:33.686]  The method of the madness, it's effective, we've woken people up, we're moving forward, we're getting people's attention.
[00:11:33.686 --> 00:11:36.487]  Doesn't mean I've got to do it perfect, doesn't mean you've got to do it perfect.
[00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:46.232]  We've just got to do the right thing and warn people as best we can about the perils of globalism and then their system will never be successful.
[00:11:46.232 --> 00:11:50.795]  And they're stonewalling of just denying that they're establishing this tyranny.
[00:11:52.287 --> 00:11:54.968]  Has totally begun to collapse.
[00:11:54.968 --> 00:11:57.988]  When I say begun to collapse, it is falling apart as we speak.
[00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.409]  They admit that in their own internal annals.
[00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:09.471]  They are in complete beehive, anthill eruption of scurrying around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:12.832]  Whatever other analogy you want, their house is on fire.
[00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:13.712]  That said though,
[00:12:14.997 --> 00:12:19.605]  Their whole reorganization to come back and counterattack is happening as we speak.
[00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:24.794]  So when I get up on air and say with 15 days, with 14 days left until Trump gets in...
[00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:35.719]  When I talk about that and tell people to be totally vigilant, it's because these are the most important days in probably modern history, if not in much of history itself.
[00:12:35.719 --> 00:12:41.923]  Because of the nuclear weapons we have now, the huge human population, all the things that are developing.
[00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:45.465]  Because we do have the technology for even more people on this planet, but we don't.
[00:12:46.974 --> 00:12:56.360]  Have the land and the resources if we don't start advancing technology and distributing it to third world nations and ourselves.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:04.165]  This whole post-industrial non-growth model will cause a giant collapse that all the demographers agree on.
[00:13:04.165 --> 00:13:10.469]  If you don't produce 2.1 children for every two adults, it's going to create a collapse level event.
[00:13:10.469 --> 00:13:13.571]  No matter how many robots you put in, how much garbage you install.
[00:13:16.704 --> 00:13:26.027]  That said, when I say I felt the collapse yesterday, that's not really even the sixth sense mumbo-jumbo.
[00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:31.368]  Even though I do believe in the sixth sense, it's been proven we all have it.
[00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:36.309]  But that's more of just an added guide of your gut or your spirit.
[00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:42.271]  When I say that they're really starting to realize they've been defeated at this phase in a big way, there's a major sea change that's hit.
[00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:55.390]  It's because you see every major globalist newspaper, like the New York Times, even the Washington Post, coming out of their editorial pages and saying, this is the end of Obama.
[00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.890]  His legacy is a joke.
[00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.630]  He's a fraud.
[00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.391]  He launched all these criminal wars.
[00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:01.551]  He did all these terrible things.
[00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:04.712]  Oh my gosh, what have we done?
[00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:05.872]  It's a capitulation move.
[00:14:07.156 --> 00:14:09.137]  And it's a desperation move.
[00:14:09.137 --> 00:14:22.324]  But it really shows that they're now having to signal to Trump and to the countercoup that's been launched by the people that, okay, we are backing off.
[00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:28.588]  I don't believe that they'd be rolling over this strong if it wasn't at least real at many levels of the elite strata.
[00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:34.594]  That does not mean it's complete, and that does not mean they're not going to come back and double-cross.
[00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:40.036]  But as I said back on November 8th, they have not capitulated yet.
[00:14:40.036 --> 00:14:44.457]  And you saw all the stuff they launched, and I laid out everything they do, and they did it.
[00:14:44.457 --> 00:14:46.718]  Almost like I was giving them ideas, but I wasn't.
[00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.919]  We just are inside their minds, they're inside ours.
[00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:51.780]  That's how interfaced we are in this fight.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:58.162]  And right now, they finally understand they've had their butts whipped, and that if they push it much further,
[00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:04.258]  Massive more leaks that make the other ones look tame in comparison are going to be released and come out.
[00:15:04.258 --> 00:15:06.779]  And so we're winning the Civil War.
[00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:11.560]  We are in the fourth quarter with about three minutes to go.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.142]  And we have got several touchdowns and several field goals on the board ahead of them.
[00:15:17.546 --> 00:15:18.826]  In this game.
[00:15:18.826 --> 00:15:29.249]  Going forward, if we're not moral, if we're not strong, if we don't drain the swamp, if we don't in our own lives take action and be better people, it's the moral rot that's gotten us to this point.
[00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:32.210]  And it's the fact that we've been in a sleep, the fact that we've been in a trance.
[00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.570]  Coming out of the trance is the key.
[00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.131]  And I'm up at 5.30 in the morning right now.
[00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:40.834]  Taping this for the show with Watson and David and the crew that are there.
[00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:48.280]  I'm gonna be gone for about a week, but I will be filing reports from the road as I take some time to do some research.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:55.326]  But I gotta occasionally take a little bit of a break or I spin out of control as everybody knows.
[00:15:55.326 --> 00:15:57.347]  Bottom line, history's happening in front of everybody.
[00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.669]  I want to salute all of you.
[00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:01.791]  And again, I want to be clear.
[00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:04.093]  I'm not doing this to pat you on the head or to be patronizing.
[00:16:05.146 --> 00:16:07.788]  You are the resistance.
[00:16:07.788 --> 00:16:09.489]  You are the MVPs.
[00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:10.951]  You are changing the world.
[00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:20.998]  All you went through being made fun of, all the bullying, all the attacks, all the demonization by your friends, your family, your bosses, your employees, your neighbors, your pastors.
[00:16:20.998 --> 00:16:22.259]  Some of your pastors stood up for the truth.
[00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:23.720]  They went through bullying.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.143]  My point is, is that this is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:16:27.143 --> 00:16:28.724]  You are the trailblazers.
[00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:29.745]  You are the winners.
[00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:34.309]  You didn't just win some lottery ticket or some football game or, you know, some stupid set of steak knives.
[00:16:35.342 --> 00:16:38.983]  You didn't win the little silly brass ring.
[00:16:38.983 --> 00:16:46.504]  You won a major battle against the most wicked, organized crime syndicates this planet's ever seen.
[00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:52.366]  And you did it because you had moral, historical foundations.
[00:16:52.366 --> 00:17:00.768]  You were standing on America that was created in providence, in God's mind, and that does have a great destiny.
[00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:01.788]  The destiny of the world
[00:17:02.972 --> 00:17:04.572]  Rises and falls of this republic.
[00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:06.413]  We have been exceptional.
[00:17:06.413 --> 00:17:08.514]  Now we've been exceptionally evil.
[00:17:08.514 --> 00:17:12.775]  And it's up to us whether America's hit bottom yet and it started its way back up.
[00:17:12.775 --> 00:17:23.177]  We have that chance to lead the world out of the technotronic era that the globalists are, we're hoping was just dawning, which I believe is dead on arrival.
[00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:24.418]  It's a great time to be alive.
[00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:26.558]  Our ideology trumps everything they could ever come up with.
[00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:27.499]  It's beautiful.
[00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:27.919]  It's true.
[00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:28.479]  It's ancient.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.121]  And it's of God.
[00:17:31.121 --> 00:17:37.825]  And I don't say that as some Pharisee on a high horse, but as somebody that's as wicked as the day is long, but my heart is pointed at God.
[00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:41.327]  So these are epic times, and I just love you all.
[00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:45.529]  And that's why when you always call and say, thank you, thank you, thank you to me.
[00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:46.550]  No, thank you.
[00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.711]  You need to get this turned around.
[00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:53.114]  These arrogant talk show hosts who got to call in and kiss their butts all day and tell them how great they are.
[00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:53.534]  No, no, no, no.
[00:17:54.491 --> 00:18:06.820]  None of us are perfect, but we are in an epic fight that is amazing and that is incredible and it's all about that fight to live in a free country and a free civilization based on families, based on real values set forth.
[00:18:07.944 --> 00:18:10.106]  And again, led by Jesus Christ.
[00:18:10.106 --> 00:18:12.708]  There's a reason the enemy hates Christ.
[00:18:12.708 --> 00:18:14.389]  And it's because Christ is real.
[00:18:14.389 --> 00:18:16.211]  And Christ's spirit's real.
[00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:18.132]  And God's plan is real.
[00:18:18.132 --> 00:18:19.133]  And they can't stand it.
[00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:20.794]  So at the end of the day, remember that.
[00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:22.876]  We're fighting evil people.
[00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:25.037]  Who serve an evil fallen God.
[00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.539]  And that's why they do all this bad stuff.
[00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.441]  Because it's all an end.
[00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:32.283]  Everything they do is a place they're going.
[00:18:32.283 --> 00:18:33.184]  A place they're leading us.
[00:18:34.952 --> 00:18:37.353]  They do these bad things because they are bad.
[00:18:37.353 --> 00:18:41.075]  Because they're building something stinking and falling.
[00:18:41.075 --> 00:18:42.976]  Because it's their nature.
[00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:44.336]  Because they can't coexist with us.
[00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:46.317]  Do you understand that?
[00:18:46.317 --> 00:18:47.678]  I know you understand that.
[00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:56.782]  But the minute we really understand that we must soften our hearts towards children, and soften our hearts towards the ignorant that don't understand what's happening, and forgive them.
[00:18:56.782 --> 00:19:01.004]  But we have to at the same time, quite frankly, harden our hearts against evil.
[00:19:01.844 --> 00:19:06.846]  And be steadfast and realize that we're going to run them over and it's our destiny to defeat them.
[00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:11.449]  But we have to take that destiny and we have to take the adversity that comes with it in our hands.
[00:19:11.449 --> 00:19:17.632]  But through the process, we will be made whole and strong on the other side and be much greater than we ever were before.
[00:19:17.632 --> 00:19:21.093]  It is the animating contest, the challenge of good versus evil.
[00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:25.395]  And you who are fighting the globalists have chosen the right side of history.
[00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:28.337]  And no matter what color you are, where you come from or what your gender is,
[00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:36.516]  That makes us brothers and sisters together in eternity because we chose the right side of history.
[00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:37.697]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:38.719]  This is the InfoWar.

[00:23:03.524 --> 00:23:07.010]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:11.713]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:23:11.713 --> 00:23:17.135]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:23:17.135 --> 00:23:18.636]  How is this even possible?
[00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:26.179]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:33.822]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:37.024]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:45.108]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:23:45.108 --> 00:23:48.269]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:52.451]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com.
[00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:53.092]  That's greens75.com.
[00:23:53.092 --> 00:23:53.472]  Greens75.com.
[00:23:53.472 --> 00:23:54.492]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:24:08.872 --> 00:24:13.216]  It'll build a big guns.
[00:24:13.216 --> 00:24:15.559]  It'll build a death planes.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:34.952]  Well, the master of war, Barack Obama, whose policies completely wrecked the Middle East and led to the migrant crisis, has just over two weeks left in office, and he's still determined to continue this madcap escalation with Russia.
[00:24:34.952 --> 00:24:36.753]  We've got an article here out of the sun.
[00:24:36.753 --> 00:24:38.955]  This is up on drudgerreport.com.
[00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:46.141]  US sends special forces to Russian border as NATO is poised to strike back against Vladimir Putin's aggression.
[00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:59.047]  Even though, as you know, Vladimir Putin doesn't even reciprocate when Obama kicks 35 Russian diplomats out of the United States, Putin's response is to basically invite children to a party.
[00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:01.809]  Does absolutely nothing in return, but he's the aggressive party.
[00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:04.091]  President Obama has deployed U.S.
[00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:09.636]  Special Forces troops along Lithuania's border with, quote, aggressive Russia.
[00:25:09.636 --> 00:25:13.319]  Tensions between Washington and the Kremlin have reached Cold War levels.
[00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:17.963]  Amid reports Vladimir Putin is deploying nuke-ready missiles in the Russian province of Kaliningrad.
[00:25:18.724 --> 00:25:36.714]  Again, this escalation has been launched off the back of the mainstream media's fake news that was in the Washington Post last week with their story claiming that Russian hackers tried to get into the computers of the US electronic grid.
[00:25:36.714 --> 00:25:39.856]  This story turned out to be complete BS.
[00:25:39.856 --> 00:25:46.200]  People have since drilled into the process of how this fake news story was reported in the Washington Post.
[00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:49.406]  It was a copy and paste job.
[00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:56.149]  These Washington Post journalists, prestitutes, called the Department of Homeland Security for a comment.
[00:25:56.149 --> 00:26:03.733]  They didn't call the actual electric public utilities who had supposedly been hacked in the Russians.
[00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:05.214]  Didn't call them for a comment.
[00:26:05.854 --> 00:26:23.284]  Which came back to smack him in the face about two hours later, because these same public utilities came out literally an hour and a half after this story, this fake news story was published in the Washington Post, said there's absolutely no evidence that Russian hackers hacked this utility.
[00:26:23.284 --> 00:26:26.826]  Number one, the computer wasn't connected to the utility itself.
[00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:30.789]  Number two, the malware could be found anywhere on the internet.
[00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:34.471]  There was no evidence whatsoever that it had come from Russia.
[00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:54.109]  But again, the Washington Post, just like with their fake news list that they put out, which they then had to back away from, said they couldn't vouch for the validity of it, because it was completely made up out of thin air, that prop or not fake news list, again, with links back to the military-industrial complex, back to the neocon establishment.
[00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.013]  Again, this turned out to be completely fake.
[00:26:58.013 --> 00:27:14.029]  Basically what happened, somebody who worked in that utility, Burlington Electric, checked their email, their Yahoo email, and it connected to a suspicious IP address because of this malware that was on the laptop that had been floating around the internet anyway.
[00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.233]  Again, nothing whatsoever to do with Russia.
[00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:23.642]  They had zero evidence that it had to do with Russia, but ran with the story anyway.
[00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.885]  Think of the danger!
[00:27:25.885 --> 00:27:31.572]  They're accusing a nuclear superpower of hacking the US electric grid!
[00:27:32.486 --> 00:27:38.412]  Think of the gravity of that charge, backed by absolutely zero evidence.
[00:27:38.412 --> 00:27:49.804]  So again, the mainstream media has the temerity to say that InfoWars is dangerous because we're pushing fake news about Pizzagate or whatever, which we didn't even push.
[00:27:49.804 --> 00:27:51.847]  I mean, I never tweeted about it personally.
[00:27:52.287 --> 00:27:54.148]  Because I thought it was a dud story.
[00:27:54.148 --> 00:27:56.029]  But no, we get all the blame for everything.
[00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:59.131]  Apparently that's dangerous, that's going to cause people to die.
[00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:09.258]  Yet they're literally hyping a military confrontation with Russia by publishing fake news blaming Russia for hacking the US electronic grid.
[00:28:09.258 --> 00:28:10.339]  With no evidence!
[00:28:11.343 --> 00:28:14.125]  But they say we're dangerous for pushing fake news.
[00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:17.448]  Their fake news could start a world war.
[00:28:17.448 --> 00:28:19.349]  How dare they blame us?
[00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:26.234]  And of course today, Trump tweets that Assange's claims on Russian hacking in his interview with Sean Hannity make sense.
[00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:31.218]  Again, no evidence that they provided WikiLeaks with the DNC leaks, with the Podesta emails.
[00:28:31.218 --> 00:28:32.319]  We know who did.
[00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.800]  Seth Rich.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.742]  Assange can't come out and say it publicly because he can't name his sources.
[00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:53.577]  But again, now the outrage is aimed at Trump because he says that Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, which has a 10 year plus track record of complete deadly accuracy, is more reliable than the US intelligence community.
[00:28:53.577 --> 00:28:54.278]  Part of which
[00:28:54.898 --> 00:29:01.061]  ...is pushing this whole crap about Russia hacking the election, again with zero evidence whatsoever.
[00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:08.545]  They've now had to put the briefing back until Friday, because they're desperately trying to scrape the barrel and cobble something together.
[00:29:08.545 --> 00:29:14.168]  Nothing has been released in the public arena that even indicates any evidence of Russian hacking.
[00:29:14.168 --> 00:29:23.733]  But again, we're bad for talking about, quote, quote, fake news, when they're directly pushing fake news that could start a nuclear conflict.
[00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:34.835]  And now we have Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, calls Julian Assange a sycophant for Russia, says that Julian Assange, quote, he leaks.
[00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:36.355]  Well, yeah, Paul Ryan.
[00:29:36.355 --> 00:29:37.436]  The clue is in the name.
[00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:38.696]  WikiLeaks, right.
[00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:41.217]  Absolutely dud insult.
[00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:43.658]  Paul Ryan is now siding with this narrative.
[00:29:43.658 --> 00:29:47.019]  We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show live after the break.
[00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:48.460]  InfoWars.com, don't go away.
[00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.756]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:57.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:06.648]  The Huffington Post says Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
[00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:12.530]  And they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of Trump right now before the inauguration.
[00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.692]  In an article titled Impeaching Trump, the process begins now.
[00:30:16.692 --> 00:30:25.677]  Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says President-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even Richard Nixon.
[00:30:26.697 --> 00:30:31.979]  And he expects Trump will immediately break the law and violate the Constitution.
[00:30:31.979 --> 00:30:40.921]  Therefore, the Huffington Post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin the first day Trump steps into office.
[00:30:40.921 --> 00:30:51.504]  The idea is to keep daily records of Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance with Vladimir Putin.
[00:30:51.504 --> 00:30:55.845]  More desperation from the lunatics on the far right.
[00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:03.068]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:03.068 --> 00:31:05.089]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:07.991]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:14.054]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:23.258]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:25.459]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:30.783]  Your co-workers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.783 --> 00:31:38.810]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.751]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.924]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:48.486]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.486 --> 00:31:55.209]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.209 --> 00:31:59.311]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:32:35.932 --> 00:32:40.675]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[00:33:23.675 --> 00:33:26.359]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:31.486]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:47.086]  I have consistently stated that past performance is indicative of future behavior.
[00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:49.068]  And I'm not the first person that said that.
[00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:51.089]  It's been well known for thousands of years.
[00:33:51.089 --> 00:33:52.990]  I'm just stating common sense here.
[00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:58.052]  So it wasn't hard to predict that the Democrats would try to steal the nomination from Trump.
[00:33:58.052 --> 00:34:01.414]  The Republican Party that tried to steal the nomination tried to block it.
[00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:03.876]  The same Democratic Party that successfully stole it from Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:04.949 --> 00:34:06.630]  Who rolled over to it?
[00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.933]  The same groups that tried to steal the election on election night.
[00:34:09.933 --> 00:34:11.935]  The same groups that tried to have the recounts.
[00:34:11.935 --> 00:34:15.338]  The same groups that tried to overturn the electors.
[00:34:15.338 --> 00:34:23.705]  The same group now saying that Trump's some type of Russian agent with all this made up crap and that, you know, the Russians are trying to bring down our power grid.
[00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:24.586]  They're not going to give up.
[00:34:24.586 --> 00:34:26.568]  And I've said that consistently.
[00:34:26.568 --> 00:34:29.130]  We're now 15 days out.
[00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.112]  But yesterday when I said I could feel them collapsing,
[00:34:33.414 --> 00:34:36.997]  Well, that's kind of like what's been described at the end of World War I and World War II.
[00:34:36.997 --> 00:34:40.320]  You just feel like this weight come off.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.444]  As the will of who you were fighting, millions of other people on the other side finally gave up.
[00:34:45.444 --> 00:34:52.831]  But really, cutting past the six cent stuff, what I'm really getting at is you can see more and more big news publications.
[00:34:54.130 --> 00:35:04.660]  Coming out and saying, OK, Obama has a horrible legacy, OK, Obama's horrible, OK, Hillary was a horrible candidate, OK, she's super corrupt, OK, you know, Trump isn't Hitler.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:13.269]  And that's being done because the mainstream media is so command and control that Trump knows that they're not giving up on their deceptive agenda.
[00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:18.597]  Unless they basically roll over and start writing these articles.
[00:35:18.597 --> 00:35:20.420]  Now, on the surface, that sounds kind of dangerous.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:27.091]  Like, wow, that they have to roll over to Trump and start having news articles, you know, basically being neutral or fair.
[00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:29.094]  Well, that's because the media was already command and control.
[00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:39.155]  As WikiLeaks showed, it was commanded right down to the paragraphs, right down to the headlines, right down to what was being said and done when it came to political news.
[00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:41.036]  I've always said, okay, a plane crashes.
[00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:42.638]  It's usually just real news reporting on it.
[00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:43.958]  Or, okay, there's a flood.
[00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:46.000]  Or, okay, this football team wins.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.241]  That's usually just real news.
[00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:50.703]  But it's the big political events that you've got to watch.
[00:35:50.703 --> 00:35:51.684]  That's where the deception
[00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:55.271]  The dissembling and manipulation is.
[00:35:55.271 --> 00:36:03.036]  But there's just a lot of indicators that the fact that there's more leaks going to come out, more whistleblowers about to come out.
[00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:14.944]  Oh, and a big thing I forgot to talk about yesterday, the fact that the whistleblowers that released the latest information in the last year to WikiLeaks are prepared to have a press conference.
[00:36:14.944 --> 00:36:17.245]  And I was told about this six months ago.
[00:36:18.348 --> 00:36:29.654]  And then it began to build, and then of course the British Ambassador, former British Ambassador who is admittedly an operative of WikiLeaks, has come out repeatedly and said, I've met in America with the head leaker.
[00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:32.456]  It's an American from intelligence agencies.
[00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:34.197]  Well, we also know
[00:36:35.168 --> 00:36:38.831]  Mr. Benny and others, and he told us that back at the same time.
[00:36:38.831 --> 00:36:40.933]  So we have top people telling us this.
[00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:51.462]  Then I have folks off record confirming it and telling me the type of stuff that's in there, which I did get out on air because I've released all info I have.
[00:36:51.462 --> 00:36:57.027]  The big thing I forgot to cover yesterday is I just get so excited about all this and I really should just write notes.
[00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:58.227]  Thank you.
[00:37:17.136 --> 00:37:22.519]  They came out and said, oh, we've delayed the briefing that Trump was going to get.
[00:37:22.519 --> 00:37:24.980]  Then they come out and say, oh, no, we didn't delay the briefing.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.401]  He's just saying that.
[00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:32.484]  But if you go look at what was actually done, they have delayed it on the evidence of the Russian hacking that they won't even give Congress.
[00:37:33.444 --> 00:37:34.865]  Because it's a metaphorical hacking.
[00:37:34.865 --> 00:37:38.228]  They mean just politically through RT and stuff of influence the election.
[00:37:38.228 --> 00:37:40.030]  Well, I guess you could say that's true.
[00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:46.875]  But the Chinese and the EU and MSN and all the foreign money is, you know, a hundred times what Russia might have done that way.
[00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:49.217]  If you call that any type of influence hacking.
[00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:54.822]  I mean, George Soros has been trying to overthrow Russia internally for a decade and admits it.
[00:37:54.822 --> 00:38:01.347]  Not just the surrounding countries like... like we've seen the last few years with the Ukraine situation.
[00:38:01.347 --> 00:38:01.468]  So...
[00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:08.854]  When I say they're starting to really falter and fall apart, that's because I really mean it.
[00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:09.854]  I think there's a lot of danger.
[00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.435]  They're going to still pull something.
[00:38:11.435 --> 00:38:12.756]  They've got a lot of rogue elements.
[00:38:12.756 --> 00:38:16.037]  It's not just one monolithic group, but more like a swarm of criminals.
[00:38:17.051 --> 00:38:17.231]  Yes.
[00:38:38.366 --> 00:38:48.673]  It's the Liberty Movement, it's 1776 worldwide, it's nationalism, it's sovereignty, it's free market capitalism that is driven by the will of the people and by innovation.
[00:38:48.673 --> 00:38:52.715]  I mean, America is infiltrating Russia more than Russia is infiltrating us.
[00:38:52.715 --> 00:38:54.056]  Everybody knows that.
[00:38:54.056 --> 00:39:02.782]  Despite all the stuff that globalists have done to Russia in our name, they love our blue jeans, they love our culture, they love, you know, James Dean and the whole nine yards.
[00:39:03.703 --> 00:39:04.483]  Everybody knows that.
[00:39:04.483 --> 00:39:05.144]  So does the French.
[00:39:05.144 --> 00:39:06.464]  So does everybody.
[00:39:06.464 --> 00:39:10.745]  So America still has a lot of soft power with people around the world.
[00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:18.648]  We can get back to people admiring us and liking us and thinking of us as the good guys and stop letting a bunch of blue-blood East Coast globalists.
[00:39:18.648 --> 00:39:20.109]  I'm not bashing you on the East Coast.
[00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:22.450]  I mean the Harvard people.
[00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.510]  The white shoe boys that Joe Salente talks about.
[00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.891]  I think they're better than everybody.
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:34.535]  We gotta just say, no, you're not better than everybody, you don't control reality, you're not history's actors, and you're crazy, and you've wrecked the ship, and you're not in control anymore.
[00:39:34.535 --> 00:39:35.055]  Do you understand?
[00:39:35.055 --> 00:39:36.276]  You're not our gods.
[00:39:36.276 --> 00:39:37.396]  You're not our owners.
[00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:40.498]  I don't care that you have big, you know, Coke bottle glasses and a chicken neck.
[00:39:40.498 --> 00:39:41.859]  Get out of the way.
[00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:42.619]  Move!
[00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:43.900]  Get out of the way!
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.701]  Get out of the way!
[00:39:44.701 --> 00:39:46.261]  You see them headlights?
[00:39:46.261 --> 00:39:46.422]  Huh.
[00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:48.486]  I mean, we are behind you.
[00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:49.487]  We want you out of the way.
[00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:52.968]  We do not want you ruling our life and being our gatekeepers anymore.
[00:39:52.968 --> 00:39:54.088]  Get off our backs, okay?
[00:39:54.088 --> 00:39:55.089]  We see you.
[00:39:55.089 --> 00:39:56.649]  You're sewing intellectual garbage.
[00:39:56.649 --> 00:39:58.650]  We're done.
[00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.731]  That said, we have to be very vigilant.
[00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:06.273]  We are way from being out of the woods, but I am seeing a lot of signs that the enemy is being demoralized.
[00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:08.254]  They're giving up right now, at least for now.
[00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:11.292]  That doesn't mean they won't try to assassinate Trump.
[00:40:11.292 --> 00:40:15.235]  It doesn't mean they won't try to crash a helicopter full of C4 to the inauguration.
[00:40:15.235 --> 00:40:17.856]  It doesn't mean they won't try to crash the economy and then blame it on Trump.
[00:40:17.856 --> 00:40:18.597]  They're already doing that.
[00:40:18.597 --> 00:40:22.459]  I don't even think I got to that clip yesterday.
[00:40:22.459 --> 00:40:30.764]  I think I played it once where, you know, they've got the editor of the Washington Post saying me and Trump are going to crash the world economy.
[00:40:30.764 --> 00:40:33.025]  That's what Soros does all over the world.
[00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:36.387]  Again, they're always projecting everything they do onto us.
[00:40:36.387 --> 00:40:38.589]  And quite frankly, I am super honored by this.
[00:40:39.531 --> 00:40:41.853]  All right, folks, back to the main transmission.
[00:40:41.853 --> 00:40:43.695]  I'll be popping in throughout the week.
[00:40:43.695 --> 00:40:45.077]  I just want to say great job to the crew.
[00:40:45.077 --> 00:40:46.478]  Great job to all you, the listeners.
[00:40:46.478 --> 00:40:47.839]  I mean, you really are the tip of the spear.
[00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.801]  And I just want to thank you.
[00:40:49.801 --> 00:40:50.882]  We have come so far together.
[00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:54.466]  Who would have thought 20 years ago, almost nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:40:54.466 --> 00:40:56.808]  Almost nobody knew what the new order was.
[00:40:56.808 --> 00:40:57.729]  I thought we were making it up.
[00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:00.052]  Just look where we are now.
[00:41:00.052 --> 00:41:10.402]  I mean, all over the world, our brand of nationalism and of Americana and of understanding that it's the globalist crime syndicate is taking over because it's reality.
[00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:14.946]  Reality is trumping the fraud, the mass wave of garbage.
[00:41:14.946 --> 00:41:16.008]  And I salute you all.
[00:41:16.008 --> 00:41:16.688]  I love you all.
[00:41:16.688 --> 00:41:17.829]  I appreciate you all.
[00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:19.171]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:41:19.171 --> 00:41:21.153]  Now back to the main transmission.
[00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:26.942]  There goes Alex Jones and he'll be back with more special reports later in the show.
[00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:31.344]  We're going to get to Julian Assange's appearance on Fox News last night.
[00:41:31.344 --> 00:41:41.908]  By the way, which coincided with the birthday of Seth Rich, the murdered DNC staffer who many consider to be the source of WikiLeaks.
[00:41:41.908 --> 00:41:44.269]  So we're going to get to those clips here in a minute.
[00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:50.751]  First, I want to tell you about the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:41:51.531 --> 00:42:07.881]  Again, the only reason we've been able to grow, to challenge the mainstream media, the only reason they have to come out with this whole fake news narrative, is the fact that we've been so successful in reaching so many millions more people, and we couldn't do it without your support.
[00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:15.646]  Which is why we're not ashamed of these products, because they've all got five-star independent reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:42:15.646 --> 00:42:18.648]  And this is the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[00:42:19.528 --> 00:42:27.910]  Again, you have to feel good to have an impact when it comes to reaching out, reaching new people, not just preaching to the choir.
[00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:36.273]  So you have to feel good to do that, and many people have given, again, their independent reviews saying that these products help them feel a lot better.
[00:42:36.273 --> 00:42:41.354]  We're talking about Brain Force, 30% off still at Infowarslife.com.
[00:42:41.354 --> 00:42:42.915]  Supermail Vitality, 30% off.

[00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:55.801]  It's time to take back your health and make your body great again in 2017.
[00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:59.303]  Visit infowarslife.com to see all the great specials again.
[00:42:59.303 --> 00:43:06.827]  This is about helping you take back your temple and fight back against the energy drain that is this.
[00:43:07.327 --> 00:43:15.694]  Vulgar culture that we're subjected to, this establishment system that tells you constantly you're worthless, you can't have any effect whatsoever.
[00:43:15.694 --> 00:43:16.635]  Well, you can.
[00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:17.675]  We've proven it.
[00:43:17.675 --> 00:43:27.423]  We've grown from a tiny operation to a huge, sprawling network that is really terrifying the mainstream media, which is why they attack us on a routine basis.
[00:43:27.423 --> 00:43:29.105]  Their audiences are dropping off.
[00:43:29.105 --> 00:43:31.346]  Their trust levels are through the floor.
[00:43:31.346 --> 00:43:34.809]  Again, we're rising, but we can only continue to do so with your support.
[00:43:34.809 --> 00:43:36.691]  That's not just a cliche to say that.
[00:43:37.588 --> 00:43:44.395]  When you get more and more employees, when you get more and more equipment, when you have to pay for more and more bandwidth, it all adds up.
[00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:48.860]  So we really need your support, especially at this time of year.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.583]  Again, after Christmas, by getting the products at infowarslife.com.
[00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:58.630]  We don't take advertising from giant pharmaceutical industry companies that sell Prozac.
[00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.592]  We don't take advertising revenue from
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:08.143]  Middle Eastern dictatorships, like CNN, to produce puff pieces about how great their horrible countries are.
[00:44:08.143 --> 00:44:12.264]  We don't take $30 million from George Soros, like Black Lives Matter.
[00:44:12.264 --> 00:44:13.525]  We don't take any of that.
[00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:19.948]  We rely on your support, which allows us to remain independent, and that is absolutely crucial.
[00:44:19.948 --> 00:44:24.650]  Again, all those great discounts are part of the Make Your Body Great Again initiative.
[00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.733]  Infowarslife.com for all those great products.
[00:44:28.733 --> 00:44:30.794]  Now let's go back to the news, of course.
[00:44:30.794 --> 00:44:36.078]  Julian Assange made an appearance on Sean Hannity last night, much anticipated.
[00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:45.345]  We're going to delve into some of these clips and then talk about it afterwards, given the new hysteria about Russia that we're seeing once again in the media today.
[00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:49.848]  The first clip is Assange elaborates on sources and Russian hacking.
[00:44:49.848 --> 00:44:50.368]  Here it is.
[00:44:51.249 --> 00:45:00.752]  I know you want to protect your sources, and you, when you first told me on my radio show that it was not Russia, you said so reluctantly.
[00:45:00.752 --> 00:45:07.995]  Can I ask, take it one step further, can you say that the source was within the United States?
[00:45:07.995 --> 00:45:17.818]  I don't want to constrain whether it was someone inside the United States, in the DNC,
[00:45:20.086 --> 00:45:25.212]  In the service providers that provide the DNC are outside etc.
[00:45:25.212 --> 00:45:35.103]  I think we have already pushed it quite a lot more than you would like more than we would like by saying it's not a state party that that was necessary to do because
[00:45:37.913 --> 00:45:45.880]  There was a serious attempt to distract from the content of our publications with this Russian narrative.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.843]  Now our sources are interested in two things.
[00:45:48.843 --> 00:45:57.111]  They're interested in protecting their identity, but also not going through all that effort and risk to themselves
[00:45:59.513 --> 00:46:01.215]  Only to have the publication undermined.
[00:46:01.215 --> 00:46:20.895]  Then what do you make of the President of the United States that Donald Trump may in the next 24 to 48 hours contradict with whatever information he's teasing that he does have, but he made a decision to expel 35 Russian diplomats in two sites, impose 12 sanctions against the Russian government, and
[00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:29.862]  You know, the Russian President Putin responded by inviting children to a Christmas party and said he will wait to deal with the new president.
[00:46:29.862 --> 00:46:35.947]  Why would the president... You're saying that Russia did not give you this information.
[00:46:35.947 --> 00:46:39.690]  He is very closely suggesting that, in fact, they did.
[00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:41.858]  And he's wrong.
[00:46:41.858 --> 00:46:45.001]  So my question is, does he know he's wrong from your perspective?
[00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:45.862]  He has to know.
[00:46:45.862 --> 00:46:47.204]  He's playing games.
[00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:48.005]  He's playing games.
[00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:48.765]  He's playing games.
[00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:50.107]  He's dishonest.
[00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.188]  Is it fair?
[00:46:51.188 --> 00:46:52.409]  Is he lying to the American people?
[00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.952]  He's acting like a lawyer instead of being honest.
[00:46:54.952 --> 00:47:02.319]  So he's playing games by trying to suggest that Russia, quote, hacked the election, unquote.
[00:47:04.361 --> 00:47:25.291]  Pretending that what's going on here is Russia hacking voting machines, for which there is no evidence, then saying without, suggesting without saying that our information was part of a plot to get Donald Trump elected.
[00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:29.173]  Once again, from our side, which we understand there's no evidence, but even
[00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:37.400]  James Clapper and so on coming out and saying we don't know how WikiLeaks, we don't know when or how WikiLeaks got this information.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:47.931]  So it's a construction to try and erect the topic that Donald Trump is illegitimately elected.
[00:47:49.597 --> 00:47:51.298]  So what is the reaction to this?
[00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:56.720]  The frothing hysteria from the fake news media that we see today, and even people like Paul Ryan.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.501]  This is out of the Washington Times.
[00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:01.882]  Paul Ryan calls Julian Assange a sycophant for Russia.
[00:48:01.882 --> 00:48:04.383]  Again, this is a narrative that we've heard over and over again.
[00:48:04.383 --> 00:48:11.546]  Because Assange had a show on Russia Today four years ago, eight episodes, that means he's working for the Kremlin.
[00:48:11.546 --> 00:48:13.187]  Okay, how many times have I been on RT?
[00:48:13.587 --> 00:48:16.328]  How many times has Alex Jones been on RT?
[00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:18.729]  How many times have they asked us to be on RT?
[00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:19.770]  Dozens and dozens.
[00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.831]  Does that mean we're taking paychecks from the Kremlin?
[00:48:22.831 --> 00:48:23.692]  No.
[00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:26.153]  It was a forum, it was a platform that he used, OK?
[00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:31.676]  The fact that Assange appeared on RT is not proof that Russia hacked the presidential election.
[00:48:31.676 --> 00:48:34.757]  You're going to have to do a bit better than that.
[00:48:34.757 --> 00:48:36.518]  This is his quote.
[00:48:36.518 --> 00:48:38.579]  This is Paul Ryan talking about Julian Assange.
[00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:42.082]  I think the guy's a sycophant for Russia.
[00:48:42.082 --> 00:48:43.022]  He leaks.
[00:48:43.022 --> 00:48:45.983]  He steals data and compromises national security.
[00:48:45.983 --> 00:48:51.025]  Okay, so Paul Ryan is calling the head of an organization called Wikileaks.
[00:48:51.025 --> 00:48:55.446]  His main charge is that he, quote, leaks.
[00:48:55.446 --> 00:48:58.327]  Right, okay, bombshell insult there from Paul Ryan.
[00:48:58.327 --> 00:49:01.088]  The clue is kind of in the name, you know, Wikileaks.
[00:49:01.088 --> 00:49:03.409]  So again, no evidence whatsoever.
[00:49:03.409 --> 00:49:08.811]  Absolutely, literally zero evidence that Julian Assange is working for Russia.
[00:49:10.168 --> 00:49:13.409]  Yeah, Paul Ryan comes out with this quote.
[00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:14.930]  Again, this is out of USA Today.
[00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:19.092]  Trump cites Assange's claim about US hacking, about Russia hacking.
[00:49:19.092 --> 00:49:28.716]  They quote Senator Charles Schumer, Democratic New York, so even for a practical supposed hard-nosed businessman, he's really being dumb to do this.
[00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:38.921]  They then quote Senator Tom Cotton, Republican from Arkansas, who said, quote, I have a lot more faith in our intelligence officers than in people like Julian Assange.
[00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:39.401]  So again,
[00:49:40.506 --> 00:49:53.514]  You have WikiLeaks, a 10-year track record of accuracy versus the US intelligence community, which has a multi-decade track record of deception and lies.
[00:49:53.514 --> 00:49:56.976]  That's not a surprise, given that's their whole raison d'etre, right?
[00:49:56.976 --> 00:50:03.841]  You know, a track record of saying that arming the moderate rebels in Syria is the best, most logical way to topple Assad.
[00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:06.371]  Oh no, it's not going to lead to the rise of jihadist groups.
[00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:08.393]  It's not going to lead to the rise of ISIS.
[00:50:08.393 --> 00:50:12.838]  Oh wait, we found out that that's exactly what they intended it to be.
[00:50:12.838 --> 00:50:14.780]  That was the whole agenda back in the first place.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.785]  That's why they were selling arms out of Benghazi to build up these rebel groups.
[00:50:19.785 --> 00:50:23.688]  Oh, but the intel said we could arm the moderate rebels and all would be hunky-dory.
[00:50:24.505 --> 00:50:30.988]  Again, their track record is deception, is lies, is chaos, is bloodshed.
[00:50:30.988 --> 00:50:42.013]  Julian Assange, his track record, and he's pleased people on the right with Trump, he's pleased people on the left with his organization's releases about the Iraq War.
[00:50:42.013 --> 00:50:43.994]  So he doesn't have a dog in this game.
[00:50:45.339 --> 00:50:56.338]  And their credibility has an absolutely perfect track record, yet still we see this complete hysterical freakout about Russia backed by zero evidence.
[00:50:56.338 --> 00:50:58.682]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live, don't go away.
[00:51:01.536 --> 00:51:03.477]  Are you looking to become more self-sufficient?
[00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:05.738]  Then you need to have your own energy source.

[00:51:31.528 --> 00:51:33.950]  Had it been the sweet Paris air permeating the night?
[00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.632]  The intoxicating way her beauty had overtaken him?
[00:51:36.632 --> 00:51:42.576]  Whatever the case back then, Jordan Dunleavy is still in love with the memory of Lauren, the woman he'd lost so many years before.
[00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:46.078]  In Bookstore on the Seine, the journey of a conspiracy analyst, author C.L.
[00:51:46.078 --> 00:51:53.444]  Hendman, ties conspiracy theories, mystery, irony, and romance into this stimulating novel that masterfully interweaves the past with the present.
[00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:57.046]  Available on Amazon and Kindle and at BookstoreOnTheSeine.com.
[00:51:57.046 --> 00:51:59.348]  That's S-E-I-N-E dot com.
[00:51:59.348 --> 00:52:00.709]  BookstoreOnTheSeine dot com.
[00:52:01.598 --> 00:52:04.325]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[00:52:04.325 --> 00:52:07.814]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:52:09.031 --> 00:52:12.513]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:52:12.513 --> 00:52:17.956]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:52:17.956 --> 00:52:19.436]  How is this even possible?
[00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:26.980]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:34.624]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:52:34.624 --> 00:52:37.826]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:52:38.106 --> 00:52:45.934]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:52:45.934 --> 00:52:49.097]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[00:52:49.097 --> 00:52:53.262]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.

[00:54:14.804 --> 00:54:20.371]  So, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says that Julian Assange is a sycophant for Russia.
[00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:28.501]  Again, that claim is backed up by the same amount of evidence backing up the claim that Russia hacked the US election, i.e.
[00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:28.941]  zero.
[00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:47.437]  The pile-on against Trump, the pile-on against Assange continues by the establishment, by the mainstream media, despite them trashing their credibility once again last week with this Washington Post report that said Russia had penetrated the US electronic grid.
[00:54:47.437 --> 00:54:52.141]  They didn't even contact the utility companies to get a statement.
[00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:58.446]  Those same utility companies came out an hour and a half later, said the Washington Post story was complete BS.
[00:54:59.628 --> 00:55:06.232]  All the Washington Post had done is basically reprinted a press release by the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:55:06.232 --> 00:55:10.734]  The laptop was not connected to the utility company and the grid.
[00:55:10.734 --> 00:55:14.377]  It had malware on it that was on the internet anyway.
[00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:28.345]  No evidence that it came from Russia, yet Donald Trump's bad for believing the claims of Julian Assange over the claims of the US Intel community that comes up again and again with this baseless nonsense.
[00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:30.510]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.995]  This is Assange talking about threats to his family.
[00:55:33.995 --> 00:55:35.957]  Very interesting clip.
[00:55:35.957 --> 00:55:38.901]  Here's Assange with Sean Hannity from last night's interview.
[00:55:39.955 --> 00:55:44.358]  I have been detained illegally, without charge, for six years.
[00:55:44.358 --> 00:55:52.583]  In prison, under house arrest, four and a half years in this embassy, without sunlight, lots of spies everywhere, etc.
[00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:54.485]  It's tough.
[00:55:54.485 --> 00:55:58.648]  It's tough, but that's the mission that I set myself on.
[00:55:58.648 --> 00:56:01.870]  So I'm willing to accept that.
[00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:08.474]  I understand the kind of game that's being played with, you know, big powerful actors, they try and take revenge, okay?
[00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:11.818]  It's a different thing for my family.
[00:56:11.818 --> 00:56:16.484]  I have young children under 10 years old.
[00:56:16.484 --> 00:56:18.367]  They didn't sign up for that.
[00:56:18.367 --> 00:56:19.889]  Okay?
[00:56:19.889 --> 00:56:21.231]  I'm the type of father that they have.
[00:56:22.242 --> 00:56:24.743]  But they didn't sign up for that.
[00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:26.524]  That's not something I like.
[00:56:26.524 --> 00:56:35.669]  And I think that is fundamentally unjust outcome for my children.
[00:56:35.669 --> 00:56:38.010]  It's not a good precedent for other people to have as well.
[00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.872]  But that would be my one concern.
[00:56:41.872 --> 00:56:42.653]  I know what I'm doing.
[00:56:43.713 --> 00:56:51.965]  I'm prepared to wear the consequences of the conflict in dealing with powerful groups and individuals.
[00:56:51.965 --> 00:56:58.554]  But my family is innocent in that equation.
[00:56:58.554 --> 00:56:59.895]  They didn't sign up for that fight.
[00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:07.711]  So, again, why is Assange now talking about concerns about powerful actors potentially threatening his family?
[00:57:07.711 --> 00:57:10.872]  That's basically what he's intimating there without saying it outright.
[00:57:10.872 --> 00:57:16.175]  Well, there's a person called Seth Rich who was murdered back in July.
[00:57:16.175 --> 00:57:18.156]  Again, a DNC staffer.
[00:57:18.156 --> 00:57:23.319]  He was almost certainly the source of the WikiLeaks for the Podesta emails and the DNC leaks.
[00:57:24.159 --> 00:57:25.341]  A robbery.
[00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:27.063]  Nothing was taken.
[00:57:27.063 --> 00:57:27.844]  Unsolved.
[00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.986]  Remains unsolved to this day.
[00:57:29.986 --> 00:57:36.314]  And who did... Who got appointed to be the spokesman for the family immediately after his murder?
[00:57:36.314 --> 00:57:39.718]  Well, it was somebody with deep connections to the DNC.
[00:57:39.718 --> 00:57:41.039]  What was the first thing they said?
[00:57:42.165 --> 00:57:45.129]  This has no connection to the DNC leaks.
[00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:47.872]  Again, they got out of that story ahead of time.
[00:57:47.872 --> 00:57:54.260]  That is why Assange is communicating the fact he's concerned about threats towards his family.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:58:00.747]  Remember, WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for information leading to the capture of Seth Rich's killer.
[00:58:01.428 --> 00:58:04.111]  Several other people offered large cash sums as well.
[00:58:04.111 --> 00:58:13.563]  In fact, I think he's up to about almost $200,000 on the table for information leading to Seth, the capture of Seth Rich's killer.
[00:58:13.563 --> 00:58:19.249]  So that's why Assange is going on record saying that he's now concerned for his safety.
[00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:32.073]  Because again, in this interview, he intimated that not Russia, not a state actor, but Seth Rich and other people connected to him within the DNC structure were responsible for the leaks.
[00:58:32.073 --> 00:58:37.215]  Now he feels threatened that he could be, again, under attack from the same forces.
[00:58:37.215 --> 00:58:39.936]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:41.876]  Don't go away.

[01:00:14.824 --> 01:00:15.946]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.748]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:19.671]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:21.354]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:21.354 --> 01:00:23.017]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.017 --> 01:00:27.684]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.318 --> 01:00:40.303]  Julian Assange speaking about powerful forces that have threatened his family during an interview with Sean Hannity yesterday.
[01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.104]  This is what RT is reporting today.
[01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:48.268]  WikiLeaks offers $20,000 reward to prevent Obama government destroying US history.
[01:00:48.928 --> 01:00:56.053]  WikiLeaks is offering a $20,000 reward for information relating to any destruction of records by a member of the Obama administration.
[01:00:56.053 --> 01:01:02.977]  However, it has not made any specific allegations that the administration inappropriately eradicated material.
[01:01:02.977 --> 01:01:12.304]  So again, they're asking for information leading to the arrest or exposure of any Obama admin agent destroying significant records.
[01:01:12.904 --> 01:01:35.026]  WikiLeaks is not done with revelations as it pertains to the Obama administration, if this story is anything to go by, and it's unsurprising that he's making enemies, again, while the mainstream media remains transfixed with the biggest conspiracy theory in years, that Russia hacked the US presidential election, for which there's no evidence.
[01:01:35.566 --> 01:01:50.154]  Remember they had the poll, it was a couple of weeks ago now, they asked Hillary Clinton supporters if they believe these claims, not only that Russia influenced the US presidential election, but that Russia directly hacked the voting machines.
[01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:51.654]  50% of respondents
[01:01:54.036 --> 01:01:59.279]  50% of Hillary Clinton supporters thought that Russia had actually hacked the voting machines.
[01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:01.640]  That's how fundamentally misled they were.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.241]  Let's go to the third Assange clip.
[01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:05.942]  This is Assange talking about media collusion.
[01:02:05.942 --> 01:02:06.483]  Here's the clip.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.341]  That was bogus.
[01:02:08.341 --> 01:02:12.383]  But there's another side of this which is, I think, pretty fascinating.
[01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:28.153]  That is that Hillary Rodham Clinton had a private server at a mom-and-pop shop in a bathroom closet that I would argue, and other lawyers would make arguments, that it was illegal for her to have.
[01:02:28.153 --> 01:02:35.658]  From what we understand, the emails were hacked through a phishing scheme where it said, click on this, give us your information, and he did so.
[01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:43.964]  Well, there's a number of hacks to the DNC and Podesta based on the publicly available information.
[01:02:43.964 --> 01:02:47.467]  This is not something coming from our sources.
[01:02:47.467 --> 01:03:02.520]  We published, as part of our policy of full disclosure, not interfering with the material, we published several Podesta emails which shows Podesta responding to a phishing email.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.901]  Now, how did they respond?
[01:03:05.222 --> 01:03:11.949]  Podesta gave out that his password was the word password.
[01:03:11.949 --> 01:03:19.576]  His own staff said, this email that you've received, this is totally legitimate.
[01:03:19.576 --> 01:03:25.161]  So this is something a 14 year old kid, a 14 year old kid could have hacked.
[01:03:28.052 --> 01:03:39.619]  So again, the media has this whole narrative about these sophisticated, dark, Russian actors packing with expert knowledge the US presidential election.
[01:03:39.619 --> 01:03:42.000]  It was literally John Podesta.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:53.627]  They sent him a fake email pretending to be a company email service provider that he's affiliated with, telling him that he needed to change his password, asking him for his password.
[01:03:53.627 --> 01:03:56.469]  His password was the word password.
[01:03:57.449 --> 01:04:05.653]  These are the people who are about to be in charge of the US government and his password for his email account is password.
[01:04:05.653 --> 01:04:14.718]  Not only that, he then asked other members of the Clinton campaign if this was a legitimate email, if he should respond to this or if it's posed a threat.
[01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:17.760]  And they all said, no, this is perfectly legitimate.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.280]  You can respond to this.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.141]  That's how they got his password.
[01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:23.102]  It wasn't Russian hackers.
[01:04:23.102 --> 01:04:24.103]  It could have been anyone.
[01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:26.344]  There was no need to hack!
[01:04:26.344 --> 01:04:29.586]  He gave them his password, which was password.
[01:04:29.586 --> 01:04:39.650]  Again, that is a detail rarely brought up by the media while they hysterically obsess about fake news stories about Russian hackers hacking the electronic grid.
[01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:40.651]  They just aren't true.
[01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:41.571]  Complete nonsense.
[01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:52.337]  And again, this whole Russian hacking narrative has taken the focus away from the fact that the information in the Podesta emails in the DNC leaks was accurate information.
[01:04:53.637 --> 01:04:56.599]  Relevant to the American voter right before the election.
[01:04:56.599 --> 01:04:57.699]  That's what they don't tell you.
[01:04:57.699 --> 01:04:59.460]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.601]  Stay tuned.
[01:05:01.601 --> 01:05:07.984]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge by targeting his family.
[01:05:07.984 --> 01:05:13.247]  During his interview with Sean Hannity, Assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played.
[01:05:13.247 --> 01:05:22.792]  But his family, including his young children under 10 years old, didn't sign up for that mission, suggesting powerful actors would take revenge by targeting his family.
[01:05:23.112 --> 01:05:30.896]  Assange once again reiterated that WikiLeaks' source for the DNC and John Podesta documents was not Russia or any state actor.
[01:05:30.896 --> 01:05:40.881]  Although he refused to name sources, Assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source for the DNC leaks.
[01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:45.645]  Rich was mysteriously murdered on July 10th in a case that remains unsolved.
[01:05:45.645 --> 01:05:51.431]  WikiLeaks subsequently offered $20,000 for information leading to the capture of his killer.
[01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:58.178]  Could Assange's concerns over what happened to Seth Rich be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family on the record?
[01:05:58.178 --> 01:06:00.140]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com

[01:08:14.949 --> 01:08:20.457]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.443]  We'll be live in the second hour of this January 4th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:31.443 --> 01:08:37.806]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones, who will be back later on in the show with some more rants.
[01:08:37.806 --> 01:08:39.687]  But for the moment, we're going to go to our guest.
[01:08:39.687 --> 01:08:42.609]  He is Jason Kessler, journalist and author.
[01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:44.970]  The website is jasonkessler.net.
[01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:48.352]  And he's been in the news recently, probably didn't see this.
[01:08:48.352 --> 01:08:55.276]  This didn't make many national headlines, but it was a big story locally for reasons that we're going to dive into right now.
[01:08:55.276 --> 01:08:56.477]  Jason, welcome to the show.
[01:09:00.629 --> 01:09:02.732]  Yeah, I don't have Jason's audio there.
[01:09:02.732 --> 01:09:04.855]  If you can fix that.
[01:09:04.855 --> 01:09:05.676]  All right.
[01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:07.419]  All right, let's get straight to it then, Jason.
[01:09:07.419 --> 01:09:08.881]  Break it down for us.
[01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:10.463]  Who is Wes Bellamy?
[01:09:10.463 --> 01:09:11.485]  What did he say?
[01:09:11.485 --> 01:09:13.347]  You know, take it from the beginning.
[01:09:13.347 --> 01:09:16.351]  And how did it lead you to spearheading this movement against him?
[01:09:17.307 --> 01:09:22.032]  Okay, so basically, I usually don't pay very much attention to local politics.
[01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.715]  I like national politics and big issues.
[01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:32.804]  But there's this vice mayor of Charlottesville, where I live, who is just totally obnoxious, Black Lives Matter racist.
[01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:35.546]  Everything he does is race, race, race.
[01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:42.009]  He never is working on fixing roads or water purity, anything like that.
[01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:53.035]  What he does is he's trying to spend $700,000 to move this Robert E. Lee Confederate statue from the park downtown.
[01:09:53.035 --> 01:10:02.440]  He has also been in the news for boycotting a UVA lecturer named Doug Muir, who put a Facebook post where he said Black Lives Matter is racist.
[01:10:03.345 --> 01:10:07.669]  And this guy went crazy and he boycotted the guy's restaurant and so forth.
[01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:13.855]  So I thought, well, let me look into Wes Bellamy's social media and see what he has to say.
[01:10:13.855 --> 01:10:16.678]  And I went on to his Twitter and I searched some keywords.
[01:10:16.678 --> 01:10:17.538]  I searched white.
[01:10:17.538 --> 01:10:18.980]  I searched black.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:24.265]  He had so many nasty things to say, like he said, white women are the devil.
[01:10:24.705 --> 01:10:27.687]  He said he hates black people who talk white.
[01:10:27.687 --> 01:10:34.450]  He said, my favorite thing about being down South is seeing the look on the faces of little white men when they have to look up to a black man.
[01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:40.493]  He also said, uh, it ain't rape if she moans, talking about having sex with a sleeping woman.
[01:10:40.493 --> 01:10:41.854]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:10:41.854 --> 01:10:51.259]  But despite these far left city counselors being so against Trump for things he said, which were not nearly as bad, they won't even condemn what he said.
[01:10:51.259 --> 01:10:52.900]  And the media is trying to cover it up.
[01:10:54.853 --> 01:10:58.875]  So you discovered these tweets, and again, we showed some of them there in the article.
[01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:01.116]  We're putting them up on screen now.
[01:11:01.116 --> 01:11:03.297]  Absolutely vile, vulgar tweets.
[01:11:03.297 --> 01:11:05.438]  This guy is a vice-mayor.
[01:11:05.438 --> 01:11:07.059]  You draw attention to this.
[01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:08.860]  I guess the media picks it up.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.963]  Tell us what happened between that moment and then when you got to the meeting, which was in the headlines a few weeks ago.
[01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:20.525]  Well, here's an interesting tidbit that the local media and even the national media did not cover.
[01:11:20.525 --> 01:11:24.226]  This guy went to the White House the very day after this story broke.
[01:11:24.226 --> 01:11:27.387]  I broke this story on Thanksgiving.
[01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:30.288]  The day after Thanksgiving, he was at the White House.
[01:11:30.288 --> 01:11:40.852]  No one knows why he was there, but this is sort of one of these chosen ones of Barack Obama and Black Lives Matter, and they had a powwow to try and see how they were going to deal with it.
[01:11:41.833 --> 01:11:48.839]  Thankfully, the Virginia legislator is Republican-controlled, so they put some pressure on the legislator.
[01:11:48.839 --> 01:11:55.144]  This guy was actually one of nine people hand-selected to be on the Virginia Board of Education.
[01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.146]  This guy is a black supremacist.
[01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.808]  He hates white people.
[01:11:58.808 --> 01:12:03.552]  He's down with this George Ciccariello's decolonization theories.
[01:12:03.912 --> 01:12:09.195]  And he was one of only nine people deciding what goes in textbooks for the entire state of Virginia.
[01:12:09.195 --> 01:12:11.576]  So we got him to step down from there.
[01:12:11.576 --> 01:12:18.199]  Then all these people came forward trying to look at what I had written.
[01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:19.819]  Obviously they were going to do that.
[01:12:19.819 --> 01:12:28.343]  I don't have anything where I'm using slurs against people or whatever, but I have talked about, I like going on 4chan, you know, I've talked about
[01:12:30.124 --> 01:12:31.645]  Uh, the alt-right.
[01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:37.709]  Before the alt-right was basically shanghaied by this whole Atlantic and Richard Spencer thing.
[01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:42.112]  So they started calling me, oh, you're a alt-right racist Nazi.
[01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:43.153]  They went crazy.
[01:12:43.153 --> 01:12:47.956]  And there was basically a mob for me at the next city council meeting when I came to speak.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.941]  So this guy put out these tweets.
[01:12:51.941 --> 01:12:54.022]  The controversy was about him.
[01:12:54.022 --> 01:12:56.383]  He should be the one at least apologizing.
[01:12:56.383 --> 01:12:58.645]  Other people should be disavowing him.
[01:12:58.645 --> 01:13:00.966]  And yet the exact opposite happened.
[01:13:00.966 --> 01:13:04.627]  All the BLM activists, which you would expect, rallied around him.
[01:13:04.627 --> 01:13:07.569]  Again, you said the mob turned out in hatred against you.
[01:13:07.569 --> 01:13:15.513]  And then at this meeting, didn't these councillors support him by at first claiming that his account had been hacked and these tweets weren't even real?
[01:13:16.621 --> 01:13:17.541]  Yeah, they did that.
[01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:19.222]  They put out false statements.
[01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:22.564]  I mean, these city councilors are so far left-wing.
[01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:31.548]  And I'm telling you, there is a cabal of very powerful left-wing people here in Charlottesville that are connected to the national DNC.
[01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:35.030]  And they are putting forward a lot of things, like the UVA rape hoax.
[01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.490]  Yeah.
[01:13:58.283 --> 01:14:00.824]  We're not even going to condemn what he said.
[01:14:00.824 --> 01:14:04.726]  Only the mayor said something slightly off about that.
[01:14:04.726 --> 01:14:08.648]  And I can tell you, we need to make this a national issue.
[01:14:08.648 --> 01:14:15.812]  We need to make sure that any of these people that are supporting this kind of anti-white racism, we cannot allow these double standards to happen.
[01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:20.454]  These people should not have careers anymore if they are going to stand behind somebody like this.
[01:14:21.468 --> 01:14:23.029]  And it's this whole double standard.
[01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:39.256]  If you had a conservative vice mayor, a councillor, or anyone who had gone on Twitter, who had spouted racism, you know, said he hated black people, talked about raping women, I mean, you can say, oh, it was just a joke, but then you've got to have the same standard for both sides of the equation.
[01:14:39.256 --> 01:14:49.540]  If the shoe was on the other foot, that guy would have been fired, would have resigned within hours of that controversy breaking out, because it would have been picked up by the mainstream media nationally.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.043]  So what happened at the council meeting?
[01:14:52.043 --> 01:14:59.593]  Basically, as far as I understand it, he was forced to give some kind of meek apology and that was basically it, correct?
[01:14:59.593 --> 01:15:07.584]  Yeah, he gave a meek apology and he didn't... and they just ignored the thing and they tried to go on with business as usual.
[01:15:07.984 --> 01:15:12.007]  And let me talk to you a little bit about your point, which is a good point.
[01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:18.252]  If even one of those tweets had been said by a white person, for instance, he said, white women are the devil.
[01:15:18.252 --> 01:15:20.654]  That one's one of the more mild tweets.
[01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:23.736]  If a white person had said black women are the devil, he would be gone.
[01:15:24.036 --> 01:15:27.540]  He would be finished everywhere immediately.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:38.510]  And that is why this struggle is so important and why this is not just a local thing to do with, you know, this vice mayor who has visited the White House and so forth.
[01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:42.234]  This is about changing attitudes and changing perceptions.
[01:15:42.634 --> 01:15:47.939]  Because I'm fighting against a media that does not want to talk about racism against white people.
[01:15:47.939 --> 01:15:50.681]  But I am forcing the issue.
[01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:52.343]  He will not step down.
[01:15:52.343 --> 01:15:55.946]  These people are trying to keep it so that he does not step down.
[01:15:55.946 --> 01:16:00.871]  But there is a legal process through which you get a certain number of signatures and there is a recall.
[01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:06.277]  And I'm in touch with some national people, and I want to make this a big story.
[01:16:06.277 --> 01:16:14.067]  If these people think it's acceptable for this guy to stay after he has said the hateful things he's had to say about white people, no.
[01:16:14.067 --> 01:16:16.370]  And I'm going to make a national example out of him.
[01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:26.662]  I think it goes back to anyone invoking supporting Black Lives Matter who is in a position of government, you have to ask serious questions about them.
[01:16:26.662 --> 01:16:32.489]  This is an organisation that was literally their ideological inspiration, Assata Shakur.
[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:35.492]  The ideological inspiration of Black Lives Matter.
[01:16:35.492 --> 01:16:38.313]  The name who they shout at every single rally.
[01:16:38.313 --> 01:16:45.618]  She is a convicted cop killer in exile on the FBI's most wanted domestic terrorist list.
[01:16:45.618 --> 01:16:48.800]  That is the ideological guru of Black Lives Matter.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:52.362]  They chant for dead cops routinely.
[01:16:52.362 --> 01:16:53.603]  We've played the videos.
[01:16:53.603 --> 01:16:54.983]  We saw what happened in Dallas.
[01:16:54.983 --> 01:16:56.824]  We saw what happened in Baton Rouge.
[01:16:56.824 --> 01:16:57.225]  This is
[01:16:57.845 --> 01:17:03.612]  At the least a domestic extremist organisation, if not a domestic terrorist organisation.
[01:17:03.612 --> 01:17:06.815]  This is an even more virulent form of the Weathermen.
[01:17:06.815 --> 01:17:09.658]  They've encouraged, they've inspired violence.
[01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.400]  We've had dead cops.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.163]  Dead cops, both black and white, because of this rhetoric.
[01:17:14.784 --> 01:17:26.833]  So, again, it's absolutely unconscionable that Obama has allied himself directly with this movement that, even to the point now, it's so ingrained in the culture they've got their own emoji on Twitter, for God's sake.
[01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:36.000]  Imagine if a white supremacist group whose ideological inspiration was Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was this active.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.503]  Would they get support from the establishment, from the mainstream media?
[01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:41.738]  Absolutely not.
[01:17:41.738 --> 01:17:50.766]  And I think that we have a golden opportunity here with this Wes Bellamy guy because he was dumb enough to say what he actually thought on Twitter.
[01:17:50.766 --> 01:18:02.876]  And don't kid yourself, all these Black Lives Matter people, they hate white people, they are a supremacist ideology, they are people who are very violent and cause riots and so forth.
[01:18:02.876 --> 01:18:07.280]  So what we have here is an opportunity where one of them has revealed himself.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.721]  This is a powerful guy.
[01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:12.744]  He's got organizations that he started, like 100 Black Men.
[01:18:12.744 --> 01:18:16.066]  You know, it's a racial solidarity group.
[01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:24.232]  And this is something that he's exploited his entire career, is this sort of black supremacist ideology.
[01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:32.017]  So I think that what we want to do is we want to make Wes Bellamy the poster boy for Black Lives Matter and show them.
[01:18:32.017 --> 01:18:35.840]  And you have on the screen right now a tweet that he made about Thomas Jefferson.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.041]  He's not only trying to
[01:18:38.702 --> 01:18:42.024]  Take down the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:18:42.024 --> 01:18:46.647]  This guy and his Black Lives Matter cohorts want to go after all of our history.
[01:18:46.647 --> 01:18:49.650]  They want to destroy the history of Western civilization.
[01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:54.573]  Charlottesville, Virginia is basically known as the home of Thomas Jefferson.
[01:18:54.573 --> 01:18:56.034]  His Monticello is here.
[01:18:56.034 --> 01:18:57.415]  He started UVA.
[01:18:57.415 --> 01:19:02.398]  This is the guy who is responsible for the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights.
[01:19:02.398 --> 01:19:05.561]  This is where all of our human rights
[01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:15.853]  ...in this country and freedoms come from, and what they want to do is reduce people like Thomas Jefferson to villains, his caricatures of the evil slave master.
[01:19:15.853 --> 01:19:20.619]  And he has a tweet where he's saying Thomas Jefferson is next.
[01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:23.022]  And don't kid yourself, that's what all these people want to do.
[01:19:23.422 --> 01:19:41.852]  They want to get onto the Virginia Board of Education and they want to push this stuff, white people are the only ones who are racist and look at colonialism and white people and slavery and they try and portray it in a very false way as if we are the only ones who had slaves.
[01:19:41.852 --> 01:19:43.853]  We are the ones who ended slavery.
[01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:50.462]  And we're gonna get more into that after the break with Jason Kessler of jasonkessler.net.
[01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:59.734]  Gonna go on to talk about how basically they've made anti-white racism trendy in the culture, and if that is about to be overturned, we'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:00.215]  Don't go away.
[01:20:01.644 --> 01:20:06.427]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:12.312]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:18.816]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:20:18.816 --> 01:20:22.879]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:23:00.379 --> 01:23:04.262]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[01:23:04.262 --> 01:23:10.926]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-years survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[01:23:10.926 --> 01:23:19.292]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[01:23:19.292 --> 01:23:24.396]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[01:23:24.756 --> 01:23:31.061]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:37.206]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food, rated for 25 years of storage.
[01:23:37.206 --> 01:23:45.593]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.
[01:23:45.593 --> 01:23:50.257]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.
[01:23:50.257 --> 01:23:52.339]  Go to freefood2.com right now.
[01:23:52.739 --> 01:23:52.959]  I think.
[01:24:17.915 --> 01:24:26.777]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show Live, talking to Jason Kessler, who is spearheading a movement to unseat Wes Bellamy, the Vice Mayor there in Charlottesville.
[01:24:26.777 --> 01:24:30.138]  Again, this extraordinary double standard on the left.
[01:24:30.138 --> 01:24:42.600]  Whenever a Conservative, whether in government or not, even if it's somebody in entertainment or whatever sphere, tweets something mildly offensive, the outrage mob is sicced upon them instantly.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.521]  They must instantly back down and apologise.
[01:24:45.521 --> 01:24:46.081]  And even then,
[01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:51.065]  In fact, what you see mostly is when they apologise, it only gets worse.
[01:24:51.065 --> 01:24:55.168]  Then they smell blood and seek even greater consequences.
[01:24:55.168 --> 01:25:08.240]  But on the left, again, these councillors rallied around this guy, despite these absolutely vulgar tweets about women, about white people, flagrantly racist, actually sexist tweets.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.861]  What did his fellow leftist colleagues do?
[01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:12.002]  They rallied around him.
[01:25:12.002 --> 01:25:14.703]  They tried to claim that his account had been hacked.
[01:25:14.703 --> 01:25:17.665]  They had to back away from that ridiculous excuse.
[01:25:17.665 --> 01:25:19.706]  And still they support him.
[01:25:19.706 --> 01:25:34.174]  Jason, we're going to talk about the Drexel Professor in a minute, but wasn't there one of the councillors at this meeting who even tried to suggest that you were making a death threat against Bellamy because you said, your days are numbered in a political sense?
[01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:40.152]  Yeah, so I have this petition and he's going to get out of office.
[01:25:40.152 --> 01:25:49.677]  This is the tide of history and the tide of history is so far been to allow this racism against white people and to allow this double standard.
[01:25:49.677 --> 01:26:00.502]  I'm swimming upstream, but I'm going to get to the end point, which is to take this guy to court and to have a trial to say this guy has said things that are discriminatory against white people.
[01:26:00.502 --> 01:26:01.683]  He is unacceptable.
[01:26:02.043 --> 01:26:13.568]  And he's also shown a pattern of discriminatory behavior in the way that he's tried to attack this Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee, which is of ethnic significance to Southern white people.
[01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:17.329]  He has attacked this UVA lecturer, Doug Muir.
[01:26:17.329 --> 01:26:19.590]  And I'd like to just bring up Doug Muir again for a second.
[01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:21.171]  When you talk about this double standard,
[01:26:21.631 --> 01:26:28.776]  What Doug Muir said, and I think you guys have an image of that tweet as well, he was joking with somebody.
[01:26:28.776 --> 01:26:41.064]  He is a conservative guy who happens to work at UVA and he was having a banter with a guy who was saying, oh, I'm not going to go to the Trump winery because Trump is like Hitler.
[01:26:41.064 --> 01:26:43.466]  So this guy said, well, Black Lives Matter is racist.
[01:26:43.466 --> 01:26:48.749]  They're the worst since the Klan, you know, kind of using a little bit of hyperbole there.
[01:26:48.749 --> 01:26:51.391]  Even though I agree with the premise that Black Lives Matter is racist.
[01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:53.292]  We're good to go.
[01:27:20.351 --> 01:27:31.175]  So, when this guy is revealed for much worse things, Doug Muir was voicing a political opinion, which always has to be protected speech.
[01:27:31.175 --> 01:27:43.839]  It's totally acceptable to criticize Black Lives Matter, but when you have a public leader who is saying, I hate seeing white people around town, I don't listen to white people at community meetings, white women are the devil,
[01:27:44.219 --> 01:27:47.103]  White women smell like assault charges in deli meat.
[01:27:47.103 --> 01:27:55.195]  This is a guy who's just said things that are too discriminatory and a bias that shows he should not have power over other people.
[01:27:57.116 --> 01:28:00.539]  Now let's move on to this other story, which is obviously connected.
[01:28:00.539 --> 01:28:07.866]  George Ma, this professor at Drexel, tweeted, Again, you can't have it both ways.
[01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:15.173]  If you want to get completely outraged and call for people to be fired on the right for making jokes, then the same standard has to apply for you.
[01:28:15.173 --> 01:28:17.475]  The university came out, you know, initially they said,
[01:28:17.955 --> 01:28:20.076]  This is, quote, utterly reprehensible.
[01:28:20.076 --> 01:28:21.757]  It doesn't represent our values.
[01:28:21.757 --> 01:28:31.583]  But then when he came back at them and claimed free speech, they backed off and issued this watered-down statement, basically saying, oh, he was, you know, he was misunderstood.
[01:28:31.583 --> 01:28:32.663]  He's still in a job.
[01:28:32.663 --> 01:28:39.167]  I mean, Jason, what do you think would happen if a conservative professor had called for the mass genocide of black people?
[01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:40.808]  Would he still be in a job right now?
[01:28:41.468 --> 01:28:49.815]  Of course they'd be fired right away and that's not the kind of thing that should be permissible according to academic freedom.
[01:28:49.815 --> 01:28:59.183]  Academic freedom should be given a wide leash because obviously we need to have a free exchange of ideas and free speech is a very sacred thing.
[01:28:59.183 --> 01:29:04.487]  But when you're talking about the mass genocide of a people and calling for that, that's over the line.
[01:29:04.787 --> 01:29:14.132]  I mean, what's the difference between this guy and bringing over, you know, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or somebody to talk about the benefits of jihad?
[01:29:14.132 --> 01:29:17.214]  And this guy had a history of making these tweets.
[01:29:17.214 --> 01:29:19.756]  He also said, abolish the white race.
[01:29:19.756 --> 01:29:23.598]  He said the massacre of whites, where they were basically
[01:29:24.398 --> 01:29:29.960]  ...completely murdered and massacred in Haiti was a good thing indeed.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.361]  He said that whites are a pig majority.
[01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:39.703]  This is the kind of thing where somebody has... These are not just political opinions.
[01:29:39.703 --> 01:29:45.225]  These are hateful, racist biases.
[01:29:45.225 --> 01:29:46.786]  Okay, hold up.
[01:29:46.786 --> 01:29:49.867]  Jason Kessler will be back after this break in 4Wars.com.
[01:29:50.731 --> 01:29:54.662]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.662 --> 01:29:57.350]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:08.016]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge by targeting his family.
[01:30:08.016 --> 01:30:13.280]  During his interview with Sean Hannity, Assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:22.809]  But his family, including his young children under 10 years old, didn't sign up for that mission, suggesting powerful actors would take revenge by targeting his family.
[01:30:23.129 --> 01:30:30.913]  Assange once again reiterated that WikiLeaks' source for the DNC and John Podesta documents was not Russia or any state actor.
[01:30:30.913 --> 01:30:40.898]  Although he refused to name sources, Assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source for the DNC leaks.
[01:30:41.218 --> 01:30:45.663]  Rich was mysteriously murdered on July 10th in a case that remains unsolved.
[01:30:45.663 --> 01:30:51.309]  WikiLeaks subsequently offered $20,000 for information leading to the capture of his killer.
[01:30:51.309 --> 01:30:58.176]  Could Assange's concerns over what happened to Seth Rich be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family on the record?
[01:30:58.176 --> 01:31:00.158]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com
[01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:06.231]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:32:01.494 --> 01:32:02.935]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.256]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:04.256 --> 01:32:05.457]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:05.457 --> 01:32:10.742]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:10.742 --> 01:32:24.295]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:24.295 --> 01:32:25.656]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:26.437 --> 01:32:28.078]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:28.078 --> 01:32:30.639]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:31.960]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.060]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.401]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:34.401 --> 01:32:38.903]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:38.903 --> 01:32:42.045]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:42.165 --> 01:32:45.188]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:45.188 --> 01:32:46.290]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:46.290 --> 01:32:48.212]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:48.212 --> 01:32:49.233]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:49.233 --> 01:32:51.936]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:51.936 --> 01:32:55.219]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:55.219 --> 01:32:57.462]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:57.462 --> 01:32:59.424]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:04.735 --> 01:33:06.356]  We are on the march.
[01:33:06.356 --> 01:33:09.518]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:09.518 --> 01:33:13.141]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:21.334 --> 01:33:23.235]  We are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.235 --> 01:33:25.516]  I apologize if what's in for Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.516 --> 01:33:34.139]  We're going to go back to our guest here in a moment, but first I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have at infowarsstore.com, exclusively available.
[01:33:34.139 --> 01:33:36.960]  It's tactical nanotechnology body armor.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.342]  Again, the government's preparing, the government's buying riot gear, they're stockpiling food.
[01:33:41.342 --> 01:33:43.743]  But if you do it, you're a kook and you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:44.483 --> 01:33:53.606]  Over the past year, InfoWars has been working with some of the top special operators in the United States to source you the absolute highest quality and affordable body armor out there.
[01:33:53.606 --> 01:34:01.689]  Our team of former Blackwater operators and Army Rangers analyzed and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies for their stopping power and safety.
[01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:11.717]  And we've teamed up with National Defence Laboratories to bring you an advanced nanotechnology body armour that until now was only available to the US military and law enforcement.
[01:34:11.717 --> 01:34:15.260]  So this is cutting edge, it's an exciting new product.
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:15.541]  It is!
[01:34:16.809 --> 01:34:19.210]  Tactical Nanotechnology Body Armor.
[01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:22.892]  Again, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:22.892 --> 01:34:26.454]  The government's preparing by buying this kind of product.
[01:34:26.454 --> 01:34:33.077]  You know, we have people across Europe buying whatever they can get their hands on, pepper spray or whatever.
[01:34:33.077 --> 01:34:39.280]  This probably would be illegal over there because of the strife that's unfolding in countries such as Germany and Sweden.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:55.631]  This is only sensible that you do the same by getting this exciting new product at InfoWarsStore.com and of course it supports this operation as we expand, as we fight the mainstream media on a higher, higher level every single day.
[01:34:55.631 --> 01:34:59.074]  We're going to go back to our guest though, who is Jason Kessler.
[01:34:59.074 --> 01:35:01.676]  We're talking about anti-white racism.
[01:35:02.694 --> 01:35:08.199]  Which has basically become the last acceptable form of racism in the West.
[01:35:08.199 --> 01:35:17.067]  We had this Wes Bellamy, this vice mayor tweeting out all these vulgar tweets about hating white people, misogynistic rape jokes.
[01:35:17.067 --> 01:35:19.990]  Again, all the left rallies around him.
[01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:22.292]  You look at someone like Justine Sacco.
[01:35:22.292 --> 01:35:24.774]  This was a woman who made a tweet which was a joke.
[01:35:25.735 --> 01:35:28.879]  And it was actually an homage to white privilege.
[01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:31.062]  It wasn't even a racist joke.
[01:35:31.062 --> 01:35:32.744]  She was absolutely crucified.
[01:35:32.744 --> 01:35:34.587]  She got on a plane, made a tweet.
[01:35:34.587 --> 01:35:40.074]  By the time she got off the plane, her entire career and life was destroyed.
[01:35:40.074 --> 01:35:41.015]  That's the difference.
[01:35:41.596 --> 01:35:50.326]  Now we have MTV, of course, coming out a couple of weeks ago with this New Year's resolutions for white guys video.
[01:35:50.326 --> 01:35:57.695]  The backlash to that was absolutely intense, suggesting that people are finally getting sick to the back teeth.
[01:35:58.482 --> 01:36:03.725]  of this fetishisation, this trendiness of anti-white racism.
[01:36:03.725 --> 01:36:07.227]  They've made it acceptable up until now, Jason.
[01:36:07.227 --> 01:36:10.328]  This is emboldening both black and white supremacists.
[01:36:10.328 --> 01:36:12.209]  This is the effect it has.
[01:36:12.209 --> 01:36:22.755]  The people on both ends of the extreme are only further radicalised, further proven right in a sense, by all this casual anti-white racism.
[01:36:22.755 --> 01:36:26.197]  What do you think is the actual agenda behind this?
[01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:26.397]  I mean,
[01:36:27.037 --> 01:36:32.918]  How do we deconstruct this fable they've created that it's impossible to be racist against white people, right?
[01:36:32.918 --> 01:36:35.119]  Because that's basically what they've framed it in.
[01:36:35.119 --> 01:36:41.140]  They've said, oh, white people have institutionalized power, even though to a greater extent they don't.
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:52.323]  And yet they're using the entire culture, setting it against white people, and saying that white people have all the power, therefore it's acceptable to be racist against them.
[01:36:52.323 --> 01:36:54.604]  How do we deconstruct that fable?
[01:36:55.604 --> 01:36:57.845]  I think we have to fight back against it.
[01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:04.626]  There's a tendency on the right, when people are racist towards white people, we just let it go.
[01:37:04.626 --> 01:37:11.387]  Because there's a certain amount of these limousine liberal white people who do not interact with minorities, really.
[01:37:11.387 --> 01:37:16.688]  They live in gated communities, and they only see minorities as a charity project.
[01:37:16.688 --> 01:37:19.529]  And they do have what you could call a privilege.
[01:37:19.529 --> 01:37:24.590]  And they think all white people are so privileged and whatever, so they let this slide.
[01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:32.797]  So there's a smaller number of people who do not have this kind of privilege that they're talking about, and they need to speak up.
[01:37:32.797 --> 01:37:40.023]  You have to make examples out of people like the West Vellemys and the George Ciccariello Mars of the world.
[01:37:40.023 --> 01:37:48.911]  You have to take them to court over things, and you have to make them feel the pain, because they have made our side feel the pain for things that are not
[01:37:50.672 --> 01:37:53.173]  Even remotely worth doing that.
[01:37:53.173 --> 01:37:55.414]  And I'm not saying you should just go after anybody.
[01:37:55.414 --> 01:37:57.675]  Like what happened with Justine Zacco.
[01:37:57.675 --> 01:37:59.536]  She was making a joke.
[01:37:59.536 --> 01:38:00.096]  And you're right.
[01:38:00.096 --> 01:38:07.399]  She was making a joke about white people having some kind of special place in the world that they wouldn't get AIDS or whatever.
[01:38:07.879 --> 01:38:12.824]  And people didn't understand the joke and they hounded her and they got her out of there.
[01:38:12.824 --> 01:38:27.839]  So I'm saying when we have a legitimate target, when we have somebody who is clearly very virulently racist against us, we have to demand that they are not going to be teaching our kids in school and we have to demand that they are not going to be our politicians.
[01:38:30.376 --> 01:38:36.344]  And again, the heart of it is this attempt by the establishment to force feeders' diversity.
[01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:45.936]  I mean, one example that I came across the other day... Oh, and by the way, back to your point about people living in white privilege bubbles, there was a video recently where they went out and asked white people
[01:38:46.397 --> 01:38:54.243]  You know, if black people should get all this help, all these subsidies, with things like using the internet, using their cell phones.
[01:38:54.243 --> 01:38:58.026]  What that video exposed was the bigotry of low expectations.
[01:38:58.026 --> 01:39:03.390]  These white people thinking that they should surround themselves and, you know, bow down and worship white privilege.
[01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:04.410]  I don't
[01:39:19.187 --> 01:39:28.072]  It's so manipulated into white guilt that they're literally insulting towards black people by saying that they need help with absolutely everything.
[01:39:28.072 --> 01:39:32.375]  They need help operating their cell phones, connecting to the internet.
[01:39:32.375 --> 01:39:34.296]  I thought that was a good expose.
[01:39:34.296 --> 01:39:37.518]  But we've also got this attempt to force feeders diversity.
[01:39:37.518 --> 01:39:38.399]  I'll give you an example.
[01:39:39.119 --> 01:39:49.825]  The BBC in the United Kingdom, the television station, they have a station ident, which for the last ten years or so has been, for example, eight whales seen swimming in a circle.
[01:39:49.825 --> 01:39:52.727]  They always use a circle for the station ident.
[01:39:52.727 --> 01:39:56.289]  So, you know, it's either eight whales, it's eight flags flying.
[01:39:56.289 --> 01:40:04.594]  Now they've decided that they're going to be culturally diverse and, for example, it's going to be eight people in a Zumba class
[01:40:05.154 --> 01:40:07.836]  In a town called Bristol in England.
[01:40:07.836 --> 01:40:13.780]  Now the problem with that is, you know, Bristol in England is still, what, 85-90% white.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:20.585]  You look at this station Iden, it's two white people, you know, two black people, two Muslims.
[01:40:20.585 --> 01:40:22.206]  It's not even accurate!
[01:40:22.206 --> 01:40:27.750]  I mean, how can you enforce this idea of diversity when it's not even accurate?
[01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:31.673]  The other point is, you know, it's fundamentally anti-egalitarian.
[01:40:32.193 --> 01:40:35.755]  You have the BAFTAs again, which is the British version of the Oscars.
[01:40:35.755 --> 01:40:42.258]  They announced recently that they would bar films that failed to be, quote, diverse from winning an award.
[01:40:42.258 --> 01:40:51.902]  Meaning that, you know, there has to be a non-white character as either the protagonist or the antagonist in every single movie.
[01:40:51.902 --> 01:40:52.303]  So again...
[01:40:53.223 --> 01:40:56.185]  This is even at the expense of historical accuracy.
[01:40:56.185 --> 01:41:07.652]  How are you going to make a film set in a country in the past in which no black people lived, yet still include black actors in the number one and the number two roles?
[01:41:07.652 --> 01:41:10.174]  It's fundamentally anti-egalitarian.
[01:41:10.974 --> 01:41:13.475]  I would say it's misguided virtue signalling.
[01:41:13.475 --> 01:41:24.879]  Instead of awarding people the best roles regardless of gender, regardless of race, which is the true non-racist stance, they're enforcing this diversity.
[01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:28.881]  I mean, do you just see it as misguided virtue signalling by the left?
[01:41:28.881 --> 01:41:30.301]  Or is there something deeper?
[01:41:30.301 --> 01:41:31.702]  Is this about political power?
[01:41:33.055 --> 01:41:36.318]  Like you, I ultimately want egalitarianism.
[01:41:36.318 --> 01:41:41.462]  I want people to be chosen for things based on their merit rather than their race.
[01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:48.609]  Unfortunately, I think that this identity politics is a genie that once out of the bottle is never going to go back.
[01:41:48.609 --> 01:41:49.830]  The only way you're going to have
[01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:58.934]  Equal treatment is to have white people stand up for themselves in the same way that black people stand up for themselves or other groups stand up for themselves.
[01:41:58.934 --> 01:42:00.475]  And not in a hateful way.
[01:42:00.475 --> 01:42:03.096]  I think that that smears the movement.
[01:42:03.096 --> 01:42:06.238]  But you have to have people to advocate.
[01:42:07.058 --> 01:42:12.143]  White people are going to be a minority in some of these countries, like in the United States perhaps.
[01:42:12.143 --> 01:42:15.285]  We have to be able to play that game to some extent.
[01:42:15.285 --> 01:42:31.398]  As far as the hiring of actors, you see that in commercials a lot of times too, where if you have 70% of the population is white, there'll be like one white guy and then, you know, a Muslim and a black person and so on and so forth.
[01:42:31.398 --> 01:42:33.460]  It's not representative of the population.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:33.960]  Yes.
[01:42:52.089 --> 01:42:57.613]  And their customer base is like 90% white, let's say.
[01:42:57.613 --> 01:43:00.935]  And so they put 90% white people in their commercial.
[01:43:00.935 --> 01:43:04.137]  Well, the black groups will get upset and they will sue these people.
[01:43:04.137 --> 01:43:08.760]  And they just, it's like a pain reaction.
[01:43:09.921 --> 01:43:23.862]  If you react to a stimulus, they've created so much pain in these companies for not giving hiring preferences based on race that they just do it automatically.
[01:43:25.863 --> 01:43:27.724]  It's created complete derangement.
[01:43:27.724 --> 01:43:30.306]  As he said, people are completely reactionary.
[01:43:30.306 --> 01:43:48.699]  They hook on to the latest little bit of outrage and, to be fair, I would say on Twitter, on some social media platforms, it's lessened in intensity over the past couple of years now that we've drawn attention to it, now that people are starting to understand how this outrage culture works, you know, what virtue singling is.
[01:43:49.499 --> 01:43:54.964]  Social justice worry is just that term has become a massive pejorative over the past couple of years.
[01:43:54.964 --> 01:43:58.687]  So we are kind of fighting this back a little bit.
[01:43:58.687 --> 01:44:10.197]  You wrote in the tweet exchange we had though that the Trump movement needs to realize that they're missing a golden opportunity to finish off some leftists while they're still in a state of panic.
[01:44:10.197 --> 01:44:12.519]  We have this Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:44:12.519 --> 01:44:14.241]  We have leftists across the board
[01:44:14.801 --> 01:44:16.703]  Faking hate crimes.
[01:44:16.703 --> 01:44:23.248]  Almost every day I see a new story about how they hoaxed a hate crime to try and frame Trump supporters.
[01:44:23.248 --> 01:44:25.029]  They did it themselves.
[01:44:25.029 --> 01:44:26.030]  Expand on your comment.
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:31.195]  How do we exploit this opportunity with leftists in this state of panic right now?
[01:44:31.855 --> 01:44:33.116]  Yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:44:33.116 --> 01:44:46.145]  I mean, a lot of people who follow the major accounts on Twitter can see that there's been a lot of feuding lately amongst the Trump coalition, particularly what I guess you could refer to as the meme coalition.
[01:44:46.145 --> 01:44:49.267]  And I think that it's really misguided.
[01:44:49.267 --> 01:44:59.735]  I think that trying to fracture Trump's coalition right before he takes office is just going to make it harder for us to do things like immigration enforcement, building the wall, and so forth.
[01:45:01.756 --> 01:45:04.678]  There are actually real enemies still out there.
[01:45:04.678 --> 01:45:07.140]  You know, there are still the Shaun Kings of the world.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.861]  There are still the Black Lives Matter.
[01:45:08.861 --> 01:45:17.487]  This George Chakariello guy is just getting away with advocating for white genocide because people are not
[01:45:19.108 --> 01:45:23.069]  Working in a way that winners work.
[01:45:23.069 --> 01:45:27.271]  I start to think some of these people may be afraid of winning.
[01:45:27.271 --> 01:45:33.653]  They get the taste of it and they don't quite have the killer instinct.
[01:45:33.653 --> 01:45:35.513]  You gotta go back after the leftists.
[01:45:35.513 --> 01:45:37.374]  Don't start attacking people on the right.
[01:45:38.908 --> 01:45:44.191]  I think some of it is just the disbelief that they actually won, that Trump got into office.
[01:45:44.191 --> 01:45:48.313]  Now they think that, you know, it's somehow too good to be true.
[01:45:48.313 --> 01:45:53.336]  It's like, you know, on the conspiracy theorist side, they think, oh, well, Trump must be controlled by someone, right?
[01:45:53.336 --> 01:45:56.057]  Now he must be part of the elite that they let him become president.
[01:45:56.057 --> 01:45:56.977]  Well, no.
[01:45:56.977 --> 01:45:57.478]  We won!
[01:45:58.058 --> 01:46:00.079]  We have to accept that we won.
[01:46:00.079 --> 01:46:02.300]  That brings us new responsibilities.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:07.461]  But there has been a lot of infighting that went with it immediately after Trump won the election.
[01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:10.342]  We had this Richard Spencer thing.
[01:46:10.342 --> 01:46:13.624]  You mentioned it earlier, without getting too far down into the weeds.
[01:46:13.624 --> 01:46:15.364]  That's what the media loves, right?
[01:46:15.364 --> 01:46:17.365]  They love to create these divisions.
[01:46:17.365 --> 01:46:18.865]  They love to exploit them.
[01:46:18.865 --> 01:46:22.827]  Because before that, it was quite a unified force, to say the least.
[01:46:23.547 --> 01:46:28.829]  I think they glom onto these personalities like Richard Spencer who are in it for the ego.
[01:46:28.829 --> 01:46:30.589]  They don't care about damaging the movement.
[01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:33.390]  They don't care about making other people look stupid.
[01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:35.110]  Guilt by association.
[01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:36.171]  The media loves it.
[01:46:36.171 --> 01:46:38.231]  They invite the mainstream media in.
[01:46:38.231 --> 01:46:40.812]  I mean, I don't even give mainstream media interviews.
[01:46:41.192 --> 01:46:44.115]  I will go on shows, I will go on Stefan Molyneux's show.
[01:46:44.115 --> 01:46:47.858]  If the BBC wants me on, I'll just say no, because I know their game by now.
[01:46:47.858 --> 01:46:50.821]  And I don't need their audience, I've got my own platform.
[01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:57.026]  But you have certain personalities that just want all the attention, they want the ego boost, they don't care about...
[01:46:57.967 --> 01:47:09.797]  You know, literally getting up in front of people and saying, uh, Heil Trump, while his slobbering, demented fans give sick heils, and then they don't even care about how that looks in the media.
[01:47:09.797 --> 01:47:23.329]  Listen, even if you believe, which I don't, and there's a vocal minority out there that Jews control the world, these Holocaust deniers or whatever, even if you believe all that, fine, whatever, I think you're completely wrong and it's damaging, but
[01:47:24.250 --> 01:47:35.082]  At least you must accept that getting up in front of the Atlantic, in front of news cameras, and aggressively sig-hailing at these events doesn't look very good, right?
[01:47:35.082 --> 01:47:37.724]  There's not great optics in doing that.
[01:47:37.724 --> 01:47:38.846]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[01:47:39.813 --> 01:47:40.894]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:47:40.894 --> 01:47:45.177]  You know, the speech itself, I didn't think that there was anything wrong with the speech.
[01:47:45.177 --> 01:47:48.419]  It was a pretty boilerplate speech.
[01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:51.822]  But doing the Sig Heil's, I mean, that was really dumb.
[01:47:51.822 --> 01:48:00.128]  The people in the audience shouldn't have done that because you're just going to be stoking fear and you're going to be putting stigma on some of the good ideas that he has.
[01:48:00.128 --> 01:48:03.311]  And personally, if I were him, I would have said that
[01:48:04.306 --> 01:48:04.787]  The St.
[01:48:04.787 --> 01:48:05.809]  Kyle's were dumb.
[01:48:05.809 --> 01:48:10.556]  I mean, I think they were doing them just in a sense of humor.
[01:48:10.556 --> 01:48:14.302]  But it's not a sense of humor that translates outside of the internet.
[01:48:14.302 --> 01:48:17.988]  You're going to scare the shit out of people when it's the front page on the Atlantic.
[01:48:19.505 --> 01:48:20.947]  I mean, I thought it was ridiculous.
[01:48:20.947 --> 01:48:29.978]  Obviously, it led to Trump having to, in front of the media, disavow the alt-right entirely, when, in fact, the alt-right now has several different divisions.
[01:48:29.978 --> 01:48:38.028]  If you look at a website like, you know, the Reddit, the Donald Reddit, and you compare that to something like 4chan, completely different audience.
[01:48:39.069 --> 01:48:41.971]  And that distinction has not been made in the mainstream media.
[01:48:41.971 --> 01:48:48.936]  They've taken this, they exploited it, they created it in a way, then they used it to make Trump disavow the alt-right.
[01:48:48.936 --> 01:48:51.617]  And I just think it was a massive defeat for us.
[01:48:51.617 --> 01:48:53.298]  And that can be blamed on certain people.
[01:48:53.298 --> 01:48:55.180]  But we've come to the end of the show.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:49:00.043]  Jason, just tell people where people can sign your petition and how they can find you on Twitter.
[01:49:00.914 --> 01:49:04.777]  Well, the petition, the legal petition, is only for Charlottesville residents.
[01:49:04.777 --> 01:49:09.621]  You can email me at themaddimension at gmail.com if you want to do that.
[01:49:09.621 --> 01:49:12.723]  But I have a lot more things going on in the coming year.
[01:49:12.723 --> 01:49:16.005]  We're going to work on turning Virginia red for Trump.
[01:49:16.005 --> 01:49:22.670]  And we're going to make sure that people like George Ciccariello and Wes Bellamy are held accountable.
[01:49:22.670 --> 01:49:25.332]  Go to my website, JasonKessler.net.
[01:49:25.332 --> 01:49:28.795]  On Twitter and Gab, I'm at TheMadDimension.
[01:49:30.552 --> 01:49:33.434]  Okay, Jason Kessler, thanks for joining us today.
[01:49:33.434 --> 01:49:35.235]  Thank you, good to be here.
[01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:36.336]  Good to have you.
[01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.037]  Okay, there goes Jason Kessler again.
[01:49:38.037 --> 01:49:40.938]  Go and read about the situation there in Charlottesville.
[01:49:40.938 --> 01:49:45.201]  This didn't get much national attention, got a lot of local attention.
[01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:59.990]  And again, it's a really good insight into how the left rallies round actual supremacists, race supremacists, racist misogynists, while of course pointing the finger at everyone else and saying that we're the racist misogynists.
[01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:15.055]  And the sheer butthurt that they get over Trump, and I think it was the White House Press Secretary-Elect who came out and made this point the other day, he will continue tweeting and the mainstream media is absolutely apoplectic.
[01:50:15.055 --> 01:50:20.917]  They've got Trump derangement syndrome merely over the fact that Donald Trump uses a Twitter account.
[01:50:21.537 --> 01:50:28.038]  Never has that direct form of communication been available to a president who's been willing to use it.
[01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:38.500]  Donald Trump will be that president and the mainstream media is scared to death because his message can't be filtered through their spin.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:45.622]  Just as CNN said that people shouldn't read WikiLeaks revelations without first seeing what CNN had to say about it.
[01:50:46.022 --> 01:50:46.743]  Well, no.
[01:50:46.743 --> 01:50:47.984]  You're the fake news.
[01:50:47.984 --> 01:50:50.707]  You've put out dangerous fake news again and again.
[01:50:50.707 --> 01:50:55.031]  The Washington Post has just done it and now you're being exposed and you're not happy about it.
[01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:57.974]  We'll be back with the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[01:51:02.208 --> 01:51:02.848]  Hello again.
[01:51:02.848 --> 01:51:03.849]  My name is Gary Clark.
[01:51:03.849 --> 01:51:10.453]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[01:51:10.453 --> 01:51:15.396]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[01:51:15.396 --> 01:51:21.920]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.762]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[01:51:24.762 --> 01:51:29.285]  I neglected to mention how one world whey protein powder has affected my life.
[01:51:29.545 --> 01:51:33.826]  Now, I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[01:51:33.826 --> 01:51:36.607]  One World Way solved my irregularity.
[01:51:36.607 --> 01:51:41.169]  I've been plagued with constipation for years, and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[01:51:41.169 --> 01:51:44.770]  Three weeks on One World Way set me on a new path.
[01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:48.151]  That was five months ago, and I haven't been irregular since.
[01:51:48.151 --> 01:51:49.551]  Will it work the same way for you?
[01:51:49.551 --> 01:51:50.391]  I don't know.
[01:51:50.391 --> 01:51:51.572]  It worked for me.

[01:54:07.719 --> 01:54:16.766]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:16.766 --> 01:54:20.609]  Live on the Alex Jones Show, we've got Harlan Hill coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:20.609 --> 01:54:26.855]  He is a Fox News CNN contributor to talk about fake news, to talk about the latest with Trump, the latest.
[01:54:27.515 --> 01:54:30.417]  Trump derangement hysteria with the mainstream media.
[01:54:30.417 --> 01:54:34.799]  On the subject of fake news though, here's a story out of the local headline.
[01:54:34.799 --> 01:54:39.902]  Italy's populist leader, public should decide whether news is fake.
[01:54:39.902 --> 01:54:44.684]  And for that one statement, he has been absolutely slammed.
[01:54:44.684 --> 01:54:52.909]  Italy's media and traditional political parties were up in arms Wednesday after the head of the populist five-star movement, this is one of the guys who helped
[01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:58.974]  Defeat that reform bill that Italians voted on that was a rejection of the EU.
[01:54:58.974 --> 01:55:03.378]  Accused the country's journalists of manufacturing false news.
[01:55:03.378 --> 01:55:08.683]  So he's daring to say that the mainstream media is the main progenitor of false news.
[01:55:08.683 --> 01:55:18.031]  This is comedian Beppe Grillo, founder of the anti-euro movement, who lashed out at print and TV journalists accusing them of fabricating news to keep the five stars down.
[01:55:18.772 --> 01:55:27.454]  He said, quote, Newspapers and television news programs are the biggest manufacturers of false news in the country with the aim of ensuring those who have power keep it.
[01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:40.637]  He called for a popular jury to determine the veracity of the news published, and said in the cases of fake news the editor must head-bad make a public apology and publish the correct version at the start of the program or on the paper's front page.
[01:55:40.637 --> 01:55:51.205]  So all he did was accuse the mainstream media of being the main progenitor of fake news and say that basically a popular jury of the people, not of
[01:55:52.066 --> 01:56:03.054]  extreme leftists hired by Facebook like Snopes.com that a jury of the people should be responsible for determining what is fake news and what isn't.
[01:56:03.054 --> 01:56:06.337]  And for this he was called a fascist.
[01:56:06.337 --> 01:56:07.438]  This was the response.
[01:56:08.703 --> 01:56:12.265]  Again, the article continues, the media world was enraged.
[01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:19.649]  The news director of private TGLA7 channel, Enrico Mentana, said he would sue the comedian.
[01:56:19.649 --> 01:56:24.371]  So he writes a blog post accusing the mainstream media of lying.
[01:56:24.371 --> 01:56:31.955]  The response is that he's a fascist and now this TV owner, TV channel owner, is going to sue him.
[01:56:31.955 --> 01:56:36.237]  He said that Beppe Grillo was encouraging the lynching of all journalists.
[01:56:36.237 --> 01:56:36.578]  Really?
[01:56:37.438 --> 01:56:49.862]  The opposition Five Stars was running neck and neck with the ruling centre-left Democratic Party before Matteo Renzi's downfall last month and is campaigning hard for the next general election, which could be held in the coming months.
[01:56:49.862 --> 01:56:53.404]  So again, this is a populist movement, a threat to the establishment.
[01:56:53.404 --> 01:56:58.746]  The leader of it in Italy comes out and says the mainstream media is responsible for fake news.
[01:56:58.746 --> 01:57:00.626]  How dare they try and censor us?
[01:57:00.626 --> 01:57:04.608]  We should have a people's jury to determine what is real and what is fake news.
[01:57:05.717 --> 01:57:15.657]  Well, according to Stefano Apposito, another politician there in Italy, he said what Grillo is proposing is fascism, and those who play it down are accomplices.
[01:57:18.457 --> 01:57:33.027]  The centre-right Forza Italia party, founded by ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said Grillo wanted a mini-Kulpop 2.0, a reference to the propaganda and censorship ministry under dictator Benito Mussolini.
[01:57:33.027 --> 01:57:35.929]  So that's not an overreaction at all, is it?
[01:57:35.929 --> 01:57:45.715]  He says that the mainstream media lies sometimes and puts out fake news that people should decide, not governments and corporations, what represents fake news.
[01:57:45.715 --> 01:57:46.136]  For that,
[01:57:47.057 --> 01:57:51.761]  He's trying to bring back something that a dictator had in Mussolini.
[01:57:51.761 --> 01:57:56.386]  He's a fascist and that he's encouraging the lynching of all journalists.
[01:57:57.378 --> 01:58:17.138]  Again, doesn't that really prove his point that he made initially, that the mainstream media is the main progenitor of fake news, giving that absolutely hysterical overreaction to Italy's populist leader, saying that the public should decide whether, quote, fake news is fake or not.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:27.067]  Now we have the EU telling Facebook they will fine them thousands of dollars a day if they don't remove, quote, fake news within 24 hours.
[01:58:27.067 --> 01:58:29.249]  Who's in control of determining what's fake news?
[01:58:29.249 --> 01:58:33.212]  The far-left bias website Snopes.com.
[01:58:33.212 --> 01:58:34.493]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:58:34.493 --> 01:58:38.376]  We'll be back with the third hour of the Alex Jones Show, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[01:58:38.376 --> 01:58:38.976]  Stay tuned.

[01:59:53.263 --> 01:59:55.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:22.559]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:22.559 --> 02:00:26.922]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.922 --> 02:00:31.105]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:31.105 --> 02:00:32.686]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.156 --> 02:00:44.238]  We have Harlan Hill, Fox News and CNN contributor coming up in the next segment to talk about media hysteria.
[02:00:44.238 --> 02:00:49.700]  And on that subject, we're going to go to this final clip now from Julian Assange's appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity.
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:52.561]  Of course, the WikiLeaks emails revealed the deep...
[02:00:53.101 --> 02:00:58.023]  Deep collusion between the Democratic Party and the mainstream media.
[02:00:58.023 --> 02:01:00.784]  We're talking about going to John Podesta's house for dinner.
[02:01:00.784 --> 02:01:02.404]  Cozy get-togethers.
[02:01:02.404 --> 02:01:06.966]  We're talking about handing Hillary Clinton debate questions in advance.
[02:01:06.966 --> 02:01:13.248]  We're talking about mainstream journalists like Glenn Thrush of Politico literally calling himself a hack.
[02:01:13.948 --> 02:01:18.590]  Giving the Clinton campaign his article a day before it's published.
[02:01:18.590 --> 02:01:19.970]  Those are just a few examples.
[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:25.292]  Here is Julian Assange with Sean Hannity on media collusion.
[02:01:25.292 --> 02:01:29.034]  I said in my country, Julian, that journalism is dead.
[02:01:29.034 --> 02:01:42.239]  I said it in 2008 because I was investigating Barack Obama and his backgrounds and his associations and his career and his lack of knowledge and his radical belief system.
[02:01:42.799 --> 02:01:45.321]  And everybody in the media ignored a lot of it.
[02:01:45.321 --> 02:01:59.092]  So my question to you then is, now knowing what WikiLeaks revealed about the Podesta emails, on Clinton corruption, on pay-to-play, on Bernie Sanders being cheated, all of this is revealed.
[02:01:59.092 --> 02:02:01.074]  Not a lot of it was covered.
[02:02:01.074 --> 02:02:06.018]  So what does that say to the American people about media coverage in America?
[02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:06.539]  Dishonest?
[02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:09.700]  It's very dishonest.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:10.680]  Corrupt is interesting.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.821]  It depends on your definition.
[02:02:12.821 --> 02:02:18.624]  If you look at what we published in the... If they're colluding with Hillary, that's not corrupt.
[02:02:18.624 --> 02:02:21.565]  It's ethical corruption.
[02:02:21.565 --> 02:02:23.506]  They're not identifying it to their audiences.
[02:02:23.506 --> 02:02:25.706]  They claim that they're objective journalists.
[02:02:25.706 --> 02:02:26.707]  It's ethically corrupt.
[02:02:27.816 --> 02:02:34.039]  Corruption also means something in law, which is that you're taking money in exchange.
[02:02:34.039 --> 02:02:34.619]  Okay.
[02:02:34.619 --> 02:02:36.280]  So I don't think that... Collusion.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:37.841]  They're colluding, yeah.
[02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:40.002]  Because they share her political agenda.
[02:02:41.553 --> 02:02:42.833]  Well, why else would they collude?
[02:02:42.833 --> 02:02:43.634]  Or they hate Donald Trump?
[02:02:43.634 --> 02:02:47.215]  I think that's an optimistic interpretation, that they share the political agenda.
[02:02:47.215 --> 02:02:48.595]  Well, explain that.
[02:02:48.595 --> 02:02:52.076]  It's more like, you rub my back, I'll rub yours.
[02:02:52.076 --> 02:02:54.577]  I'll give you, you know, I'll give you information.
[02:02:54.577 --> 02:03:02.920]  You'll be, you'll come to my, um, I'll invite you to my child's christening or our next big party or, do you know what I mean?
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.940]  Or a state dinner.
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:05.680]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.801]  So, I think it's more,
[02:03:07.945 --> 02:03:09.846]  Sadly, I think it's long gone.
[02:03:09.846 --> 02:03:18.811]  But I look at this list of what WikiLeaks exposed for... Can I just go back to this media question?
[02:03:18.811 --> 02:03:24.694]  What is the line now in the New York Times, MSNBC?
[02:03:24.694 --> 02:03:27.115]  Okay.
[02:03:27.115 --> 02:03:33.278]  The line is that WikiLeaks changed the result of the election.
[02:03:33.278 --> 02:03:33.778]  Okay.
[02:03:33.778 --> 02:03:34.819]  And is that true, WikiLeaks?
[02:03:36.232 --> 02:03:48.298]  We're quite happy to have the credit for exposing the corruption and behavior that was occurring in that Clinton team.
[02:03:48.298 --> 02:03:52.459]  And the DNC fixing things, in relation to Bernie Sanders, we're quite happy to accept that credit.
[02:03:52.459 --> 02:03:53.360]  Was that your motivation?
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:59.142]  Was your motivation to influence the election or do you, is your motivation, what is your motivation?
[02:03:59.142 --> 02:04:00.923]  Is it fidelity to truth?
[02:04:00.923 --> 02:04:10.107]  My motivation for maybe 20 years, but 10 years with WikiLeaks has been to publish true information that is otherwise unsayable.
[02:04:11.474 --> 02:04:16.236]  So there is Julian Assange again making the point that the information they published was true.
[02:04:16.236 --> 02:04:17.717]  It was accurate.
[02:04:17.717 --> 02:04:28.002]  Remember, back at the beginning of this whole fake news scandal, it was Democratic Hillary Clinton-supporting operatives that were the progenitors of the original fake news.
[02:04:28.522 --> 02:04:34.649]  The fake news that the WikiLeaks releases were not authentic, or that they had been doctored.
[02:04:34.649 --> 02:04:46.864]  So you go right back to the beginning of that narrative, and they were the ones releasing fake news to try and bait conservatives, Trump supporters, into amplifying that fake news, and in many cases it worked.
[02:04:47.705 --> 02:04:52.471]  But again, eventually the narrative to derail WikiLeaks didn't work.
[02:04:52.471 --> 02:04:53.753]  The information got out there.
[02:04:53.753 --> 02:04:54.514]  It was accurate.
[02:04:54.514 --> 02:04:56.256]  It damaged Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:56.256 --> 02:04:57.938]  It had a massive impact on the U.S.
[02:04:57.938 --> 02:04:59.139]  election.
[02:04:59.139 --> 02:05:01.262]  We will be back in the next segment with Hollander.
[02:05:01.262 --> 02:05:06.068]  The Huffington Post says Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
[02:05:06.408 --> 02:05:12.294]  And they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of Trump right now, before the inauguration.
[02:05:12.294 --> 02:05:25.428]  In an article titled, Impeaching Trump, The Process Begins Now, Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says President-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even Richard Nixon.
[02:05:26.449 --> 02:05:31.733]  And he expects Trump will immediately break the law and violate the Constitution.
[02:05:31.733 --> 02:05:40.680]  Therefore, the Huffington Post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin the first day Trump steps into office.
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:51.288]  The idea is to keep daily records of Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance with Vladimir Putin.
[02:05:51.288 --> 02:05:55.731]  More desperation from the lunatics on the far right.
[02:05:55.931 --> 02:05:56.651]  Left.

[02:09:05.666 --> 02:09:08.808]  Popped a couple of these and it helped immeasurably.
[02:09:09.548 --> 02:09:13.810]  It's a bold new frontier if you research new tropics generally.
[02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:16.511]  The Silicon Valley whiz kids are all taking them.

[02:09:26.896 --> 02:09:28.396]  We're good to go.
[02:09:46.441 --> 02:09:53.983]  ...continues to accuse the likes of Infowars, the likes of you, no doubt, of, you know, being dangerous for pushing fake news.
[02:09:53.983 --> 02:09:56.624]  They're calling for censorship.
[02:09:56.624 --> 02:10:04.966]  When they're the ones publishing this fake news about Russia hacking the US electric grid, again with no evidence whatsoever,
[02:10:05.706 --> 02:10:15.260]  They're escalating a conflict with a nuclear-armed power by pushing fake news while accusing us of pushing fake news.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:17.963]  Holland, do these people have any self-awareness at all?
[02:10:19.281 --> 02:10:28.149]  You know, what's been pretty amazing to me is the hysteria that has swept not just the liberal media, but I think most of the mainstream media.
[02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:36.075]  What I noticed over the course of this election is that we really, and this isn't just a talking point, we really don't have real journalists anymore.
[02:10:36.075 --> 02:10:41.320]  We have activists in the media that think that their responsibility was to destroy Donald Trump.
[02:10:43.141 --> 02:10:43.301]  What's
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.902]  I think that what they're doing is they're playing with fire.
[02:11:08.902 --> 02:11:17.526]  My concern is when you look at footage in the aftermath of the election of liberal supporters of Hillary Clinton, they didn't take this election very well.
[02:11:17.526 --> 02:11:24.870]  And it's because they've been told for months now that the guy that won, Donald Trump, is quote-unquote literally Hitler.
[02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:46.817]  And so when you saw people at the Jacob Javits Center, which is really close to where I am right now, where Hillary is supposed to have her big, you know, break-in-the-glass-ceiling party on election night, you saw liberals literally crawling around the floor crying, rolling around, you know, sobbing like their dear leader had just passed away.
[02:11:46.817 --> 02:11:49.198]  This isn't a mature reaction to have
[02:11:50.038 --> 02:11:51.919]  To the loss of your candidate.
[02:11:51.919 --> 02:11:53.580]  But yet, that's what we've seen.
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:57.321]  And I hold the media actually directly responsible for that.
[02:11:57.321 --> 02:12:02.944]  They've done everything in their power to undermine his candidacy and now his presidency.
[02:12:02.944 --> 02:12:07.165]  They're pushing conspiracy theory with unsubstantiated claims of Russian hacking.
[02:12:07.165 --> 02:12:12.367]  They even pushed unsubstantiated claims of the Russians in WikiLeaks modifying emails.
[02:12:12.367 --> 02:12:14.408]  That's been debunked as well.
[02:12:14.408 --> 02:12:16.749]  We're dealing in a... Wow, sorry about that.
[02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:28.917]  We're dealing in, I think, a pretty unprecedented period of the devolution of the media here in the West.
[02:12:28.917 --> 02:12:41.365]  And I thought that Sean Hannity's point about there not being a free and fair media in this country is absolutely true.
[02:12:41.365 --> 02:12:42.845]  And it didn't happen overnight.
[02:12:42.845 --> 02:12:44.967]  It's happened over the course of several decades.
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:49.381]  And again, I mean, we have to blame the media for this, right?
[02:12:49.381 --> 02:12:54.802]  The whole election cycle was about this violence occurring at Trump rallies.
[02:12:54.802 --> 02:13:05.145]  The media again and again blamed Trump, despite the fact now we know that was organized in part by the DNC, thanks to James O'Keefe and those revelations.
[02:13:05.145 --> 02:13:13.787]  But even so, it was obvious at the time that this was mobs of people going to Trump rallies, attacking Trump supporters, trying to shut down his events.
[02:13:14.807 --> 02:13:37.282]  What do you make of this new phenomenon which we've seen after the election, I guess it ties into the same what they've termed Trump Derangement Syndrome, of anti-Trump people across the board, almost a case every single day now, faking hate crimes, trying to blame them on Trump supporters when they were hoaxes staged by these very same individuals.
[02:13:37.282 --> 02:13:41.105]  Have you ever seen anything like this in the immediate aftermath of an election?
[02:13:42.202 --> 02:13:42.946]  I haven't.
[02:13:42.946 --> 02:13:45.198]  And like I said earlier, I think that they're playing with fire.
[02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:51.932]  The problem is, I believe that there are true hate crimes that happen every day.
[02:13:51.932 --> 02:14:02.299]  And so when they peddle this fiction, they undermine and they bring into question the validity of people that actually have encountered some of these crimes.
[02:14:02.299 --> 02:14:07.883]  And I can tell you that no single party has a monopoly on this kind of behavior.
[02:14:07.883 --> 02:14:10.124]  I'm sure that you've run into it frequently.
[02:14:10.124 --> 02:14:11.165]  I run into it all the time.
[02:14:11.165 --> 02:14:16.628]  I can't go to the coffee shop here in Manhattan without being accosted by some liberal fringe lunatic.
[02:14:17.989 --> 02:14:18.769]  Every day.
[02:14:18.769 --> 02:14:22.671]  I'll be at the dog park and I'll have to be harassed by some lunatic.
[02:14:22.671 --> 02:14:25.752]  So, no side has a monopoly on this.
[02:14:25.752 --> 02:14:40.458]  I do believe that there are real criticisms of people that are on the fringe of either political persuasion that go out of their way to engage in violence and rhetoric that I don't think is productive at all.
[02:14:40.458 --> 02:14:43.559]  But what the media has done is that they don't do their due diligence at all.
[02:14:44.159 --> 02:14:53.243]  They don't do what I think is responsible and what you'd expect of any journalistic organization of, you know, the pedigree of something like the New York Times.
[02:14:53.243 --> 02:14:55.044]  They just publish this fiction.
[02:14:55.044 --> 02:15:00.427]  And we saw this, you know, getting beyond just the, you know, the violence in the aftermath of the election.
[02:15:00.427 --> 02:15:09.731]  We saw this with the fake news story that the Washington Post pushed last week on, you know, alleged Russian hacking of a Vermont power grid.
[02:15:10.071 --> 02:15:13.936]  You know, it is really out of control at this point.
[02:15:13.936 --> 02:15:22.368]  And so what it does is it contributes to this error of, you know, people can't trust what they're hearing, which is a real problem.
[02:15:23.343 --> 02:15:29.386]  The democracy only works if we can trust the media, if we have a vibrant media.
[02:15:29.386 --> 02:15:34.910]  I think that's why something like InfoWars is really important, telling a different side of the story that's really under-reported.
[02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:41.173]  There are lots of other news organizations that I'm really encouraged by that are popping up and helping to balance this out.
[02:15:41.173 --> 02:15:47.717]  My concern is, though, that what we're seeing in the mainstream media is that for a long time they just had a liberal bent.
[02:15:48.357 --> 02:15:55.841]  What they have now instead is that they're willing to abdicate all of their journalistic responsibility to cover their own people responsibly.
[02:15:55.841 --> 02:15:59.623]  Somebody like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, who are not above criticism.
[02:15:59.623 --> 02:16:01.584]  And so it's not just the liberal bent anymore.
[02:16:01.584 --> 02:16:03.485]  They're willing to fabricate stories.
[02:16:03.485 --> 02:16:07.067]  They're willing to peddle conspiracy theory that's totally unsubstantiated.
[02:16:07.067 --> 02:16:15.111]  They're willing to parrot the line that comes out of the federal government, you know, with like this Russian hacking story, with zero homework.
[02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:18.853]  They've done zero homework on many of these stories.
[02:16:18.853 --> 02:16:19.553]  So it's dangerous.
[02:16:19.553 --> 02:16:21.254]  This is a dangerous time.
[02:16:21.254 --> 02:16:23.695]  And this democracy is not going to work.
[02:16:23.695 --> 02:16:25.937]  Many of the democracies across this planet are not going to work.
[02:16:25.937 --> 02:16:31.040]  The UK, for instance, if we do not have a return to real journalistic practices in this country.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:31.580]  It's not a joke.
[02:16:33.084 --> 02:16:34.105]  That's just amazing.
[02:16:34.105 --> 02:16:40.914]  I mean, the mainstream media gave birth to fake news in the first place by being completely dishonest and deceptive.
[02:16:40.914 --> 02:16:52.268]  I mean, there wouldn't be a market, there wouldn't be a thirst for alternative news if the mainstream media actually went back to its muckraking heritage and actually acted like the Fourth Estate should act.
[02:16:52.828 --> 02:16:56.169]  I mean, I would say that, you know, I noticed these fake news websites.
[02:16:56.169 --> 02:16:59.390]  I don't think they were anywhere near as prominent as they're trying to claim.
[02:16:59.390 --> 02:17:10.592]  In fact, I think it was Daily Caller did a story where they pointed out that the top, quote, fake news websites were listed 80, 90,000 to 100,000 on Alexa.
[02:17:10.592 --> 02:17:12.753]  So they didn't even get that much traffic.
[02:17:12.753 --> 02:17:14.353]  Obviously, it's hyperbole.
[02:17:14.353 --> 02:17:16.734]  It's been completely over-exaggerated.
[02:17:16.734 --> 02:17:18.914]  But again, they gave birth to it in the first place.
[02:17:18.914 --> 02:17:20.395]  Quickly, though, I wanted to ask you about
[02:17:21.255 --> 02:17:28.642]  Seth Rich, because again in that interview with Sean Hannity, Julian Assange alluded to who his source might be.
[02:17:28.642 --> 02:17:32.285]  He talked about possibly someone within the DNC.
[02:17:32.285 --> 02:17:36.449]  I know that this was something you were tracking back at the start of it.
[02:17:36.449 --> 02:17:45.958]  The DNC, or the Democratic Party, they hired an individual to sort of become the spokesperson for the family of Seth Rich after he died.
[02:17:47.299 --> 02:17:49.521]  Immediate public statement.
[02:17:49.521 --> 02:17:58.871]  His first statement was to completely disavow any suggestion that the murder of Seth Rich, which remains unsolved, had anything to do with the DNC leaks.
[02:17:58.871 --> 02:18:02.494]  Do you think that was quite strange when you heard that at the time?
[02:18:03.610 --> 02:18:05.411]  I do.
[02:18:05.411 --> 02:18:11.655]  I've heard many rumors, I've heard lots of whispers, even within Democratic circles about this.
[02:18:11.655 --> 02:18:14.197]  And to be honest with you, I don't know what to believe anymore.
[02:18:14.197 --> 02:18:18.980]  I do think that the response of the Democratic National Committee in the aftermath of this has been very strange.
[02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:23.283]  I think that the family has asked for answers and they're not getting them.
[02:18:23.283 --> 02:18:28.267]  And I think the circumstances of this were very suspicious.
[02:18:28.267 --> 02:18:32.950]  Julian Assange has indicated that somebody like Seth Rich could have been
[02:18:33.892 --> 02:18:38.029]  You know part of the DNC link, not the pedestal link, but the DNC link and so I
[02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:47.497]  Getting back to the media, because it relates to this, I don't think any theory is above consideration.
[02:18:47.497 --> 02:18:58.146]  And what really made me question this story is when certain people started asking, you know, does this story have some legitimacy?
[02:18:58.146 --> 02:19:02.090]  The effort was to immediately shut down that conversation.
[02:19:02.090 --> 02:19:04.572]  And that concerns me, particularly because
[02:19:05.753 --> 02:19:10.998]  Everything pointed to this guy's death was very suspicious.
[02:19:10.998 --> 02:19:18.244]  We know that he was shot, that he still had his wallet on him, he still had all of his valuables on him.
[02:19:18.244 --> 02:19:24.849]  If this was your, you know, run-of-the-mill robbery that went wrong, that wouldn't have been the case.
[02:19:24.849 --> 02:19:27.331]  And so it does seem suspicious.
[02:19:27.331 --> 02:19:28.992]  Now maybe, maybe there's nothing there.
[02:19:29.733 --> 02:19:34.416]  But it's not above consideration.
[02:19:34.416 --> 02:19:43.543]  And I can tell you from first-hand experience, as I said previously, there are people that looked at this from day one and they said, something doesn't smell right here.
[02:19:43.543 --> 02:19:49.046]  Okay, Harlan Hill will be back with the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:49.046 --> 02:19:52.108]  We're going to talk about Obama's final days in office.
[02:19:52.108 --> 02:19:53.129]  We will be back.
[02:19:53.129 --> 02:19:54.630]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:20:01.522 --> 02:20:05.405]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[02:20:05.405 --> 02:20:12.049]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-years survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[02:20:12.049 --> 02:20:20.435]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[02:20:20.435 --> 02:20:25.539]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[02:20:25.899 --> 02:20:32.203]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[02:20:32.203 --> 02:20:38.347]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food, rated for 25 years of storage.
[02:20:38.347 --> 02:20:46.213]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.
[02:20:46.713 --> 02:20:49.055]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free.

[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:08.322]  Remember the market drops of 2002, the financial crisis of 2008, the flash crash of 2010?
[02:22:08.322 --> 02:22:10.062]  It's not if, but when.
[02:22:10.062 --> 02:22:12.583]  What do you have in place to protect your profits?

[02:23:00.558 --> 02:23:01.379]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:23:01.379 --> 02:23:03.160]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:04.821]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:23:04.821 --> 02:23:07.643]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:23:07.643 --> 02:23:09.944]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[02:23:29.673 --> 02:23:32.395]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[02:23:32.395 --> 02:23:38.300]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:42.983]  But now, One Planet Nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[02:24:13.493 --> 02:24:16.975]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show with Harlan Hill.
[02:24:16.975 --> 02:24:19.676]  Website is harlanhill.com.
[02:24:19.676 --> 02:24:29.521]  Harlan, just wrapping up here, I noticed in the past few days we've had a narrative that's almost equally as bizarre and unfounded as the Russian hacking narrative.
[02:24:29.521 --> 02:24:37.545]  This claim made by some in the media attempting to characterize Obama's legacy as, quote, scandal-free.
[02:24:37.545 --> 02:24:38.986]  What's your response to that claim?
[02:24:41.135 --> 02:24:42.295]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:24:42.295 --> 02:24:49.378]  I mean, we had everything from, you know, Fast and Furious, where we were literally arming the cartel, okay?
[02:24:49.378 --> 02:24:56.060]  And what was even worse than that was that the Obama administration was engaged in a cover-up of it.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:01.541]  You know, the Attorney General at the time refused to speak to Congress on the issue.
[02:25:01.541 --> 02:25:06.202]  Obama invoked executive privilege to avoid answering questions about that.
[02:25:06.202 --> 02:25:19.884]  So, you know, then moving on to the Iran deal, that was a total disaster that led to, you know, a multi-billion dollar ransom and the release of enormous funds to the Iranians.
[02:25:19.884 --> 02:25:22.405]  You know, to Hillary Clinton's email scandal.
[02:25:22.645 --> 02:25:31.130]  Don't forget that when she was using this private server, she was in the employ of Barack Obama as the Secretary of State.
[02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:34.892]  So, it's just laughable.
[02:25:34.892 --> 02:25:40.615]  It's laughable for the Obama administration to make the claim that, you know, they've been scandal-free.
[02:25:40.615 --> 02:25:44.397]  They've had literally dozens of scandals.
[02:25:44.397 --> 02:25:49.580]  In many ways, they're probably one of the more scandal-plagued administrations in the last century.
[02:25:50.661 --> 02:25:52.682]  But, you know, everything's rosy.
[02:25:52.682 --> 02:25:55.104]  That's what we're told to believe with Barack Obama.
[02:25:55.104 --> 02:25:58.147]  And the media never really pushes back on it.
[02:25:58.147 --> 02:26:00.289]  So he can get away with making that claim.
[02:26:00.289 --> 02:26:03.472]  And he's engaged in revisionist history.
[02:26:03.472 --> 02:26:11.819]  And he's trying to cater to what his long-term legacy is going to be.
[02:26:13.473 --> 02:26:17.314]  I guess it's part of the process of delegitimizing Trump, right?
[02:26:17.314 --> 02:26:28.818]  They need to uphold Obama as this Christ-like saintly figure to then put him up against Trump, who is the devil incarnate, before he's even took office, right?
[02:26:29.418 --> 02:26:44.004]  If you Google Obama and Jesus, or Obama and Halo, you will see so many photos that were taken by actual, like, photographic journalists at events, and they try to get him... Yeah, there you go!
[02:26:44.004 --> 02:26:45.224]  I mean, isn't this... Look at that!
[02:26:45.224 --> 02:26:47.365]  That is insane!
[02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:48.286]  That is insane!
[02:26:48.286 --> 02:26:51.487]  That is... That can't be a coincidence, the amount of times I've seen that.
[02:26:51.847 --> 02:26:53.148]  Oh my God!
[02:26:53.148 --> 02:26:56.029]  And if you look at Newsweek, they're probably one of the biggest offenders of this.
[02:26:56.029 --> 02:27:00.250]  I mean, they make all kinds of comparisons to, you know, Jesus.
[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:03.391]  They called his re-election the second coming.
[02:27:03.391 --> 02:27:06.333]  You know, I mean, just get over yourselves.
[02:27:06.333 --> 02:27:09.414]  How can you look at this and believe what these people are pushing?
[02:27:10.634 --> 02:27:12.496]  And this is what I was saying previously.
[02:27:12.496 --> 02:27:14.817]  This is not good for anybody.
[02:27:14.817 --> 02:27:19.361]  I'm not happy to say this because we need a vibrant media now.
[02:27:19.361 --> 02:27:23.123]  We need a vibrant media to hold Trump accountable.
[02:27:23.123 --> 02:27:24.424]  I mean, he's not going to be perfect.
[02:27:24.424 --> 02:27:25.105]  I voted for him.
[02:27:25.105 --> 02:27:28.427]  I supported him, but we need to hold his feet to the fire too.
[02:27:32.011 --> 02:27:33.792]  You know, what can you say at this point?
[02:27:33.792 --> 02:27:34.372]  What can you say?
[02:27:34.372 --> 02:27:45.976]  I mean, but now I'm caught in kind of a weird spot because I feel like I have to over-defend Trump sometimes because the media onslaught is just endless.
[02:27:45.976 --> 02:27:46.556]  Is endless.
[02:27:48.959 --> 02:27:53.300]  You've got the New York Times with an opinion piece comparing Trump to a crackhead.
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:55.181]  I mean, that's just out yesterday.
[02:27:55.181 --> 02:28:00.902]  Can you imagine them saying that about Obama just two weeks out before he took office back in 2008?
[02:28:00.902 --> 02:28:02.103]  It's amazing.
[02:28:02.103 --> 02:28:08.684]  We've run out of time, Holland, but just tell people how they can find your content, how they can follow you on Twitter.
[02:28:08.684 --> 02:28:11.485]  Yeah, yeah, just at Harlan, H-A-R-L-A-N.
[02:28:11.485 --> 02:28:12.025]  Follow me there.
[02:28:12.025 --> 02:28:12.245]  Tweet me.
[02:28:13.427 --> 02:28:15.649]  And the website is HarlanHill.com.
[02:28:15.649 --> 02:28:16.770]  Harlan, thanks for joining us.
[02:28:16.770 --> 02:28:18.251]  Thanks for having me.
[02:28:18.251 --> 02:28:19.933]  Okay, there goes Harlan Hill.
[02:28:19.933 --> 02:28:23.516]  Be sure to check out his website and his other appearances.
[02:28:23.516 --> 02:28:34.265]  Again, he was somebody who founded Democrats for Trump after seeing Bernie Sanders get stabbed in the back at the DNC by Hillary Clinton's people.
[02:28:34.265 --> 02:28:37.007]  So, you know, he's not somebody who was a partisan
[02:28:38.088 --> 02:28:43.690]  Pro-Trump from the very beginning, but he saw what was happening with the political establishment and then came out for Trump.
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:47.491]  So be sure to check out his information at HarlanHill.com.
[02:28:47.491 --> 02:28:52.753]  Gonna come back after the break with more special reports from Alex Jones and more news...
[02:28:53.573 --> 02:28:58.839]  About the cultural enrichment of Europe, we covered the Cologne issue.
[02:28:58.839 --> 02:29:07.988]  They had a phalanx of police out there on New Year's Eve to stop the mass molestation of women, to stop a repeat of that that happened back last New Year's Eve.
[02:29:07.988 --> 02:29:14.134]  Of course, the police in Cologne were criticised for stopping women from being raped by the left.
[02:29:14.835 --> 02:29:25.386]  Because they, God forbid, profiled the hundreds of North African men that descended on the scene with, according to the police, intent to commit criminal behavior.
[02:29:25.386 --> 02:29:33.574]  God forbid they actually surrounded them, questioned them, arrested some of them, prevented women being raped.
[02:29:33.574 --> 02:29:37.158]  We can't have that because it's not politically correct.
[02:29:38.473 --> 02:29:41.957]  We're gonna come back with that news and more on the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:29:41.957 --> 02:29:44.460]  Alex Jones special reports coming up.
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:46.503]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:46.503 --> 02:29:50.668]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:50.668 --> 02:29:52.070]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:54.613]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.613 --> 02:29:57.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.539 --> 02:30:07.946]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge by targeting his family.
[02:30:07.946 --> 02:30:13.211]  During his interview with Sean Hannity, Assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played.
[02:30:13.211 --> 02:30:22.741]  But his family, including his young children under 10 years old, didn't sign up for that mission, suggesting powerful actors would take revenge by targeting his family.
[02:30:23.081 --> 02:30:30.867]  Assange once again reiterated that WikiLeaks' source for the DNC and John Podesta documents was not Russia or any state actor.
[02:30:30.867 --> 02:30:40.855]  Although he refused to name sources, Assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source for the DNC leaks.
[02:30:41.155 --> 02:30:45.597]  Rich was mysteriously murdered on July 10th in a case that remains unsolved.
[02:30:45.597 --> 02:30:51.379]  WikiLeaks subsequently offered $20,000 for information leading to the capture of his killer.
[02:30:51.379 --> 02:30:58.122]  Could Assange's concerns over what happened to Seth Rich be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family on the record?
[02:30:58.122 --> 02:30:59.823]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com
[02:31:01.132 --> 02:31:09.376]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[02:32:00.869 --> 02:32:06.311]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in the battle for freedom.
[02:32:06.311 --> 02:32:08.731]  And the information war is paramount.
[02:32:08.731 --> 02:32:19.934]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars.com and send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcast and download the free iPhone and Droid apps at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:32:20.274 --> 02:32:24.899]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.
[02:32:24.899 --> 02:32:28.843]  Sign up to get our email alerts at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:32:28.843 --> 02:32:33.608]  And finally, we have launched our new free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:32:33.608 --> 02:32:35.350]  You can download it on iPhone and Android.
[02:32:35.650 --> 02:32:36.130]  We're good to go.
[02:33:12.757 --> 02:33:18.401]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:18.401 --> 02:33:20.522]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.368 --> 02:33:41.614]  And when getting rid of Roger Ailes still didn't work for them, and their audience began to tank, half of Fox's main audience, regular audience, began to leave them.
[02:33:41.614 --> 02:33:44.276]  Their key demographics were cratering.
[02:33:44.276 --> 02:33:45.877]  The rats began to leave the sinking ship.
[02:33:45.877 --> 02:33:56.124]  So the attempt by Rupert Murdoch to force-feed Fox viewers basically this soft CNN-style garbage
[02:33:57.517 --> 02:33:59.437]  It just blew up in their face.
[02:33:59.437 --> 02:34:05.239]  It absolutely blew up in their face to be a softer version of basically CNN or even MSNBC.
[02:34:05.239 --> 02:34:13.281]  So this is just another example of the devastating victories that we're having and how delusional the entire power structure is and has been.
[02:34:13.281 --> 02:34:22.023]  And they have no idea that their own intelligence agencies and own groups around them have used the panopticon spy grids they put in place to control the public against them.
[02:34:22.023 --> 02:34:25.904]  So now they're saying a conservative woman is going to replace Megyn Kelly, who's pro-Trump.
[02:34:27.027 --> 02:34:28.897]  There you have it, just months ago they were on the verge of...
[02:34:30.114 --> 02:34:32.335]  Basically firing Hannity.
[02:34:32.335 --> 02:34:35.097]  They were absolutely threatening everyone.
[02:34:35.097 --> 02:34:35.837]  Now they're panicking.
[02:34:35.837 --> 02:34:43.501]  They're trying to get out of their contract to pay the rest of the 30 plus million of the 60 million they owe him to Roger Ailes, the star of Fox News.
[02:34:43.501 --> 02:34:45.522]  I mean, it is just a disastrous mess.
[02:34:45.522 --> 02:34:56.087]  But that little arrogant snot who went and for that $7 million signing bonus for the book, reportedly, according to my sources, which are size you get,
[02:34:57.848 --> 02:35:00.270]  Basically, I'm not going to even get into it.
[02:35:00.270 --> 02:35:03.732]  The point is, is that she thought she was going to win.
[02:35:03.732 --> 02:35:05.393]  She thought she was invincible.
[02:35:05.393 --> 02:35:12.657]  She thought that, oh, the power structure wants me to attack Trump, or the power structure wants me to destroy myself, you know, going after him.
[02:35:12.657 --> 02:35:15.039]  And because I'm the pretty young lady, everybody will buy it.
[02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:15.939]  Everybody saw through it.
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:19.121]  Eye switch.
[02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:23.604]  She was the girl next door before, but she really showed her true colors the eye switch.
[02:35:23.604 --> 02:35:30.708]  And so just total defeat by these delusionites and their delusional followers and to continue to break their will.
[02:35:30.708 --> 02:35:31.929]  They've been trying to break our will.
[02:35:31.929 --> 02:35:33.090]  We must break their will.
[02:35:34.361 --> 02:35:35.841]  So very, very exciting on that front.
[02:35:35.841 --> 02:35:39.002]  That's just all part of the collapse of their system.
[02:35:39.002 --> 02:35:43.264]  And as they've said during the campaign, trying to brand Trump with InfoWars.
[02:35:43.264 --> 02:35:45.384]  Trump's main shock troops were InfoWars.
[02:35:45.384 --> 02:35:46.785]  We're the Americana message.
[02:35:46.785 --> 02:35:51.006]  Our listeners are the core of the return of Americana and making America great again.
[02:35:52.529 --> 02:35:56.932]  And so they just helped brand us even more, thinking it would hurt Trump and the nationalist movement.
[02:35:56.932 --> 02:36:04.839]  It only helped us take over the entire conservative movement even more with true, classic American renaissance systems that aren't left or right.
[02:36:04.839 --> 02:36:06.460]  I mean, this is just beautiful.
[02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:10.623]  Their controlled paradigm is collapsing, and now real choices can come into the mix.
[02:36:10.623 --> 02:36:15.066]  That's why they're desperately going to even more primitive forms of brainwashing, but it's not working.
[02:36:15.066 --> 02:36:18.309]  It's only working on the most weak-minded people.
[02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:19.250]  We are breaking through.
[02:36:20.541 --> 02:36:30.275]  We're in a collapse level event for the enemy at this point.
[02:36:30.275 --> 02:36:33.199]  What we have is exponentially invading.
[02:36:33.199 --> 02:36:36.404]  We have globalists at the top that have used class warfare to control people.
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:44.544]  And then really all they do is make them feel worthless and disempowered and basically just zombies to the system.
[02:36:44.544 --> 02:36:55.109]  Frightened followers who then only tie in and buy into the larger superstructure that's destroying them because they believe they get power and solace by merging with that.
[02:36:55.109 --> 02:36:59.111]  And one of the most clear-cut examples of this is the last eight years.
[02:36:59.111 --> 02:37:03.574]  The Tea Party that was started by Ron Paul and the Liberty Movement, myself and the listeners of this broadcast,
[02:37:04.983 --> 02:37:07.924]  I did get partially co-opted by the Republican Party.
[02:37:07.924 --> 02:37:16.185]  But then the left all came in and just branded it as completely racist, completely evil, and so that no one of any color was welcome at those.
[02:37:16.185 --> 02:37:30.727]  Because they don't want minorities who are the majority to have this birthright and this freedom and be able to, you know, continue in the steps of prosperity with low taxes, the right to self-defense, property rights, things like that.
[02:37:30.727 --> 02:37:31.808]  It was a stroke of genius.
[02:37:31.808 --> 02:37:33.588]  The last six, seven years they were able
[02:37:34.893 --> 02:37:42.339]  To really brand it as if it was something bad and so minorities felt like they felt like they couldn't be part of that.
[02:37:42.339 --> 02:37:45.402]  And now they've just expanded.
[02:37:45.402 --> 02:37:50.146]  But Trump began the last two years to break that and we've seen 30-40% of the people at rallies being minorities.
[02:37:51.027 --> 02:37:55.011]  At our own rallies, which is like half in Cleveland.
[02:37:55.011 --> 02:37:56.493]  And that's what really shook up.
[02:37:56.493 --> 02:37:59.537]  I was watching the Mother Jones riders, other people that were there.
[02:37:59.537 --> 02:38:04.263]  They were really shook up and they were looking at the crowd and it was frightening the elite.
[02:38:04.263 --> 02:38:05.565]  It was really frightening the establishment.
[02:38:06.668 --> 02:38:20.498]  So now, while they're capitulating to the Trump victory of populism on the surface, all over the world they're going into overdrive branding any type of populism by people that aren't blonde-haired, blue-eyed as racist.
[02:38:20.498 --> 02:38:35.588]  And I, on the newsstand before I got on this plane, I'm sitting there about to take off, so I gotta hurry, bought a Mother Jones, Ford Foundation propaganda piece, and of course the Council on Foreign Relations slash Davos group, Economist propaganda, and literally,
[02:38:36.810 --> 02:38:37.210]  Literally.
[02:38:37.210 --> 02:38:39.111]  This is what the pseudo-intellectuals read.
[02:38:39.111 --> 02:38:55.838]  The entire thing, on almost every page, shows blonde-haired, blue-eyed people in real photos, but also in editorial cartoons, saying blonde-haired, blue-eyed people are bad, putting KKK hats on them, and then saying, if someone looks like this, then they're your enemy.
[02:38:57.574 --> 02:39:04.018]  And these are publications that mainly go to the white intelligentsia, so they can go out now and henpeck everyone into this submission.
[02:39:04.018 --> 02:39:05.979]  This is just two things I got off the newsstand.
[02:39:05.979 --> 02:39:09.561]  I mean, this is the most cultic brainwashing I've ever seen.
[02:39:09.561 --> 02:39:12.403]  Clear-cut, cold-blooded, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:39:12.403 --> 02:39:13.603]  But it's so transparent.
[02:39:13.603 --> 02:39:17.265]  If we just call it, it will collapse, and that's what's begun to happen.
[02:39:17.265 --> 02:39:20.187]  That's why they stole those five states from Trump.
[02:39:20.187 --> 02:39:24.750]  And they tried to sell another five, because the numbers were, minorities were even bigger in landslides for him.
[02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:27.297]  That's what we saw in the primary.
[02:39:27.297 --> 02:39:28.458]  So they're very, very scared.
[02:39:28.458 --> 02:39:30.179]  Their whole paradigm is shattering.
[02:39:30.179 --> 02:39:33.002]  They're trying to invoke all this, but our real...
[02:39:35.419 --> 02:39:37.800]  Our real gang we're in is the free market.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:39.501]  That's what unifies us.
[02:39:39.501 --> 02:39:41.762]  And Western civilization.
[02:39:41.762 --> 02:39:42.943]  And it's like Gran Torino.
[02:39:42.943 --> 02:39:46.065]  You know, it's a fictional account, but you know, the guy didn't like his spoiled family.
[02:39:46.065 --> 02:39:46.685]  He's a white guy.
[02:39:46.685 --> 02:39:49.947]  It's a sign of declining white culture, which is the truth.
[02:39:49.947 --> 02:39:58.851]  Western culture's in massive decline and he tries, he gives the love of his life, the Gran Torino, to the kid that made something of himself in the neighborhood.
[02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:01.553]  And that's not some affirmative action bull in the movie.
[02:40:01.553 --> 02:40:02.293]  It's like real.
[02:40:02.293 --> 02:40:03.494]  That's how it really works, folks.
[02:40:04.176 --> 02:40:08.514]  So they want to steal that birthright from everybody who's hard-working in a big part of America.
[02:40:09.719 --> 02:40:11.320]  Telling you, you don't get to be part of it.
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:13.682]  Telling you, you're in their gang, you're under their control.
[02:40:13.682 --> 02:40:15.784]  Because you're a victim and they're going to take care of you.
[02:40:15.784 --> 02:40:16.785]  And they know how to run your life.
[02:40:16.785 --> 02:40:19.507]  They're going to tell you how to talk and they're going to tell you what to do.
[02:40:19.507 --> 02:40:26.933]  So again, this is total desperation by the most scientific, cold-blooded psychological warfare divisions of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:40:26.933 --> 02:40:31.076]  But most of the CIA is awake to this and now breaking with the whole deal.
[02:40:31.076 --> 02:40:34.499]  One other part of the psychological warfare of who they're targeting with these publications.
[02:40:36.104 --> 02:40:38.887]  Is a lot of people that read these aren't actual controller level.
[02:40:38.887 --> 02:40:42.250]  They don't understand the paradigm of the alien dialectic.
[02:40:42.250 --> 02:40:48.135]  But clearly, they're inflicting a guilt complex in the publications of anyone who is white or has blonde hair.
[02:40:48.135 --> 02:40:56.022]  You notice they also have photos of women with blonde hair and blue eyes, but in the ads, who are activists and then they're the good person.
[02:40:56.602 --> 02:41:01.523]  So it shows them we're good, and it shows the corporations they're backing, and then it shows everyone else that's bad.
[02:41:01.523 --> 02:41:04.564]  So that you think, oh my God, I have this guilt, I need to submit to this.
[02:41:04.564 --> 02:41:09.045]  I know I'm stating the obvious here, but it's just, it's key that we know this, the public doesn't.
[02:41:09.045 --> 02:41:12.586]  And once they understand the trick, they get angry, and they break free of the programming.
[02:41:12.586 --> 02:41:17.967]  And then future programming only causes them to resist and entrench harder against the enemy.
[02:41:17.967 --> 02:41:20.968]  And then it opens up larger pathways for the mind to begin to resist.
[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:26.616]  And over to come and adapt in the animated contest instead of submitting to it.
[02:41:26.616 --> 02:41:28.398]  That's why the public looks like zombies.
[02:41:28.398 --> 02:41:30.581]  Because subconsciously they know they've been beaten into submission.
[02:41:30.581 --> 02:41:31.442]  It's time to break that.
[02:41:31.442 --> 02:41:33.265]  So I'm going to follow this report.
[02:41:33.265 --> 02:41:34.386]  I'm going to follow more.
[02:41:34.386 --> 02:41:36.069]  I'm Alex Jones for Frontline's The Info War.
[02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:37.430]  I think so.
[02:42:11.676 --> 02:42:15.920]  There is Alex Jones and switching back into the news now here.
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:24.507]  This is out of RT and it's gonna be the preface for a audio clip we got coming up, a special report on comments made by John Kerry.
[02:42:24.507 --> 02:42:30.491]  But we have RT reporting right now, US coalition spared ISIS oil production facilities in Syria.
[02:42:31.232 --> 02:42:37.235]  The U.S.-led international coalition did not bomb oil production facilities captured by Islamic State.
[02:42:37.235 --> 02:42:45.020]  This is the charge made by Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashevkov.
[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:57.567]  He says, miraculously, only oil fields captured by ISIS, allowing the militants to earn tens of millions of dollars a month on illegal oil sales and recruit mercenaries from all over the world, did not come under U.S.
[02:42:57.567 --> 02:42:58.387]  bombardment.
[02:42:58.387 --> 02:42:59.828]  And we had the story before.
[02:43:00.288 --> 02:43:02.513]  They had the chance to bomb the oil fields.
[02:43:02.513 --> 02:43:09.265]  The Obama administration refused to do so, claiming they were concerned about the environmental impact.
[02:43:09.265 --> 02:43:10.688]  They drop leaflets.
[02:43:11.909 --> 02:43:21.132]  Before they bomb ISIS convoys, warning ISIS terrorists to leave the region so they can escape the falling bombs.
[02:43:21.132 --> 02:43:24.213]  And that relates to this special report about John Kerry.
[02:43:24.213 --> 02:43:30.015]  We know from the very beginning they saw the rise of ISIS, this jihadist principality.
[02:43:30.655 --> 02:43:36.119]  As something to be encouraged, something that would lead to the overthrow of Assad in Syria.
[02:43:36.119 --> 02:43:37.440]  They armed ISIS.
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:45.187]  They knew the so-called moderate rebel groups they were arming were defecting to ISIS, were handing their weapons over to ISIS.
[02:43:45.187 --> 02:43:53.453]  And now we have this amazing leaked audio from John Kerry that highlights exactly the agenda from the very beginning.
[02:43:53.453 --> 02:43:54.194]  Here's that report.
[02:43:55.430 --> 02:43:55.670]  U.S.
[02:43:55.670 --> 02:44:02.593]  counterterrorism officials asking why are ISIS fighters driving so many similar trucks and where are they getting them from?
[02:44:02.593 --> 02:44:07.456]  Hillary Clinton has described already the meeting in the White House over two years ago.
[02:44:07.456 --> 02:44:12.178]  Everyone in the national security team recommended arming ISIS.
[02:44:12.178 --> 02:44:18.641]  You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis and you were arguing against it.
[02:44:18.641 --> 02:44:20.602]  But who wasn't listening?
[02:44:20.602 --> 02:44:22.783]  I think the administration.
[02:44:22.783 --> 02:44:24.484]  But what we're trying to do is help.
[02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:34.302]  We've been spending a lot of money, a lot of effort to try to help do this.
[02:44:34.302 --> 02:44:37.005]  So, there's an opposition there.
[02:44:37.005 --> 02:44:39.308]  The opposition is doing very well.
[02:44:39.308 --> 02:44:42.132]  And if they're not serious, then we will help the opposition more.
[02:44:43.294 --> 02:44:51.363]  Intelligence officials in Pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist network Islamic State has admitted receiving funds transferred via the U.S.
[02:44:51.363 --> 02:44:53.705]  He made the confession while being interrogated.
[02:44:53.705 --> 02:45:00.553]  Today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[02:45:00.953 --> 02:45:02.695]  I don't think it was a willful decision.
[02:45:02.695 --> 02:45:06.140]  A willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:08.783]  Right, a willful decision to do what they're doing.
[02:45:08.783 --> 02:45:14.110]  Which you have to really ask the President, what is it that he actually is doing?
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:22.806]  As I said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly, but the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.
[02:45:22.806 --> 02:45:30.892]  So with the additional steps I ordered last month, we're speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar province.
[02:45:31.312 --> 02:45:31.512]  U.S.
[02:45:31.512 --> 02:45:36.674]  military aircraft have dropped ammunition in areas held by ISIL terror group in Iraq.
[02:45:36.674 --> 02:45:44.616]  According to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists, American helicopters dropped boxes of weapons in Yathrib and Balad districts in the Salahuddin province.
[02:45:44.616 --> 02:45:54.739]  In the last eight years, Obama completely sold us out to the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians and others, and launched a program all over the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, Far Asia, you name it.
[02:45:55.279 --> 02:46:00.102]  To put radical jihadis funded by Saudi Arabia as well as NATO in charge.
[02:46:00.102 --> 02:46:01.503]  It's now been leaked.
[02:46:01.503 --> 02:46:03.445]  Even the New York Times is having a report on it.
[02:46:03.445 --> 02:46:06.226]  Obama wanted ISIS to grow, leaked audio.
[02:46:06.226 --> 02:46:09.148]  And that's addressing the Syrian opposition.
[02:46:09.148 --> 02:46:12.431]  So that's just an example of what we're talking about.
[02:46:12.431 --> 02:46:16.693]  We saw that Daesh was growing in strength.
[02:46:16.693 --> 02:46:21.296]  And we thought Assad was ready.
[02:46:21.296 --> 02:46:23.298]  We thought, however, we could probably
[02:46:24.387 --> 02:46:36.373]  Now, the public didn't know what was going on, but our military did.
[02:46:36.373 --> 02:46:39.134]  They began five years ago, and Sy Hersh has now broken this.
[02:46:39.134 --> 02:46:41.696]  Last year, we first broke it, but he confirmed it all.
[02:46:41.696 --> 02:46:45.478]  We had the direct sources from NATO, from the CIA.
[02:46:45.478 --> 02:46:48.119]  I mean, from low level and high level, we had it from every angle.
[02:46:48.459 --> 02:46:50.501]  When you cross them, he's going to fight you to the end.
[02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:51.902]  It's a war to the end.
[02:46:51.902 --> 02:46:53.864]  He's fighting ISIS.
[02:46:53.864 --> 02:46:54.945]  He's fighting al-Qaeda.
[02:46:54.945 --> 02:46:56.307]  He's fighting al-Nusra.
[02:46:56.307 --> 02:46:58.088]  These are people that hang in garages.
[02:46:58.088 --> 02:46:59.810]  Some of the horrible stuff that happens.
[02:46:59.810 --> 02:47:04.174]  He's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people.
[02:47:04.174 --> 02:47:05.816]  So, our Joint Chiefs
[02:47:06.679 --> 02:47:07.720]  We're good to go.
[02:47:27.775 --> 02:47:40.552]  Some of the groups we advocate as moderate have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government, no Christians or Alawites at the minority sect, Shia sect at Bashar Assad, and about 12% of the
[02:47:42.034 --> 02:47:42.494]  We're good to go.
[02:47:58.426 --> 02:48:07.396]  A lot of arms from Libya into Turkey, and from Turkey, the gentleman running Turkey, Erdogan, is a total, complete supporter of ISIS.
[02:48:07.396 --> 02:48:10.079]  I don't think there's any question of that, even though we deny that.
[02:48:10.079 --> 02:48:11.860]  Our intelligence shows it.
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:15.804]  What I wrote about is the fact that two and a half years ago, the Joint Chiefs decided,
[02:48:16.733 --> 02:48:21.155]  They can't convince the White House and the State Department of Intelligence.
[02:48:21.155 --> 02:48:23.776]  They're just going to begin to do what they can do.
[02:48:23.776 --> 02:48:26.898]  So the Russians basically came into Syria because the U.S.
[02:48:26.898 --> 02:48:33.541]  military said, we're telling Obama if he doesn't back off, we're going to release the fact that we know they've been funding him, giving him missiles, you name it.
[02:48:33.541 --> 02:48:34.742]  Benghazi was the last straw.
[02:48:35.382 --> 02:48:37.243]  Russia said, OK, we're going to come in.
[02:48:37.243 --> 02:48:38.204]  Trump is right.
[02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:40.686]  Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS.
[02:48:40.686 --> 02:48:43.948]  They founded it because it's really Al Qaeda to confuse the name.
[02:48:43.948 --> 02:48:56.196]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[02:48:56.196 --> 02:48:58.918]  Obama as the leader of ISIS.
[02:48:58.918 --> 02:49:03.861]  ISIS is honoring President Obama.
[02:49:03.861 --> 02:49:04.922]  He is the founder.
[02:49:05.766 --> 02:49:08.369]  Of ISIS.
[02:49:08.369 --> 02:49:13.814]  And again, to re-emphasize the quote that was contained, that leaked audio of John Kerry, here's the quote.
[02:49:13.814 --> 02:49:15.616]  And we know that this was growing.
[02:49:15.616 --> 02:49:16.417]  We were watching.
[02:49:16.417 --> 02:49:21.322]  We saw that ISIS was growing in strength and we thought Assad was threatened.
[02:49:21.322 --> 02:49:26.227]  So they knew ISIS was growing in strength, but because it threatened Assad, they let it happen.
[02:49:26.227 --> 02:49:28.148]  Of course, we know they also gave them the weapons.
[02:49:28.789 --> 02:49:32.630]  He continued, we thought, however, we could probably manage that.
[02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:37.552]  Assad might then negotiate, but instead of negotiating, he got Putin to support him.
[02:49:37.552 --> 02:49:52.838]  So again, brazen admission that they knew ISIS was getting stronger and that that was beneficial because they were going to overthrow ISIS before, of course, Putin and Russia came along and absolutely obliterated ISIS.
[02:49:52.838 --> 02:49:57.680]  The one thing that the Obama administration admitted they had no plan to do.
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:57.960]  And again,
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:01.163]  Warned ISIS ahead of time before the bombings.
[02:50:01.163 --> 02:50:03.986]  Refused to bomb the oil tankers.
[02:50:03.986 --> 02:50:06.349]  Absolutely bombshell revelation.
[02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:09.012]  And of course, what all that led to was the migrant crisis.
[02:50:09.012 --> 02:50:11.355]  Now we have this story.
[02:50:11.355 --> 02:50:13.177]  This is out of Spita.
[02:50:13.177 --> 02:50:15.940]  Muslim migrants throw firecracker at baby.
[02:50:15.940 --> 02:50:16.802]  Well, what do you know?
[02:50:16.802 --> 02:50:17.883]  It's in Sweden!
[02:50:18.163 --> 02:50:24.804]  Immigrant gangs have put fear into the hearts of the infidels in residential areas northeast of Gavla in Sweden recently.
[02:50:24.804 --> 02:50:34.446]  The night before New Year's Eve, a group of mass youths threw a powerful firecracker known as a banger into a stroller where a three-month-old infant was sleeping.
[02:50:34.446 --> 02:50:41.648]  The father of the baby managed to get it out in time, but go watch the video we put up out of Sweden back a few days ago.
[02:50:42.208 --> 02:50:45.551]  Migrants lobbing firecrackers at each other.
[02:50:45.551 --> 02:50:48.474]  It is absolute bedlam in Sweden.
[02:50:48.474 --> 02:50:51.937]  This cultural enrichment is ruining the country.
[02:50:51.937 --> 02:50:55.080]  It's gonna ruin many others if we don't put a stop to it.
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:58.503]  We're gonna be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:58.503 --> 02:50:59.524]  Stay right there, we'll be back.
[02:51:01.371 --> 02:51:02.492]  Attention, citizens.
[02:51:02.492 --> 02:51:08.395]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[02:51:08.395 --> 02:51:17.561]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.

[02:51:34.050 --> 02:51:37.791]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:51:37.791 --> 02:51:38.872]  Forget bonkers.
[02:51:38.872 --> 02:51:40.693]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:51:40.693 --> 02:51:42.413]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:55:33.833 --> 02:55:38.897]  But we can only do it with your support by getting the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:39.918 --> 02:55:41.900]  Let's hit a few final news stories.
[02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:43.661]  This is out of the Metro.
[02:55:43.661 --> 02:55:48.705]  Lily Allen hints at legal action against Tommy Robinson after Twitter row.
[02:55:48.705 --> 02:55:52.108]  Now, we got Tommy Robinson coming on the show tomorrow, by the way.
[02:55:52.108 --> 02:56:07.620]  Basically, Lily Allen, who is this massive virtue-signalling celebrity in the United Kingdom, constantly banging on about refugees and migrants, she lost an argument on Twitter with Tommy Robinson and then threatened to sue him.
[02:56:08.260 --> 02:56:12.101]  Threatened to take him to court because she lost an argument on Twitter.
[02:56:12.101 --> 02:56:15.683]  That's how the left does debate.
[02:56:15.683 --> 02:56:21.705]  Again, she claimed that because she hadn't been sexually abused by a migrant, that that meant
[02:56:23.064 --> 02:56:34.668]  Sexual assaults being committed by migrants weren't happening, which is kind of like saying, oh, you know, I've never had cancer, therefore cancer doesn't exist and cancer isn't a problem.
[02:56:34.668 --> 02:56:37.409]  Okay, that's not an argument.
[02:56:37.409 --> 02:56:44.451]  She then came out and, with the usual standard fair anti-white racism and said it's only white men that have ever sexually abused her,
[02:56:45.051 --> 02:56:49.394]  Tommy Robinson said, well, why haven't you reported that to the police?
[02:56:49.394 --> 02:56:50.795]  There's no record of it.
[02:56:50.795 --> 02:56:52.136]  She had no response.
[02:56:52.136 --> 02:56:53.436]  She lost the argument.
[02:56:53.436 --> 02:56:59.821]  She responded by threatening to sue him, saying that he will hear from her lawyers in the coming days.
[02:56:59.821 --> 02:57:02.542]  This is how the left does debate.
[02:57:02.542 --> 02:57:07.806]  They can't stand to lose, so again, they resort to government coercement, government action.
[02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:13.414]  UK reality game show star acts for saying all terrorists are Muslim.
[02:57:13.414 --> 02:57:15.636]  Again, she didn't say all Muslims are terrorists.
[02:57:15.636 --> 02:57:20.241]  She said that all terrorists are Muslim, which for the vast majority is a fact.
[02:57:21.081 --> 02:57:31.767]  And Islam isn't a race, so it's not racist, but she was axed from Celebrity Big Brother in the United Kingdom again as the Thought Police continue their aggressive patrols.
[02:57:31.767 --> 02:57:39.632]  Meanwhile, The Mirror reports Austrian police investigating a precedented number of sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Innsbruck.
[02:57:40.632 --> 02:57:45.414]  So again, we didn't have mass sexual assaults in Cologne because of the massive police presence.
[02:57:45.414 --> 02:57:46.474]  They prevented it.
[02:57:46.474 --> 02:57:57.258]  They were bad for preventing women from being raped because it wasn't politically correct to profile hundreds of North African Muslim migrants who had gathered at exactly the same spot.
[02:57:58.063 --> 02:58:04.551]  I mean, why on earth did they go to the same spot unless they expected the same thing to happen?
[02:58:04.551 --> 02:58:06.152]  It didn't happen, thankfully, in Cologne.
[02:58:06.152 --> 02:58:15.103]  It did in other cities, including Innsbruck, Austria, where police are investigating an unprecedented number of sexual assaults on New Year's Eve.
[02:58:16.184 --> 02:58:19.566]  So, it happened in Innsbruck, it's happening in other countries.
[02:58:19.566 --> 02:58:24.088]  Again, this is the cultural enrichment that the West is importing.
[02:58:24.088 --> 02:58:28.650]  Firecrackers being literally thrown into baby strollers.
[02:58:28.650 --> 02:58:32.592]  This is a problem, and speaking out against it isn't racist.
[02:58:32.592 --> 02:58:34.593]  It makes complete common sense.
[02:58:34.593 --> 02:58:37.235]  Fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show coming right up.
[02:58:37.235 --> 02:58:37.815]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:37.815 --> 02:58:41.857]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[02:58:41.857 --> 02:58:43.177]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.192 --> 02:58:51.156]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.156 --> 02:58:55.318]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:55.318 --> 02:59:02.783]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:59:02.783 --> 02:59:13.831]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:59:14.231 --> 02:59:22.053]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:59:22.053 --> 02:59:31.376]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:59:31.696 --> 02:59:36.138]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:36.138 --> 02:59:43.221]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:43.221 --> 02:59:44.662]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:44.662 --> 02:59:45.822]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:45.822 --> 02:59:48.603]  That's Infowarswife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:48.603 --> 02:59:53.626]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:53.626 --> 02:59:56.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.253 --> 03:00:14.235]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:14.235 --> 03:00:21.365]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.316 --> 03:00:29.217]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:00:29.217 --> 03:00:39.782]  I'm Roger Stone, back from a long sabbatical working on my book, and delighted to be sitting in today for Alex Jones.
[03:00:39.782 --> 03:00:52.428]  A lot of politics to talk about today, but before we go there, I reinstituted a tradition which on New Year's Day every year for the last 11 years,
[03:00:57.794 --> 03:01:00.896]  Dressed people on the face of the planet.
[03:01:00.896 --> 03:01:08.100]  We call this Mr. Stone's international best-in-dress list, and it's gotten very wide media coverage.
[03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:15.385]  I'm happy to say that right here at InfoWars, Owen Schroyer has made this year's list.
[03:01:15.385 --> 03:01:21.268]  He's got the whole spread collar, tight tie knot down perfectly.
[03:01:21.268 --> 03:01:25.151]  Now, there were others who made the list but did not fare as well.
[03:01:26.038 --> 03:01:29.819]  Michael Moore comes to mind.
[03:01:29.819 --> 03:01:33.700]  What can you say other than slob?
[03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:40.422]  Hillary Clinton, but then let's face it, she's not going to look good in anything other than an orange jumpsuit.
[03:01:40.422 --> 03:01:50.644]  And then of course you've got some emeritus members of this fraternity like Larry Kudlow, perhaps the best dressed man on television.
[03:01:50.644 --> 03:01:53.985]  So if you have not had the opportunity to check it out,
[03:01:55.025 --> 03:02:07.717]  You can find that folks like Cenk from the Young Turks who assaulted Alex and I last summer makes the worst dressed list.
[03:02:07.717 --> 03:02:12.321]  It's a moment of levity to start the new year.
[03:02:12.321 --> 03:02:13.522]  You'll find Lena Dunham,
[03:02:14.534 --> 03:02:16.536]  You guess which list she's on.
[03:02:16.536 --> 03:02:20.078]  You can also find Kimberly Guilfoyle at Fox.
[03:02:20.078 --> 03:02:23.401]  You can guess which list she's on.
[03:02:23.401 --> 03:02:26.684]  So, start looking for this every New Year's Eve.
[03:02:26.684 --> 03:02:29.386]  You can find it at StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:02:29.386 --> 03:02:35.891]  You can also find it at StoneOnStyle, where we keep track of these things.
[03:02:35.891 --> 03:02:39.594]  I want to say right up front, our lists are not ideological.
[03:02:40.373 --> 03:02:50.360]  We've had some liberals on the best list, and we've had some fine Americans like Ron Paul, who looks like he slept in his clothes, on the worst list.
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:56.925]  So this is a fashion statement, not an ideological statement.
[03:02:56.925 --> 03:03:01.289]  We have a lot of ground to cover because the
[03:03:02.415 --> 03:03:15.931]  Waning days of the Obama administration have featured this ongoing effort to try to undermine the legitimacy of President-elect Trump's ascendancy to the White House.
[03:03:17.869 --> 03:03:35.368]  Strangely enough, today, I believe Senator John McCain had to cancel his vaulted hearing in which he and his sidekick from South Carolina were going to reveal all this proof they have of Russian hacking of the election.
[03:03:36.462 --> 03:03:41.406]  I think the reason they scrubbed the hearing is because there is no proof.
[03:03:41.406 --> 03:03:44.949]  There has never been any proof.
[03:03:44.949 --> 03:03:52.395]  It's kind of interesting to me that the number one progenitor of this theory is CIA Director John Brennan.
[03:03:52.395 --> 03:04:03.003]  Brennan is a man who refused to be sworn in using the Bible, who has converted to Wahhabism, who has spent a substantial amount of time in that region.
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:11.003]  Who personally cleansed the passport files of Barack Obama when he was preparing to run for a second term.
[03:04:11.003 --> 03:04:17.206]  And quite frankly, if you believe my friend Wayne Madsen, and I do, is a mole.
[03:04:17.206 --> 03:04:20.027]  A Saudi mole.
[03:04:20.027 --> 03:04:28.931]  That is who is advocating and pushing the entire false narrative that the Russians have somehow hacked this election.
[03:04:30.020 --> 03:04:38.083]  It came back around last night when Sean Hannity was asked about this and we'll come to that in just a moment.
[03:04:38.083 --> 03:04:42.145]  We're going to put this whole Russian question to bed where it belongs.
[03:04:42.145 --> 03:04:43.806]  Thanks for joining us at InfoWars.
[03:05:01.095 --> 03:05:06.317]  The Huffington Post says Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
[03:05:06.317 --> 03:05:12.200]  And they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of Trump right now, before the inauguration.
[03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:25.585]  In an article titled, Impeaching Trump, The Process Begins Now, Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says President-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even Richard Nixon.
[03:05:25.585 --> 03:05:26.365]  Whoa!
[03:05:26.365 --> 03:05:30.227]  And he expects Trump will immediately break the law and violate
[03:05:30.447 --> 03:05:31.648]  The Constitution.
[03:05:31.648 --> 03:05:40.574]  Therefore, the Huffington Post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin the first day Trump steps into office.
[03:05:40.574 --> 03:05:51.181]  The idea is to keep daily records of Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance with Vladimir Putin.
[03:05:51.181 --> 03:05:56.584]  More desperation from the lunatics on the far left.
[03:05:56.584 --> 03:05:59.526]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:00.988 --> 03:06:08.857]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in the battle for freedom and the information war is paramount.
[03:06:08.857 --> 03:06:20.011]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars.com and send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcast and download the free iPhone and Android apps at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[03:06:25.017 --> 03:06:28.961]  Sign up to get our email alerts at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:06:28.961 --> 03:06:33.727]  And finally, we have launched our new free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:06:33.727 --> 03:06:35.469]  You can download it on iPhone and Android.
[03:06:35.469 --> 03:06:35.829]  Absolutely.
[03:06:35.829 --> 03:06:43.275]  Once you've downloaded the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app, you can then if you choose pay $4.95 a month to get InfoWars Prime.
[03:06:43.275 --> 03:06:50.621]  We produce documentaries, special reports, live events and so much more on a daily and weekly basis just for Prime members.
[03:06:50.621 --> 03:06:55.385]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much as 50% off for members of InfoWars Prime.
[03:06:55.385 --> 03:07:00.449]  InfoWars has come a long way and InfoWars Prime is just one more weapon in the fight for liberty.
[03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:07.271]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:07:07.271 --> 03:07:20.255]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:07:20.255 --> 03:07:23.916]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:07:23.916 --> 03:07:27.457]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[03:07:27.737 --> 03:07:31.299]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:07:31.299 --> 03:07:43.746]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:43.746 --> 03:07:45.287]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:51.990]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:56.912]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:11.174 --> 03:08:15.717]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:15.717 --> 03:08:19.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:46.328 --> 03:08:46.970]  Can I ask you this?
[03:08:46.970 --> 03:08:49.841]  Have you ever talked to Vladimir Putin?
[03:08:49.841 --> 03:08:50.784]  No.
[03:08:50.784 --> 03:08:52.671]  Have you ever talked to any of his surrogates?
[03:08:56.004 --> 03:08:56.904]  Any of his surrogates?
[03:08:56.904 --> 03:08:57.725]  No.
[03:08:57.725 --> 03:08:58.505]  Not one?
[03:08:58.505 --> 03:08:58.665]  No.
[03:08:58.665 --> 03:09:04.367]  There was some report that you might have talked to somebody who was not associated with the campaign, Roger Stone?
[03:09:04.367 --> 03:09:05.608]  No, that's false.
[03:09:05.608 --> 03:09:23.115]  I think where this Roger Stone claim is coming from is there's a radio guy on WBAI, which is a mutual friend, who wanted to come and see me to see if I would set up a radio show on WBAI, but he didn't.
[03:09:23.115 --> 03:09:24.996]  He did come to London, but he didn't meet with me.
[03:09:27.848 --> 03:09:31.831]  That is, of course, completely consistent with what I have said all along.
[03:09:31.831 --> 03:09:41.639]  I have never claimed to have met with Julian Assange, someone I admire very much, someone who I think is a freedom fighter.
[03:09:41.639 --> 03:09:53.267]  I did correctly say that we had a mutual acquaintance and that I had learned that Assange had unspecified political dynamite that he would release.
[03:09:54.108 --> 03:10:02.679]  That is not to say that I knew what Assange would deliver, when he would deliver it, where he got it, where it came from.
[03:10:02.679 --> 03:10:05.242]  I never made any such claims.
[03:10:05.242 --> 03:10:12.971]  Just for the historical record, my claim that Assange had unspecified political dynamite that would royal the race.
[03:10:13.905 --> 03:10:17.668]  Turned out to be exactly correct.
[03:10:17.668 --> 03:10:23.272]  We are going to be taking some of your calls today, because this is one of my favorite parts of the show.
[03:10:23.272 --> 03:10:24.313]  That number is 800-259-9231.
[03:10:24.313 --> 03:10:27.595]  We will move to calls here shortly.
[03:10:27.595 --> 03:10:32.339]  But I want to, once and for all, put to bed the so-called Russian canard.
[03:10:41.144 --> 03:10:48.411]  At about 11 o'clock last night, I got a phone call from a reporter with The Hill newspaper.
[03:10:48.411 --> 03:10:50.633]  It was as if this fellow was Rip Van Winkle.
[03:10:50.633 --> 03:10:52.795]  We were starting from the beginning.
[03:10:52.795 --> 03:11:02.484]  The Clinton people claim that you knew in advance about the hacking of John Podesta and that Assange was briefing you on what was to come.
[03:11:03.467 --> 03:11:05.088]  It was false then.
[03:11:05.088 --> 03:11:08.630]  It is false now.
[03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:10.811]  I have no Russian clients.
[03:11:10.811 --> 03:11:13.072]  I have no Russian influences.
[03:11:13.072 --> 03:11:15.533]  I have never been to Russia.
[03:11:15.533 --> 03:11:19.636]  I have never met with anyone from Russian intelligence.
[03:11:19.636 --> 03:11:22.317]  I have never met Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:22.317 --> 03:11:24.618]  But this is the new McCarthyism.
[03:11:24.618 --> 03:11:31.282]  If you're not for thermonuclear war over Syria, well then you must be a traitor to the United States.
[03:11:32.267 --> 03:11:34.348]  Let's move to some questions.
[03:11:34.348 --> 03:11:36.850]  Let's see, we have Dee in California.
[03:11:36.850 --> 03:11:39.972]  Dee, what's up?
[03:11:39.972 --> 03:11:41.213]  Yes, how are you doing?
[03:11:41.213 --> 03:11:49.939]  I wanted to first give some credit to Roger Stone and to Alex Jones for getting a lot of the info out.
[03:11:49.939 --> 03:11:52.320]  That is very important to the people.
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:56.263]  But I have a question that's concerning me and it's
[03:11:58.513 --> 03:12:04.118]  If everybody's supposed to be informed and try to work against this one world government,
[03:12:06.306 --> 03:12:10.607]  Is Alex Jones, Roger Stone, you guys concerned about that this might be prophecy?
[03:12:10.607 --> 03:12:13.368]  That these things are happening?
[03:12:13.368 --> 03:12:27.912]  And if things get so bad and we try to stand up or people try to stand up to fight against it, wouldn't that be going, would that be something that's not sanctioned by God because of the fact that this world is ruled by the devil?
[03:12:27.912 --> 03:12:32.893]  And if the prophecy is going to be, then it becomes a spiritual war, not a physical war.
[03:12:32.893 --> 03:12:35.454]  I'd like to get your take on that, Roger Stone.
[03:12:36.789 --> 03:12:38.010]  Sure.
[03:12:38.010 --> 03:12:43.575]  I don't believe that slavery is ever ordained by a greater God.
[03:12:43.575 --> 03:12:46.217]  In fact, it's just the opposite.
[03:12:46.217 --> 03:12:48.539]  We're put on Earth to fight for our freedom.
[03:12:50.757 --> 03:12:53.580]  Moses led his people out of servitude.
[03:12:53.580 --> 03:12:56.324]  That is the story of Christianity.
[03:12:56.324 --> 03:13:07.419]  So I think we're put here to fight, and the only un-Christian thing, the only ungodly thing is to buckling over to some totalitarian
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:15.767]  Power that would destroy our free speech, our free expression, our free association, and so on.
[03:13:15.767 --> 03:13:31.040]  This is, make no mistake about it, we're headed for a very long, hard struggle against the well-heeled forces of globalism who have, up until now, had a monopoly on control of information.
[03:13:31.874 --> 03:13:41.537]  Thank God, and thanks to InfoWars.com and Breitbart and Daily Caller and so many others, they no longer have a monopoly.
[03:13:41.537 --> 03:13:43.157]  We're now at the table.
[03:13:43.157 --> 03:13:45.818]  In fact, we may have a bigger audience than they do.
[03:13:45.818 --> 03:13:50.039]  So, the struggle must continue.
[03:13:50.039 --> 03:13:53.520]  Andrew in California wants to talk about war with Russia.
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:55.921]  Andrew, lay it on us.
[03:13:55.921 --> 03:13:58.481]  Hello?
[03:13:58.481 --> 03:14:00.842]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[03:14:01.823 --> 03:14:03.164]  How you doing, Mr. Stone?
[03:14:03.164 --> 03:14:09.167]  I first just wanted to say thank you for all the great work you do and everything you've been doing.
[03:14:09.167 --> 03:14:19.732]  I just wanted to see what you think about all the things going on with the last few days of Obama and his legacy.
[03:14:19.732 --> 03:14:29.918]  I'm just worried about them trying to start something with Russia, with all these fake allegations and whatnot.
[03:14:32.028 --> 03:14:41.931]  Well, I think it is kind of odd that for eight years the Russians have pushed Barack Obama around like a child.
[03:14:41.931 --> 03:14:43.871]  They moved on Crimea.
[03:14:43.871 --> 03:14:49.633]  They have perpetrated numerous acts against the United States.
[03:14:50.473 --> 03:14:52.634]  And Barack Obama's done nothing.
[03:14:52.634 --> 03:15:04.457]  Now, suddenly, with less than 20 days to go in his presidency, he's going to expel a bunch of Russians on the basis of no evidence of hacking?
[03:15:04.457 --> 03:15:05.857]  Please!
[03:15:05.857 --> 03:15:12.759]  It is so transparent that this is a last-ditch effort to create
[03:15:13.959 --> 03:15:18.483]  A reason not to have the next president sworn in.
[03:15:18.483 --> 03:15:30.274]  Some of our European allies who are perhaps not as sophisticated in the ways of Western politics are still wondering whether Trump will ever actually get to the point where he has his hand on the Bible.
[03:15:31.374 --> 03:15:49.261]  But because we are a nation of laws and not men, I am confident that Donald J. Trump will take office as scheduled and that we are going to then have an entirely new direction and a new fight over America's future.
[03:15:49.261 --> 03:15:56.484]  So, Barack Obama, in all honesty, too little, too late.
[03:15:56.484 --> 03:15:58.664]  Derek from Michigan.
[03:15:58.664 --> 03:15:59.685]  What's on your mind, Derek?
[03:16:01.229 --> 03:16:06.372]  How you doing, Mr. Stone?
[03:16:06.372 --> 03:16:07.613]  I'm doing great.
[03:16:07.613 --> 03:16:09.594]  What's your question for today?
[03:16:09.594 --> 03:16:19.020]  My question is, what do you think the next big roadblock is going to be for the president-elect in the next two weeks?
[03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:20.500]  I'm sure there's going to be another one.
[03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:21.401]  What do you predict?
[03:16:23.462 --> 03:16:28.124]  Well, it's rather hard to say once he gets the levers of power.
[03:16:28.124 --> 03:16:37.268]  I think it's also very important that, in my opinion, President-elect Trump could have as many as four appointments to the U.S.
[03:16:37.268 --> 03:16:39.349]  Supreme Court.
[03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:43.910]  Now, the first appointment, in my opinion, will be the most important.
[03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:52.314]  If you look at it from a historical point of view, First Franklin Roosevelt put one of his closest friends on the court.
[03:16:53.516 --> 03:16:59.499]  And then the other three jurists essentially became followers.
[03:16:59.499 --> 03:17:06.063]  In this particular case, I think Trump has a unique opportunity to rebuild the court.
[03:17:06.063 --> 03:17:09.625]  I'm not hoping that he appoints a right winger to the court.
[03:17:09.625 --> 03:17:13.127]  I'm hoping that he appoints a libertarian to the coin.
[03:17:13.127 --> 03:17:16.009]  That is my fondest wish.
[03:17:16.009 --> 03:17:20.071]  But I do think you're going to see action in that area in the next two weeks.
[03:17:20.071 --> 03:17:21.592]  And I can predict to you right now.
[03:17:22.455 --> 03:17:31.699]  The Liberals and the Democrats and Chuck Schumer are going to go out of their minds.
[03:17:31.699 --> 03:17:39.803]  Danny, you've got a question.
[03:17:39.803 --> 03:17:40.723]  Danny, we lose you?
[03:17:40.723 --> 03:17:46.406]  Appears to be the case.
[03:17:46.406 --> 03:17:49.367]  Let us move on then to Judy in Florida.
[03:17:49.367 --> 03:17:50.468]  Judy, what's on your mind?
[03:17:52.165 --> 03:17:54.145]  Hi Roger, it's nice to talk to you.
[03:17:54.145 --> 03:18:01.007]  I really appreciate what you've done with Trump's campaign and your friendship with Trump.
[03:18:01.007 --> 03:18:15.950]  And having said that, do you think there's going to be a very meaningful look at the, not just the felons, but Muslims in general, the infiltration of our country?
[03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:21.271]  I saw and listened to at a Patriot meeting last night in my state,
[03:18:22.037 --> 03:18:34.590]  A very powerful speaker who was raised in Egypt, and he's a Christian, a Baptist Christian, and he studied the Muslim faith and Sharia law.
[03:18:35.168 --> 03:18:36.029]  I don't think so.
[03:18:55.172 --> 03:18:59.913]  I do not think that there will be mass deportations, nor do I think it would be correct.
[03:18:59.913 --> 03:19:08.755]  What we do need is a complete house cleaning and an entirely new beginning among our intelligence services.
[03:19:08.755 --> 03:19:12.136]  We need a new FBI director who isn't in the tank.
[03:19:12.136 --> 03:19:15.676]  Somebody like Judge Jeanine Pirro, for example.
[03:19:15.676 --> 03:19:18.677]  We need a new CIA director who, unlike
[03:19:19.557 --> 03:19:35.080]  John Brennan, who I believe is a Saudi mole, but someone who is loyal to the United States and understands, as General Flynn does, for example, the inherent dangers of Islamic terrorism.
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:38.601]  That, I think, is the most important thing we need to focus on.
[03:19:38.601 --> 03:19:40.562]  It's been great to take your questions.
[03:19:40.562 --> 03:19:46.003]  Perhaps we'll grab a few more later on, but thanks for joining me here at InfoWars.
[03:20:01.348 --> 03:20:05.230]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[03:20:05.230 --> 03:20:11.892]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-years survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[03:20:11.892 --> 03:20:20.276]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[03:20:20.276 --> 03:20:25.378]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[03:20:25.738 --> 03:20:32.042]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[03:20:32.042 --> 03:20:38.186]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food, rated for 25 years of storage.
[03:20:38.186 --> 03:20:46.551]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.
[03:20:46.551 --> 03:20:49.552]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.
[03:20:49.552 --> 03:20:50.333]  Go to freefood2.com right now.
[03:20:53.715 --> 03:20:56.456]  Supplies are limited, and the program may end at any time.

[03:23:00.175 --> 03:23:02.896]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[03:23:02.896 --> 03:23:06.399]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:11.082]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:23:11.082 --> 03:23:16.524]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:23:16.524 --> 03:23:18.005]  How is this even possible?
[03:23:18.005 --> 03:23:25.548]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:23:25.548 --> 03:23:33.191]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:23:33.191 --> 03:23:36.393]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:23:36.673 --> 03:23:44.478]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:23:44.478 --> 03:23:47.660]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:51.823]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:23:51.823 --> 03:23:52.483]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:23:52.483 --> 03:23:52.884]  Greens75.com.
[03:24:12.979 --> 03:24:15.281]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:24:15.281 --> 03:24:23.086]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones, who's getting some well-deserved rest.
[03:24:23.086 --> 03:24:29.891]  On several occasions, I've had to point out to many of my friends that freedom isn't free.
[03:24:29.891 --> 03:24:35.135]  And this revolution that we're involved in needs your support.
[03:24:35.135 --> 03:24:40.199]  That's why I'm happy to mention the 2017 Making Our Bodies Great Initiative.
[03:24:41.092 --> 03:24:52.580]  Because now, for a short period of time only, some of the very most effective Infowars products, all natural products, are available at sale prices.
[03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:54.281]  Let me give you some examples.
[03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:59.485]  Brain Force, without which I could never have finished my recent manuscript of 125,000 words, 30% off.
[03:25:04.028 --> 03:25:07.672]  Super Mal Vitality, 30% off.
[03:25:07.672 --> 03:25:10.694]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[03:25:10.694 --> 03:25:13.737]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[03:25:13.737 --> 03:25:16.360]  Knockout, 20% off.
[03:25:16.360 --> 03:25:19.062]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[03:25:19.062 --> 03:25:22.325]  Now, these products actually work, folks.
[03:25:22.325 --> 03:25:26.589]  That's why they are so popular and why we have so many testimonials.
[03:25:27.550 --> 03:25:35.577]  Maybe I'm a stick in the mud, but I won't endorse products that I haven't myself experienced and determined that they have value.
[03:25:35.577 --> 03:25:37.679]  So this is a twofer.
[03:25:37.679 --> 03:25:41.683]  You can fuel the fight for freedom.
[03:25:41.683 --> 03:25:43.964]  You can keep Infowars free.
[03:25:45.413 --> 03:25:50.596]  And unpressured, and you can buy these outstanding products.
[03:25:50.596 --> 03:26:00.262]  So don't walk, run to the InfoWars.com store and load up because these deep discount prices are worth it.
[03:26:00.262 --> 03:26:06.185]  And with a blink of the eye, Brain Force, which I go through quite a bit of, will be back at its regular price.
[03:26:06.185 --> 03:26:09.087]  So don't miss the opportunity.
[03:26:09.087 --> 03:26:12.029]  I can't say enough about these fine products.
[03:26:13.939 --> 03:26:21.746]  We, uh, apparently I missed a story a few months ago, but it does still merit attention.
[03:26:21.746 --> 03:26:29.712]  Right here down in Florida, the city of Pembroke Pines, there's a city commissioner named Jay Schwartz.
[03:26:29.712 --> 03:26:34.817]  Now this loser may set the record for anti-American tone deafness of all time.
[03:26:36.072 --> 03:26:48.468]  Get this, on the week of 9-11, yup, the anniversary of the terrorist attacks, Jay Schwartz proposed that his city officially designate May as Muslim Heritage Month.
[03:26:49.656 --> 03:26:51.996]  Now, here's where it really gets interesting.
[03:26:51.996 --> 03:27:03.299]  Since the days of Reagan, May of every month is designated by the President and by Congressional resolution as Jewish American Heritage Month.
[03:27:03.299 --> 03:27:04.619]  So, follow me here.
[03:27:04.619 --> 03:27:14.681]  Schwartz proposed during the week of 9-11 to rename Jewish American Heritage Month as Muslim Heritage Month.
[03:27:14.681 --> 03:27:16.441]  Why, you ask?
[03:27:16.441 --> 03:27:18.742]  According to the statement that Mr. Schwartz put out,
[03:27:19.639 --> 03:27:27.885]  When he made his resolution, it was because American Muslims have been striving to promote peace and understanding.
[03:27:27.885 --> 03:27:29.166]  Really?
[03:27:29.166 --> 03:27:31.327]  So why am I bringing this up?
[03:27:31.327 --> 03:27:39.493]  Because here we are, once again, Mr. Schwartz is back with his plan to designate the month as Muslim Month.
[03:27:39.493 --> 03:27:42.395]  Why does this guy hate America?
[03:27:42.395 --> 03:27:46.658]  Why does Schwartz want to wipe out the Jewish American Heritage Month?
[03:27:46.658 --> 03:27:48.220]  What's next from this character?
[03:27:49.249 --> 03:27:51.111]  So here's what I suggest, folks.
[03:27:51.111 --> 03:27:53.273]  We live in a democracy.
[03:27:53.273 --> 03:27:59.379]  Call Commissioner Schwartz at 954-450-1030.
[03:27:59.379 --> 03:28:10.650]  Politely exercise your First Amendment rights and let him know that pandering to pro-sharia ideas is a terrible, terrible idea.
[03:28:13.553 --> 03:28:31.253]  I mentioned a little earlier that I was able to turn in 125,000 words, approximately 400 pages, for my upcoming book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[03:28:32.341 --> 03:28:49.730]  Now, if all goes as I hope, and our editors can work with some efficiency, this will be not only the first book out covering what actually transpired and how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest single political upset in American history.
[03:28:50.828 --> 03:28:53.150]  There's a lot of inside information in here.
[03:28:53.150 --> 03:29:02.380]  In fact, there's a very substantial analysis of the importance of InfoWars and the other alternative media in the
[03:29:04.866 --> 03:29:17.752]  A role of winning this election and providing the counterpoint to the CNNs, the Foxes, the networks, and so on.
[03:29:17.752 --> 03:29:30.577]  So I urge you to go to Amazon or to go to Barnes and Noble or soon the Infowars store and get your copy of The Making of the President 2016 by Roger Stone.
[03:29:33.288 --> 03:29:34.249]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:29:34.249 --> 03:29:50.525]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.525 --> 03:29:51.927]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.927 --> 03:29:54.449]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.449 --> 03:29:57.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.454 --> 03:30:07.879]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge by targeting his family.
[03:30:07.879 --> 03:30:13.144]  During his interview with Sean Hannity, Assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played.
[03:30:13.144 --> 03:30:22.652]  But his family, including his young children under 10 years old, didn't sign up for that mission, suggesting powerful actors would take revenge by targeting his family.
[03:30:22.992 --> 03:30:30.776]  Assange once again reiterated that WikiLeaks' source for the DNC and John Podesta documents was not Russia or any state actor.
[03:30:30.776 --> 03:30:40.761]  Although he refused to name sources, Assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source for the DNC leaks.
[03:30:41.081 --> 03:30:45.524]  Rich was mysteriously murdered on July 10th in a case that remains unsolved.
[03:30:45.524 --> 03:30:51.308]  WikiLeaks subsequently offered $20,000 for information leading to the capture of his killer.
[03:30:51.308 --> 03:30:58.033]  Could Assange's concerns over what happened to Seth Rich be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family on the record?

[03:31:00.956 --> 03:31:02.837]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:02.837 --> 03:31:04.857]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:04.857 --> 03:31:07.758]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:07.758 --> 03:31:13.839]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.

[03:33:18.139 --> 03:33:20.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:27.694 --> 03:33:28.795]  Welcome back.
[03:33:28.795 --> 03:33:37.941]  I'm Roger Stone from StoneColdTruth.com, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's getting some well-deserved rest.
[03:33:37.941 --> 03:33:45.327]  With the inauguration coming up, there's a couple things that I really think if you intend to attend, you need.
[03:33:46.869 --> 03:33:53.936]  I have been very interested in the tactical nanotechnology body armor, now available through InfoWars.
[03:33:53.936 --> 03:34:00.743]  Now, this armor was previously only available to military and law enforcement.
[03:34:00.743 --> 03:34:08.872]  But now, through special arrangements, you can get some of the highest quality, most affordable body armor out there.
[03:34:10.112 --> 03:34:23.806]  A team of Blackwater operatives and Army Rangers analyzed and tested hundreds of different body army technologies to come up with something with the stopping power and safety aspects of this particular product.
[03:34:24.693 --> 03:34:41.520]  Now, we have already had announcements by AJ20 that they intend to disrupt the inauguration, and I think that we all pray, of course, that there will be no violence, but we must be prepared.
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:44.141]  There's two things, therefore, I strongly recommend.
[03:34:45.097 --> 03:34:53.240]  Go to theinfowarsstore.com and look into and order your tactical nanotechnology body armor.
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:59.602]  And also, while you're at it, get your Donald Trump is my president t-shirt.
[03:34:59.602 --> 03:35:04.264]  This is the t-shirt that the worker bees are going to be wearing.
[03:35:04.264 --> 03:35:09.966]  This is the t-shirt that lets people know that you've been on the team from the very beginning.
[03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:13.991]  Now I'm very pleased to go to my guest.
[03:35:13.991 --> 03:35:16.772]  Peter Roth is a U.S.
[03:35:16.772 --> 03:35:36.579]  News and World Report contributing editor, longtime observer of the Washington political scene, former senior political writer for UPI, has long written about public policy for a number of publications, including the Asian Forum, Japan, The Daily Ledger, and others.
[03:35:36.579 --> 03:35:40.160]  Peter, welcome to InfoWars.com.
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:44.003]  Thank you Roger, it's a pleasure to be here.
[03:35:44.003 --> 03:35:49.027]  I specifically wanted to talk to you because I thought it was interesting that in this past week
[03:35:49.884 --> 03:36:14.676]  Last Sunday, specifically, the New York Times printed an op-ed story in which they yet recycled the claim that President Richard Nixon interceded with the South Vietnamese in order to stall off a peace initiative by President Lyndon Baines Johnson that Nixon believed was designed to cost him the election.
[03:36:15.476 --> 03:36:18.157]  Now, there have been a number of books written about this.
[03:36:18.157 --> 03:36:21.078]  There have been a number of claims.
[03:36:21.078 --> 03:36:29.421]  Up until now, there has never been any direct proof of Nixon's personal involvement.
[03:36:29.421 --> 03:36:38.605]  A journalist named John Farrell claims to have found notes that indicate that Nixon discussed this with his chief aide, H.R.
[03:36:38.605 --> 03:36:44.507]  Bob Haldeman, who would later become White House Chief of Staff and, of course, go to jail in the Watergate scandal.
[03:36:45.831 --> 03:36:56.179]  So damaging was this story to Nixon that the New York Times couldn't resist running the whole story all over again on page one yesterday.
[03:36:56.179 --> 03:36:57.800]  What was your take on this?
[03:36:57.800 --> 03:37:01.703]  I know you are a... I mean, haters got to hate.
[03:37:01.703 --> 03:37:02.863]  And I understand that.
[03:37:02.863 --> 03:37:09.248]  But at some point, Nixon's dead.
[03:37:09.248 --> 03:37:09.428]  It's over.
[03:37:12.233 --> 03:37:18.357]  There's nothing new coming out, and there's nothing new in the New York Times story.
[03:37:18.357 --> 03:37:27.643]  They have a line or two that Haldeman apparently scribbled based on notes from a phone call.
[03:37:27.643 --> 03:37:31.165]  They have no record of Nixon having taken any action.
[03:37:31.165 --> 03:37:38.169]  There's no way to confirm with Haldeman what Haldeman meant when he wrote the note.
[03:37:40.841 --> 03:37:49.800]  This is the kind of thing where, you know, if your wife thinks you're cheating on her, she's going to find proof you're cheating whether you are or not.
[03:37:51.837 --> 03:37:55.358]  The New York Times hates Nixon.
[03:37:55.358 --> 03:37:57.178]  They have always hated Nixon.
[03:37:57.178 --> 03:38:00.159]  They hate Nixon going back to Helen Gahagan Douglas.
[03:38:00.159 --> 03:38:03.799]  They hate Nixon going back to Jerry Voorhees.
[03:38:03.799 --> 03:38:06.120]  They hate Nixon because of Alger Hiss.
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:09.781]  They hate Nixon because he was right about so many things.
[03:38:09.781 --> 03:38:14.462]  And they will stop at nothing to continue to blacken his reputation.
[03:38:14.462 --> 03:38:20.183]  Yeah, I think this has to be put in a very important context.
[03:38:20.183 --> 03:38:20.883]  And it is this.
[03:38:21.923 --> 03:38:25.446]  Yes, Lyndon Johnson orchestrated a bombing haul.
[03:38:25.446 --> 03:38:28.968]  He had no concessions from the North Vietnamese.
[03:38:28.968 --> 03:38:30.730]  None whatsoever.
[03:38:30.730 --> 03:38:37.355]  It was a unilateral bombing haul meant to buy Hubert Horatio Humphrey the presidency.
[03:38:37.355 --> 03:38:38.736]  There was nothing behind it.
[03:38:38.736 --> 03:38:46.782]  So for anyone to say Nixon acted in a treasonous way and cost us peace is false.
[03:38:46.782 --> 03:38:49.344]  This was one politician outmaneuvering another.
[03:38:50.585 --> 03:39:09.318]  The other thing, Roger, in the New York Times, Jack Farrell says this in the story, that Johnson learned of this whole alleged story which has permeated through the Washington corridors of power for 50 years now.
[03:39:09.318 --> 03:39:12.561]  Is it Johnson learned through bugs and illegal surveillance?
[03:39:13.581 --> 03:39:18.747]  Yeah, he had J. Edgar Hoover bugging Richard Nixon's campaign plan.
[03:39:18.747 --> 03:39:20.969]  That's how he knew this.
[03:39:20.969 --> 03:39:34.604]  I've never been involved in any serious conversations with anybody about Lyndon Johnson's abuse of the national intelligence law enforcement apparatus.
[03:39:35.725 --> 03:39:36.866]  For political ends.
[03:39:36.866 --> 03:39:51.414]  Now this, of course, was supposed to have been Nixon's big crime, his big sin, that he obstructed justice, that he used the CIA and the FBI to try and stop the Watergate investigation, that he abused the power of office.
[03:39:51.414 --> 03:40:00.859]  We have Jack Farrell admitting in the story here that Johnson did precisely the same thing that Nixon did, perhaps even on a greater scale, on issues
[03:40:03.664 --> 03:40:05.685]  At least of equal importance.
[03:40:05.685 --> 03:40:13.327]  And there's no desire to hash this out over Johnson, who, in my mind, is a failed president.
[03:40:13.327 --> 03:40:19.709]  In a far bigger... In the majestic volumes by Robert Caro, notwithstanding, he's a failed president.
[03:40:20.336 --> 03:40:29.987]  Yeah, it's interesting that Mr. Caro's biography, Never Ever Once, in four volumes, mentions Billy Saul Estes.
[03:40:29.987 --> 03:40:31.569]  Mr. Estes does not exist.
[03:40:31.569 --> 03:40:34.632]  He's been airbrushed out of history by Mr. Caro.
[03:40:34.632 --> 03:40:35.293]  Why?
[03:40:35.293 --> 03:40:39.918]  Because he and Lyndon Johnson were stealing money hand over fist.
[03:40:39.918 --> 03:40:41.580]  Also, remember the context here.
[03:40:42.982 --> 03:40:51.084]  It may be in Book 5, but people should read your book about the man who killed Kennedy, because it goes into all of this detail.
[03:40:51.084 --> 03:41:06.607]  But, you know, Johnson was a New Dealer, and a progressive on civil rights, and all of these other things that the New York Times thinks important, thinks venerable, thinks saintly.
[03:41:06.607 --> 03:41:10.228]  But, you know, their hatred of Nixon, the Eastern establishment hatred of Nixon, goes
[03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:17.852]  At least to his first Congressional campaign and certainly the Senate campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas.
[03:41:17.852 --> 03:41:23.636]  They never forgave him for being right about Alger Hiss and for being right about Whitaker Chambers.
[03:41:23.636 --> 03:41:26.257]  And they want to keep dancing on his grave.
[03:41:26.257 --> 03:41:40.186]  And as far as this story is concerned, there's nothing in these notes that is confirmation, that is proof positive that Nixon personally intervened.
[03:41:41.314 --> 03:41:47.356]  To prevent a ceasefire from occurring in Vietnam.
[03:41:47.356 --> 03:41:50.998]  The ceasefire wasn't even on the table!
[03:41:50.998 --> 03:41:57.720]  This is a story they have to tell to perpetuate the idea that Nixon was an evil man rather than a flawed genius.
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:00.061]  Well, again, context.
[03:42:00.061 --> 03:42:02.902]  Let's not lose sight of the fact that Nixon always believed
[03:42:03.783 --> 03:42:11.309]  That John Kennedy had beaten him by using classified information regarding the Bay of Pigs and therefore had cheated.
[03:42:11.309 --> 03:42:14.312]  So it was not going to happen to him a second time.
[03:42:14.312 --> 03:42:24.300]  Secondarily, as even Walt Rostow who worked for LBJ said, nobody needed to tell the South Vietnamese to resist and not give in to Johnson's deal.
[03:42:24.300 --> 03:42:27.042]  They weren't inclined to take the deal anyway.
[03:42:27.042 --> 03:42:31.185]  So this is very clearly what happened.
[03:42:31.185 --> 03:42:33.287]  Johnson, as president,
[03:42:34.815 --> 03:42:38.676]  Employed a last minute maneuver to try to elect Hubert Humphrey.
[03:42:38.676 --> 03:42:40.777]  There was nothing behind it.
[03:42:40.777 --> 03:42:45.799]  Nixon figured out exactly what he was doing and thwarted it.
[03:42:45.799 --> 03:42:50.021]  But the truth is, there was no opportunity for peace.
[03:42:50.021 --> 03:42:53.402]  No, the war would not have ended many years earlier.
[03:42:53.402 --> 03:42:55.823]  That is all liberal BS.
[03:42:56.991 --> 03:43:01.536]  Yeah, well, they're defending their own team and their own turf.
[03:43:01.536 --> 03:43:03.698]  It was Johnson who expanded the war.
[03:43:03.698 --> 03:43:13.169]  It was Nixon who drew down the war and ultimately brought the Americans home and successfully pursued the policy of Vietnamization.
[03:43:14.049 --> 03:43:27.241]  And if the Democratic Congress that was elected after Nixon's resignation hadn't pulled the rug out from underneath the South Vietnamese, we never would have had the boat people and the genocide we experienced.
[03:43:27.241 --> 03:43:34.467]  But that's not the way history likes to tell the story, because the way the contemporary historians like to tell the story.
[03:43:34.807 --> 03:43:41.693]  The liberals like Kennedy and Johnson are always the good guys, and the conservatives like Nixon and Reagan are always the bad guys.
[03:43:41.693 --> 03:44:00.350]  They tell the same story about Reagan, only it was George Bush and Bill Casey made a secret trip to Paris to meet with representatives of the Ayatollah to get them to agree that they wouldn't let the hostages go until after the November 1980 election.
[03:44:01.974 --> 03:44:14.038]  Very interestingly, the actual first person who came up with the idea of Donald Trump running for President of the United States was none other than Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[03:44:15.259 --> 03:44:21.502]  Nixon met Trump in George Steinbrenner's box at Yankee Stadium in 1987.
[03:44:21.502 --> 03:44:25.284]  And he called me the next morning.
[03:44:25.284 --> 03:44:28.725]  We had a regular Saturday morning phone call.
[03:44:28.725 --> 03:44:30.946]  And he said, your man's got it, you know.
[03:44:30.946 --> 03:44:32.127]  He's really got it.
[03:44:32.127 --> 03:44:32.987]  And I said, sir?
[03:44:32.987 --> 03:44:34.148]  He said, Trump.
[03:44:34.148 --> 03:44:35.028]  He's really got it.
[03:44:35.028 --> 03:44:36.349]  If he ever runs, he'll win.
[03:44:37.546 --> 03:44:57.551]  Shortly thereafter, Trump receives a note from Nixon, which is very typical Nixonian circumlocation, in which he says, Dear Donald, Mrs. Nixon saw you on the Mike Douglas Show, thought you were excellent, and she says if you ever run for office, you will win.
[03:44:58.431 --> 03:45:01.232]  And Mrs. Nixon knows about these things.
[03:45:01.232 --> 03:45:05.654]  Well, of course it was Nixon's observation, not Mrs. Nixon's.
[03:45:05.654 --> 03:45:20.401]  But from that came a weekend in Houston where the Trumps, the Connellys, John Connelly and his wife Nellie, and the Nixons spent a weekend getting acquainted.
[03:45:20.401 --> 03:45:25.743]  And Nixon came away from that telling me, over a long period of time,
[03:45:26.795 --> 03:45:29.938]  That Donald Trump would someday be president.
[03:45:29.938 --> 03:45:50.337]  Therefore, it's not surprising to me that Trump runs as the candidate of the silent majority, the candidate of the forgotten Americans, the candidate of law and order, and of course, in the final analysis, the candidate of peace.
[03:45:50.337 --> 03:45:51.799]  Does this sound familiar to you?
[03:45:53.172 --> 03:46:20.150]  Absolutely, and I'm not the least bit surprised, and I'm not the least bit surprised that his victory came from the same kind of people who switched their allegiance from the Democrats to the Republicans for Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, and who came through in a big way for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, because Trump talks about issues that people care about, like jobs, jobs, and of course jobs.
[03:46:21.491 --> 03:46:28.334]  And so I think there are lots of favorable comparisons to be made between Trump, Nixon, and Reagan.
[03:46:28.334 --> 03:46:44.281]  And they're not identical, and I'm not trying to suggest that they're all identical, or their thinking is alike, or there's an affinity for a certain kind of an orthodoxy, ideologically, or politically, or tactically, but they understand
[03:46:45.041 --> 03:46:52.927]  Each of them, in their own ways, understands the American electorate and understands what's necessary to win the presidency.
[03:46:52.927 --> 03:46:56.150]  And I think they've demonstrated that clearly.
[03:46:56.150 --> 03:47:10.701]  I think that the liberals at the left, at the New York Times and the Washington Post and everyone else, are trying to set up the comparison between Nixon and Trump because they want to destroy Trump the same way that they believe they destroyed Nixon.
[03:47:11.641 --> 03:47:15.124]  They want to use the politics of personal destruction.
[03:47:15.124 --> 03:47:17.806]  They want to use ethical complaints.
[03:47:17.806 --> 03:47:20.007]  They tried the same thing against Reagan.
[03:47:20.007 --> 03:47:25.991]  It didn't work, because Reagan was a different kind of a president, a different kind of a guy.
[03:47:25.991 --> 03:47:35.118]  It wasn't until Iran-Contra, which was a very thin thread on which to hang an attack on Reagan, after all.
[03:47:35.638 --> 03:47:36.099]  I don't know.
[03:47:50.495 --> 03:47:54.257]  For each controversial nominee, and he gets to decide who's controversial.
[03:47:54.257 --> 03:48:01.501]  He wants all of their tax returns, and he wants one day devoted to panels to come in and beat up on the president's nominee.
[03:48:01.501 --> 03:48:03.021]  So much for the honeymoon.
[03:48:03.021 --> 03:48:05.543]  So much for the president's power of executive appointment.
[03:48:05.543 --> 03:48:14.427]  You know, Schumer has a thin minority, and he's going to work it to the max to try and prevent Trump from doing anything.
[03:48:14.427 --> 03:48:15.688]  They're trying to try and stop
[03:48:16.768 --> 03:48:20.911]  To use the Trump phrase, to try and stop Trump from making America great again.
[03:48:20.911 --> 03:48:33.699]  Because he would rather have the country descend in a spiral of social and economic chaos until they can get their progressive act together and try and turn us into a European-style liberal welfare state.
[03:48:34.281 --> 03:48:37.802]  Yeah, I have to laugh looking at the headline from Richard Perlstein.
[03:48:37.802 --> 03:48:43.244]  We should hope that Donald Trump is as successful as Richard Nixon, if I may go through it.
[03:48:43.244 --> 03:48:45.385]  He ended the war in Vietnam.
[03:48:45.385 --> 03:48:47.285]  He opened the door to China.
[03:48:47.285 --> 03:48:51.167]  He reached a SALT agreement, an arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[03:48:51.707 --> 03:48:56.051]  He single-handedly saved Israel from annihilation in 1973.
[03:48:56.051 --> 03:48:59.474]  He desegregated the public schools.
[03:48:59.474 --> 03:49:02.297]  He began the Environmental Protection Agency.
[03:49:02.297 --> 03:49:04.919]  He gave us federal revenue sharing.
[03:49:04.919 --> 03:49:07.701]  He desegregated the trade unions.
[03:49:08.542 --> 03:49:14.606]  He quadrupled the amount of money for minority enterprise and for black colleges.
[03:49:14.606 --> 03:49:21.631]  We should be so lucky to have a president as successful as Richard Nixon.
[03:49:21.631 --> 03:49:32.438]  So, it has been a delight for me because you and I can kick this subject around all night, usually over what Nixon used to call a silver bullet.
[03:49:32.898 --> 03:49:37.061]  As you know, he was very proud of his martini-making skills.
[03:49:37.061 --> 03:49:46.368]  So, when I get to Washington next, let's hoist a silver bullet in honor of the man who first thought that Donald Trump should run for president.
[03:49:46.368 --> 03:49:49.170]  That would be Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[03:49:49.170 --> 03:49:51.531]  I'd be happy to do that.
[03:49:51.531 --> 03:49:53.393]  So, Peter, thanks for joining us here.
[03:49:53.393 --> 03:49:55.134]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:49:55.134 --> 03:49:58.797]  I want to say one more time for the InfoWars audience.
[03:49:59.887 --> 03:50:07.634]  uh... that you have a unique opportunity to both back the fight for freedom and pick up some of these important
[03:50:08.930 --> 03:50:23.943]  A product which I know as someone who has a long-term interest in Eastern medicine and natural healing and herbology, you've got a sale going on now that will not last forever.
[03:50:23.943 --> 03:50:29.188]  So go if you have the opportunity to the InfoWars store.
[03:50:31.710 --> 03:50:43.155]  Because the auto ship checkout right now, where you get 10% off your order and guaranteed delivery immediately, will not last forever.
[03:50:43.155 --> 03:50:46.497]  Get your t-shirts, get your brain force.
[03:50:46.497 --> 03:50:49.558]  If you're going to Washington DC, get your body armor.
[03:50:49.558 --> 03:50:50.839]  You might need it.
[03:50:50.839 --> 03:50:55.961]  But above all, back the fight for freedom by getting these terrific products.
[03:50:55.961 --> 03:50:58.202]  It's been great to be with you on InfoWars.
[03:50:58.202 --> 03:50:58.923]  I'll see you soon.
[03:51:00.891 --> 03:51:08.974]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[03:51:08.974 --> 03:51:16.837]  I have my help today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:16.837 --> 03:51:21.639]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite as suggested for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:21.639 --> 03:51:26.301]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on, you know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:26.661 --> 03:51:33.425]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:33.425 --> 03:51:34.566]  Life is too short!
[03:51:34.566 --> 03:51:36.527]  Get your Xtendivite today!
[03:51:36.527 --> 03:51:41.990]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2-month supply.
[03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:43.331]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.331 --> 03:51:43.851]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.851 --> 03:51:44.632]  Or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:52:00.933 --> 03:52:03.656]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[03:52:03.656 --> 03:52:07.141]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[03:52:08.348 --> 03:52:11.850]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:52:11.850 --> 03:52:17.272]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:52:17.272 --> 03:52:18.773]  How is this even possible?
[03:52:18.773 --> 03:52:26.316]  Turns out the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:52:26.316 --> 03:52:33.959]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:52:33.959 --> 03:52:37.161]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:52:37.441 --> 03:52:45.248]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:52:45.248 --> 03:52:48.411]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[03:52:48.411 --> 03:52:52.534]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:52:52.534 --> 03:52:53.235]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:52:53.235 --> 03:52:53.635]  Greens75.com.

[03:53:23.304 --> 03:53:25.567]  Earth friendly and natural soaps.
[03:53:25.567 --> 03:53:27.349]  Your family deserves the best.

[03:54:04.411 --> 03:54:05.035]  He's gone!
[03:54:13.855 --> 03:54:14.936]  This is Roger Stone.
[03:54:14.936 --> 03:54:17.077]  I was a little premature.
[03:54:17.077 --> 03:54:22.819]  Anxious, perhaps, to get to a cocktail bar for my post-broadcast libation.
[03:54:22.819 --> 03:54:25.661]  First, a small bookkeeping matter.
[03:54:25.661 --> 03:54:28.862]  I've got to give this back to David Knight.
[03:54:28.862 --> 03:54:32.024]  David, you can't buy your way onto the best-dressed list.
[03:54:32.024 --> 03:54:34.165]  It just doesn't work that way.
[03:54:34.165 --> 03:54:35.025]  No, I'm only kidding.
[03:54:35.025 --> 03:54:36.666]  David Knight is a contender.
[03:54:36.666 --> 03:54:37.707]  Very much a contender.
[03:54:39.067 --> 03:54:48.510]  I'd like to go to some calls since we've got a few extra minutes, and I'd like to hear from the individual patriots out there, find out what's on their minds.
[03:54:48.510 --> 03:54:51.411]  So, Eric in Arizona.
[03:54:51.411 --> 03:54:53.431]  Lay it on me, Eric.
[03:54:53.431 --> 03:54:55.092]  Hey, Roderick, God bless you.
[03:54:55.092 --> 03:55:01.133]  I really liked when you said you're into Eastern medicine, natural healing, and herbology.
[03:55:01.133 --> 03:55:06.315]  I'm a homeopath about 45 years, and I just live and breathe that stuff.
[03:55:06.315 --> 03:55:07.835]  So, we're on the same
[03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:13.052]  Hey listen, now I have a question for you.
[03:55:13.052 --> 03:55:17.295]  I finished your book, LBJ, The Man Who Killed Kennedy.
[03:55:17.295 --> 03:55:18.015]  Yes.
[03:55:18.015 --> 03:55:19.596]  Loved that book, man.
[03:55:19.596 --> 03:55:26.340]  That was so deep that anybody who wants a good read, grab that book.
[03:55:26.340 --> 03:55:28.142]  Anyway, I have one question.
[03:55:28.142 --> 03:55:31.043]  It's been eating on me ever since I saw Jack Ruby shoot.
[03:55:37.024 --> 03:55:41.310]  I have two questions.
[03:55:41.310 --> 03:55:42.331]  That's one.
[03:55:42.331 --> 03:55:46.056]  What was going on in Jack Ruby's mind?
[03:55:46.056 --> 03:55:48.399]  How did they get him to do that?
[03:55:48.399 --> 03:55:51.924]  Didn't he know his life was going to be over once he made that shot?
[03:55:52.725 --> 03:55:55.126]  Well, it was over whether he did or whether he didn't.
[03:55:55.126 --> 03:56:09.976]  You see, the problem was that Jack Ruby, even though the Warren Commission told us that he had no known association with organized crime, was in fact a soldier for Carlos Marcello, who controlled the mob in both Louisiana and Texas.
[03:56:10.987 --> 03:56:12.467]  The problem here was obvious.
[03:56:12.467 --> 03:56:14.048]  Oswald was starting to talk.
[03:56:14.048 --> 03:56:16.028]  What did he yell when he was in public?
[03:56:16.028 --> 03:56:17.629]  I didn't shoot anybody, he said.
[03:56:17.629 --> 03:56:19.049]  I'm a patsy.
[03:56:19.049 --> 03:56:22.870]  They needed to shut Oswald up and quickly.
[03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:26.051]  And the designated hitter was Jack Ruby.
[03:56:26.051 --> 03:56:31.993]  In fact, Jack Ruby's club, the Carousel Club, was actually owned by Carlos Marcello.
[03:56:31.993 --> 03:56:35.874]  And Ruby was only fronting for him.
[03:56:35.874 --> 03:56:37.354]  A second part to that question?
[03:56:38.925 --> 03:56:39.966]  I'm sorry?
[03:56:39.966 --> 03:56:42.270]  Well, I have one more question.
[03:56:42.270 --> 03:56:42.510]  Go!
[03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:45.454]  So what you're saying is that Ruby's life was over anyway.
[03:56:45.454 --> 03:56:46.896]  Everything was over for him anyway.
[03:56:47.523 --> 03:56:53.927]  Well, and in fact, Ruby was visited by a couple physicians while in jail.
[03:56:53.927 --> 03:57:00.110]  We believe he was injected with a cancer-causing virus, and he would die shortly thereafter.
[03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:02.051]  But never remember this.
[03:57:02.051 --> 03:57:03.692]  Pardon me, never forget this.
[03:57:03.692 --> 03:57:09.536]  You can see this on YouTube, where you see two deputy sheriffs pulling Jack Ruby.
[03:57:10.396 --> 03:57:12.036]  Down a hallway.
[03:57:12.036 --> 03:57:15.057]  And they say, Jack, Jack, how could this have happened?
[03:57:15.057 --> 03:57:19.978]  And Ruby said, this never would have happened if Adelaide Stevenson had been vice president.
[03:57:19.978 --> 03:57:21.599]  They said, Jack, what do you mean?
[03:57:21.599 --> 03:57:23.019]  What are you saying?
[03:57:23.019 --> 03:57:27.500]  And Ruby said, look at the man at the top, the man at the very top.
[03:57:27.500 --> 03:57:31.801]  He's talking about Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[03:57:31.801 --> 03:57:33.461]  All right, great question.
[03:57:33.461 --> 03:57:36.822]  Let's go to Danny in Florida.
[03:57:40.609 --> 03:57:43.174]  Roger, why was Nixon removed from office?
[03:57:43.174 --> 03:57:47.283]  Was there a specific incident or thing he was doing that the globalists didn't like?
[03:57:48.220 --> 03:57:50.440]  Yes, it turns out that he was for peace.
[03:57:50.440 --> 03:57:51.741]  Oh my God!
[03:57:51.741 --> 03:57:59.923]  You see, when Nixon was elected, the hardliners thought that they were now finally going to be able to do whatever they wanted in Vietnam.
[03:57:59.923 --> 03:58:13.446]  When they learned that Nixon was not only going around his own national security apparatus to begin a discussion with the Chinese, opening SALT talks with the Russians, and ending the war, good God, Nixon was for peace!
[03:58:13.446 --> 03:58:14.766]  We've got to stop this guy!
[03:58:15.626 --> 03:58:21.729]  So he was essentially, although he made many mistakes on his own, taken down by his own hand.
[03:58:21.729 --> 03:58:26.131]  The reason they did so was because he was not for war.
[03:58:26.131 --> 03:58:28.752]  He was indeed a peacemaker.
[03:58:28.752 --> 03:58:33.514]  Thanks again for coming and joining us at TheInfoWars.com and we'll see you shortly.
