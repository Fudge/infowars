[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  you
[00:02.000 --> 00:22.100]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the
[00:22.100 --> 00:33.460]  Alex Jones show we are live on this Wednesday January 4th edition of the
[00:33.460 --> 00:37.960]  Alex Jones show Alex will be coming up with special reports throughout the show
[00:37.960 --> 00:42.020]  the first of which will be aired after the break the first few minutes you want
[00:42.020 --> 00:46.020]  to concentrate on the breaking news which is of course the mainstream media
[00:46.020 --> 00:51.500]  doubling down in its failed narrative that the American people completely don't
[00:51.500 --> 00:55.500]  believe that Russia hacked the election for Donald Trump this is a headline
[00:55.500 --> 01:00.940]  upon USA today this is the flavor of the manipulative narrative that we're
[01:00.940 --> 01:05.500]  seeing once again today about Russia in the aftermath of Julian Assange's
[01:05.500 --> 01:09.300]  interview with Sean Hannity which we were gonna play clips from later in the
[01:09.300 --> 01:14.780]  show this is USA today though Trump sites Assange claim about Russia hacking
[01:14.780 --> 01:18.420]  when it comes to claims that Russia hacked Democratic officials during last
[01:18.420 --> 01:22.420]  year's election president-elect Donald Trump is apparently taking the word of
[01:22.420 --> 01:27.620]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over that of US intelligence officials so
[01:27.620 --> 01:32.940]  again massive helping of bought her from the mainstream media from the
[01:32.940 --> 01:37.940]  Democratic Party establishment that a Donald Trump tweeted about what's in the
[01:37.940 --> 01:43.020]  news how dare he do that and that be he took the side of Julian Assange when it
[01:43.020 --> 01:46.780]  came to Assange's denial which again we're gonna play later in the show that
[01:46.780 --> 01:50.820]  he their information the leaks he received he received concerning John
[01:50.820 --> 01:56.500]  Podesta's email the DNC leaks didn't come from Russia they didn't come from a
[01:56.500 --> 02:01.220]  state actor of course we know from what Assange's intimated in the past they
[02:01.220 --> 02:07.180]  most likely came from murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich but again they've
[02:07.180 --> 02:11.540]  stacked up Assange's credibility against the credibility of the mainstream
[02:11.540 --> 02:17.380]  media and the much-vaunted US intelligence apparatus which its entire
[02:17.380 --> 02:22.140]  raison d'etre is to lie and deceive people now this is pretty interesting
[02:22.140 --> 02:26.300]  pretty interesting given what happened last week and we can't talk about this
[02:26.300 --> 02:31.460]  enough which is the fact that the Washington Post which has been lecturing
[02:31.460 --> 02:38.740]  everyone about fake news for the past God knows how many weeks completely faked a
[02:38.740 --> 02:43.860]  news story about so-called Russian hackers hacking into the US electrical
[02:43.860 --> 02:48.300]  grid remember they put up this story last week in fact there's a good summary
[02:48.300 --> 02:52.180]  up at Liberty Blitzkrieg which is here's the best summary of the Washington
[02:52.180 --> 02:57.580]  Post latest fake news fiasco so they painted this dire scenario of Russian
[02:57.580 --> 03:03.820]  hackers hacking into this utility grid in Vermont turned out within hours within
[03:03.820 --> 03:10.060]  hours to be absolute BX now only was the computer effect infected with this
[03:10.060 --> 03:17.820]  malware not connected to the US electric grid the malware on the computer can be
[03:17.820 --> 03:22.980]  bought from the internet by anyone in fact this was so rubbish this was so
[03:22.980 --> 03:26.820]  debunked within hours of it being published by the Washington Post that
[03:26.820 --> 03:31.620]  they then had to publish a second article admitting that there was no
[03:31.620 --> 03:38.860]  evidence whatsoever that Russia hacked the US electric grid just imagine for a
[03:38.860 --> 03:44.700]  second the gravity of that claim backed up by absolutely zero evidence that
[03:44.700 --> 03:50.380]  there was this team of Russian hackers scheming to plunge the entire United
[03:50.380 --> 03:56.060]  States into darkness that was evidence that they had attempted to do so with
[03:56.060 --> 04:00.460]  the malware infection of this computer again turned out to be absolute
[04:00.460 --> 04:07.700]  unbridled nonsense fake news this is the same publication that bangs on about
[04:07.700 --> 04:13.060]  pizza gate and this idiot gunman who thankfully injured no one going into a
[04:13.060 --> 04:18.460]  pizza parlor and how that means fake news is so deadly they literally put out
[04:18.460 --> 04:23.460]  an article accusing Russia of hacking the US electric grid with no evidence
[04:23.460 --> 04:27.900]  completely fake news story the kind of news story that could create
[04:27.900 --> 04:33.460]  international conflict they publish a retraction in the form of a second
[04:33.460 --> 04:38.820]  article and you know by this week everybody's forgotten about it so yes
[04:38.820 --> 04:43.780]  when Donald Trump tweets and says that WikiLeaks which has a 10-year proven
[04:43.780 --> 04:47.900]  record of accuracy is more reliable than the Washington Post and their fake
[04:47.900 --> 04:54.460]  news narrative and the USWMDs interact fake intel community then yes it's
[04:54.460 --> 04:58.260]  sensible that we would believe Julian Assange of WikiLeaks will be back with
[04:58.260 --> 05:04.260]  Alex Jones live after the break the Huffington Post says Donald Trump is
[05:04.260 --> 05:09.140]  unfit to be president and they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of
[05:09.140 --> 05:14.780]  Trump right now before the inauguration in an article titled impeaching Trump
[05:14.780 --> 05:19.340]  the process begins now Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says
[05:19.340 --> 05:24.460]  president-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even
[05:24.460 --> 05:29.900]  Richard Nixon whoa and he expects Trump will immediately break the law and
[05:29.900 --> 05:34.820]  violate the Constitution therefore the Huffington Post is calling for a
[05:34.820 --> 05:40.940]  citizens impeachment inquiry to begin the first day Trump steps into office the
[05:40.940 --> 05:45.820]  idea is to keep daily records of Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors
[05:45.820 --> 05:50.780]  including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance with Vladimir
[05:50.780 --> 05:57.300]  Putin more desperation from the lunatics on the far left you can learn

[07:12.060 --> 07:16.380]  IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[07:16.380 --> 07:20.480]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[07:20.480 --> 07:24.940]  took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima

[07:47.100 --> 07:51.060]  and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum

[07:56.140 --> 08:09.500]  or by calling 888-253-3139 you're listening to the alex jones show
[08:11.100 --> 08:16.620]  we have got two big guests with big breaking news coming up in the second
[08:16.620 --> 08:21.620]  and third hours the first of which is Jason Kessler he was the journalist who
[08:21.620 --> 08:26.180]  confronted the vice mayor there in Charlottesville who made these basically racist
[08:26.180 --> 08:31.020]  misogynistic tweets was then of course rallied round by his leftist colleagues
[08:31.020 --> 08:35.460]  we've got him coming up he's leading the campaign spearheading focus on that
[08:35.460 --> 08:40.820]  issue then we've got Harlan Hill who is a Fox News and a CNN contributor to talk
[08:40.820 --> 08:45.460]  about the latest with Trump the latest with the rushing Russian hacking
[08:45.460 --> 08:50.340]  allegations of course off the back of this Julian Assange interview with Sean
[08:50.340 --> 08:54.540]  Hannity we've also got key clips from that interview coming up but here is
[08:54.540 --> 08:58.980]  alex jones this is a powerful run about how the power lies with you the
[08:58.980 --> 09:02.820]  individual and we'll be back in the next segment with more news here's alex
[09:02.820 --> 09:09.460]  jones these arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity the truth is
[09:09.460 --> 09:15.340]  whether it's Obama or George Soros their losers everything they had everything
[09:15.340 --> 09:21.060]  they threw against us failed now just because we defeated these tyrants for
[09:21.060 --> 09:25.500]  now does it mean we've won the war the war is happening within our hearts
[09:25.500 --> 09:31.420]  then our souls on our minds we have to be good we have to be pure we have to be
[09:31.420 --> 09:35.380]  strong we have to build prosperity we have to bring every one of every race
[09:35.380 --> 09:39.980]  color and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who
[09:39.980 --> 09:43.380]  believe we were going to fail who believe their divide and conquer would work
[09:43.380 --> 09:51.420]  yes we've won the first phase the battle for the soul of humanity has just
[09:51.420 --> 09:58.580]  begun but Obama and Hillary and Soros you were losers from the day you were
[09:58.580 --> 10:15.340]  born
[10:15.340 --> 10:25.900]  it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[10:25.900 --> 10:40.060]  we pledge allegiance to one flag it's been a cozy relationship from the
[10:40.060 --> 10:45.580]  beginning I will not let you down you'll be very very impressed I hope and I
[10:45.580 --> 10:52.420]  think we'll be speaking a lot this means the Donald Trump will be the 45th
[10:52.420 --> 11:02.020]  president of the United States waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones I get
[11:02.020 --> 11:07.420]  pretty emotional on air and people ask me is it an act and the answer is no
[11:07.420 --> 11:16.740]  it's a hundred percent real it's 110% real but I do basically let the dog off
[11:16.740 --> 11:21.060]  the leash I do that on purpose because I just want to be completely honest with
[11:21.060 --> 11:25.700]  people about where I stand and how serious these issues are and you can
[11:25.700 --> 11:30.300]  say whatever you want about it the method of the madness it's effective we've
[11:30.300 --> 11:33.900]  woken people up we're moving forward we're getting people's attention doesn't
[11:33.900 --> 11:36.980]  mean I got to do it perfect doesn't mean you got to do it perfect we just got to
[11:36.980 --> 11:42.620]  do the right thing and warn people as best we can about the perils of
[11:42.620 --> 11:46.740]  globalism and then their system will never be successful and they're stone
[11:46.740 --> 11:52.780]  walling of just denying that they're establishing this tyranny has totally
[11:52.780 --> 11:57.500]  begun to collapse when I say begun to collapse it is falling apart as we
[11:57.500 --> 12:02.980]  speak they admit that in their own internal animals they are in complete
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.980]  beehive and hill eruptions of scurrying around like chickens with their heads
[12:07.980 --> 12:14.300]  cut off whatever other analogy you want their houses on fire that said though
[12:14.300 --> 12:18.460]  their whole reorganization to come back and counterattack is happening as we
[12:18.460 --> 12:24.060]  speak so when I get up on air and say with 15 days with 14 days left until
[12:24.060 --> 12:29.820]  Trump gets in when I talk about that until they'll be totally vigilant it's
[12:29.820 --> 12:33.540]  because these are the most important days in probably modern history if not in
[12:33.540 --> 12:38.260]  much of history itself because the nuclear weapons we have now the huge
[12:38.260 --> 12:42.900]  human population all the things that are developing because we do have the
[12:42.900 --> 12:48.740]  technology for even more people on this planet but we don't have the land and
[12:48.740 --> 12:52.100]  the resources that we don't start advancing technology and distributing it
[12:52.100 --> 12:58.140]  to third world nations and ourselves this whole post-industrial non-growth
[12:58.140 --> 13:04.340]  model will cause a giant collapse that all the demographers agree on if you
[13:04.340 --> 13:08.780]  don't produce 2.1 children for every two adults it's going to create a
[13:08.780 --> 13:13.060]  collapse level event no matter how many robots you put in how much garbage
[13:13.060 --> 13:23.460]  you install now that said when I say I felt the collapse yesterday that's not
[13:23.460 --> 13:29.340]  really even the sixth sense mumbo jumbo even though I do believe in the sixth
[13:29.340 --> 13:33.500]  sense has been proven we all have it but that's more of just a added guide of
[13:33.500 --> 13:38.420]  your gut or your spirit when I say that they're really starting to realize they've
[13:38.420 --> 13:42.020]  been defeated at this phase in a big way that there's a major sea change that's
[13:42.020 --> 13:48.260]  hit it's because you see every major globalist newspaper like the New York
[13:48.260 --> 13:53.420]  Times even the Washington Post coming out of their editorial pages and saying
[13:53.420 --> 13:58.220]  this is the end of Obama his legacy is a joke he's a fraud he launched all these
[13:58.220 --> 14:04.740]  criminal wars he did all these terrible things oh my gosh what have we done it's
[14:04.740 --> 14:10.060]  a capitulation move and it's a desperation move but it really shows
[14:10.060 --> 14:18.460]  that they're now having to signal to Trump and to the counter to that's been
[14:18.460 --> 14:23.260]  launched by the people that okay we are backing off I don't believe that they'd
[14:23.260 --> 14:27.940]  be rolling over this strong if it wasn't at least real at many levels of the
[14:27.940 --> 14:32.660]  elite strata that does not mean it's complete and that does not mean they're
[14:32.660 --> 14:37.740]  not going to come back and double cross but as I said back on November 8th they
[14:37.740 --> 14:41.980]  have not capitulated yet and you saw all the stuff they launched and I laid out
[14:41.980 --> 14:45.860]  everything they do and they did it almost like I was giving them ideas but I
[14:45.860 --> 14:49.780]  wasn't we just are inside their minds they're inside ours that's how interface
[14:49.780 --> 14:54.980]  we are in this fight and right now they finally understand they've had their
[14:54.980 --> 15:01.740]  butts whipped and then they push it much further massive more leaks that make the
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.460]  other ones look tabling comparison are going to be released and come out and so
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.780]  we're winning the civil war we are in the fourth quarter with about three
[15:09.780 --> 15:15.380]  minutes to go and we have got several touchdowns and several field goals on
[15:15.380 --> 15:20.580]  the board ahead of them in this game going forward if we're not moral if
[15:20.580 --> 15:24.500]  we're not strong if we don't drain the swamp if we don't in our own lives take
[15:24.500 --> 15:28.460]  action and be better people it's the moral right that's got us to this point
[15:28.460 --> 15:32.460]  it's the fact that we've been in a sleep the fact we've been in a trance coming
[15:32.460 --> 15:37.420]  out of the trance is the key and I'm up at 5 3 in the morning right now taping
[15:37.420 --> 15:41.620]  this for the show with Watson and David not in the crew that are there I'm gonna
[15:41.620 --> 15:46.140]  be gone for about a week but I will be filing reports from the road as I take
[15:46.140 --> 15:51.460]  some time to do some research but I gotta occasionally take a little bit of a
[15:51.460 --> 15:56.420]  break or I spend out of control as everybody knows bottom line history is
[15:56.420 --> 16:00.220]  happening in front of everybody I want to salute all of you and again I want to
[16:00.220 --> 16:06.580]  be clear I'm not doing this to Pat on the head or be patronizing you are the
[16:06.580 --> 16:11.540]  resistance you are the MVPs you are changing the world all you went through
[16:11.540 --> 16:16.580]  being made fun of all the bullying all the attacks all the demonization by your
[16:16.580 --> 16:20.140]  friends your family your bosses your employees your neighbors your pastors
[16:20.140 --> 16:24.060]  some of your pastors stood up for the truth they went through bullying my point
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.940]  is is that this is an amazing time to be alive you are the trailblazers you are
[16:28.940 --> 16:32.300]  the winners you didn't just win some lottery ticket or some football game or
[16:32.300 --> 16:37.740]  you know some stupid set of steak knives you didn't win the little silly brass
[16:37.740 --> 16:44.340]  ring you won a major battle against the most wicked organized crime who
[16:44.340 --> 16:49.540]  syndicates this planet's ever seen and you did it because you had moral
[16:49.540 --> 16:55.900]  historical foundations you were standing on America that was created in
[16:55.900 --> 17:01.380]  Providence in God's mind and that does have a great destiny the destiny of the
[17:01.380 --> 17:06.820]  world rises and falls with this Republic we have been exceptional now we've been
[17:06.820 --> 17:10.740]  exceptionally evil and it's up to us whether America's hit bottom yet and
[17:10.740 --> 17:16.220]  it started its way back up we have that chance to lead the world out of the
[17:16.220 --> 17:20.940]  technotronic era that the globalist are we're hoping was just dawning which I
[17:20.940 --> 17:25.340]  believe is dead on arrival it's a great time to be alive our ideology trumps
[17:25.340 --> 17:29.380]  everything they could ever come up with it's beautiful it's true it's ancient and
[17:29.380 --> 17:34.020]  it's of God and I don't say that is some Pharisee on a high horse but it's
[17:34.020 --> 17:37.940]  somebody that says wicked as the day is long but my heart is pointed at God so

[17:55.500 --> 17:59.140]  we are in a epic fight that is amazing and that is incredible and it's all
[17:59.140 --> 18:03.660]  about that fight to live in a free country and a free civilization based on
[18:03.660 --> 18:10.300]  families based on real values set forth and again led by Jesus Christ there's
[18:10.300 --> 18:14.700]  any reason the enemy hates Christ and it's because Christ is real and Christ
[18:14.700 --> 18:19.620]  spirits real and God's plan is real and they can't stand it so at the end of the
[18:19.620 --> 18:24.700]  day remember that we're fighting evil people who serve an evil fallen God and
[18:24.700 --> 18:29.740]  that's why they do all this bad stuff because it's all an ends everything
[18:29.740 --> 18:35.700]  they do is a place they're going a place they're leading us they do these bad
[18:35.700 --> 18:39.820]  things because they are bad because they're building something stinking and
[18:39.820 --> 18:45.300]  falling because it's their nature because they can't coexist with us to
[18:45.300 --> 18:50.220]  understand that I know you understand that but the minute we really understand
[18:50.220 --> 18:53.580]  that we must soften our hearts towards children and soften our hearts towards
[18:53.580 --> 18:57.100]  the ignorant that don't understand what's happening and forgive them but we have
[18:57.100 --> 19:02.340]  to at the same time quite frankly harden our hearts against evil and be stead
[19:02.340 --> 19:05.980]  fast and realize that we're going to run them over and there's our destiny to
[19:05.980 --> 19:09.100]  defeat them but we have to take that destiny and we have to take the
[19:09.100 --> 19:12.740]  adversity that comes with it in our hands but through the process we will be
[19:12.740 --> 19:16.500]  made whole and strong on the other side and be much greater than we ever were

[23:24.460 --> 23:28.140]  called Patriot Power Greens Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for

[24:08.300 --> 24:12.620]  here they build the big guns
[24:13.020 --> 24:17.180]  here they build the death planes
[24:17.340 --> 24:22.700]  here they build all the bombs for the master of war Barack Obama whose policy
[24:22.700 --> 24:26.220]  is completely wrecked to the middle east and led to the migrant crisis has just
[24:26.220 --> 24:30.380]  over two weeks left in office and he's still determined to
[24:30.380 --> 24:34.780]  continue this madcap escalation with Russia
[24:34.780 --> 24:38.700]  we've got an article here out of the sun this is up on drudgerreport.com
[24:38.700 --> 24:43.340]  US sends special forces to Russian border as NATO is poised to strike back
[24:43.340 --> 24:46.620]  against Vladimir Putin's aggression
[24:46.620 --> 24:51.180]  even though as you know Vladimir Putin doesn't even reciprocate when Obama
[24:51.180 --> 24:55.020]  kicks 35 Russian diplomats out of the United States
[24:55.020 --> 24:58.940]  Putin's response is to basically invite children to a party
[24:58.940 --> 25:02.380]  does absolutely nothing in return but he's the aggressive party
[25:02.380 --> 25:06.860]  President Obama has deployed US special forces troops along Lithuania's border
[25:06.860 --> 25:11.580]  with quote aggressive Russia tensions between Washington and the Kremlin have
[25:11.580 --> 25:14.860]  reached Cold War levels amid reports Vladimir Putin is
[25:14.860 --> 25:17.340]  deploying nuclear missiles in the Russian province of
[25:17.340 --> 25:21.980]  Kalingrad again this escalation has been launched
[25:21.980 --> 25:25.420]  off the back of the mainstream media's fake news
[25:25.420 --> 25:28.940]  that was in the Washington Post last week with their story
[25:28.940 --> 25:33.580]  claiming that Russian hackers tried to get into the computers
[25:33.580 --> 25:39.740]  of the US electronic grid this story turned out to be complete BS
[25:39.740 --> 25:43.340]  people have since drilled into the process of how this
[25:43.340 --> 25:47.020]  fake news story was reported in the Washington Post
[25:47.020 --> 25:50.860]  it was a copy and paste job these Washington Post
[25:50.860 --> 25:54.460]  journalists, prostitutes called the Department of Homeland
[25:54.460 --> 25:59.900]  of Security for a comment they didn't call the actual electric public
[25:59.900 --> 26:03.660]  utilities who had supposedly been hacked in the Russians
[26:03.660 --> 26:07.500]  didn't call them for a comment which came back to smack them in the face
[26:07.500 --> 26:11.260]  about two hours later because these same public utilities came out
[26:11.260 --> 26:14.380]  literally an hour and a half after this story
[26:14.380 --> 26:17.660]  this fake news story was published in the Washington Post
[26:17.660 --> 26:21.580]  said there's absolutely no evidence that Russian hackers
[26:21.580 --> 26:25.180]  hacked this utility number one the computer wasn't connected
[26:25.180 --> 26:30.300]  to the utility itself number two the malware could be found anywhere on the
[26:30.300 --> 26:34.940]  internet there was no evidence whatsoever that it had come from Russia
[26:34.940 --> 26:38.780]  but again the Washington Post just like with their fake news list
[26:38.780 --> 26:41.660]  that they put out which they then had to back away from
[26:41.660 --> 26:45.340]  said they couldn't vouch for the validity of it because it was completely
[26:45.340 --> 26:49.420]  made up out of thin air that proper not fake news list again
[26:49.420 --> 26:53.420]  with links back to the military industrial complex back to the neocon
[26:53.420 --> 26:57.180]  establishment again this turned out to be completely
[26:57.180 --> 27:02.140]  fake basically what happened somebody who worked in that utility Burlington
[27:02.140 --> 27:06.460]  Electric checked their email their yahu email
[27:06.460 --> 27:09.500]  and it connected to a suspicious IP address
[27:09.500 --> 27:13.100]  because of this malware that was on the laptop that had been floating around
[27:13.100 --> 27:16.380]  the internet anyway again nothing whatsoever to do
[27:16.380 --> 27:21.100]  with Russia they had zero evidence that it had to do with Russia
[27:21.100 --> 27:25.740]  but ran with the story anyway think of the danger
[27:25.740 --> 27:32.380]  they're accusing a nuclear superpower of hacking the US electric grid
[27:32.380 --> 27:36.620]  think of the gravity of that charge backed by absolutely
[27:36.620 --> 27:39.980]  zero evidence so again the mainstream media has the
[27:39.980 --> 27:44.300]  temerity to say that info wars is dangerous
[27:44.300 --> 27:48.060]  because we're pushing fake news about pizza gate or whatever
[27:48.060 --> 27:52.140]  which we didn't even push I mean I never tweeted about it personally
[27:52.140 --> 27:55.900]  because I thought it was a dud story but no we get all the blame for everything
[27:55.900 --> 27:59.020]  apparently that's dangerous that's going to cause people to die
[27:59.020 --> 28:04.300]  yet they're literally hyping a military confrontation with Russia
[28:04.300 --> 28:09.180]  by publishing fake news blaming Russia for hacking the US electronic grid
[28:09.180 --> 28:14.060]  with no evidence but they say we're dangerous for pushing fake news
[28:14.060 --> 28:17.340]  their fake news could start a world war
[28:17.340 --> 28:21.660]  how dare they blame us and of course today Trump tweets
[28:21.660 --> 28:25.420]  that Assange's claims on Russian hacking in his interview with Sean Hannity
[28:25.420 --> 28:29.980]  makes sense again no evidence that they provided wiki leaks with the dnc leaks
[28:29.980 --> 28:33.580]  with the pedestrian emails we know who did Seth Rich
[28:33.580 --> 28:36.220]  Assange can't come out and say it publicly because he can't name his
[28:36.220 --> 28:40.140]  sources but again now the outrage is that aimed at
[28:40.140 --> 28:44.700]  Trump because he says that Julian Assange of wiki leaks
[28:44.700 --> 28:49.500]  which has a 10 year plus track record of complete deadly accuracy
[28:49.500 --> 28:53.500]  is more reliable than the US intelligence community
[28:53.500 --> 28:58.620]  part of which is pushing this whole crap about Russia hacking the election
[28:58.620 --> 29:02.300]  again with zero evidence whatsoever they've now had to put the
[29:02.300 --> 29:06.060]  briefing back until Friday because they're desperately trying to scrape the
[29:06.060 --> 29:08.460]  barrel and cobble something together
[29:08.460 --> 29:11.020]  nothing has been released in the public arena
[29:11.020 --> 29:15.020]  that even indicates any evidence of Russian hacking but again
[29:15.020 --> 29:19.660]  we're bad for talking about quote quote fake news when they're directly
[29:19.660 --> 29:24.860]  pushing fake news that could start a nuclear conflict
[29:24.860 --> 29:28.460]  and now we have Paul Ryan the speaker of the house
[29:28.460 --> 29:31.340]  calls Julian Assange a sycophant for Russia
[29:31.340 --> 29:36.220]  says that Julian Assange quote he leaks well yeah Paul Ryan
[29:36.220 --> 29:39.740]  the clue is in the name wiki leaks right absolutely
[29:39.740 --> 29:43.500]  George Insel Paul Ryan is now siding with this narrative
[29:43.500 --> 29:46.860]  we'll be back with more on the alex jones show live after the break
[29:46.860 --> 29:50.140]  info wars.com don't go away
[29:50.700 --> 29:56.940]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:56.940 --> 30:00.140]  network
[30:00.140 --> 30:06.940]  the Huffington Post says Donald Trump is unfit to be president and they've
[30:06.940 --> 30:10.540]  thought of a way to begin the impeachment of Trump right now
[30:10.540 --> 30:15.660]  before the inauguration in an article titled impeaching Trump the process
[30:15.660 --> 30:19.420]  begins now Huffington Post contributor Robert Kirtner says
[30:19.420 --> 30:24.620]  president-elect Donald Trump is far more of a menace to society than even
[30:24.620 --> 30:29.820]  Richard Nixon whoa and he expects Trump will immediately break the law
[30:29.820 --> 30:34.940]  and violate the constitution therefore the Huffington Post is calling for a
[30:34.940 --> 30:38.620]  citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin the first day
[30:38.620 --> 30:44.060]  Trump steps into office the idea is to keep daily records of Trump's
[30:44.060 --> 30:49.340]  high crimes and misdemeanors including evidence they collect of his treasonous
[30:49.340 --> 30:53.660]  alliance with vladimir putin more desperation from the

[33:38.780 --> 33:46.380]  i have consistently stated that past performance is indicative of future
[33:46.380 --> 33:49.740]  behavior and i'm not the first person that said that that's been well known for
[33:49.740 --> 33:52.780]  thousands of years i'm just stating common sense here
[33:52.780 --> 33:56.700]  so it wasn't hard to predict that the democrats who try to steal the nomination
[33:56.700 --> 34:00.060]  from trump the republican party that tried to steal the nomination tried to
[34:00.060 --> 34:02.700]  block it the same democratic party that successfully
[34:02.700 --> 34:06.460]  stole it from bernie sanders who rolled over to it
[34:06.460 --> 34:10.140]  the same groups that try to steal the election on election night the same
[34:10.140 --> 34:12.860]  groups that tried to have the recounts the same groups that
[34:12.860 --> 34:16.540]  tried to overturn the electors the same group now
[34:16.540 --> 34:19.660]  saying that trump's some type of russian agent with all this made up crap and
[34:19.660 --> 34:23.580]  that you know the russians are trying to bring down our power grid
[34:23.580 --> 34:27.420]  they're not going to give up and i've said that consistently we're now 15 days
[34:27.420 --> 34:31.420]  out but yesterday when i said i could feel them
[34:31.420 --> 34:34.940]  collapsing uh well that's kind of like what's been
[34:34.940 --> 34:38.220]  described at the end of world war one or world war two you just feel like
[34:38.220 --> 34:42.220]  this weight come off as the will of who you were fighting
[34:42.220 --> 34:46.300]  millions of other people on the other side finally gave up but really
[34:46.300 --> 34:51.100]  cutting past the six cent stuff what i'm really getting at is you can see
[34:51.100 --> 34:55.660]  more and more big news publications coming out and saying okay obama has a
[34:55.660 --> 34:59.580]  horrible legacy okay obama's horrible okay hillary was a horrible candidate okay
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.860]  she's super corrupt okay you know uh trump isn't hitler and that's
[35:04.860 --> 35:09.100]  being done because the mainstream media is so command and control
[35:09.100 --> 35:14.460]  that trump knows that they're not giving up on their deceptive agenda
[35:14.460 --> 35:18.460]  unless they basically roll over and start writing these articles
[35:18.460 --> 35:21.260]  now on the surface that sounds kind of dangerous like wow
[35:21.260 --> 35:24.860]  that they have to roll over to trump and start having news articles you know
[35:24.860 --> 35:28.300]  basically being neutral or fair well that's because the media was already
[35:28.300 --> 35:31.740]  command and control as wiki league showed it was
[35:31.740 --> 35:34.620]  commanded right down to the paragraphs right down to the headlines right down
[35:34.620 --> 35:37.580]  to what was being said and done when it came to
[35:37.580 --> 35:41.740]  political news i've always said okay a plane crashes it's usually just real
[35:41.740 --> 35:45.820]  news reporting on it or okay there's a flood or okay this football team wins
[35:45.820 --> 35:49.980]  that's usually just real news but it's the big political events that you've
[35:49.980 --> 35:55.180]  got to watch that's where the deception the dissembling manipulation is
[35:55.180 --> 35:59.180]  but there's just a lot of indicators that the fact that there's more leaks
[35:59.180 --> 36:02.780]  going to come out more whistleblowers about to come out
[36:02.780 --> 36:07.340]  oh and a big thing i've talked about yesterday the fact that
[36:07.340 --> 36:10.460]  the whistleblowers that released the latest information in the last year to
[36:10.460 --> 36:14.780]  wiki leaks are prepared to have a press conference
[36:14.780 --> 36:18.780]  and i was told about this six months ago and then
[36:18.780 --> 36:22.540]  it began to build and then of course the british ambassador
[36:22.540 --> 36:26.140]  former british ambassador who is admittedly an operative of wiki leaks
[36:26.140 --> 36:29.500]  has come out repeatedly and said i've met in america with the head leaker
[36:29.500 --> 36:33.100]  it's an american from intelligence agencies well
[36:33.100 --> 36:37.580]  we also know mr benny and others and he told us that
[36:37.580 --> 36:40.860]  back at the same time so we have top people telling us this
[36:40.860 --> 36:44.940]  then i have folks off record confirming and telling me
[36:44.940 --> 36:49.180]  the type of stuff that's in there which i did get out on air because i
[36:49.180 --> 36:54.060]  i released all info i have the big thing i forgot to cover
[36:54.060 --> 36:57.820]  yesterday's just get so excited about all this i really should just write notes
[36:57.820 --> 37:02.700]  and then go over it uh is that i mean we're teleprompter for free sometimes it
[37:02.700 --> 37:06.300]  goes too far obviously was stuff that's so important
[37:06.300 --> 37:10.060]  that that that that's what's being prepared that if they want to push it
[37:10.060 --> 37:13.900]  further they want to keep pushing this russia garbage that's going to happen
[37:13.900 --> 37:18.860]  now notice yesterday this is a big one they came out and said oh we've delayed
[37:18.860 --> 37:22.380]  the briefing that uh trump was going to get
[37:22.380 --> 37:25.740]  then they come out and say oh no we didn't delay the briefing he's just saying
[37:25.740 --> 37:29.340]  that but if you go look at what was actually done they have delayed it
[37:29.340 --> 37:33.340]  on the evidence of the russian hacking that they won't even give congress
[37:33.340 --> 37:36.540]  because it's a metaphorical hacking i mean just politically through rt and
[37:36.540 --> 37:39.900]  stuff of influence the election well i guess you could say that's true
[37:39.900 --> 37:44.620]  but the chinese and the eu and msm and all the foreign money is you know a
[37:44.620 --> 37:48.300]  hundred times what russia might have done that way if you call that any type of
[37:48.300 --> 37:51.820]  influence hacking and the george soros has been trying to overthrow russia
[37:51.820 --> 37:55.660]  internally for a decade and admits it not just the surrounding
[37:55.660 --> 37:59.900]  countries like like we've seen the last few years
[37:59.900 --> 38:05.180]  with the ukraine situation so when i say they're starting to really falter and
[38:05.180 --> 38:09.020]  fall apart that's because i really mean it i think
[38:09.020 --> 38:11.260]  there's a lot of danger they're going to still pull something
[38:11.260 --> 38:14.780]  they've got a lot of rogue elements it's not just one monolithic group but more
[38:14.780 --> 38:19.500]  like a swarm of criminals and that you know that follow a basic
[38:19.500 --> 38:23.340]  piratical global system but i really think that
[38:23.340 --> 38:27.340]  very positive things are happening and really it's about holding
[38:27.340 --> 38:32.940]  trumps surrounding people accountable and really pushing our populist agenda
[38:32.940 --> 38:36.220]  not just here but worldwide because of anything's influencing things around
[38:36.220 --> 38:41.500]  the world it's the liberty movement it's 1776
[38:41.500 --> 38:44.540]  worldwide it's nationalism it's sovereignty it's free market
[38:44.540 --> 38:48.060]  capitalism that is driven by the will of the people and by
[38:48.060 --> 38:51.500]  innovation i mean america is infiltrating russia more
[38:51.500 --> 38:54.940]  than russia is infiltrating us everybody knows that despite all the
[38:54.940 --> 38:57.340]  stuff that globalists have done to russia in our name
[38:57.340 --> 39:00.860]  they love our blue jeans they love our culture they love
[39:00.860 --> 39:04.700]  you know james dean in the whole nine yards everybody knows that so to the
[39:04.700 --> 39:07.740]  french shows everybody so america still has a lot of soft
[39:07.740 --> 39:12.620]  power with people around the world we can get back to people admiring us and
[39:12.620 --> 39:16.220]  liking us and thinking of us as the good guys who stop letting a bunch of blue
[39:16.220 --> 39:20.060]  blood east coast globalists i'm not bashing you live on the east coast i
[39:20.060 --> 39:23.180]  mean the the harvard people the the white shoe boys
[39:23.180 --> 39:26.300]  that jose lente talks about i think they're better than everybody
[39:26.300 --> 39:28.860]  we got to just say no you're not better than everybody you don't control
[39:28.860 --> 39:33.020]  reality you're not history's actors and you're crazy and you've wrecked the ship
[39:33.020 --> 39:36.140]  and you're not in control anymore do you understand you're not our gods
[39:36.140 --> 39:39.260]  you're not our owners i don't care that you have big you know coke bottle
[39:39.260 --> 39:43.740]  glasses and a chicken neck get out of the way move get out of the way
[39:43.740 --> 39:48.460]  get out of the way you see them headlights i mean we are behind you we
[39:48.460 --> 39:51.420]  want you out of the way we do not want you ruling our life
[39:51.420 --> 39:54.860]  and being our gatekeepers anymore get off our backs okay we see you
[39:54.860 --> 40:00.620]  your pseudo-electrical garbage we're done that said we have to be very vigilant
[40:00.620 --> 40:05.100]  we are away from being out of the woods but i am seeing a lot of signs that the
[40:05.100 --> 40:09.260]  enemy's being demoralized they're giving up right now at least for now
[40:09.260 --> 40:11.740]  that doesn't mean they won't try to assassinate trump it doesn't mean they
[40:11.740 --> 40:14.860]  won't try to crash helicopter full of c4 or the inauguration
[40:14.860 --> 40:17.740]  it doesn't mean they won't try to crash the economy and they blame it on trump
[40:17.740 --> 40:21.980]  they're already doing that i don't even think i got to that clip
[40:21.980 --> 40:26.460]  yes i think i played it once where you know they've got the editor of the
[40:26.460 --> 40:30.060]  wash them posts saying me and trump are going to crash the world economy
[40:30.060 --> 40:33.740]  well that's what soros does all over the world again they're always
[40:33.740 --> 40:38.300]  projecting everything they do onto us and quite frankly i am super honored by
[40:38.300 --> 40:41.660]  this all right folks back to the main transmission

[40:57.180 --> 41:01.820]  making it up just look where we are now i mean all over the world
[41:01.820 --> 41:06.140]  our brand of nationalism and of americana and of understanding that it's the
[41:06.140 --> 41:09.180]  globalist crime syndicate is taking over because it's
[41:09.180 --> 41:15.580]  reality reality is trumping the fraud the mass wave of garbage and i salute you

[44:29.900 --> 44:32.700]  of course julie nasange made an appearance on
[44:32.700 --> 44:37.340]  sean hanity last night much anticipated we're going to delve into some of these
[44:37.340 --> 44:39.500]  clips and then talk about it afterwards
[44:39.500 --> 44:44.940]  given the new hysteria about russia that we're seeing once again in the media
[44:44.940 --> 44:49.740]  today the first clip is nasange elaborates on sources and russian hacking
[44:49.740 --> 44:53.340]  here it is i know you want to protect your sources
[44:53.340 --> 44:56.860]  and you when you first told me on my radio show
[44:56.860 --> 45:00.620]  that it was not russia you said so reluctantly
[45:00.620 --> 45:05.580]  can i ask take it one step further can you say that the source was within the
[45:05.580 --> 45:08.380]  united states
[45:08.380 --> 45:15.260]  i don't want to constrain whether it was someone
[45:15.260 --> 45:21.900]  inside the united states in the dnc in the service providers
[45:21.900 --> 45:26.700]  that provide the dnc or outside etc i think we have already pushed it quite
[45:26.700 --> 45:29.660]  a lot more than you would like more than we
[45:29.660 --> 45:32.220]  would like by saying it's not a state party
[45:32.220 --> 45:36.940]  but that was necessary to do because
[45:36.940 --> 45:41.340]  there was in a serious attempt to distract
[45:41.340 --> 45:45.740]  from the contents about publications with this russian narrative
[45:45.740 --> 45:49.180]  now our sources are interested in two things
[45:49.180 --> 45:52.860]  they're interested in protecting their identity but also
[45:52.860 --> 45:59.340]  not going through all that effort and risk themselves
[45:59.340 --> 46:02.940]  only to have the publication undermined then what do you make of the president
[46:02.940 --> 46:07.420]  of the united states and donald trump may in the next 24 to 48 hours
[46:07.420 --> 46:10.860]  contradict with whatever information he's teasing that he
[46:10.860 --> 46:15.900]  does have but he made a decision to expel 35 russian diplomats
[46:15.900 --> 46:20.460]  in two sites impose 12 sanctions against the russian government
[46:20.460 --> 46:26.140]  and you know the russian president putin responded by inviting children to a
[46:26.140 --> 46:29.740]  christmas party and said he will wait to deal with the new president
[46:29.740 --> 46:34.300]  what are you why would the president you're saying that russia did not give
[46:34.300 --> 46:39.420]  you this information he is very closely suggesting that in fact they
[46:39.420 --> 46:42.860]  did and he's wrong is so my question is does he
[46:42.860 --> 46:46.300]  know he's wrong and from your perspective he has to know he's playing
[46:46.300 --> 46:48.860]  games he's playing games he's playing games he's
[46:48.860 --> 46:52.300]  dishonest fair is he lying to the american people
[46:52.300 --> 46:57.980]  like a lawyer instead of being honest so uh he's playing playing games by
[46:57.980 --> 47:02.140]  trying to suggest that russia quote hacked the election
[47:02.140 --> 47:07.500]  unquote uh pretending that what's going on here is
[47:07.500 --> 47:12.620]  russia hacking voting machines uh for which there is no evidence
[47:12.620 --> 47:17.420]  then uh saying without suggesting without saying
[47:17.420 --> 47:21.420]  that uh our information was part of a plot
[47:21.420 --> 47:26.060]  to get donald trump elected uh once once again
[47:26.060 --> 47:29.980]  from our side which we understand there's no evidence but even
[47:29.980 --> 47:33.660]  james clapper and so on coming out and saying uh we don't know how we he
[47:33.660 --> 47:37.260]  thinks we don't know when or how we he thinks about this information
[47:37.260 --> 47:44.860]  so it it's a it's a construction to try and uh erect the topic
[47:44.860 --> 47:49.500]  that donald trump is illegitimately elected
[47:49.500 --> 47:53.740]  so what is the reaction to this the frothing hysteria from the fake news
[47:53.740 --> 47:57.100]  media that we see today and even people like paul ryan this is out the
[47:57.100 --> 48:00.060]  washington times paul ryan calls julia nissanja
[48:00.060 --> 48:03.660]  sycophant for russia and again this is a narrative that we've heard over and
[48:03.660 --> 48:06.860]  over again because assange had a show on russia today
[48:06.860 --> 48:11.340]  four years ago eight episodes that means he's working for the kremlin
[48:11.340 --> 48:15.260]  okay how many times have i been on arty how many times has alex jones been on
[48:15.260 --> 48:19.820]  on arty how many times have they asked us to be on arty dozens and dozens does
[48:19.820 --> 48:22.700]  that mean we're taking paychecks from the kremlin
[48:22.700 --> 48:26.860]  no it was a forum it was a platform that he used okay the fact that sarge
[48:26.860 --> 48:30.300]  appeared on arty is not proof that russia hacked the
[48:30.300 --> 48:34.620]  presidential election you're gonna have to do a bit better than that
[48:34.620 --> 48:39.660]  this is his quote this is paul ryan talking about julia nissanja
[48:39.660 --> 48:43.980]  i think the guy is a sycophant for russia he leaks he steals data and
[48:43.980 --> 48:48.780]  compromises national security okay so paul ryan is calling the head of an
[48:48.780 --> 48:53.180]  organization called wiki leaks his main charge is that he
[48:53.180 --> 48:56.940]  quote leaks right okay bombshell insult there
[48:56.940 --> 49:00.940]  from paul ryan the clue is is kind of in the name you know wiki leaks
[49:00.940 --> 49:04.780]  so again no evidence whatsoever absolutely literally
[49:04.780 --> 49:10.060]  zero evidence that julia nissanja is working for russia
[49:10.060 --> 49:15.100]  yet paul ryan comes out with this quote again this is out of usa today trump
[49:15.100 --> 49:18.940]  sites the sarge claim about us hacking about russia hacking
[49:18.940 --> 49:22.940]  they quote senator charles schumer democratic new york so even for a
[49:22.940 --> 49:25.340]  practical supposed hard-nosed businessman
[49:25.340 --> 49:30.220]  he's really being done to do this they then quote senator tom
[49:30.220 --> 49:35.180]  cotton republican from arkansas who said quote i have a lot more faith in our
[49:35.180 --> 49:40.380]  intelligence officers than in people like julia nissanja so again
[49:40.380 --> 49:44.780]  you have wiki leaks a 10-year track record of accuracy
[49:44.780 --> 49:48.460]  versus the us intelligence community which has
[49:48.460 --> 49:52.300]  a multi-decade track record of deception
[49:52.300 --> 49:56.860]  and lies that's not a surprise given that's a whole raisin detra right
[49:56.860 --> 50:01.340]  you know a track record of saying that arming the moderate rebels in syria
[50:01.340 --> 50:05.260]  is the best most logical way to topple a sad oh no it's not going to lead to the
[50:05.260 --> 50:08.220]  rise of jihadist groups it's not going to lead to the rise of isis
[50:08.220 --> 50:12.060]  oh wait we found out that that's exactly what they intended it
[50:12.060 --> 50:15.260]  to be that was the whole agenda back in the first place that's why they were
[50:15.260 --> 50:19.580]  selling arms out of Benghazi to build up these rebel groups
[50:19.580 --> 50:23.260]  oh but the intel said we could arm the moderate rebels and all would be hunky
[50:23.260 --> 50:27.340]  dory again their track record is deception
[50:27.340 --> 50:34.380]  is lies is chaos is bloodshed julia nissanja his track record and he's
[50:34.380 --> 50:37.820]  pleased people on the right with trump he's pleased people on the left with
[50:37.820 --> 50:42.940]  his organization's releases about the iraq war so he doesn't have a
[50:42.940 --> 50:48.220]  dog in this game and their credibility has an absolutely perfect
[50:48.220 --> 50:53.020]  track record yet still we see this complete hysterical
[50:53.020 --> 50:57.500]  freakout about russia backed by zero evidence will be back on the alexiom

[54:01.020 --> 54:20.860]  so speaker of the house paul ryan says that julien assange is a sicker fan for russia
[54:20.860 --> 54:25.100]  again that claim is backed up by the same amount of evidence backing up the
[54:25.100 --> 54:28.380]  claim that russia hacked the us election i.e.
[54:28.380 --> 54:33.420]  zero the pylon against trump the pylon against assange continues
[54:33.420 --> 54:37.500]  by the establishment by the mainstream media despite them
[54:37.500 --> 54:42.220]  trashing their credibility once again last week with this washington post
[54:42.220 --> 54:45.660]  report that said russia had penetrated the
[54:45.660 --> 54:49.820]  us electronic grid they didn't even contact the utility
[54:49.820 --> 54:54.380]  companies to get a statement those same utility companies came out an hour
[54:54.380 --> 54:57.100]  and a half later said the washington post story
[54:57.100 --> 55:01.500]  was complete bs all the washington post had done it is
[55:01.500 --> 55:06.060]  basically reprinted a press release by the department of home and security
[55:06.060 --> 55:10.540]  the laptop was not connected to the utility company in the grid
[55:10.540 --> 55:14.220]  it had malware on it that was on the internet anyway
[55:14.220 --> 55:18.380]  no evidence that it came from russia yet donald trump's bad
[55:18.380 --> 55:22.140]  for believing the claims of julien assange over the claims
[55:22.140 --> 55:26.140]  of the us intel community that comes up again and again
[55:26.140 --> 55:32.060]  with this baseless nonsense let's go to the next clip this is assange talking
[55:32.060 --> 55:35.820]  about threats to his family very interesting clip
[55:35.820 --> 55:39.740]  here's assange with sean hannisy from last night's interview
[55:39.740 --> 55:43.100]  i have been detained illegally without charge
[55:43.100 --> 55:46.540]  for six years in prison under house arrest
[55:46.540 --> 55:51.500]  four and a half years in this embassy without sunlight lots of spies everywhere
[55:51.500 --> 55:57.100]  etc it's tough it's tough but that's the mission
[55:57.100 --> 56:01.340]  that i set myself on so i'm willing to accept that
[56:01.340 --> 56:05.740]  i understand that the kind of game that's being played with you know
[56:05.740 --> 56:10.220]  big powerful actors they try and take revenge okay
[56:10.220 --> 56:15.100]  it's a different thing for my family you know i have young children under 10 years
[56:15.100 --> 56:19.660]  old uh they didn't sign up for that okay
[56:19.660 --> 56:24.540]  i'm the type of father that they have but they didn't sign up for that
[56:24.540 --> 56:29.580]  that's not something i like and i think that is
[56:29.580 --> 56:36.060]  fundamentally unjust outcome for my children it's it's not a good
[56:36.060 --> 56:39.660]  precedent for other people to have as well but that would be my
[56:39.660 --> 56:44.940]  one concern i know what i'm doing i'm prepared to
[56:44.940 --> 56:48.540]  have the the where the consequences of the conflict
[56:48.540 --> 56:51.820]  and dealing with powerful groups and individuals
[56:51.820 --> 56:59.580]  but my family is innocent uh in that equation they didn't sign up for that
[56:59.580 --> 57:03.180]  fight so again why is assange now talking
[57:03.180 --> 57:06.060]  about concerns about powerful actors
[57:06.060 --> 57:09.260]  potentially threatening his family that's basically what he's intimating
[57:09.260 --> 57:13.100]  there without saying it outright well there's a person called
[57:13.100 --> 57:18.860]  seth rich who was murdered back in july again a dnc staffer he was almost
[57:18.860 --> 57:20.940]  certainly the source of the wiki leaks for the
[57:20.940 --> 57:26.940]  pedestrian emails in the dnc leaks a robbery nothing was taken
[57:26.940 --> 57:31.500]  unsolved remains unsolved to this day and who did
[57:31.500 --> 57:35.820]  who got appointed to be the spokesman for the family immediately after his
[57:35.820 --> 57:38.460]  murder well it was somebody with deep connections
[57:38.460 --> 57:44.620]  to the dnc what was the first thing they said this has no connection to the dnc
[57:44.620 --> 57:47.740]  leaks again they got out of that story ahead of time
[57:47.740 --> 57:52.860]  that is why assange is communicating the fact he's concerned about threats
[57:52.860 --> 57:55.900]  towards his family remember wiki leaks offered
[57:55.900 --> 58:01.340]  20 000 for information leading to the capture of seth rich as killer
[58:01.340 --> 58:04.860]  several other people offered large cash sums as well in fact i think he's up to
[58:04.860 --> 58:09.500]  about almost 200 000 on the table for information
[58:09.500 --> 58:13.420]  leading to seth the capture of seth rich as killer
[58:13.420 --> 58:17.500]  so that's why assange is going on record saying that he's now
[58:17.500 --> 58:21.660]  concerned for his safety because again in this interview
[58:21.660 --> 58:26.860]  he intimated that not russia not a state actor but seth rich and other people
[58:26.860 --> 58:31.340]  connected to him within the dnc structure were responsible
[58:31.340 --> 58:34.860]  for the leaks now he feels threatened that he could be
[58:34.860 --> 58:39.100]  again under attack from the same forces will be back on the alex germshaw live

[1:00:22.860 --> 1:00:26.140]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:29.500]  it's alex jones
[1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:37.100]  julien assange speaking about powerful forces that have threatened his family
[1:00:37.100 --> 1:00:40.140]  during an interview with sean hannity yesterday
[1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:44.700]  this is what arty is reporting today wikileaks offers $20,000 reward
[1:00:44.700 --> 1:00:48.780]  to prevent obama government destroying us history
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:52.460]  wikileaks is offering a $20,000 reward for information relating to any
[1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:56.380]  destruction of records by a member of the obama administration however
[1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:59.900]  has not made any specific allegations that the administration
[1:00:59.900 --> 1:01:04.780]  inappropriately eradicated material so again they're asking for information
[1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:08.220]  leading to the arrest or exposure of any obama
[1:01:08.220 --> 1:01:12.780]  admin agent destroying significant records
[1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:17.100]  wikileaks is not done with revelations as it pertains to the obama
[1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:21.500]  administration if this story is anything to go by and it's unsurprising
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:25.660]  that he's making enemies again while the mainstream media
[1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:30.700]  remains transfixed with the biggest conspiracy theory in years
[1:01:30.700 --> 1:01:35.420]  that russia hacked the u.s presidential election for which there's no evidence
[1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:39.020]  remember they had the poll it was a couple of weeks ago now
[1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:43.740]  they asked hillary clinton supporters if they believed these claims not only
[1:01:43.740 --> 1:01:47.820]  that russia influenced the u.s presidential election but that russia
[1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:54.060]  directly hacked the voting machines 50 percent of respondents 50 percent of
[1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:58.780]  hillary clinton supporters thought that russia had actually hacked the voting
[1:01:58.780 --> 1:02:01.500]  machines that's how fundamentally misled they were
[1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.620]  let's go to the third assange clip this is assange talking about
[1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:08.620]  media collusion here's the clip that was bogus but
[1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:13.500]  there's another side of this which is i think pretty fascinating that is
[1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:17.660]  that hillary rotham clinton had a private server
[1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:21.180]  at a mom and pop shop in a bathroom closet
[1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:25.660]  that i would argue and other lawyers would make arguments that it was
[1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:30.860]  illegal for her to have from what we understand the podesta emails were hacked
[1:02:30.860 --> 1:02:33.900]  through a phishing scheme where it said click on this give us your
[1:02:33.900 --> 1:02:38.620]  information and he did so well there's a number of
[1:02:38.620 --> 1:02:43.020]  hacks to the dnc uh and podesta based on the publicly
[1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:45.340]  available information this is not something coming
[1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:49.500]  from our sources uh we published as part of our
[1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:53.180]  policy of full disclosure not interfering with material
[1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:58.380]  we published the several podesta emails which shows
[1:02:58.380 --> 1:03:02.860]  podesta uh responding to a phishing email now
[1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:07.660]  how did they respond but podesta gave out that his
[1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:14.860]  password was the word password his own staff said
[1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:19.100]  this email that you've received uh this is totally legitimate
[1:03:19.100 --> 1:03:24.140]  so this is something a 14 year old kid a 14 year old kid
[1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:30.380]  uh could have hacked uh based on that so again the media has this and
[1:03:30.380 --> 1:03:35.660]  this whole narrative about these sophisticated dark russian actors
[1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:39.420]  hacking with expert knowledge the u.s presidential election
[1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:44.940]  it was literally john podesta they sent him a fake email pretending to be a
[1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:49.100]  company email service provider that he's affiliated with
[1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:53.500]  telling him that he needed to change his password asking him for his password
[1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:59.740]  his password was the word password these are the people who are about to be in
[1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:03.420]  charge of the u.s government and his password for his
[1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:08.140]  email account is password not only that he then asked
[1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:11.900]  other members of the clinton campaign if this was a legitimate email
[1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:15.820]  if he should respond to this or if it's posed a threat and they all said no this
[1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:19.180]  is perfectly legitimate you can respond to this
[1:04:19.180 --> 1:04:22.940]  that's how they got his password it wasn't russian hackers
[1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:26.220]  it could have been anyone there was no need to hack
[1:04:26.220 --> 1:04:31.340]  he gave them his password which was password again that is a detail
[1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:35.340]  rarely brought up by the media while they hysterically obsess about
[1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:39.500]  fake news stories about russian hackers hacking the electronic grid
[1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:42.540]  they're just aren't true complete nonsense again and again
[1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:46.620]  this whole russian hacking narrative has taken the focus away from the fact
[1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:50.700]  that the information in the podesta emails in the dnc leaks was
[1:04:50.700 --> 1:04:56.060]  accurate information relevant to the american voter right before the
[1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:57.900]  election that's what they don't tell you will be
[1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:01.500]  by on the alex jones show stay tuned
[1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:06.460]  wikileaks founder julian assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge
[1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:09.660]  by targeting his family during his interview with sean hannity
[1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:13.500]  assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played but his
[1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:16.780]  family including his young children under 10 years old
[1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:20.620]  didn't sign up for that mission suggesting powerful actors would take
[1:05:20.620 --> 1:05:23.900]  revenge by targeting his family assange once again
[1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:28.780]  reiterated that wikileaks source for the dnc and john podesta documents was not
[1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:32.940]  russia or any state actor although he refused to name sources
[1:05:32.940 --> 1:05:36.380]  assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion
[1:05:36.380 --> 1:05:41.420]  that murdered dnc staffer seth rich was the source for the dnc leaks rich was
[1:05:41.420 --> 1:05:46.060]  mysteriously murdered on july 10th in a case that remains unsolved wikileaks
[1:05:46.060 --> 1:05:49.900]  subsequently offered 20 000 for information leading to the
[1:05:49.900 --> 1:05:54.060]  capture of his killer could assange's concerns over what happened to seth rich
[1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:57.180]  be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family

[1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:39.180]  the show with some more rants but for the moment we're going to go to our
[1:08:39.180 --> 1:08:42.540]  guest he is jason kessler journalist and author the
[1:08:42.540 --> 1:08:46.700]  website is jason kessler dot net and he's been in the news recently
[1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:50.780]  probably didn't see this this didn't make many national headlines
[1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:54.620]  but it was a big story locally for reasons that we're going to dive into
[1:08:54.620 --> 1:08:58.460]  right now jason welcome to the show
[1:09:00.460 --> 1:09:04.780]  yeah i don't have jason's audio there if you can fix that
[1:09:04.780 --> 1:09:08.780]  all right all right let's get straight to it then jason break it down for us
[1:09:08.780 --> 1:09:13.580]  who is wes bellamy what did he say you know take it from the beginning and how
[1:09:13.580 --> 1:09:17.180]  did it lead you to spearheading this movement against him
[1:09:17.180 --> 1:09:20.860]  okay so basically i usually don't pay very much attention to
[1:09:20.860 --> 1:09:24.540]  local politics i like national politics and big issues
[1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:28.220]  but there's this vice mayor of charlesville where i live
[1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:33.340]  who is just totally obnoxious black lives matter racist
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:37.420]  everything he does is race race race he never is working on fixing
[1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:42.860]  roads or water purity anything like that what he does
[1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:45.900]  is he's trying to spend seven hundred thousand dollars
[1:09:45.900 --> 1:09:49.980]  to move this robert e lee confederate statue from
[1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:56.780]  uh the park downtown uh he has also been in the news for boycotting a uba
[1:09:56.780 --> 1:10:01.500]  lecturer named dug mirror who put a facebook post where he said black lives
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:05.500]  matter is racist and this guy went crazy and he boycotted the
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:09.980]  guy's restaurant and so forth so i thought well let me look into
[1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:13.740]  wes bellamy's social media and see what he has to say
[1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.100]  and i went on to his twitter and i searched some keywords i searched
[1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:21.340]  white i searched black he had so many nasty things to say
[1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:24.620]  like he said uh white women are the devil
[1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:29.100]  he said he hates black people who talk white he said my favorite thing about
[1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:32.540]  being down south is seeing the look on the faces of little white men when they
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:37.820]  have to look up to a black man he also said uh it ain't rape if she moans
[1:10:37.820 --> 1:10:40.380]  talking about having sex with a sleeping woman
[1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:45.500]  he's just ridiculous but despite these far left city counselors being so
[1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:48.140]  against trump for things he said which were not
[1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:52.220]  nearly as bad they won't even condemn what he said and the media is trying to
[1:10:52.220 --> 1:10:56.940]  cover it up so you discovered these tweets and again
[1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:00.060]  we showed some of them there in the article we're putting them up on screen
[1:11:00.060 --> 1:11:05.340]  now absolutely vile vulgar tweets this guy is a vice mayor
[1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:08.780]  you draw attention to this i guess the media picks it up
[1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:12.060]  tell us what happened between that moment and then when you got to the
[1:11:12.060 --> 1:11:15.580]  meeting which was uh in the headlines a few weeks ago
[1:11:15.580 --> 1:11:19.180]  well here's an interesting tidbit that the local media and even the national
[1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:22.540]  media did not cover this guy went to the white house the very
[1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:26.380]  day after this story broke i i broke the story on uh
[1:11:26.380 --> 1:11:30.140]  Thanksgiving the day after Thanksgiving he was at the white house
[1:11:30.140 --> 1:11:34.460]  no one knows why he was there but this is sort of one of these chosen ones
[1:11:34.460 --> 1:11:39.580]  of barack obama and black lives matter and they had a pow wow to try and see
[1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:42.620]  how they were going to deal with it uh thankfully
[1:11:42.620 --> 1:11:47.420]  the virginia legislator is republican controlled so they put some pressure
[1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:51.660]  on the legislator this guy is was actually one of nine people
[1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:55.020]  hand selected to be on the virginia board of education
[1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:58.700]  this guy is a black supremacist he hates white people
[1:11:58.700 --> 1:12:04.300]  he's down with this uh george chicario's decolonization theories and he was
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:08.220]  one of only nine people deciding what goes in textbooks for the entire state
[1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:11.500]  of virginia so we got him to step down from there
[1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:17.980]  then uh all these people came forward trying to look at what i had written
[1:12:17.980 --> 1:12:21.740]  obviously they were going to do that i didn't i don't have anything where i'm
[1:12:21.740 --> 1:12:26.540]  using slurs against people or whatever but i have talked about i like going on
[1:12:26.540 --> 1:12:30.540]  for chan you know i've talked about um
[1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:35.100]  the alt right before the alt right was basically shanghai by this whole
[1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:39.900]  atlantic and richard spencer then so they started calling me oh you're a
[1:12:39.900 --> 1:12:45.420]  alt right racist nazi they went crazy and there was basically a mob for me at
[1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:49.260]  the next city council meeting when i came to speak
[1:12:49.260 --> 1:12:53.900]  so this this guy put out these tweets the controversy was about him
[1:12:53.900 --> 1:12:57.260]  he should be the one at least apologizing other people should be
[1:12:57.260 --> 1:13:00.780]  disavowing him and yet the exact opposite happened
[1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:04.460]  all the blm activists which you would expect rallied around him
[1:13:04.460 --> 1:13:07.420]  again you said the mob turned out in hatred against you
[1:13:07.420 --> 1:13:12.140]  and then at this meeting didn't these counselors support him by at first
[1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:16.540]  claiming that his account had been hacked and these tweets weren't even real
[1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:20.060]  yeah they did that they put out uh false statements i mean these city
[1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:25.340]  counselors are so far left wing and i'm telling you there is a cabal a very
[1:13:25.340 --> 1:13:28.300]  powerful left-wing people here in charlesville
[1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:32.940]  that are connected to the national dnc and they are putting forward a lot of
[1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:35.980]  things like the uva rape hoax happened here
[1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:40.380]  somebody was telling sabrina eerily come here you can do your uh fake rape
[1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.220]  story here kazir khan lives here and somebody is
[1:13:44.220 --> 1:13:48.300]  pushing these people to the national media so you have some very powerful
[1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:53.100]  connected people uh who are very upset about losing
[1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:56.700]  the election losing to trump in a big way and they
[1:13:56.700 --> 1:14:00.620]  doubled down they said we're not even going to condemn what he said
[1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:04.540]  only the mayor said something slightly uh off about that
[1:14:04.540 --> 1:14:08.060]  and i can tell you we need to make this a national issue
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:11.500]  uh we need to make sure that any of these people that are supporting this kind
[1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:14.780]  of anti-white racism that we cannot allow these double
[1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:18.460]  standards to happen these people should not have careers anymore if they are
[1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:22.540]  going to stand behind somebody like this and it is this whole double
[1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:26.300]  standard if you had a conservative vice mayor a counselor or anyone
[1:14:26.300 --> 1:14:31.020]  who had gone on twitter who had spouted racism you know 38 black people
[1:14:31.020 --> 1:14:35.420]  talked about raping women i mean you can say oh it was just a joke but then
[1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:39.660]  you've got to have the same standard for both sides of the equation if the shoe
[1:14:39.660 --> 1:14:42.700]  was on the other four that guy would have been fired would have
[1:14:42.700 --> 1:14:46.300]  resigned within hours of that controversy breaking out because it
[1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:49.980]  would have been picked up by the mainstream media nationally
[1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:53.820]  so what happened at the council meeting basically as far as i understand it
[1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:58.540]  he was forced to give some kind of uh meek apology and that was basically it
[1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:02.060]  correct yeah he gave a meek apology and he didn't
[1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:07.180]  uh and they just ignored the thing and uh they tried to go on with business as
[1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:10.700]  usual and let me talk to you a little bit about your
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:14.540]  point which is a good point if even one of those tweets have been said by a
[1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:18.140]  white person for instance he said white women are the devil
[1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:22.300]  that one's one of the more mild tweets if a white person and said black women
[1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:24.860]  are the devil he would be gone he would be finished
[1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:28.940]  everywhere uh immediately and that is why this
[1:15:28.940 --> 1:15:33.660]  struggle is so important and why this is not just a local thing to deal with
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:38.380]  you know this uh vice mayor who has visited the white house and so forth
[1:15:38.380 --> 1:15:42.540]  this is about changing attitudes and changing perceptions
[1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:46.620]  because i'm fighting against a media that does not want to talk about racism
[1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:49.820]  against white people but i am forcing the issue
[1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:54.700]  uh that he will not step down these people are trying to keep it so that he
[1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:57.580]  does not step down but there is a legal process
[1:15:57.580 --> 1:16:01.260]  through which you get a certain number of signatures and there is a recall
[1:16:01.260 --> 1:16:05.420]  and i am in touch with some national people and i want to make this
[1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:09.820]  a big story if these people think it's acceptable for this guy to stay
[1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:13.420]  after he has said the hateful things he's had to say about white people
[1:16:13.420 --> 1:16:17.820]  no and i'm going to make a national example out of him
[1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:22.540]  and it goes back to anyone invoking supporting black lives matter who is
[1:16:22.540 --> 1:16:25.020]  in a position of government you have to ask
[1:16:25.020 --> 1:16:29.100]  serious questions about them this is an organization that was literally
[1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:32.860]  their ideological inspiration assata chicor
[1:16:32.860 --> 1:16:36.860]  the ideological inspiration of black lives matter the name who they shout at
[1:16:36.860 --> 1:16:40.780]  every single rally she is a convicted cop killer
[1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:45.500]  in exile on the fbi's most wanted domestic terrorist list
[1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:48.700]  that is the ideological guru of black lives matter
[1:16:48.700 --> 1:16:53.500]  they chant for dead cops routinely we've played the videos
[1:16:53.500 --> 1:16:56.780]  we saw what happened in delos we saw what happened in baton rouge
[1:16:56.780 --> 1:17:01.980]  this is at the least a domestic extremist organization if not a domestic
[1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:05.980]  terrorist organization this is an even more virulent form of the
[1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:09.980]  weathermen they've encouraged they've inspired violence we've had
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:13.260]  dead cops dead cops both black and white because
[1:17:13.260 --> 1:17:16.140]  of this rhetoric so again it's absolutely
[1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:20.300]  unconscionable that obama has allied himself directly with this movement
[1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:23.900]  that even to the point now it's so ingrained in the culture they've got
[1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.700]  their own emoji on twitter for god's sake
[1:17:26.700 --> 1:17:31.260]  imagine if a if a white supremacist group whose ideological inspiration was
[1:17:31.260 --> 1:17:35.100]  timothy mcveigh the oklahoma city bomber was this
[1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.580]  active would they get support from the
[1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:40.620]  establishment from the mainstream media
[1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:44.940]  absolutely not and i think that we have a golden opportunity here with this
[1:17:44.940 --> 1:17:49.420]  west bellamy guy because he was dumb enough to say what he actually
[1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:52.860]  thought on twitter and don't kid yourself all these black
[1:17:52.860 --> 1:17:57.820]  lives matter people they hate white people they are a supremacist ideology
[1:17:57.820 --> 1:18:02.780]  they are people who are very violent and cause riots and so forth
[1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:05.980]  so what we have here is an opportunity where one of them
[1:18:05.980 --> 1:18:10.860]  has revealed himself this is a powerful guy he's got organizations that he started
[1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:15.820]  like 100 black men you know it's a racial solidarity group
[1:18:15.820 --> 1:18:19.740]  and this is something that he's exploited his entire
[1:18:19.740 --> 1:18:24.060]  career is this sort of black supremacist ideology
[1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:27.180]  so i think that what we want to do is we want to make
[1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:31.660]  west bellamy the poster boy for black lives matter and show them
[1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:35.660]  and you have on the screen right now a tweet that he made about thomas jefferson
[1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:39.900]  he's not only trying to uh take down the statue
[1:18:39.900 --> 1:18:45.580]  of robert e lee this guy and his black lives matter cohorts want to go after
[1:18:45.580 --> 1:18:49.500]  all of our history they want to destroy the history of western civilization
[1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:54.380]  charlesville virginia is basically known as the home of thomas jefferson
[1:18:54.380 --> 1:18:59.420]  his monicello is here he started uba this is the guy who is responsible for
[1:18:59.420 --> 1:19:02.860]  the declaration of independence the bill of rights this is
[1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:08.380]  uh where all of our human rights in this country and freedoms come from
[1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:11.820]  and what they want to do is reduce people like thomas jefferson
[1:19:11.820 --> 1:19:15.500]  to villains his caricatures of the evil slave master
[1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:20.140]  then and he has a tweet where he's saying thomas jefferson is next
[1:19:20.140 --> 1:19:23.260]  and and don't kid yourself that's what all these people want to do
[1:19:23.260 --> 1:19:27.180]  they want to get on to the virginia board of education and they want to push
[1:19:27.180 --> 1:19:31.180]  this stuff white people are the only ones who are uh racist
[1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:36.300]  and look at colonialism and and white people and slavery
[1:19:36.300 --> 1:19:40.700]  and they try and portray it in a very false way as if we are the only ones
[1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:45.180]  who had slaves we're the ones who ended slavery
[1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:48.860]  and we're gonna get more into that after the break with jason kessler jason
[1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:52.220]  kessler dot net we're gonna go on to talk about how basically they've
[1:19:52.220 --> 1:19:56.620]  made anti-white racism trendy in the culture and if that is
[1:19:56.620 --> 1:20:01.500]  about to be overturned we'll be back live on the alex jome show don't go away

[1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:21.340]  we're back on the election show live talking to Jason Kessler who is spear
[1:24:21.340 --> 1:24:25.580]  heading a movement to one city Wes Bellamy the vice mayor there in
[1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:29.420]  Charlottesville again this extraordinary double standard on the
[1:24:29.420 --> 1:24:32.620]  left whenever a conservative whether in government
[1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:36.060]  or not even if it's somebody in entertainment or whatever spear
[1:24:36.060 --> 1:24:41.420]  tweet something mildly offensive the outrage mob is sicked upon them
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:45.340]  instantly they must instantly back down and apologize
[1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:49.500]  and even then in fact what you see mostly is when they apologize
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:53.900]  it only gets worse then they see they smell blood and seek even greater
[1:24:53.900 --> 1:24:59.180]  consequences but on the left again these counselors rallied
[1:24:59.180 --> 1:25:03.020]  around this guy despite these absolutely vulgar tweets
[1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:06.540]  about women about white people flagrantly racist
[1:25:06.540 --> 1:25:10.700]  actually sexist tweets what does his fellow leftist colleagues do
[1:25:10.700 --> 1:25:14.620]  they rallied around him they tried to claim that his account had been hacked
[1:25:14.620 --> 1:25:17.500]  they had to back away from that ridiculous excuse
[1:25:17.500 --> 1:25:21.660]  and still they support him uh Jason finish we're going to talk about the
[1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:25.500]  directional professor in a minute but wasn't there one of the counselors at
[1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:28.940]  this meeting who even tried to suggest that you were making a
[1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:33.180]  death threat against Bellamy because you said your days are numbered in a
[1:25:33.180 --> 1:25:37.260]  political sense yeah um so i have this petition
[1:25:37.260 --> 1:25:40.780]  and he's going to get out of office um this is
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:43.980]  the tide of history and the tide of history is
[1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:47.580]  so far been to allow this racism against white people
[1:25:47.580 --> 1:25:52.140]  and to allow this double standard i'm swimming upstream but i'm going to get
[1:25:52.140 --> 1:25:54.940]  to the end point which is to take this guy to court
[1:25:54.940 --> 1:25:59.500]  and to have a trial to say this guy has said things that are discriminatory
[1:25:59.500 --> 1:26:03.740]  against white people he is unacceptable and he's also shown a pattern
[1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:07.340]  of discriminatory behavior in the way that he's tried to
[1:26:07.340 --> 1:26:11.340]  attack this confederate statue of Robert E. Lee which is of ethnic
[1:26:11.340 --> 1:26:14.220]  significance to southern white people he has uh
[1:26:14.220 --> 1:26:18.780]  attacked this UVA lecture Doug Muir and i'd like to just bring up Doug Muir
[1:26:18.780 --> 1:26:21.500]  again for a second when you talk about this double standard
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:26.060]  what Doug Muir said and i think you guys have an image of that tweet as well
[1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:30.140]  he was joking with somebody he is a conservative
[1:26:30.140 --> 1:26:36.700]  guy uh who happens to work at UVA and he was having a banter with a guy who
[1:26:36.700 --> 1:26:39.340]  was saying oh i'm not going to go to the Trump winery
[1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:43.340]  because Trump is like Hitler so this guy said well black lives matter is racist
[1:26:43.340 --> 1:26:47.420]  they're the worst since the Klan you know kind of using a little bit of hyperbole
[1:26:47.420 --> 1:26:50.140]  there um even though i agree with the premise
[1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:54.700]  that black lives matter is racist and this story made international
[1:26:54.700 --> 1:26:58.540]  headlines he had to take a leave from his job
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:02.620]  he received death threats his children and his wife received death threats
[1:27:02.620 --> 1:27:07.260]  he was forced to apologize to keep his job it was reported as far as the daily
[1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:10.620]  mail in the UK and yet and what happened was this
[1:27:10.620 --> 1:27:14.460]  West Bellamy guy called for a boycott on his restaurant
[1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:18.460]  just for a political opinion about black lives matter
[1:27:18.460 --> 1:27:25.100]  and uh so when this guy uh is revealed for much worse things
[1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:29.900]  Doug Muir was voicing a political opinion which always has to be protected
[1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:33.660]  speech uh it's it's totally acceptable to criticize
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:37.180]  black lives matter but when you have a public leader who is saying
[1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:41.100]  i hate seeing white people around town i don't listen to white people at
[1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:44.940]  community meetings white women are the devil white women smell
[1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:49.340]  like assault charges in deli meat this is a guy who's just said things that are
[1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:54.540]  too discriminatory and a bias that shows he should not have power over
[1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:59.180]  other people now let's move on to this other story which is
[1:27:59.180 --> 1:28:03.660]  obviously connected George Ma this professor at Drexel tweeted all i want
[1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:07.980]  for christmas is white genocide again you can't have it both ways if you
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:11.980]  want to get completely outraged and call for people to be fired on the right
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:15.020]  for making jokes then the same standard has to apply for you
[1:28:15.020 --> 1:28:17.820]  the university came out you know initially they said
[1:28:17.820 --> 1:28:21.580]  this is quote utterly reprehensible it doesn't represent our values
[1:28:21.580 --> 1:28:24.940]  but then when he came back at them and claimed free speech they
[1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:28.860]  backed off and issued this watered down statement basically saying
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:33.020]  oh he was under you know he was misunderstood he's still in a job
[1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:36.620]  i mean jason what do you think would happen if a conservative professor
[1:28:36.620 --> 1:28:40.380]  had called for the mass genocide of black people would he still be in a job
[1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:43.340]  right now of course they'd be fired right away and
[1:28:43.340 --> 1:28:46.780]  that's not the kind of thing that should be uh
[1:28:46.780 --> 1:28:51.180]  permissible according to academic freedom what academic freedom
[1:28:51.180 --> 1:28:55.100]  should be given a wide leash because obviously we need to have a free
[1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:59.020]  exchange of ideas and free speech is a very sacred thing
[1:28:59.020 --> 1:29:01.980]  but when you're talking about the mass genocide of a people
[1:29:01.980 --> 1:29:05.820]  and calling for that that's over the line i mean what's the difference between
[1:29:05.820 --> 1:29:09.900]  this guy and bringing over you know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or
[1:29:09.900 --> 1:29:15.820]  somebody to talk about the benefits of jihad and this guy had a history
[1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:19.580]  of making these sweets he also said abolish the white race
[1:29:19.580 --> 1:29:24.300]  he said uh the massacre of whites where they were basically
[1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:27.980]  completely murdered and massacred in Haiti
[1:29:27.980 --> 1:29:33.900]  was a good thing indeed he said that whites are a pig majority uh this is
[1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:39.580]  the kind of thing where somebody has these are not just political opinions
[1:29:39.580 --> 1:29:46.940]  these are hateful uh racist uh biases and he should okay hold our thoughts jason
[1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:50.620]  kessler we'll be back after this break in four wars dot com
[1:29:50.620 --> 1:29:54.460]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:54.460 --> 1:30:01.500]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.500 --> 1:30:06.460]  wikileaks founder julian assange suggests powerful actors are taking revenge
[1:30:06.460 --> 1:30:09.660]  by targeting his family during his interview with shon hannity
[1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:13.500]  assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played but his
[1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:16.780]  family including his young children under 10 years old
[1:30:16.780 --> 1:30:20.620]  didn't sign up for that mission suggesting powerful actors would take
[1:30:20.620 --> 1:30:23.900]  revenge by targeting his family assange once again
[1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:28.540]  reiterated that wikileaks' source for the dnc and jon padesta documents was
[1:30:28.540 --> 1:30:32.940]  not russia or any state actor although he refused to name sources
[1:30:32.940 --> 1:30:36.380]  assange has indicated on more than one previous occasion
[1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:41.500]  that murdered dnc staffer seth rich was the source for the dnc leaks rich was
[1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:46.140]  mysteriously murdered on july 10th in a case that remains unsolved wikileaks
[1:30:46.140 --> 1:30:49.980]  subsequently offered 20 000 for information leading to the
[1:30:49.980 --> 1:30:54.140]  capture of his killer could assange's concerns over what happened to seth rich
[1:30:54.140 --> 1:30:57.260]  be the reason why he is now putting his fears for his family

[1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:42.860]  gear they're stockpiling food but if you do it you're a coup can you're a
[1:33:42.860 --> 1:33:45.740]  conspiracy theorist over the past year info wars has
[1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:49.420]  been working with some of the top special operators in the united states to
[1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:53.420]  source you the absolute highest quality and affordable body armor out there
[1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:56.700]  our team of former blackwater operators and army rangers
[1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:00.140]  analyzed and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies for the
[1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:03.660]  stopping power and safety and we've teamed up with national

[1:34:15.100 --> 1:34:21.020]  it is tactical nano technology body armor again exclusively available
[1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:25.340]  info wars store dot com the government's preparing by buying this kind of
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:28.940]  product you know we have people across europe buying
[1:34:28.940 --> 1:34:32.940]  whatever they can get their hands on pepper spray or whatever
[1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:36.540]  this probably would be illegal over there because of the strife that's
[1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:40.060]  unfolding in countries such as germany and sweden
[1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:44.620]  this is only sensible that you do the same by getting this exciting new
[1:34:44.620 --> 1:34:49.660]  product at info wars store dot com and of course it supports
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:53.500]  this operation as we expand as we fight the mainstream media
[1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:56.780]  on a higher high level every single day we're going to go back to our guest
[1:34:56.780 --> 1:35:00.300]  though who is jason keslo we're talking about
[1:35:00.300 --> 1:35:04.060]  anti-white racism which has basically become
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:08.060]  the last acceptable form of racism in the west
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:11.500]  we had this wes bellamy this feist mere tweeting out all these uh
[1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:15.740]  vulgar tweets about hating white people misogynistic
[1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:19.820]  rape jokes again all the left rallies around him
[1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:23.980]  you look at someone like justine saco this was a woman who made a tweet which
[1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:27.820]  was a joke and it was actually an homage to white
[1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:31.420]  privilege it wasn't even a racist joke she was
[1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:35.660]  absolutely crucified she got on a plane made a tweet by the time she got off
[1:35:35.660 --> 1:35:39.900]  the plane her entire career and life was destroyed
[1:35:39.900 --> 1:35:44.300]  that's the difference now we have mtv of course coming out a couple of weeks
[1:35:44.300 --> 1:35:47.660]  ago with this resolutions for white guys news
[1:35:47.660 --> 1:35:51.740]  new year's resolutions for white guys video the backlash to that
[1:35:51.740 --> 1:35:56.940]  was absolutely intense suggesting that people are finally getting sick to the
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:00.540]  back teeth of this fetishization this
[1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:05.260]  trendiness of anti-white racism they've made it acceptable up till
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:09.420]  up until now jason this is emboldening both black and white
[1:36:09.420 --> 1:36:15.340]  supremacists this is the effect it has the people on both ends of the extreme
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:19.740]  are only further radicalized further proven right in a sense
[1:36:19.740 --> 1:36:23.660]  by all this casual anti-white racism what do you think
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:28.780]  is the actual agenda behind this i mean how do we deconstruct this fable
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:32.860]  they've created that it's impossible to be racist against white people right
[1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.020]  because that's basically what they've framed it in
[1:36:35.020 --> 1:36:39.420]  they've said oh white people have institutionalized power even though to a
[1:36:39.420 --> 1:36:42.540]  greater extent they don't and yet they're using
[1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:46.460]  the entire culture setting it against white people
[1:36:46.460 --> 1:36:49.740]  and saying that white people have all the power
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:53.820]  therefore it's acceptable to be racist against them how do we deconstruct
[1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:57.740]  that fable i think we have to fight back against it
[1:36:57.740 --> 1:37:01.980]  there's a tendency on the right when people are
[1:37:01.980 --> 1:37:05.740]  racist towards white people we just let it go because there's a certain amount
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:11.020]  of these limousine liberal white people who do not interact with minorities
[1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:15.660]  really they live in gated communities and they only see minorities as a
[1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:18.780]  charity project and they do have what you could call a
[1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:22.620]  privilege and they think all white people are so privileged and
[1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:26.700]  whatever so they let this slide so there's a smaller number of people
[1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:31.020]  who do not have this kind of privilege that they're talking about and they need
[1:37:31.020 --> 1:37:34.460]  to speak up you have to make examples out of
[1:37:34.460 --> 1:37:37.100]  people like the west felonies and the george
[1:37:37.100 --> 1:37:43.100]  chicarello mars of the world you have to take them to court over things and you
[1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:47.580]  have to make them feel the pain because they have made our side feel the pain
[1:37:47.580 --> 1:37:52.140]  for things that are not uh even remotely
[1:37:52.140 --> 1:37:55.260]  worth doing that and i'm not saying you should just go after anybody
[1:37:55.260 --> 1:37:58.460]  like what happened with justine zaco she was
[1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:02.060]  making a joke and you're right she was making a joke about
[1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:06.300]  uh white people having some kind of special place in the world that they
[1:38:06.300 --> 1:38:09.260]  wouldn't get aids or whatever and people didn't understand
[1:38:09.260 --> 1:38:12.700]  the joke and they hounded her and they got her out of there
[1:38:12.700 --> 1:38:16.220]  so i'm saying when we have a legitimate target when we have somebody
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.820]  who is clearly very virulently racist against us
[1:38:19.820 --> 1:38:23.500]  we have to demand that they are not going to be teaching our kids
[1:38:23.500 --> 1:38:26.860]  in school and we have to demand that they are not going to be
[1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:32.460]  our politicians and again the heart of it is this this
[1:38:32.460 --> 1:38:36.220]  attempt by the establishment to force feeders diversity
[1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:38.700]  i mean one example that i came across the other day
[1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:41.660]  oh and by the way back to your point about people living in white privileged
[1:38:41.660 --> 1:38:44.620]  bubbles there was a video recently where they went out
[1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:48.700]  and asked white people you know if black people should get all this help
[1:38:48.700 --> 1:38:52.860]  all these all these subsidies with things like using the internet using
[1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:55.820]  their cell phones what that video exposed was the
[1:38:55.820 --> 1:38:59.900]  bigotry of low expectations these white people thinking that they should
[1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:04.140]  surround themselves and you know bow down and worship white privilege
[1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:07.820]  actually made out that black people were completely stupid they didn't know how
[1:39:07.820 --> 1:39:11.260]  to operate cell phones they needed help with absolutely every little
[1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:15.100]  aspect of their lives so it actually creates more racism it creates that
[1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:18.860]  bigotry of low expectations where these leftists
[1:39:18.860 --> 1:39:23.180]  are so manipulated into white guilt that they they're literally insulting
[1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:26.220]  towards black people by saying that they they need
[1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:28.860]  help with absolutely everything they need
[1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:32.220]  you know help operating their cell phones connecting to the internet
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:35.980]  i thought that was a good expose but we've also got this this attempt to
[1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:40.060]  force feeders diversity i'll give you an example the bbc
[1:39:40.060 --> 1:39:44.220]  in the united kingdom the television station they have a station ident which
[1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:47.820]  for the last 10 years or so has been for example eight
[1:39:47.820 --> 1:39:51.900]  whales seen swimming in a circle they always use a circle for the station
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:56.140]  ident so you know it's either eight whales it's eight flags flying
[1:39:56.140 --> 1:40:00.620]  now they've decided that they're going to be culturally diverse
[1:40:00.620 --> 1:40:05.020]  and for example it's going to be eight people in a zumba class
[1:40:05.020 --> 1:40:09.260]  in a town called bristol in england now the problem with that is
[1:40:09.260 --> 1:40:13.660]  you know bristol in england is still what 85 90 percent why
[1:40:13.660 --> 1:40:18.060]  you look at this station ident it's the two white people
[1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:22.060]  you know two black people two muslims it's not even accurate
[1:40:22.060 --> 1:40:27.580]  i mean how can you enforce this idea of diversity when it's not even accurate
[1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:32.060]  the other point is you know it's fundamentally anti egalitarian
[1:40:32.060 --> 1:40:35.660]  you have the BAFTAs again which is the british version of the oscars
[1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:39.500]  they announced recently that they would bar films that failed to be quote
[1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:43.740]  diverse from winning an award meaning that you know
[1:40:43.740 --> 1:40:49.500]  there has to be a non-white character as either the protagonist or the antagonist
[1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:55.500]  in every single movie so again this is even at the expense of historical
[1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:59.180]  accuracy how are you going to make a film set in a country
[1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:02.540]  in the past in which no black people lived
[1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:07.900]  yet still include black actors in the number one and the number two roles it's
[1:41:07.900 --> 1:41:13.340]  fundamentally anti egalitarian i would say it's misguided virtue signaling
[1:41:13.340 --> 1:41:17.420]  instead of awarding people the best roles regardless of gender
[1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:22.540]  regardless of race which is the two which is the true non-racist stance
[1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:26.860]  they're enforcing this diversity i mean do you do you just see it as misguided
[1:41:26.860 --> 1:41:30.780]  virtue signaling by the left or is there something deeper is this about
[1:41:30.780 --> 1:41:36.220]  political power like you i ultimately want egalitarianism
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:39.740]  i want people to be chosen for things based on their merit
[1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:43.260]  rather than their race unfortunately i think that this
[1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:48.220]  identity politics is a genie that once out of the bottle is never going to go
[1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:50.380]  back the only way you're going to have
[1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:54.940]  equal treatment is to have white people stand up for themselves in the same way
[1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:58.060]  that black people stand up for themselves or other groups stand up for
[1:41:58.060 --> 1:42:01.580]  themselves and not in a hateful way i think that that's
[1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:04.860]  mirrors the movement but i think you have to have
[1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:09.820]  people to advocate white people are going to be a minority in some of these
[1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:13.420]  countries like in the united states perhaps we have to be able to play that
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:18.460]  game to some extent as far as the hiring of actors
[1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:22.780]  you see that in commercials a lot of times too where if you have 70 percent of
[1:42:22.780 --> 1:42:26.700]  the population is white they'll be like one
[1:42:26.700 --> 1:42:30.460]  white guy and then you know a muslim and a black person and
[1:42:30.460 --> 1:42:33.820]  so on and so forth it's not representative of the population
[1:42:33.820 --> 1:42:38.380]  and that's on purpose because for about 30 or 40 years
[1:42:38.380 --> 1:42:43.100]  you've had race-based solidarity groups like the in double acp you've had race
[1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:47.340]  pimps like al sharpton suing these companies
[1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:51.820]  so if macy's puts out a commercial you know
[1:42:51.820 --> 1:42:57.420]  and their their customer base is like 90 percent white let's say
[1:42:57.420 --> 1:43:00.780]  and so they put 90 percent white people in their commercial
[1:43:00.780 --> 1:43:04.380]  well the black groups will get upset and they will sue these people and they've
[1:43:04.380 --> 1:43:11.740]  just uh it's like a pain reaction it's it's
[1:43:11.740 --> 1:43:15.660]  if you react to a stimulus they've created so much
[1:43:15.660 --> 1:43:21.660]  pain in these companies for not giving hiring preferences based on
[1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:25.580]  race that they just do it automatically
[1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:30.220]  it's created complete derangement as he said people are completely reactionary
[1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:33.420]  they hook on to the latest little bit of outrage and
[1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:38.540]  to be fair i would say on twitter on some social media platforms it's lessened
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:42.620]  in intensity over the past couple of years now that we've drawn attention to
[1:43:42.620 --> 1:43:45.260]  it now that people are starting to understand
[1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:49.020]  how this outrage culture works you know what virtue singling is
[1:43:49.020 --> 1:43:52.460]  uh social justice warriors just that term has become a massive
[1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:56.300]  pejorative over the past couple of years so we are kind of
[1:43:56.300 --> 1:44:01.260]  fighting this back a little bit um you wrote in in the tweet exchange we had
[1:44:01.260 --> 1:44:04.620]  though that the uh trump movement needs to realize that they're missing a
[1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:08.940]  golden opportunity to finish off some leftists while they're still in a state
[1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:12.380]  of panic we have this trump derangement syndrome
[1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:17.980]  we have leftists across the board faking hate crimes almost every day i see a
[1:44:17.980 --> 1:44:20.940]  new story about how they hoped to hate crime
[1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:24.860]  to try and frame trump supporters they did it themselves
[1:44:24.860 --> 1:44:28.860]  expand on your comment how do we how do we exploit this opportunity
[1:44:28.860 --> 1:44:31.740]  with leftists in this state of panic right now
[1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:34.940]  yeah it's really interesting i mean a lot of people who follow
[1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:39.180]  the major accounts on twitter can see that there's been a lot of
[1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:43.500]  feuding lately amongst the trump coalition particularly what i guess you
[1:44:43.500 --> 1:44:49.020]  could refer to is the meme coalition and uh i think that it's really misguided
[1:44:49.020 --> 1:44:53.020]  i think that trying to fracture trump's coalition
[1:44:53.020 --> 1:44:56.140]  right before he takes office is just going to make it harder for us to do
[1:44:56.140 --> 1:45:00.140]  things like immigration enforcement building the wall and so forth
[1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:04.540]  and uh there are actually real enemies still out there
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:07.980]  you know there are still the shan kings of the world there are still the black
[1:45:07.980 --> 1:45:11.820]  lives matter this george chicari yellow guy is just
[1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:15.660]  getting away with uh advocating for white genocide
[1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:22.460]  because people are not uh working in a way that uh that winners work
[1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:25.500]  i i i start to think some of these people may be
[1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:31.580]  afraid of winning like they don't uh they get the taste of it and
[1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:34.860]  they don't quite have the killer instinct you got to go back after the
[1:45:34.860 --> 1:45:38.700]  leftist don't start attacking people on the right
[1:45:38.700 --> 1:45:42.700]  i think it's some of it is just the disbelief that they actually won
[1:45:42.700 --> 1:45:46.060]  that trump got into office now they think that you know it's
[1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:49.660]  it's somehow too good to be true it's like you know on the conspiracy
[1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:53.340]  theorist side they think oh well trump must be controlled by someone right now
[1:45:53.340 --> 1:45:56.860]  he must be part of the elite that they let him become president well no
[1:45:56.860 --> 1:46:02.140]  we won we have to accept that we won that brings us new responsibilities
[1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:06.140]  but there has been a lot of infighting that went with it immediately after
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:09.900]  uh trump won the election we had this richard spencer thing
[1:46:09.900 --> 1:46:13.500]  um you mentioned it earlier without getting too far down into the weeds
[1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:17.500]  that's what the media loves right they love to create these divisions they
[1:46:17.500 --> 1:46:20.460]  love to exploit them because before that it was it was
[1:46:20.460 --> 1:46:24.940]  quite a unified force to say the least i think they glom on to these
[1:46:24.940 --> 1:46:28.700]  personalities like richard spencer who are in it for the ego
[1:46:28.700 --> 1:46:31.660]  they don't care about damaging the movement they don't care about making
[1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:36.300]  other people look stupid guilt by association the media loves it they
[1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:39.500]  invite the mainstream media in i mean i don't even give
[1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:43.020]  mainstream media interviews i will go on shows i will go and step on
[1:46:43.020 --> 1:46:47.180]  mullin new show if the bbc wants me on i just say no because i know their game
[1:46:47.180 --> 1:46:50.700]  by now and i don't need their audience i've got my own platform
[1:46:50.700 --> 1:46:54.860]  but you have certain personalities that just want all the attention they want
[1:46:54.860 --> 1:46:59.180]  the ego boost they don't care about you know literally getting up in
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:02.460]  front of people and saying uh hyal trump
[1:47:02.460 --> 1:47:05.980]  while his slobbering demented fans give sick
[1:47:05.980 --> 1:47:09.660]  hyals and then they don't even care about how that looks in the media
[1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:14.700]  listen even if you believe which i don't and there's a vocal minority out there
[1:47:14.700 --> 1:47:18.620]  that jews control the world these holocaust deniers or whatever
[1:47:18.620 --> 1:47:22.300]  even if you believe all that fine whatever i think you're completely wrong
[1:47:22.300 --> 1:47:25.900]  and it's damaging but you at least you must accept
[1:47:25.900 --> 1:47:30.380]  that getting up in front of the atlantic in front of news cameras
[1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:33.580]  and aggressively seek hyaling at these events
[1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:37.580]  doesn't look very good right it's not not great optics in doing that
[1:47:37.580 --> 1:47:41.740]  i mean what's your take on that yeah i think that's right you know the speech
[1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:44.460]  itself uh i didn't think that there was anything wrong
[1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:48.300]  with the speech it was a pretty uh boilerplate speech
[1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:52.300]  but the doing the sick house i mean that was really dumb i'm the people in the
[1:47:52.300 --> 1:47:55.260]  audience shouldn't have done that because you're just going to be stoking
[1:47:55.260 --> 1:47:59.260]  fear and you're going to be putting stigma on some of the good ideas that he
[1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:02.620]  has and personally if i were him i would have
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:06.620]  said that the sick hiles were dumb i mean i think they
[1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:11.020]  were doing them just as a in a sense of humor but it's not a
[1:48:11.020 --> 1:48:14.140]  sense of humor that translates outside of the internet
[1:48:14.140 --> 1:48:17.420]  you're going to scare the shit out of people when it's the front page on the
[1:48:17.420 --> 1:48:20.860]  atlantic i mean i i thought it was ridiculous
[1:48:20.860 --> 1:48:24.220]  obviously it led to trump having to in front of the media
[1:48:24.220 --> 1:48:28.220]  disavow the alt right entirely when in fact the alt right
[1:48:28.220 --> 1:48:31.340]  now has several different divisions if you look at a website like
[1:48:31.340 --> 1:48:35.900]  you know the reddit the donald reddit and you compare that to something like
[1:48:35.900 --> 1:48:40.620]  fourchan completely different audience and that distinction has not been made
[1:48:40.620 --> 1:48:44.940]  in the mainstream media they've taken this they exploited it they created it
[1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:48.780]  in a way then they used it to make trump disavow the alt right
[1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:52.540]  and i just think it was a massive defeat for us and and that can be blamed on
[1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:55.100]  certain people but we've come to the end of the show
[1:48:55.100 --> 1:48:58.540]  jason just tell people where people can sign your petition
[1:48:58.540 --> 1:49:02.780]  and how they can find you on twitter well the petition the legal petition is
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:07.260]  only for charlesville residents you can email me at the mad dimension at gmail
[1:49:07.260 --> 1:49:10.860]  dot com if you want to do that but i have a lot
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:13.980]  more things going on in the coming year we're going to work on turning
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:18.460]  virginia red for trump and we're going to make sure that people like
[1:49:18.460 --> 1:49:22.540]  george chicarello and uh west belmere held accountable
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:26.060]  go to my website jason kessler dot net on twitter
[1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:32.460]  and gab i'm at the mad dimension okay jason kessler thanks for joining us
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:36.140]  today thank you good to be here good to have you
[1:49:36.140 --> 1:49:40.140]  okay there goes jason kessler again go and read about the situation there in
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:43.180]  charlesville this didn't get much national attention
[1:49:43.180 --> 1:49:47.180]  got a lot of local attention and again it's a really good insight into how the
[1:49:47.180 --> 1:49:52.620]  left rallies around actual supremacist race supremacist
[1:49:52.620 --> 1:49:56.220]  racist misogynist wow of course pointing the finger
[1:49:56.220 --> 1:50:00.220]  everyone else is saying that where the racist misogynist
[1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:05.180]  and the sheer butthurt that they get over trump and i think it was the uh
[1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:09.340]  the white house press secretary elect who came out and made this point the other
[1:50:09.340 --> 1:50:12.060]  day he will continue tweeting and the mainstream
[1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:15.820]  media is absolutely apoplectic they've got trump
[1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:19.500]  derangement syndrome merely over the fact that donald trump
[1:50:19.500 --> 1:50:25.020]  uses a twitter account never has that direct form of communication being
[1:50:25.020 --> 1:50:27.980]  available to a president who's been willing to use it
[1:50:27.980 --> 1:50:33.100]  donald trump will be that president and the mainstream media is scared
[1:50:33.100 --> 1:50:36.540]  to death because his message can't be filtered
[1:50:36.540 --> 1:50:41.580]  through their spin just as cnn said that people shouldn't read wiki leaks
[1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:45.180]  revelations without first seeing what cnn had to say
[1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:48.700]  about it well now you're the fake news you've put out
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:52.300]  dangerous fake news again and again the washington post has just done it

[1:54:33.340 --> 1:54:38.860]  local headline italy's populist leader public should decide where the news is
[1:54:38.860 --> 1:54:42.140]  fake and for that one statement he has been
[1:54:42.140 --> 1:54:47.180]  absolutely slammed italy's media and traditional political parties were up
[1:54:47.180 --> 1:54:50.780]  in arms wednesday after the head of the populist five star
[1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:53.580]  movement this is one of the guys who helped her
[1:54:53.580 --> 1:54:58.860]  defeat that reform builder italy's voted on that was a rejection of the EU
[1:54:58.860 --> 1:55:03.260]  accused the country's journalists of manufacturing false news
[1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:07.500]  so he's daring to say that the mainstream media is the main progenitor of
[1:55:07.500 --> 1:55:10.860]  false news this is comedian bepe grillo founder of
[1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:15.180]  the anti euro movement who lashed out at print and tv journalists accusing them
[1:55:15.180 --> 1:55:18.620]  of fabricating news to keep the five stars down
[1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:21.980]  he said quote newspapers and television news programs are the biggest
[1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:25.740]  manufacturers of false news in the country with the aim of ensuring those
[1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:29.260]  who have power keep it he called for a popular
[1:55:29.260 --> 1:55:32.060]  jury to determine the veracity of the news published
[1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:35.420]  and said in the cases of fake news the editor must head bad make a public
[1:55:35.420 --> 1:55:38.700]  apology and publish the correct version at the start of the program or on the
[1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:43.660]  papers front page so all he did was accuse the
[1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:47.100]  mainstream media of being the main progenitor of fake news
[1:55:47.100 --> 1:55:50.780]  and say that basically a popular jury of the people
[1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:56.780]  not of extreme leftists hired by facebook like snopes.com
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:56:00.060]  that a jury of the people should be responsible
[1:56:00.060 --> 1:56:02.940]  for determining what is fake news and what isn't
[1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:08.540]  and for this he was called a fascist this was the response
[1:56:08.540 --> 1:56:12.140]  again the article continues the media world was enraged
[1:56:12.140 --> 1:56:15.500]  the news director of private tg la seven channel
[1:56:15.500 --> 1:56:21.900]  and riko mentana said he would sue the comedian so he writes a blog post
[1:56:21.900 --> 1:56:26.540]  accusing the mainstream media of lying the response is that he's a fascist
[1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:31.820]  and now this tv owner tv channel owner is going to sue him
[1:56:31.820 --> 1:56:36.140]  he said that bepe grillo was encouraging the lynching of all journalists
[1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:39.820]  really the opposition five stars was running neck and neck with the
[1:56:39.820 --> 1:56:42.540]  entire with the ruling central left democratic party
[1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:46.220]  before matthew renzi's downfall last month and is campaigning hard for the
[1:56:46.220 --> 1:56:49.660]  next general election which could be held in the coming months
[1:56:49.660 --> 1:56:53.260]  so again this is a populist movement a threat to the establishment
[1:56:53.260 --> 1:56:56.940]  the leader of it in italy comes out and says the mainstream media is
[1:56:56.940 --> 1:57:00.460]  responsible for fake news how dare they try and censor us
[1:57:00.460 --> 1:57:04.300]  we should have a people's jury to determine what is real and what is fake
[1:57:04.300 --> 1:57:08.300]  news well according to stifano apposito
[1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:12.460]  another politician there in italy he said what grillo is proposing is
[1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:16.380]  fascism and those who play it down are accomplices
[1:57:16.380 --> 1:57:20.940]  the center right force at italy a party
[1:57:20.940 --> 1:57:24.620]  founded by ex-prime minister silvio billosconi said grillo wanted
[1:57:24.620 --> 1:57:29.180]  a mini cul-pot 2.0 a reference to the propaganda and censorship ministry
[1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:35.740]  under dictator benito musta leaving so that's not an overreaction at all is it
[1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:40.380]  he says that the mainstream media lies sometimes and puts out fake news that
[1:57:40.380 --> 1:57:45.580]  people should decide not governments and corporations what represents fake news
[1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:49.260]  for that he's trying to bring back something that
[1:57:49.260 --> 1:57:53.100]  a dictator had in Mussolini he's a fascist
[1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:57.260]  and that he's encouraging the lynching of all journalists
[1:57:57.260 --> 1:58:01.340]  again doesn't that really prove his point that he made initially
[1:58:01.340 --> 1:58:04.460]  that the mainstream media is the main progenitor
[1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:08.300]  of fake news giving that absolutely hysterical
[1:58:08.300 --> 1:58:11.980]  overreaction to italy's populist leader
[1:58:11.980 --> 1:58:15.820]  saying that the public should decide whether quote fake news
[1:58:15.820 --> 1:58:22.380]  is fake or not now we have the EU telling facebook they will find them
[1:58:22.380 --> 1:58:26.460]  thousands of dollars a day if they don't remove quote fake news within 24
[1:58:26.460 --> 1:58:30.700]  hours who's in control of determining what's fake news the far left bias

[2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:45.500]  to talk about media hysteria and on that subject we're going to go to this
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:48.940]  final clip now from julian assange's appearance on fox news with
[2:00:48.940 --> 2:00:53.020]  sean hannity of course the wiki leaks emails revealed the deep
[2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:56.620]  deep collusion between the democratic party
[2:00:56.620 --> 2:01:00.140]  and the mainstream media we're talking about going to john podesta's house for
[2:01:00.140 --> 2:01:04.380]  dinner cozy get-togethers we're talking about handing hillary clinton
[2:01:04.380 --> 2:01:07.900]  debate questions in advance we're talking about
[2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:11.260]  mainstream journalists like glenn thrush of politico
[2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:16.940]  literally calling himself a hack giving the clinton campaign his article a day
[2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:21.180]  before it's published those are just a few examples here is julian assange
[2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:25.100]  with sean hannity on media collusion
[2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:28.860]  i said in my country julian that journalism is dead
[2:01:28.860 --> 2:01:33.500]  i said it in 2008 because i was in i was investigating
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:37.820]  barack obama and his backgrounds and his associations
[2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:42.620]  and his career and his lack of knowledge and his radical belief system
[2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:45.180]  and everybody in the media ignored a lot of it
[2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:49.180]  so my question to you then is now knowing what wiki leaks revealed
[2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:53.500]  about the podesta emails on clinton corruption
[2:01:53.500 --> 2:01:57.340]  on pay-to-play on bernie sanders being cheated
[2:01:57.340 --> 2:02:00.940]  all of this is revealed not a lot of it was covered
[2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:05.100]  so what does that say to the american people about media coverage in
[2:02:05.100 --> 2:02:09.580]  america dishonest it's very dishonest
[2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:12.700]  corrupt is interesting it depends on your definition
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:17.420]  if you if you look at what we published in the if they're colluding with hillary
[2:02:17.420 --> 2:02:21.420]  that's not corrupt it's an ethical corruption
[2:02:21.420 --> 2:02:24.460]  they're not identifying it to their audiences they claim that they're
[2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.740]  objective journalists it's ethically corrupt
[2:02:27.740 --> 2:02:31.900]  corrupt by its the corruption also means something of law which is
[2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:36.140]  that you're taking money in exchange okay so i don't think that collusion
[2:02:36.140 --> 2:02:41.420]  they're colluding yeah okay because they share her political agenda
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:44.220]  but why else would they collude or they hate donald's i think that's an
[2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:47.100]  optimistic interpretation that they share the political agenda
[2:02:47.100 --> 2:02:51.900]  we'll explain that it's more like you rub my back or rub yours
[2:02:51.900 --> 2:02:55.020]  i'll give you you know i'll give you information you'll be
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:59.740]  you'll come to my um i'll i'll invite you to my
[2:02:59.740 --> 2:03:03.340]  child's christening or our next big party or do you know what i mean it we go
[2:03:03.340 --> 2:03:07.820]  to our state dinner yeah so i think it's more
[2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:11.820]  sadly i think it's longer but i look at this list of
[2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:17.500]  of what wiki leaks exposed for you can go back to this media question
[2:03:18.700 --> 2:03:23.740]  what is what is the line now uh in the new york times
[2:03:23.740 --> 2:03:30.460]  see msnbc okay the line is that wiki leaks
[2:03:30.460 --> 2:03:36.140]  change the result of the election okay and is that a true wiki leaks
[2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:41.260]  we're quite happy to have the credit uh for
[2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:48.140]  exposing uh the corruption and behavior that was occurring in that clinton team
[2:03:48.140 --> 2:03:51.820]  and the dnc fixing things evasion to bernie sanders we're quite happy to
[2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:55.740]  accept that was that your motivation was your motivation to influence the
[2:03:55.740 --> 2:03:58.540]  election or do you is your motivation what is your
[2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:03.420]  motivation is a fidelity to truth my motivation for maybe 20 years but 10
[2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:06.780]  years 10 years with wiki leaks has been to
[2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:11.340]  publish true information that is otherwise unsayable
[2:04:11.340 --> 2:04:15.020]  so there is juliena sange again making the point that the information they
[2:04:15.020 --> 2:04:19.100]  published was true it was accurate remember back at the beginning of this
[2:04:19.100 --> 2:04:22.940]  whole fake news scandal it was democratic hillary clinton
[2:04:22.940 --> 2:04:27.100]  supporting operatives that were the progenitors of the original
[2:04:27.100 --> 2:04:30.220]  fake news the fake news that the wiki leaks
[2:04:30.220 --> 2:04:33.500]  releases were not authentic or that they had been
[2:04:33.500 --> 2:04:37.740]  doctored so you go right back to the beginning of that narrative
[2:04:37.740 --> 2:04:42.540]  and they were the ones releasing fake news to try and bait conservatives
[2:04:42.540 --> 2:04:47.500]  trump supporters into amplifying that fake news and in many cases it worked
[2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:51.740]  but again eventually the narrative to derail wiki leaks
[2:04:51.740 --> 2:04:55.500]  didn't work the information got out there it was accurate it damaged hillary
[2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:58.540]  clinton it had a massive impact on the us election
[2:04:58.540 --> 2:05:01.180]  we'll we will be back in the next segment with holland
[2:05:01.180 --> 2:05:06.220]  huffington post says donald trump is unfit to be president
[2:05:06.220 --> 2:05:10.220]  and they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of trump right now
[2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:15.340]  before the inauguration in an article titled impeaching trump the process
[2:05:15.340 --> 2:05:18.300]  begins now hoffington post contributor robert
[2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:23.500]  curtner says president elect donald trump is far more of a menace to society
[2:05:23.500 --> 2:05:28.620]  than even richard nixon whoa and he expects trump will immediately
[2:05:28.620 --> 2:05:32.380]  break the law and violate the constitution therefore the
[2:05:32.380 --> 2:05:37.340]  huffington post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin
[2:05:37.340 --> 2:05:43.260]  the first day trump steps into office the idea is to keep daily records of
[2:05:43.260 --> 2:05:48.380]  trump's high crimes and misdemeanors including evidence they collect of his
[2:05:48.380 --> 2:05:54.620]  treasonous alliance with vladimir putin more desperation from the lunatics on

[2:09:43.100 --> 2:09:48.700]  good to have you on the washington post continues to accuse the likes of info

[2:09:51.660 --> 2:09:55.740]  dangerous for pushing fake news they're calling for censorship
[2:09:55.740 --> 2:09:59.820]  there when they're the ones publishing this fake news about
[2:09:59.820 --> 2:10:05.580]  russia hacking the us electric grid again with no evidence whatsoever
[2:10:05.580 --> 2:10:09.420]  they're escalating a conflict with a nuclear armed
[2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:15.100]  power by pushing fake news while accusing us of pushing fake news
[2:10:15.100 --> 2:10:19.100]  harlin do these people have any self-awareness at all
[2:10:19.100 --> 2:10:23.500]  you know i what's been pretty amazing to me is the hysteria that has swept
[2:10:23.500 --> 2:10:27.900]  uh not just the liberal uh media but i think most of the mainstream media
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:31.260]  uh what i noticed over the course of this election is that we really and this
[2:10:31.260 --> 2:10:34.300]  isn't just a talking point we really don't have
[2:10:34.300 --> 2:10:37.740]  real journalists anymore we have activists in the media that think that
[2:10:37.740 --> 2:10:41.740]  their responsibility was to destroy donald trump
[2:10:41.740 --> 2:10:45.900]  and uh what that's translated to in the post-election environment
[2:10:45.900 --> 2:10:49.180]  is that they think it's their responsibility to undermine
[2:10:49.180 --> 2:10:53.180]  his presidency um so i mean it's it's concerning
[2:10:53.180 --> 2:10:57.580]  um and you combine that with the uh the propaganda
[2:10:57.580 --> 2:11:00.620]  and the conspiracy the conspiracy theory that they're pushing around the
[2:11:00.620 --> 2:11:05.020]  russian hacking and i think that a lot of the a lot of the
[2:11:05.020 --> 2:11:07.580]  i think that what they're doing is they're playing with fire
[2:11:07.580 --> 2:11:10.940]  um my concern is when you look at
[2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:14.460]  footage uh in the aftermath of the election of liberal supporters of
[2:11:14.460 --> 2:11:17.340]  hillary clinton they didn't take this election very well
[2:11:17.340 --> 2:11:20.220]  and it's because they've been told for months now
[2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:23.900]  that the guy that won donald trump is quote unquote
[2:11:23.900 --> 2:11:28.140]  literally hitler and so when you saw people at the javits the jacob javits
[2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:30.220]  center which is really close to where i am right now
[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:33.100]  where hillary is supposed to have her big you know break in the glass ceiling
[2:11:33.100 --> 2:11:37.100]  party that on election night you saw liberals
[2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:41.420]  literally crawling around the floor crying rolling around
[2:11:41.420 --> 2:11:46.140]  you know it's sobbing like their dear leader had just passed away
[2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:49.660]  um this isn't a mature reaction to have
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:54.140]  uh to the loss of your candidate um but yet that's what we've seen and i i hold
[2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:57.180]  the media actually directly responsible for that
[2:11:57.180 --> 2:12:00.380]  they've done they've they've they've done everything in their power to
[2:12:00.380 --> 2:12:02.780]  undermine his candidacy and now his presidency
[2:12:02.780 --> 2:12:06.300]  they're pushing conspiracy theory with unsubstantiated claims of russian
[2:12:06.300 --> 2:12:09.900]  hacking they even pushed unsubstantiated claims of the russians
[2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:13.820]  uh in wikileaks modifying emails that's been debunked as well
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:18.460]  um we're dealing in we're dealing in a wow sorry about that
[2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:22.300]  we're dealing in i think a pretty unprecedented period of
[2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:27.260]  of of of um you know that i think the devolution
[2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:31.020]  of the media here in the west and i thought that shon hannity's point
[2:12:31.020 --> 2:12:37.260]  about you know that the um uh about uh you know they're they're not
[2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:41.180]  being a free and fair media in this country is absolutely true
[2:12:41.180 --> 2:12:44.460]  and it didn't happen overnight it's happened over the course of several
[2:12:44.460 --> 2:12:48.540]  decades and again i mean we have to blame the
[2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:52.140]  media for this right the whole election cycle was about these this this
[2:12:52.140 --> 2:12:55.980]  violence occurring at trump rallies the media
[2:12:55.980 --> 2:13:00.220]  again and again blamed trump despite the fact now we know that that was
[2:13:00.220 --> 2:13:04.940]  organized in part by the dnc thanks to james o kief and those revelations
[2:13:04.940 --> 2:13:08.860]  but even so it was obvious at the time that this was mobs of people
[2:13:08.860 --> 2:13:13.340]  going to trump rallies attacking trump supporters trying to shut down his
[2:13:13.340 --> 2:13:16.940]  events what do you make of this new phenomenon which we've seen
[2:13:16.940 --> 2:13:19.340]  after the election i guess it ties into the same
[2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:22.380]  what they've termed trump derangement syndrome
[2:13:22.380 --> 2:13:28.620]  of anti-trump people across the board almost a case every single day now
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:33.020]  faking hate crimes trying to blame them on trump supporters when they were
[2:13:33.020 --> 2:13:37.420]  hoaxes staged by these very same individuals have you
[2:13:37.420 --> 2:13:42.060]  ever seen anything like this in the media aftermath of of an election
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:45.660]  i haven't and like i said earlier i think that they're playing with fire
[2:13:45.660 --> 2:13:49.260]  um the problem is i believe that there are
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:53.420]  true hate crimes that happen every day and so when they put when they pedaled
[2:13:53.420 --> 2:13:57.820]  this fiction they undermine the and they bring into question the
[2:13:57.820 --> 2:14:01.260]  validity of people that that actually have encountered
[2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:04.540]  some of these crimes and i can tell you that no single
[2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:07.740]  party has a monopoly on this kind of behavior
[2:14:07.740 --> 2:14:11.020]  i'm sure that you've run into it frequently i run into it all the time
[2:14:11.020 --> 2:14:14.540]  i can't go to the coffee shop here in manhattan without being accosted
[2:14:14.540 --> 2:14:17.900]  by you know some liberal fringe lunatic literally
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:21.660]  every day i'll be at the dog park and i'll be i'll have to be harassed by some
[2:14:21.660 --> 2:14:25.580]  lunatic so no side has a monopoly on this
[2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:29.660]  i do believe that there there are there real criticisms of people that are on
[2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:33.820]  the fringe of of either political uh persuasion
[2:14:33.820 --> 2:14:37.500]  that go out of their way to engage in violence and
[2:14:37.500 --> 2:14:40.300]  rhetoric that i don't think is productive at all
[2:14:40.300 --> 2:14:44.060]  but what the media has done is that they don't do their due diligence at all
[2:14:44.060 --> 2:14:47.900]  they don't do what i think is responsible and what you'd expect of any
[2:14:47.900 --> 2:14:52.300]  uh journalistic organization of you know of the pedigree of something like the
[2:14:52.300 --> 2:14:56.220]  new york times they just published this fiction and we saw this you know
[2:14:56.220 --> 2:15:00.060]  getting beyond just the you know the violence and the aftermath of the
[2:15:00.060 --> 2:15:03.660]  election we saw this with uh the the the fake news story that the
[2:15:03.660 --> 2:15:08.060]  washington post post last week on you know alleged russian hacking of a
[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:12.700]  vermont uh power grid you know it it is really out of
[2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:15.900]  control at this point and so what it does is it contributes to this
[2:15:15.900 --> 2:15:21.260]  error of of of uh you know people people can't trust what they're
[2:15:21.260 --> 2:15:25.740]  hearing which is a real problem the democracy only works
[2:15:25.740 --> 2:15:29.020]  if we can trust the media if we have a vibrant media
[2:15:29.020 --> 2:15:31.980]  um i think that's why something like info wars is really important telling a
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:34.780]  different side of the story that's really under reported
[2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:37.900]  there are there are lots of other news organizations that i'm really encouraged
[2:15:37.900 --> 2:15:41.020]  by that are popping up and and helping to balance this out
[2:15:41.020 --> 2:15:45.660]  my concern is though that we what we're seeing in the mainstream media is that
[2:15:45.660 --> 2:15:48.220]  for a long time they just had a liberal bent
[2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:51.500]  what they have now instead is that they're willing to abdicate all of their
[2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:54.780]  journalistic responsibility to cover their own people
[2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:58.220]  responsibly somebody like hillary clinton or or brock obama who are not
[2:15:58.220 --> 2:16:00.940]  above criticism and so it's not just a liberal
[2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:03.340]  bent anymore they're willing to fabricate stories
[2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:06.060]  they're willing to pedal conspiracy theory that's totally
[2:16:06.060 --> 2:16:08.860]  unsubstantiated they're willing to parrot the line that comes out of the
[2:16:08.860 --> 2:16:11.820]  federal government uh you know with like this russian
[2:16:11.820 --> 2:16:16.540]  hacking story um with zero homework they've done zero
[2:16:16.540 --> 2:16:19.900]  homework on on on many of these these stories so it's dangerous this is a
[2:16:19.900 --> 2:16:22.940]  dangerous time and you know and this democracy is not
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:25.820]  going to work many of the democracies across this planet are not going to work
[2:16:25.820 --> 2:16:28.780]  the uk for instance if we do not have a return
[2:16:28.780 --> 2:16:32.940]  to real journalistic practices in this country it's not a joke
[2:16:32.940 --> 2:16:37.180]  that's just amazing i mean the mainstream media gave birth to fake news in the
[2:16:37.180 --> 2:16:41.260]  first place by being completely dishonest and deceptive i mean
[2:16:41.260 --> 2:16:45.260]  there wouldn't be a market they wouldn't be a thirst for alternative news if the
[2:16:45.260 --> 2:16:49.820]  mainstream media actually went back to its its muck raking heritage and
[2:16:49.820 --> 2:16:52.620]  actually acted like the fourth estate should act
[2:16:52.620 --> 2:16:56.300]  i mean i would say that you know i noticed these fake news website i don't
[2:16:56.300 --> 2:16:59.420]  think they were anywhere near as prominent as they're trying to claim in
[2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:03.500]  fact i think it was daily caller did a story where they pointed out that
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:07.820]  the top quote fake news websites were listed 80
[2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:12.620]  90 000 to 100 000 on alexa so they didn't even get that much traffic
[2:17:12.620 --> 2:17:16.540]  obviously it's it's hyperbole it's being completely over exaggerated
[2:17:16.540 --> 2:17:20.060]  but again they gave birth to it in the first place quickly i wanted to ask you
[2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:23.420]  about uh seth rich because um again in that
[2:17:23.420 --> 2:17:28.300]  interview with shone hannity julien assange alluded to who his source might
[2:17:28.300 --> 2:17:32.940]  be he talked about uh possibly someone within the dnc i know that this was
[2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:35.980]  something you were tracking back at the start of it
[2:17:35.980 --> 2:17:39.500]  um the dnc or the democratic party they
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:44.380]  hired an individual to sort of become the spokesperson for the family of seth
[2:17:44.380 --> 2:17:49.660]  rich after he died his immediate public statement his
[2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:52.940]  first statement was to completely disavow any suggestion
[2:17:52.940 --> 2:17:56.220]  that the murder of seth rich which remains unsolved
[2:17:56.220 --> 2:18:00.380]  had anything to do with the dnc leaks do you think that was
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:03.420]  quite strange when you heard that at the time
[2:18:03.420 --> 2:18:09.020]  i do um you know i i've heard many rumors i've heard lots of whispers even
[2:18:09.020 --> 2:18:12.860]  within democratic circles about this and to be honest with you i don't know
[2:18:12.860 --> 2:18:15.820]  what to believe anymore i do think that the response of the democratic
[2:18:15.820 --> 2:18:18.780]  national committee and the aftermath of this has been very strange
[2:18:18.780 --> 2:18:22.460]  i think that the family has asked for answers and they're not getting them
[2:18:22.460 --> 2:18:26.540]  um and i think you know the the circumstances of this were very
[2:18:26.540 --> 2:18:29.980]  suspicious julien assange has indicated that
[2:18:29.980 --> 2:18:33.740]  it's somebody like seth rich could have been
[2:18:33.740 --> 2:18:37.340]  you know part of the dnc leak not the padesa leak but the dnc leak
[2:18:37.340 --> 2:18:42.380]  and so i i the getting back to the media because it really relates to this
[2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:47.260]  i don't think any theory is above consideration
[2:18:47.260 --> 2:18:52.460]  and in what really made me question this story is when
[2:18:52.460 --> 2:18:56.620]  when certain people started asking you know does this story have some
[2:18:56.620 --> 2:19:00.060]  legitimacy the the effort was to immediately
[2:19:00.060 --> 2:19:05.580]  shut down that conversation and and that concerns me particularly because
[2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:09.820]  everything pointed to this that this guy's death was very suspicious
[2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:15.900]  um we know that he was shot that he still had his wallet on him he
[2:19:15.900 --> 2:19:19.100]  still had all of his values valuables on him if this was your
[2:19:19.100 --> 2:19:22.540]  you know run-of-the-mill robbery that went wrong
[2:19:22.540 --> 2:19:27.980]  that wouldn't have been the case um and so it does seem suspicious now maybe
[2:19:27.980 --> 2:19:31.820]  maybe there's nothing there but it's not be
[2:19:31.820 --> 2:19:36.780]  above consideration and i can tell you from first hand experience as i said
[2:19:36.780 --> 2:19:40.300]  previously um there are people that looked at this
[2:19:40.300 --> 2:19:45.020]  from day one and they said something doesn't smell right here
[2:19:45.020 --> 2:19:48.540]  okay hall and hill will be back with the next segment of the alex

[2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:21.580]  website is haulenhill.com haulen just wrapping up here
[2:24:21.580 --> 2:24:25.100]  i noticed in the past few days we've had a narrative that's
[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:29.420]  almost equally as bizarre and unfounded as the russian hacking narrative
[2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:34.460]  this claim made by some in the media attempting to characterize obama's
[2:24:34.460 --> 2:24:40.940]  legacy as quote scandal free what's your response to that claim
[2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:43.820]  i mean it's ridiculous i mean we had everything from
[2:24:43.820 --> 2:24:47.420]  you know fast and furious where we were literally arming
[2:24:47.420 --> 2:24:52.220]  the cartel okay and and and what was even worse than that was that the
[2:24:52.220 --> 2:24:56.380]  obama administration was engaged in a in a cover-up of it
[2:24:56.380 --> 2:24:59.660]  uh... you know the attorney general at the time refused to
[2:24:59.660 --> 2:25:03.100]  uh... speak to congress on the issue uh... obama invoked
[2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:06.060]  executive privilege to avoid answering questions about that
[2:25:06.060 --> 2:25:09.820]  so um you know then you moving on to the iran deal
[2:25:09.820 --> 2:25:14.220]  that was a total disaster that led to you know multi-billion dollar ransom
[2:25:14.220 --> 2:25:19.340]  um and and the release of of enormous funds to the iranians
[2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:22.540]  um you know to hillary clinton's email scandal
[2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:26.300]  don't forget that when she was using this private server she was
[2:25:26.300 --> 2:25:31.020]  uh... in the employee of of brock obama as the secretary of state
[2:25:31.020 --> 2:25:34.700]  so it's just laughable
[2:25:34.700 --> 2:25:38.460]  it's laughable for the obama administration to make the claim
[2:25:38.460 --> 2:25:43.580]  that you know they've been scandal free they've had literally dozens of scandals
[2:25:43.580 --> 2:25:47.420]  um in in many ways they're probably one of the more scandal plagued
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:51.580]  administrations in the last century um but you know
[2:25:51.580 --> 2:25:55.260]  everything's rosy that's what we're told to believe with with brock obama and
[2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:57.500]  the media never really pushes back on it
[2:25:57.500 --> 2:26:00.540]  um so he he can get away with making that claim and
[2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:03.740]  and he's he's he's engaged in revisionist history
[2:26:03.740 --> 2:26:06.860]  um you know and he he's trying to
[2:26:06.860 --> 2:26:10.060]  uh you know cater to what his long-term
[2:26:10.060 --> 2:26:13.260]  um legacy is going to be
[2:26:13.260 --> 2:26:15.660]  i guess it's you know it's part of the process of
[2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:20.540]  delegitimizing trump right they need to uphold obama as this christlike
[2:26:20.540 --> 2:26:25.180]  you know saintly to then yeah to then uh to then put him up against trump
[2:26:25.180 --> 2:26:29.260]  who is the devil incarnate before he's even took office right
[2:26:29.260 --> 2:26:34.060]  if you google uh obama and jesus or obama and halo
[2:26:34.060 --> 2:26:37.820]  you will see so many photos that were taken by
[2:26:37.820 --> 2:26:42.860]  actual like uh photographic journalists at at events and they they try to get
[2:26:42.860 --> 2:26:47.260]  him yeah there you go i mean isn't this look at that that is insane
[2:26:47.260 --> 2:26:51.020]  that is insane that is in that can't be a coincidence the amount of times i've
[2:26:51.020 --> 2:26:54.300]  seen that oh my god and if you look at newsweek they're
[2:26:54.300 --> 2:26:57.100]  probably one of the biggest offenders of this i mean they they they make all
[2:26:57.100 --> 2:27:00.460]  kinds of comparisons uh to you know jesus they call
[2:27:00.460 --> 2:27:03.260]  they called his uh his reelection the second coming
[2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:06.220]  you know i mean just get over yourselves how
[2:27:06.220 --> 2:27:09.980]  how can you look at this and believe what these people are pushing
[2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:13.580]  um and and this is what i what i was saying previously this is this is this
[2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:17.660]  is not good for anybody i don't i'm not happy to say this because we need
[2:27:17.660 --> 2:27:21.020]  a vibrant media now we need a vibrant media to hold
[2:27:21.020 --> 2:27:25.020]  uh trump you know accountable i mean he's not going to be perfect i voted for him
[2:27:25.020 --> 2:27:27.580]  i supported him but he's not going to be we need to hold his
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:32.780]  feet to the fire too um and so you know what what can you
[2:27:32.780 --> 2:27:37.020]  say at this point what can you say i mean but now i'm caught in kind of a
[2:27:37.020 --> 2:27:41.180]  a weird spot because i i feel like i have to over defend trump
[2:27:41.180 --> 2:27:44.860]  sometimes because the media onslaught is just
[2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:48.860]  endless is endless so no i'm it's the matter that
[2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:52.220]  you've got the new york times with an opinion piece comparing trump to a
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:55.980]  crackhead i mean that's just out yesterday can you imagine them
[2:27:55.980 --> 2:28:00.060]  saying that about obama just two weeks out before he took
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:03.740]  office back in 2008 it's amazing we've run out of time holland but just tell

[2:30:05.740 --> 2:30:09.580]  revenge by targeting his family during his interview with shon hannity
[2:30:09.580 --> 2:30:13.100]  assange acknowledged that he signed up for the game that's being played
[2:30:13.100 --> 2:30:16.700]  but his family including his young children under 10 years old
[2:30:16.700 --> 2:30:20.620]  didn't sign up for that mission suggesting powerful actors would take
[2:30:20.620 --> 2:30:24.700]  revenge by targeting his family assange once again reiterated that

[2:33:36.460 --> 2:33:41.420]  to tank half of fox's main audience regular audience began to leave them
[2:33:41.420 --> 2:33:45.740]  their key demographics were cratering the rats began to leave the sinking ships
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:49.900]  so the attempt by rupert murdoch to force feed
[2:33:49.900 --> 2:33:59.260]  fox viewers they basically this soft cnn style garbage just bloop in their face
[2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:04.220]  it absolutely bloop in their face to be a softer version of basically cnn or even
[2:34:04.220 --> 2:34:08.380]  msnbc so this is just another example of the devastating victories that we're
[2:34:08.380 --> 2:34:11.340]  having and how delusional the entire power structure
[2:34:11.340 --> 2:34:15.500]  is and has been and they have no idea that their own intelligence agencies and
[2:34:15.500 --> 2:34:19.100]  own groups around them have used the penopting on spy grids they put in place
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:23.500]  to control the public against them so now they're saying a conservative woman
[2:34:23.500 --> 2:34:26.860]  is going to replace megah kelly who's pro-trome
[2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:29.980]  there you have it just months ago they were on the verge of
[2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:34.940]  basically firing hannity they were absolutely threatening everyone
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:38.380]  now they're panicking they're trying to get out of their contract to pay the
[2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:41.820]  rest of 30 plus million of the 60 million they owe him to roger ale's
[2:34:41.820 --> 2:34:45.100]  started fox knows i mean it is just a disastrous
[2:34:45.100 --> 2:34:49.740]  mess but that little arrogant snot who went and for
[2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:53.260]  you know that's seven million dollar signing bonus for the book
[2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:57.500]  reportedly according to my sources which are size you get
[2:34:57.500 --> 2:35:01.100]  they're basically i'm not going to even get into it the point is
[2:35:01.100 --> 2:35:05.260]  is that she thought she was going to win she thought she was invincible
[2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:09.260]  she thought that that the power structure wants me to attack trump of the
[2:35:09.260 --> 2:35:12.860]  power structure wants me to destroy myself you know going after him
[2:35:12.860 --> 2:35:15.740]  and because i'm the pretty young lady everybody will buy it nobody saw through
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:20.060]  it and she liked turning into the i switch she was the girl next door
[2:35:20.060 --> 2:35:23.580]  before but she really showed her true colors the i switch
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:27.660]  so just total defeat by these delusionites
[2:35:27.660 --> 2:35:30.860]  and their delusional followers maybe continue to break their will they've been
[2:35:30.860 --> 2:35:34.220]  trying to break our will we must break their will
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:37.580]  so very very exciting on that front that's just all part of the collapse
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:40.860]  of their system and and and as they've said during the campaign
[2:35:40.860 --> 2:35:45.260]  trying to brand trump with info wars trumps main shock troops were info wars
[2:35:45.260 --> 2:35:48.060]  we're the americana message our listeners are the core
[2:35:48.060 --> 2:35:52.380]  of the return of americana and making america ready again
[2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:55.900]  and so they just helped brand us even more thinking it would hurt trump and
[2:35:55.900 --> 2:35:58.860]  the nationalist movement it only helped us take over the entire conservative
[2:35:58.860 --> 2:36:02.380]  movement even more with true classic american
[2:36:02.380 --> 2:36:06.300]  renaissance systems that aren't left or right i mean this is just beautiful
[2:36:06.300 --> 2:36:09.340]  their controlled paradigm is collapsing and our real choices
[2:36:09.340 --> 2:36:12.700]  can come into the mix that's whether desperately going even more primitive
[2:36:12.700 --> 2:36:16.220]  forms of brainwashing but it's not working it's only working on the most
[2:36:16.220 --> 2:36:20.380]  weak minded people we are breaking through
[2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:25.820]  we're in a collapsed level event for the enemy at this point
[2:36:30.140 --> 2:36:34.700]  what we have is exponentially in vain we have globalists at the top that have
[2:36:34.700 --> 2:36:38.620]  used class warfare to control people and then really all they do is make them
[2:36:38.620 --> 2:36:44.300]  feel worthless and disempowered and basically just zombies to the system
[2:36:44.300 --> 2:36:49.660]  frightened followers who then only tie in and buy in the larger
[2:36:49.660 --> 2:36:52.780]  superstructure that's destroying them because they believe they get power in
[2:36:52.780 --> 2:36:55.820]  solace by merging with that and one of the most
[2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:58.940]  full haircut examples of this is the last eight years
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:02.300]  the team party that was started by ron paul the liberty movement myself and
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:06.700]  the listeners of this broadcast did get partially co-opted by the republican
[2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:11.740]  party but then the left all came in and just branded it as completely racist
[2:37:11.740 --> 2:37:16.060]  completely evil and so that no one of any color was welcome at those
[2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:19.580]  because they don't want minorities who are the majority to have this birthright
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:23.100]  and this freedom and be able to you know continue
[2:37:23.100 --> 2:37:27.180]  in the other steps of prosperity with a low taxes
[2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:30.540]  the right to self-defense property rights things like that
[2:37:30.540 --> 2:37:34.780]  so it was a stroke of genius the last six seven years they were able
[2:37:34.780 --> 2:37:38.380]  to really brand it as if it was something bad
[2:37:38.380 --> 2:37:43.100]  and so minorities felt like they felt like they couldn't be part of that
[2:37:43.100 --> 2:37:47.020]  and now they've just expanded but trumping in the last two years to break
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:50.860]  that and we'd see 30 40 percent of the people at rallies being minorities
[2:37:50.860 --> 2:37:54.860]  i mean at our own rallies it's like half uh in in cleveland
[2:37:54.860 --> 2:37:58.780]  and that's what really shook up i was watching the mother jones riders other
[2:37:58.780 --> 2:38:01.900]  people that were there they were really shook up and they were looking at the
[2:38:01.900 --> 2:38:06.540]  crowd and it was frighteningly elite was really frightening the establishment
[2:38:06.540 --> 2:38:10.620]  so now while they're capitulating to the trump victory of the populism on the
[2:38:10.620 --> 2:38:13.820]  surface all over the world they're going into overdrive
[2:38:13.820 --> 2:38:18.300]  branding any type of of populism by people that aren't
[2:38:18.300 --> 2:38:21.820]  blonde-haired blue-eyed as racist and i on the newsstand before i got on this
[2:38:21.820 --> 2:38:25.180]  plane i'm sitting here about to take off so i gotta hurry
[2:38:25.180 --> 2:38:29.740]  bottom mother jones uh four foundation propaganda piece and of course the
[2:38:29.740 --> 2:38:32.620]  council on farm relations slash davos group
[2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:37.820]  economist propaganda and literally literally this is what the pseudo
[2:38:37.820 --> 2:38:41.740]  intellectuals read the entire thing on almost every page was blonde-haired
[2:38:41.740 --> 2:38:45.340]  blue-eyed people in real photos but also in editorial
[2:38:45.340 --> 2:38:49.180]  cartoons saying blonde-haired blue-eyed people are bad
[2:38:49.180 --> 2:38:54.780]  putting kkk hats on them and then saying if someone looks like this
[2:38:54.780 --> 2:38:58.940]  then they're your enemy and these are publications that mainly go to the
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:03.020]  white intelligentsia so they can go out now and henpeck everyone into this
[2:39:03.020 --> 2:39:05.820]  submission this is just two things i got off the newsstand
[2:39:05.820 --> 2:39:09.500]  i mean this is the most cultic brainwashing i've ever seen
[2:39:09.500 --> 2:39:12.700]  clear-cut cold-blooded they know exactly what they're doing but it's so
[2:39:12.700 --> 2:39:16.140]  transparent if we just call it it will collapse and that's what's begun to
[2:39:16.140 --> 2:39:18.860]  happen that's why they stole those five states
[2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:22.620]  from trombone and that they try to sell other five because the numbers were
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:25.260]  minorities were even bigger in landslides for him
[2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:28.700]  that's what we saw in the primary so they're very very scared their whole
[2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:35.180]  paradigm is shattering they're trying to invoke all this but our real
[2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:39.340]  our real gang we're in is free market that's what unifies us
[2:39:39.340 --> 2:39:43.340]  and and western civilization and it's like grand terino you know it's a
[2:39:43.340 --> 2:39:46.220]  fictional account but you know the guy didn't like his spoiled family he's a
[2:39:46.220 --> 2:39:48.460]  white guy it's a sign of a declining white culture
[2:39:48.460 --> 2:39:52.780]  which is the truth western cultures it's massive decline and he tries
[2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:56.860]  he gives the love of his life the grand terino to the kid that made something
[2:39:56.860 --> 2:39:59.420]  of himself in the neighborhood and that's not some
[2:39:59.420 --> 2:40:02.860]  affirmative action bull in the movie it's like real that's how it really
[2:40:02.860 --> 2:40:05.740]  works folks so they want to steal that birthright from
[2:40:05.740 --> 2:40:09.660]  everybody who's hardworking and a big part of america
[2:40:09.660 --> 2:40:12.700]  telling you you don't get to be part of it telling you you're in their gang you're
[2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:15.340]  under their control because you're a victim and they're going to take care of
[2:40:15.340 --> 2:40:17.580]  you and they know how to run your life they're going to tell you how to talk
[2:40:17.580 --> 2:40:21.580]  and they're going to tell you what to do so again this is total desperation by
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:24.940]  the most scientific cold-blooded psychological warfare divisions of the
[2:40:24.940 --> 2:40:29.020]  central intelligence agency but most of the CIA is awake to this and now
[2:40:29.020 --> 2:40:32.860]  breaking with the whole deal one other part of the psychological warfare of
[2:40:32.860 --> 2:40:35.900]  who they're targeting with these publications
[2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:39.020]  is a lot of people that read these aren't actual controller level they don't
[2:40:39.020 --> 2:40:43.020]  understand the paradigm or the alien dialectic but clearly they're
[2:40:43.020 --> 2:40:46.460]  inflicting a guilt complex in the publications on anyone who is
[2:40:46.460 --> 2:40:50.860]  whiter has blonde hair you notice they also have photos of women with
[2:40:50.860 --> 2:40:55.180]  blonde hair and blue eyes but in the ads who are activists and then they're the
[2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:58.220]  good person so it shows them who are good
[2:40:58.220 --> 2:41:01.340]  and shows the corporations they're backing and finishes everyone else that's bad
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:04.620]  so that you think oh my god i have this guilt i need to submit to this i know
[2:41:04.620 --> 2:41:08.140]  i'm stating the obvious here but it's just it's key that we know this the
[2:41:08.140 --> 2:41:11.580]  public doesn't once they understand the trick they get angry they break free of
[2:41:11.580 --> 2:41:15.660]  the programming and then future programming only causes them to resist
[2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:19.740]  and entrench harder against the enemy and then it opens up larger pathways to
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:24.220]  mind to begin to resist and overcome and adapt
[2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:27.180]  in the animating contest instead of submitting to it that's why the public
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:29.580]  looks like zombies because subconsciously they know that they've
[2:41:29.580 --> 2:41:31.900]  been beaten into submission it's time to break that
[2:41:31.900 --> 2:41:34.860]  so i'm going to follow this report i'm going to follow more and i'll show them
[2:41:34.860 --> 2:41:37.980]  from the front lines the info war a lot of positive things are happening but a
[2:41:37.980 --> 2:41:40.540]  lot of negative things are happening we've got to keep fighting keep pushing
[2:41:40.540 --> 2:41:44.700]  is the animating contest of liberty but these people are super low
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:48.140]  they promote thug culture in here they try to sell minorities on acting like
[2:41:48.140 --> 2:41:51.020]  thugs as if that's their culture so they can then be identified and put in
[2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:55.260]  prison this is so evil info wars dot com spread that folks
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:41:58.460]  are trying to censor it but you are overpowering it we're overpowering it
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:03.900]  together and i want to salute you all as we go into 2017 and beyond
[2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:15.740]  there is alex jones and switching back into the news now here
[2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:19.180]  this is out of rt and it's going to be the preface for a
[2:42:19.180 --> 2:42:22.220]  audio clip we got coming up a special report on
[2:42:22.220 --> 2:42:27.420]  comments made by john carrey but we have rt reporting right now u.s coalition
[2:42:27.420 --> 2:42:31.820]  spared isis oil production facilities in syria the u.s led
[2:42:31.820 --> 2:42:35.820]  international coalition did not bomb oil production facilities captured by
[2:42:35.820 --> 2:42:39.900]  islamic state this is the charge made by
[2:42:39.900 --> 2:42:42.460]  russian defense ministry spokesman major general
[2:42:42.460 --> 2:42:48.460]  igor konoshevkov he says miraculously only oil fields captured by isis
[2:42:48.460 --> 2:42:51.660]  allowing the militants to earn tens of millions of dollars a month on illegal
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:54.940]  oil sales and recruit mercenaries from all over the world
[2:42:54.940 --> 2:43:00.140]  did not come under us bomb barman and we had the story before
[2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:04.300]  they had the chance to bomb the oil fields the obama administration refused
[2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:07.180]  to do so claiming they were concerned about the
[2:43:07.180 --> 2:43:13.020]  environmental impact they drop leaflets before they bomb
[2:43:13.020 --> 2:43:17.660]  isis convoys warning isis terrorists to leave the
[2:43:17.660 --> 2:43:22.220]  region so they can escape the falling bombs that relates to this
[2:43:22.220 --> 2:43:25.980]  special report about john carrey we know from the very beginning
[2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:30.460]  they saw the rise of isis this jihadist principality
[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:33.900]  as something to be encouraged something that would lead to the overthrow
[2:43:33.900 --> 2:43:37.980]  of a sad in syria they armed isis they knew
[2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:42.380]  the so-called moderate rebel groups they were arming were defecting to isis
[2:43:42.380 --> 2:43:47.900]  were handing their weapons over to isis and now we have this amazing leaked
[2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:51.340]  audio from john carrey that highlights exactly
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:55.180]  the agenda from the very beginning here's that report
[2:43:55.180 --> 2:43:59.660]  us counterterrorism officials asking why are isis fighters driving so many
[2:43:59.660 --> 2:44:02.540]  similar trucks and where are they getting them from
[2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:06.620]  hillary clinton has described already the meeting in the white house over two
[2:44:06.620 --> 2:44:09.340]  years ago everyone in the national security team
[2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:14.140]  recommended arming isis you are basically saying that even in government
[2:44:14.140 --> 2:44:17.580]  at the time you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you
[2:44:17.580 --> 2:44:20.460]  were arguing against it but who wasn't listening
[2:44:20.460 --> 2:44:25.340]  i think uh i think the administration but what we're trying to do is help
[2:44:25.340 --> 2:44:30.460]  syrians to fight for their own benefit and we've been spending a lot of money
[2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:34.220]  and a lot of effort to try to help do this
[2:44:34.220 --> 2:44:39.100]  so there's an opposition there the opposition is doing very well
[2:44:39.100 --> 2:44:43.180]  and if they're not serious then we will help the opposition more
[2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:46.780]  intelligence officials in pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist
[2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:50.700]  network islamic state has admitted receiving funds transferred via the
[2:44:50.700 --> 2:44:53.660]  us he made the confession while being interrogated
[2:44:53.660 --> 2:44:57.340]  today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly
[2:44:57.340 --> 2:45:00.860]  cache of american-made firepower stinger missiles
[2:45:00.860 --> 2:45:04.060]  don't think it was a willful decision a willful decision to go support an
[2:45:04.060 --> 2:45:07.500]  insurgency that had salafist al-qaeda a willful decision to do what they're
[2:45:07.500 --> 2:45:10.460]  doing which which you have to really you have to
[2:45:10.460 --> 2:45:14.780]  really ask the president what is it that he actually is doing
[2:45:14.780 --> 2:45:19.580]  as i said before this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly
[2:45:19.580 --> 2:45:22.620]  but the fall of ramadi has galvanized the iraqi government
[2:45:22.620 --> 2:45:25.740]  so with the additional steps i ordered last month we're speeding up training
[2:45:25.740 --> 2:45:29.820]  of isle forces including volunteers from sunni tribes
[2:45:29.820 --> 2:45:33.820]  in anbar province now u.s military aircraft have dropped ammunition in
[2:45:33.820 --> 2:45:38.060]  areas held by isle terror group in iraq according to volunteer forces were
[2:45:38.060 --> 2:45:41.420]  fighting the terrorists american helicopters dropped boxes of weapons
[2:45:41.420 --> 2:45:45.180]  india three and balad districts in this halloween province in the last eight
[2:45:45.180 --> 2:45:46.940]  years obama completely sold us out at the
[2:45:46.940 --> 2:45:49.180]  communist chinese the saudi arabians and others
[2:45:49.180 --> 2:45:53.260]  and launched a program all over the middle east africa central asia
[2:45:53.260 --> 2:45:58.140]  far asia you name it to put radical jihadis funded by saudi arabia
[2:45:58.140 --> 2:46:02.140]  as well as nato in charge it's now been leaked uh even the new york times is
[2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:06.060]  having a report on it obama wanted isis to grow leaked audio
[2:46:06.060 --> 2:46:10.380]  and that's addressing the syrian opposition so that's just an example
[2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:17.260]  of what we're talking about we saw that that dash was growing in strength and we
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:24.140]  thought i said what's right uh we thought however we could probably
[2:46:24.140 --> 2:46:27.500]  manage uh you know that i said might negotiate
[2:46:27.500 --> 2:46:31.420]  instead of negotiating if you got outside that you got to put in the
[2:46:31.420 --> 2:46:36.220]  supportive now the public didn't know what was going on but our military did
[2:46:36.220 --> 2:46:39.980]  they began five years ago and cyhurst is now broken this last year we first
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:44.060]  broke it but he he confirmed it all we had the direct sources from nato
[2:46:44.060 --> 2:46:48.300]  from the cia i mean from low level and high level we had it from every angle
[2:46:48.300 --> 2:46:51.740]  when you cross them he's going to fight you to the end at the war to the end
[2:46:51.740 --> 2:46:56.140]  he's fighting isis he's fighting al-qaeda he's fighting al-musra
[2:46:56.140 --> 2:46:59.580]  these are people that hang and in garat some of the horrible stuff that happened
[2:46:59.580 --> 2:47:04.060]  he's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:10.380]  so our joint chief decided some years ago on the basis of intelligence reporting
[2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:13.740]  that there really wasn't any option that there really were no moderate though
[2:47:13.740 --> 2:47:16.300]  we the the white house keeps on talking about
[2:47:16.300 --> 2:47:19.740]  there are moderate groups in the opposition there weren't one time but
[2:47:19.740 --> 2:47:22.780]  they were quickly quickly taken over and cleaned out by the
[2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:26.780]  more radical jihadists oh you know people believe in sharia law
[2:47:26.780 --> 2:47:30.620]  uh some of the groups we advocate uh as a moderate
[2:47:30.620 --> 2:47:33.740]  i have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government no
[2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:37.260]  christians or al-awaits that's a minority sect
[2:47:37.260 --> 2:47:41.900]  shia sect at brishara sad and about 12 percent of the
[2:47:41.900 --> 2:47:45.820]  of the people living in syria belong to none of them could be in could be allowed
[2:47:45.820 --> 2:47:48.300]  to live in the country they were talking about
[2:47:48.300 --> 2:47:51.820]  genocide of you know uh a genocide of cleaning
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:55.820]  after libya fell we began to funnel stuff that
[2:47:55.820 --> 2:48:00.460]  in an earlier article i called the rat line um a lot of arms from libya into
[2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:04.220]  turkey and from turkey uh the gentleman running turkey
[2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:07.820]  are going into is a total complete supporter of isis i don't think there's
[2:48:07.820 --> 2:48:11.420]  any question of that even though we deny that our intelligence social
[2:48:11.420 --> 2:48:15.260]  so what i wrote about is the fact that two and a half years ago the joint chief
[2:48:15.260 --> 2:48:19.100]  decided well they can't convince the white house
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:22.380]  and the state department of intelligence they're just going to begin to do what
[2:48:22.380 --> 2:48:25.660]  they can do so the russians uh basically came
[2:48:25.660 --> 2:48:29.500]  into syria because the us military said we're telling obama if he doesn't back
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:32.060]  off we're going to release the fact that we know they've been funding them
[2:48:32.060 --> 2:48:35.260]  giving them missiles you name it ben gazi was the last straw
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:38.700]  russia said okay we're going to come in trump is right pillory
[2:48:38.700 --> 2:48:42.460]  and obama are the founders of isis they founded it because it's really al-qaeda
[2:48:42.460 --> 2:48:47.900]  to confuse the name donald trump and alex jones the conservative conspiracy
[2:48:47.900 --> 2:48:51.180]  theorist and operator of the website info wars
[2:48:51.180 --> 2:48:56.780]  which seems to be a place where trump gets a lot of his information obama as
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:49:03.740]  the leader of isis is honoring president obama
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:10.380]  he is the founder of isis and again to re-emphasize the quote
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:13.660]  that was contained that leaked audio of john carrey here's the quote
[2:49:13.660 --> 2:49:18.220]  and we know that this was growing we were watching we saw that isis was growing
[2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:21.180]  in strength and we thought asad was threatened
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:25.260]  so they knew isis was growing in strength but because it threatened a sad
[2:49:25.260 --> 2:49:28.620]  they let it happen of course we know they also gave them the weapons
[2:49:28.620 --> 2:49:32.460]  he continued we thought however we could probably manage that
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:37.420]  asad might then negotiate but instead of negotiating he got putin to support him
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:43.420]  so again brazen admission that they knew isis was getting stronger and that that
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:47.180]  was beneficial because they were going to overthrow isis
[2:49:47.180 --> 2:49:50.540]  before of course putin and russia came along and
[2:49:50.540 --> 2:49:53.980]  absolutely obliterated isis the one thing that the obar
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:57.500]  administration admitted they had no plan to do
[2:49:57.500 --> 2:50:01.740]  and again warned isis ahead of time before the bombings refused
[2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:06.220]  to bomb the oil tankers absolutely bombshell revelation
[2:50:06.220 --> 2:50:09.660]  and of course what all that led to was the migrant crisis now we have
[2:50:09.660 --> 2:50:14.220]  this story this is out of spesa muslim migrants throw
[2:50:14.220 --> 2:50:17.260]  firecracker at baby well what do you know it's in
[2:50:17.260 --> 2:50:20.940]  sweden immigrant gangs have put fear into the hearts of the infidels in
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:25.100]  residential areas northeast of gavela in sweden recently the night
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:27.740]  before new year's eve a group of masks used through a
[2:50:27.740 --> 2:50:31.100]  powerful firecracker known as a banger into a stroller
[2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:34.380]  where a three-month-old infant was sleeping
[2:50:34.380 --> 2:50:37.900]  the father of the baby managed to get it out in time
[2:50:37.900 --> 2:50:42.140]  but go watch the video we put up out of sweden back a few days ago
[2:50:42.140 --> 2:50:46.060]  migrants lobbing firecrackers at each other it is
[2:50:46.060 --> 2:50:49.740]  absolute vedlam in sweden this cultural enrichment

[2:55:43.580 --> 2:55:48.540]  lily alan hints at legal action against tommy robinson after twitter row
[2:55:48.540 --> 2:55:51.980]  now we got tommy robinson coming on the show tomorrow by the way
[2:55:51.980 --> 2:55:56.140]  basically lily alan who is this massive virtue signaling
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:00.460]  celebrity in the united kingdom constantly banging on about refugees and
[2:56:00.460 --> 2:56:03.900]  migrants she lost an argument on twitter
[2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:08.140]  with tommy robinson and then threatened to sue him
[2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:11.980]  threatened to take him to court because she lost an argument on twitter
[2:56:11.980 --> 2:56:18.220]  that's how the left does debate again she claimed that because she hadn't
[2:56:18.220 --> 2:56:22.940]  been sexually abused by a migrant that that meant
[2:56:22.940 --> 2:56:27.340]  sexual assaults being committed by migrants weren't happening
[2:56:27.340 --> 2:56:31.100]  which is kind of like saying oh you know i've never had cancer therefore
[2:56:31.100 --> 2:56:34.540]  cancer doesn't exist and cancer isn't a problem
[2:56:34.540 --> 2:56:38.780]  okay that's not an argument she then came out and
[2:56:38.780 --> 2:56:43.020]  with the usual standard fair anti-white racism and said it's only white men that
[2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:46.460]  have ever sexually abused her tommy robinson said
[2:56:46.460 --> 2:56:50.620]  well why haven't you reported that to the police there's no record of it
[2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:54.300]  she had no response she lost the argument she responded
[2:56:54.300 --> 2:56:58.300]  by threatening to sue him saying that he will hear from her lawyers
[2:56:58.300 --> 2:57:01.500]  in the coming days this is how the left does
[2:57:01.500 --> 2:57:05.340]  debate they can't stand to lose so again they resort
[2:57:05.340 --> 2:57:09.180]  to government coercement government action
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:13.740]  uk reality game show star acts for saying all terrorists are muslim again she
[2:57:13.740 --> 2:57:17.500]  didn't say all muslims are terrorists she said that all terrorists are muslim
[2:57:17.500 --> 2:57:20.860]  which for the vast majority is a fact
[2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:23.900]  and islam isn't a race so it's not racist but she was
[2:57:23.900 --> 2:57:28.460]  axed from celebrity big brother in the united kingdom again as the thought
[2:57:28.460 --> 2:57:31.660]  police continue their aggressive patrols
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:35.820]  meanwhile the mirror reports austrian police investigating a
[2:57:35.820 --> 2:57:38.860]  precedented number of sexual assaults on new years even
[2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:43.820]  innsbruck so again we didn't have mass sexual assaults in cologne because of
[2:57:43.820 --> 2:57:46.380]  the massive police presence they prevented it
[2:57:46.380 --> 2:57:49.980]  they were bad for preventing women from being raped because it wasn't
[2:57:49.980 --> 2:57:54.620]  politically correct to profile hundreds of north african muslim migrants who
[2:57:54.620 --> 2:57:58.780]  would gather at exactly the same spot i mean why on
[2:57:58.780 --> 2:58:02.620]  earth did they go to the same spot unless they expected
[2:58:02.620 --> 2:58:06.620]  the same thing to happen it didn't happen thankfully in cologne it did in
[2:58:06.620 --> 2:58:10.380]  other cities including innsbruck austria where police are
[2:58:10.380 --> 2:58:14.140]  investigating an unprecedented number of sexual assaults
[2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:18.620]  on new years eve so it happened in innsbruck it's happening in other
[2:58:18.620 --> 2:58:21.660]  countries again this is the cultural enrichment
[2:58:21.660 --> 2:58:26.940]  that the west is importing firecrackers being literally thrown into baby
[2:58:26.940 --> 2:58:30.700]  strollers this is a problem and speaking out
[2:58:30.700 --> 2:58:34.540]  against it isn't racist it makes complete common sense

[3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:48.300]  before we go there i reinstituted a tradition
[3:00:48.300 --> 3:00:52.060]  which on new year's day every year for the last
[3:00:52.060 --> 3:00:56.780]  11 years the
[3:00:57.660 --> 3:01:02.300]  dressed people on the face of the planet we call this mr stone's
[3:01:02.300 --> 3:01:07.900]  international best and dressed list and it's gotten very wide media coverage
[3:01:07.900 --> 3:01:11.980]  i'm happy to say that right here at info wars
[3:01:11.980 --> 3:01:18.060]  oan schweyer has made this year's list he's got the whole spread collar tight
[3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:22.860]  tie not down perfectly now there were others who
[3:01:22.860 --> 3:01:25.900]  made the list but did not fare as well
[3:01:25.900 --> 3:01:31.420]  michael moore comes to mind what can you say other than
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:36.700]  slob uh hillary clinton but then let's face it she's not going to look good in
[3:01:36.700 --> 3:01:41.900]  anything other than an orange jumpsuit and then of course you've got some
[3:01:41.900 --> 3:01:46.940]  emeritus members of this fraternity like larry kudlow
[3:01:46.940 --> 3:01:52.300]  perhaps the best dressed man on television so if you have not had the
[3:01:52.300 --> 3:01:57.100]  opportunity to check it out uh you can find that folks like
[3:01:57.100 --> 3:02:02.140]  sank uh from the uh the young turds i mean the young turks
[3:02:02.140 --> 3:02:05.900]  who assaulted alex and i last summer makes the worst
[3:02:05.900 --> 3:02:12.220]  dressed list it's a moment of uh of levity to start the new year
[3:02:12.220 --> 3:02:16.380]  you'll find lina dunham you guess which list she's on
[3:02:16.380 --> 3:02:19.980]  you can also find kim kimberley gilfoil at fox
[3:02:19.980 --> 3:02:26.380]  you can guess which list she's on so uh start looking for this every new year's
[3:02:26.380 --> 3:02:31.900]  eve you can find it at stone cold truth dot com you can also find it at
[3:02:31.900 --> 3:02:36.780]  stone on style where we keep track of these things i want to say right up
[3:02:36.780 --> 3:02:42.220]  front our lists are not ideological we've had some liberals on the best
[3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:46.700]  lists and we've had some fine americans like ron paul
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:50.220]  who looks like he slept in his clothes on the worst list
[3:02:50.220 --> 3:02:56.860]  so this is a fashion statement not an ideological statement
[3:02:56.860 --> 3:03:02.380]  we are uh have a lot of ground to cover uh because the
[3:03:02.380 --> 3:03:06.380]  waning days of the obama administration have featured
[3:03:06.380 --> 3:03:11.420]  this ongoing effort to try to undermine the legitimacy
[3:03:11.420 --> 3:03:17.020]  of president elect trump's uh uh ascendancy to the white house
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:23.420]  uh strangely enough today i believe senator john mccain had to cancel his
[3:03:23.420 --> 3:03:27.980]  vaulted hearing in which he and his sidekick
[3:03:27.980 --> 3:03:33.740]  from south carolina were going to reveal all this proof they have of
[3:03:33.740 --> 3:03:38.140]  russian hacking of the election i think the reason they scrub the hearing is
[3:03:38.140 --> 3:03:43.260]  because there is no proof there has never been
[3:03:43.260 --> 3:03:46.940]  any proof it's kind of interesting to me that the
[3:03:46.940 --> 3:03:52.300]  number one progenitor of this theory is cia director john brennan
[3:03:52.300 --> 3:03:56.460]  brennan is a man who refused to be sworn in using the bible
[3:03:56.460 --> 3:04:02.140]  who has converted to wahhabism uh who has spent a substantial amount of time
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:08.700]  in that region who personally cleansed the passport files of barack obama
[3:04:08.700 --> 3:04:11.900]  when he was preparing to run for a second term
[3:04:11.900 --> 3:04:16.460]  uh and quite frankly if you believe my friend wane madsen and i do
[3:04:16.460 --> 3:04:24.540]  is a mole a saudi mole that is who is advocating and pushing the entire
[3:04:24.540 --> 3:04:28.140]  false narrative that the russians have somehow hacked
[3:04:28.140 --> 3:04:33.020]  this election it came back around last night when
[3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:36.700]  sean hannity uh was asked about this and we'll come to that
[3:04:36.700 --> 3:04:40.220]  in just a moment we're going to put this whole russian question
[3:04:40.220 --> 3:04:45.180]  to bed where it belongs thanks for joining us at info wars
[3:04:45.180 --> 3:05:00.940]  baby baby baby i'm gonna leave you
[3:05:00.940 --> 3:05:04.940]  the huffington post says donald trump is unfit
[3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:09.340]  to be president and they've thought of a way to begin the impeachment of trump
[3:05:09.340 --> 3:05:13.420]  right now before the inauguration in an article titled
[3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:18.220]  impeaching trump the process begins now huffington post contributor robert
[3:05:18.220 --> 3:05:23.420]  curtner says president elect donald trump is far more of a menace to society
[3:05:23.420 --> 3:05:28.540]  than even richard nixon whoa and he expects trump will immediately
[3:05:28.540 --> 3:05:32.300]  break the law and violate the constitution therefore the
[3:05:32.300 --> 3:05:37.260]  huffington post is calling for a citizen's impeachment inquiry to begin
[3:05:37.260 --> 3:05:41.260]  the first day trump steps into office the idea
[3:05:41.260 --> 3:05:45.820]  is to keep daily records of trump's high crimes and misdemeanors
[3:05:45.820 --> 3:05:49.660]  including evidence they collect of his treasonous alliance
[3:05:49.660 --> 3:05:53.260]  with vladimir putin more desperation from the
[3:05:53.260 --> 3:05:57.500]  lunatics on the far left you can learn more

[3:07:07.340 --> 3:07:11.100]  told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies
[3:07:11.100 --> 3:07:13.660]  can devastate iq and how the government
[3:07:13.660 --> 3:07:17.500]  knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride
[3:07:17.500 --> 3:07:21.580]  the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[3:07:21.580 --> 3:07:25.820]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened
[3:07:25.820 --> 3:07:29.420]  as it still is worsening today i was there telling you how to prepare
[3:07:29.420 --> 3:07:34.860]  yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed
[3:07:34.860 --> 3:07:37.980]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut
[3:07:37.980 --> 3:07:41.260]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest
[3:07:41.260 --> 3:07:45.500]  revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself
[3:07:45.500 --> 3:07:49.820]  this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view

[3:08:31.980 --> 3:08:36.380]  you are the resistance live from austin texas
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:46.140]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[3:08:46.140 --> 3:08:50.620]  can i ask you this have you ever talked to vladimir putin no
[3:08:50.620 --> 3:08:53.580]  have you ever talked to any of his surrogates no
[3:08:53.580 --> 3:08:57.580]  have you ever talked to donald trump no any of his surrogates no
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:09:01.820]  not one there was some report that you might have talked to somebody who was
[3:09:01.820 --> 3:09:05.420]  not associated with the campaign roger stone no that's false
[3:09:05.420 --> 3:09:08.940]  i think where this roger stone claim is coming from is
[3:09:08.940 --> 3:09:16.700]  uh there's a a radio guy on wbai which is a mutual friend
[3:09:16.700 --> 3:09:20.380]  who was who wanted to come and see me to see if i would set up a radio show on
[3:09:20.380 --> 3:09:24.220]  wbai uh but he didn't he did come to london but he
[3:09:24.220 --> 3:09:29.260]  didn't meet with me uh that is of course completely
[3:09:29.260 --> 3:09:33.260]  consistent with what i have said all along i have never claimed
[3:09:33.260 --> 3:09:38.300]  to have met with julie assange someone i admire very much someone who i think is
[3:09:38.300 --> 3:09:43.100]  a free freedom fighter i i did correctly say
[3:09:43.100 --> 3:09:46.300]  that we had a mutual acquaintance and that i had
[3:09:46.300 --> 3:09:53.980]  learned that assange had unspecified political dynamite that he would release
[3:09:53.980 --> 3:09:58.620]  that is not to say that i knew what assange would deliver
[3:09:58.620 --> 3:10:03.660]  when he would deliver it uh where he got it where it came from i never made any
[3:10:03.660 --> 3:10:07.500]  such claims just for the historical record
[3:10:07.500 --> 3:10:11.020]  my claim that assange had unspecified political dot
[3:10:11.020 --> 3:10:17.500]  dynamite that would royal the race turned out to be exactly correct
[3:10:17.500 --> 3:10:21.180]  we are going to be taking some of your calls today because this is one of my
[3:10:21.180 --> 3:10:25.820]  favorite parts of the show that number is uh 800
[3:10:25.820 --> 3:10:33.020]  259 9231 uh we will move to calls here shortly
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:37.820]  uh but i want to uh once and for all put to bed the
[3:10:37.820 --> 3:10:43.580]  so-called russian canard at about 11 o'clock last night i got a phone call
[3:10:43.580 --> 3:10:48.220]  from a reporter uh with the hill newspaper
[3:10:48.220 --> 3:10:52.620]  it was as if the spell was ripped van winkel we were starting from the beginning
[3:10:52.620 --> 3:10:57.260]  the clinton people claim that you knew in advance about the hacking of john
[3:10:57.260 --> 3:11:01.660]  pedesta uh and that assange was briefing you on what
[3:11:01.660 --> 3:11:08.460]  was to come it was false then it is false now
[3:11:08.460 --> 3:11:12.860]  i have no russian clients i have no russian influences
[3:11:12.860 --> 3:11:17.180]  i have never been to russia i have never met with anyone from
[3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:20.540]  into russian intelligence i have never met
[3:11:20.540 --> 3:11:24.460]  latimer putin but this is the new macartheism
[3:11:24.460 --> 3:11:28.060]  if you're not for thermonuclear war over syria
[3:11:28.060 --> 3:11:32.140]  well then you must be a traitor to the united states
[3:11:32.140 --> 3:11:35.900]  let's move to some questions uh let's see we have d in
[3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:39.660]  california d what's up
[3:11:39.900 --> 3:11:45.660]  yes i do and uh i want to first give uh some credit to our roger stone and to
[3:11:45.660 --> 3:11:49.100]  alex jones for uh getting a lot of the info
[3:11:49.100 --> 3:11:53.500]  out that is uh very important to the people but um
[3:11:53.500 --> 3:11:58.380]  i have a question that's concerning me and it's uh
[3:11:58.380 --> 3:12:01.420]  if everybody's supposed to be informed and try to
[3:12:01.420 --> 3:12:06.140]  work against this uh one world government uh
[3:12:06.140 --> 3:12:09.900]  is alex jones roger stone you guys concerned about that this might be
[3:12:09.900 --> 3:12:13.180]  prophecy uh that these things are happening
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:17.900]  and if things get so bad and we try to stand up or people try to stand up to
[3:12:17.900 --> 3:12:21.340]  fight against it wouldn't that be going would that be
[3:12:21.340 --> 3:12:24.940]  something that's not sanctioned by god because the fact that
[3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:28.780]  uh this world is ruled by the devil and uh
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:32.460]  if the prophecy is going to be then it becomes a spiritual war not a physical
[3:12:32.460 --> 3:12:36.700]  war like they get your take on that roger stone
[3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:40.700]  sure uh i don't believe that slavery is ever
[3:12:40.700 --> 3:12:45.980]  uh ordained by a greater god in fact it's just the opposite
[3:12:45.980 --> 3:12:52.620]  we're put on earth to fight for our freedom uh it moses led his people out
[3:12:52.620 --> 3:12:56.220]  of servitude that is the story of christianity
[3:12:56.220 --> 3:13:00.460]  so um i think we're put here to fight uh and the only
[3:13:00.460 --> 3:13:04.540]  unchristian thing the only only ungodly thing
[3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:08.300]  is to buckling over to some totalitarian
[3:13:08.300 --> 3:13:12.540]  power that would destroy our free speech our free expression
[3:13:12.540 --> 3:13:18.140]  our free association uh and so on this is make no mistake about it we're
[3:13:18.140 --> 3:13:22.300]  headed for a very long hard struggle against the
[3:13:22.300 --> 3:13:28.300]  well-heeled forces of globalism who have up until now
[3:13:28.300 --> 3:13:33.100]  had a monopoly on control of information thank god
[3:13:33.100 --> 3:13:38.060]  and thanks to info wars dot com and bright bart and daily caller and so many
[3:13:38.060 --> 3:13:41.420]  others they no longer have a monopoly
[3:13:41.420 --> 3:13:45.740]  we're now at the table in fact we may have a bigger audience than they do
[3:13:45.740 --> 3:13:51.580]  so uh the struggle must continue uh indrew in california wants to talk
[3:13:51.580 --> 3:13:58.380]  about war with russia indrew laid on us hello
[3:13:58.380 --> 3:14:04.060]  yes sir go ahead oh yes indeed how you doing mr stone i first just wanted to
[3:14:04.060 --> 3:14:07.180]  say thank you for you know all the great work you do and
[3:14:07.180 --> 3:14:10.620]  you know everything you've been doing but um yeah i just
[3:14:10.620 --> 3:14:14.380]  i just wanted to see what you think about all the things going on just
[3:14:14.380 --> 3:14:21.100]  with the last few days of obama and his uh legacy i'm just worried about this
[3:14:21.100 --> 3:14:24.700]  uh them trying to start something with russia and
[3:14:24.700 --> 3:14:29.340]  you know with all these uh fake allegations and
[3:14:29.340 --> 3:14:34.700]  whatnot well i think it is uh it is kind of odd
[3:14:34.700 --> 3:14:39.020]  that for eight years the russians have pushed barack obama around like a
[3:14:39.020 --> 3:14:43.740]  child uh and we have uh they moved on crimea
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:47.980]  they have they have perpetrated numerous uh
[3:14:47.980 --> 3:14:52.540]  acts against the united states and barack obama has done nothing
[3:14:52.540 --> 3:14:57.500]  now suddenly with less than 20 days to go in his presidency
[3:14:57.500 --> 3:15:01.500]  he's going to expel a bunch of russians on the basis of
[3:15:01.500 --> 3:15:08.940]  no evidence of hacking please it is so uh transparent
[3:15:08.940 --> 3:15:13.660]  that this is a last ditch effort to create
[3:15:13.660 --> 3:15:18.300]  a reason not to have the next president sworn in
[3:15:18.300 --> 3:15:23.020]  some of our european allies who are perhaps not as sophisticated in the
[3:15:23.020 --> 3:15:25.900]  ways of western politics are still wondering
[3:15:25.900 --> 3:15:28.460]  whether trump will ever actually get to the point
[3:15:28.460 --> 3:15:32.780]  where he has his hand on the bible uh but because we are a
[3:15:32.780 --> 3:15:36.860]  a a nation of laws and not men
[3:15:36.860 --> 3:15:41.420]  i am confident that donald j trump will take office as scheduled
[3:15:41.420 --> 3:15:44.220]  uh and that we are going to then have a
[3:15:44.220 --> 3:15:49.100]  entirely new direction and a new fight over america's future
[3:15:49.100 --> 3:15:53.260]  so barack obama in all honesty too little
[3:15:53.260 --> 3:15:59.340]  too late uh derrick from michigan what's on your mind
[3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:07.420]  derrick how you doing uh mr stone i'm doing great
[3:16:07.420 --> 3:16:11.100]  what's your question for good hey my question is uh
[3:16:11.100 --> 3:16:14.700]  what do you think the next big roadblock is going to be
[3:16:14.700 --> 3:16:19.820]  for uh the president elect in the next two weeks i'm sure there's going to be
[3:16:19.820 --> 3:16:25.260]  another one what do you predict well it's it's rather hard to say
[3:16:25.260 --> 3:16:30.460]  once he gets the levers of power i think it's also very important that
[3:16:30.460 --> 3:16:35.820]  in my opinion president elect trump could have as many as four
[3:16:35.820 --> 3:16:41.900]  appointments to the u.s supreme court now the first appointment in my opinion
[3:16:41.900 --> 3:16:45.740]  will be the most important if you look at it from a historical
[3:16:45.740 --> 3:16:51.900]  point of view first franklin roosevelt uh put one of his closest friends on the
[3:16:51.900 --> 3:16:56.060]  court and then the other three jurists
[3:16:56.060 --> 3:17:01.500]  essentially became followers uh in this particular case i think
[3:17:01.500 --> 3:17:05.500]  trump has a unique opportunity to rebuild the court
[3:17:05.500 --> 3:17:08.860]  uh i'm not hoping that he appoints a right winger
[3:17:08.860 --> 3:17:12.380]  to the court i'm hoping that he appoints a libertarian
[3:17:12.380 --> 3:17:17.100]  to the coin that is my fondest wish uh but i do think you're going to see
[3:17:17.100 --> 3:17:21.020]  action in that area in the next two weeks and i can predict you
[3:17:21.020 --> 3:17:24.700]  right now the liberals and the democrats
[3:17:24.700 --> 3:17:28.540]  and chuck schumer are going to go out of
[3:17:28.540 --> 3:17:34.860]  their minds uh dany you've got a question
[3:17:39.660 --> 3:17:42.700]  dany we lose you
[3:17:43.740 --> 3:17:49.580]  appears to be the case uh let us uh move on then to judy in florida judy
[3:17:49.580 --> 3:17:54.300]  what's on your mind hi roger it's nice to talk to you
[3:17:54.300 --> 3:17:57.660]  um i i really appreciate you what you've done with
[3:17:57.660 --> 3:18:01.900]  trump's campaign and and your friendship with trump and having said that
[3:18:01.900 --> 3:18:07.980]  um do you think there's going to be a very meaningful look at the um not just
[3:18:07.980 --> 3:18:15.180]  the felons but uh it muslims in general the infiltration of our country
[3:18:15.180 --> 3:18:21.900]  um i i saw and listened to um at a patriot meeting last night in my state
[3:18:21.900 --> 3:18:25.660]  a very powerful speaker who was raised in egypt
[3:18:25.660 --> 3:18:28.540]  and he's a christian a baptist christian
[3:18:28.540 --> 3:18:35.100]  and he studied uh the muslim faith uh and sharia law
[3:18:35.100 --> 3:18:40.060]  uh all of his life and you know he addresses this issue very powerfully
[3:18:40.060 --> 3:18:43.260]  but you know just bottom line as far as my question
[3:18:43.260 --> 3:18:47.660]  is do you think there's going to be a meaningful deportation
[3:18:47.660 --> 3:18:52.780]  of of you know the muslim people uh in this country not just felons
[3:18:52.780 --> 3:18:57.820]  after trump gets an office i do not think that there will be mass deportations
[3:18:57.820 --> 3:19:01.260]  nor do i think it would be correct what we do need
[3:19:01.260 --> 3:19:06.460]  is a complete house cleaning uh in an entirely new beginning among our
[3:19:06.460 --> 3:19:10.700]  intelligence services we need a new fbi director who
[3:19:10.700 --> 3:19:14.300]  isn't in the tank somebody like judge janine piero
[3:19:14.300 --> 3:19:19.500]  for example we need a new cia director who unlike
[3:19:19.500 --> 3:19:26.380]  john brennan who i believe is a saudi mole uh but someone who is loyal
[3:19:26.380 --> 3:19:30.940]  united states and understands uh as general flinn does for example
[3:19:30.940 --> 3:19:35.020]  the inherent dangers uh of islamic terrorism
[3:19:35.020 --> 3:19:38.860]  that i think is the most important uh thing we need to focus on
[3:19:38.860 --> 3:19:43.020]  it's been great to take your questions perhaps we'll grab a few more later on
[3:19:43.020 --> 3:19:54.780]  but uh thanks for joining me here at info wars

[3:26:09.660 --> 3:26:13.820]  enough about these fine products
[3:26:13.820 --> 3:26:18.620]  we uh apparently i missed a story a few months ago but
[3:26:18.620 --> 3:26:23.900]  it does still merit attention right here down in florida the city of
[3:26:23.900 --> 3:26:27.660]  pembroke pines there's a city commissioner named
[3:26:27.660 --> 3:26:31.660]  jay schwarz now this loser may set the record for
[3:26:31.660 --> 3:26:39.260]  anti-american tone deafness of all time get this on the week of 9 11
[3:26:39.260 --> 3:26:43.580]  yep the anniversary of the terrorist attacks jay schwarz proposed
[3:26:43.580 --> 3:26:49.500]  that his city officially designate may as muslim heritage month
[3:26:49.500 --> 3:26:53.420]  now here's where it really gets interesting since the days of reagan
[3:26:53.420 --> 3:26:56.620]  may of every month is designated by the president
[3:26:56.620 --> 3:27:03.180]  and by congressional resolution as jewish american heritage month
[3:27:03.180 --> 3:27:08.940]  so follow me here schwarz proposed during the week of 9 11 to rename
[3:27:08.940 --> 3:27:13.100]  jewish american heritage month as muslim heritage
[3:27:13.100 --> 3:27:19.500]  a month why you ask quoting the statement that mr schwarz put out
[3:27:19.500 --> 3:27:23.580]  when he made his resolution it was because american muslims
[3:27:23.580 --> 3:27:27.820]  have been striving to promote peace and understanding
[3:27:27.820 --> 3:27:32.700]  really so why am i bringing this up because here we are
[3:27:32.700 --> 3:27:37.900]  once again mr schwarz is back with his plan to designate the month as muslim
[3:27:37.900 --> 3:27:42.300]  month why does this guy hate america
[3:27:42.300 --> 3:27:46.540]  why does schwarz want to wipe out the jewish american heritage month
[3:27:46.540 --> 3:27:50.940]  what's next from this character so here's what i suggest folks
[3:27:50.940 --> 3:27:55.980]  we live in a democracy call commissioner schwarz at 9 5 4
[3:27:55.980 --> 3:28:02.540]  4 5 0 1 0 3 0 politely exercise your first amendment
[3:28:02.540 --> 3:28:07.980]  rights and let him know that pandering to pro sharia ideas
[3:28:07.980 --> 3:28:12.620]  is a terrible terrible idea
[3:28:13.420 --> 3:28:20.540]  i mentioned a little earlier that i was able to turn in 125 000 words
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:26.460]  approximately 400 pages for my upcoming book the making of the president
[3:28:26.460 --> 3:28:32.220]  2016 how donald trump orchestrated an american revolution
[3:28:32.220 --> 3:28:38.140]  now if all goes as i hope and our editors can work with some efficiency

[3:28:42.700 --> 3:28:45.900]  what actually transpired and how donald trump
[3:28:45.900 --> 3:28:50.700]  pulled off the greatest single political upset in american history
[3:28:50.700 --> 3:28:54.140]  there's a lot of inside information in here in fact there's a
[3:28:54.140 --> 3:28:59.740]  very substantial analysis of the importance of info wars and the other
[3:28:59.740 --> 3:29:05.020]  alternative media in the in the
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:11.660]  role of winning this election and providing the counterpoint
[3:29:11.660 --> 3:29:20.060]  to the cnn's the foxes the networks and so on so i urge you to go to

[3:30:25.260 --> 3:30:29.660]  sourced for the dnc and john pedesta documents was not russia or any

[3:30:54.220 --> 3:30:57.900]  reason why he is now putting his fears for his family on the record

[3:35:35.740 --> 3:35:40.780]  and others peter welcome to info wars dot com
[3:35:40.780 --> 3:35:45.740]  thank you roger's pleasure to be here i specifically wanted to talk to you
[3:35:45.740 --> 3:35:49.820]  because i thought it was interesting that in this past week
[3:35:49.820 --> 3:35:53.340]  last sunday specifically the new york times
[3:35:53.340 --> 3:35:58.220]  printed an op-ed story in which they yet recycled the claim
[3:35:58.220 --> 3:36:04.380]  that president richard nixon interceded with the south vietnamese
[3:36:04.380 --> 3:36:08.380]  in order to stall off a peace initiative by president
[3:36:08.380 --> 3:36:14.140]  linden baines johnson uh that nixon believed was designed to cost him the
[3:36:14.140 --> 3:36:17.500]  election now there have been a number of books written
[3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:20.940]  about this there have been a number of claims
[3:36:20.940 --> 3:36:25.580]  up until now there has never been any direct proof
[3:36:25.580 --> 3:36:31.820]  of nixon's personal involvement a journalist named john ferrell claims to
[3:36:31.820 --> 3:36:36.460]  have found notes that indicate that nixon discussed this with his
[3:36:36.460 --> 3:36:41.020]  chief aid uh hr bob holliman who would later become
[3:36:41.020 --> 3:36:45.740]  white house chief of staff and of course go to jail in the watergate scandal
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:50.220]  so damaging was this story to nixon that the new york times could resist running
[3:36:50.220 --> 3:36:53.420]  the whole story all over again on page one
[3:36:53.420 --> 3:36:59.420]  yesterday uh what was your take on this i know you are a
[3:36:59.420 --> 3:37:03.500]  i mean hey hey and i understand that but they're
[3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:09.020]  they're at some point nixon's dead
[3:37:09.020 --> 3:37:15.420]  it's exactly right over um yeah but they can see new coming out
[3:37:15.420 --> 3:37:18.860]  and there's nothing new in the new york times story they have
[3:37:18.860 --> 3:37:24.780]  they have a line or two that holliman apparently scribbled
[3:37:24.780 --> 3:37:29.820]  based on notes from a phone call they have no record of nixon having taken
[3:37:29.820 --> 3:37:34.700]  any action there's no way to confirm with holliman
[3:37:34.700 --> 3:37:39.340]  what holliman meant when he wrote the note
[3:37:39.340 --> 3:37:43.180]  um this this is this is the kind of thing where you know
[3:37:43.180 --> 3:37:48.300]  if your wife thinks you're cheating on her she's going to find proof you're
[3:37:48.300 --> 3:37:51.420]  cheating whether you are or not
[3:37:51.420 --> 3:37:55.260]  i think that's an excellent the new york times hates nixon
[3:37:55.260 --> 3:37:59.420]  they have always hated nixon they hate nixon going back to helen gehagen
[3:37:59.420 --> 3:38:03.020]  douglas they hate nixon going back to jerry fourhees
[3:38:03.020 --> 3:38:07.580]  um they hate nixon because of alger hiss they hate nixon because he was
[3:38:07.580 --> 3:38:11.500]  right about so many things and they will stop it nothing to
[3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:16.380]  continue to blacken his reputation yeah i think i think this has to this has to
[3:38:16.380 --> 3:38:21.820]  be put in a very important context and and it is this
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:25.340]  yes linden johnson orchestrated a bombing hall
[3:38:25.340 --> 3:38:28.860]  he had no concessions from the north yeddon meese
[3:38:28.860 --> 3:38:33.260]  none whatsoever it was a unilateral bombing hall
[3:38:33.260 --> 3:38:37.180]  meant to buy ubert haratio humphrey the presidency
[3:38:37.180 --> 3:38:41.100]  there was nothing behind it so for for anyone to say
[3:38:41.100 --> 3:38:47.340]  nixon acted in the trees this way and cost us peace is false this was one
[3:38:47.340 --> 3:38:50.940]  politician outmaneuvering another remember what you do the other thing
[3:38:50.940 --> 3:38:55.100]  roger in the new york times jack carl says this in the story
[3:38:55.100 --> 3:39:00.860]  that johnson learned of this whole alleged story
[3:39:00.860 --> 3:39:05.420]  which has permeated through the washington
[3:39:05.420 --> 3:39:10.620]  corridors of power for 50 years now is it johnson learned through a
[3:39:10.620 --> 3:39:16.860]  true bugs and illegal surveillance yeah he had he had jade gehrhoover uh bugging
[3:39:16.860 --> 3:39:20.780]  richard nixon's campaign plan that's how that's how he knew this
[3:39:20.780 --> 3:39:26.220]  i've never been involved in any serious conversations with anybody
[3:39:26.220 --> 3:39:33.820]  about linden johnson's abuse of the national intelligence law enforcement
[3:39:33.820 --> 3:39:39.180]  apparatus for political ends now this of course was supposed to have been
[3:39:39.180 --> 3:39:44.700]  nixon's big crime his big sin that he that he obstructed justice that he
[3:39:44.700 --> 3:39:48.540]  used the sky and the fbi to try and stop the watergate
[3:39:48.540 --> 3:39:51.260]  investigation that he abused the power of office
[3:39:51.260 --> 3:39:55.500]  we have jack for admitting in the story here that johnson did precisely the
[3:39:55.500 --> 3:39:59.820]  same thing that nixon did um perhaps even on a greater scale
[3:39:59.820 --> 3:40:05.500]  on on on on on issues at least of equal importance
[3:40:05.500 --> 3:40:10.220]  and and there's there's there's no desire to hash this out over johnson who
[3:40:10.220 --> 3:40:14.940]  in my mind is a failed president in a far in a far bigger
[3:40:14.940 --> 3:40:20.220]  majestic volumes by robert caro not withstanding he's a failed president
[3:40:20.220 --> 3:40:23.660]  yeah it's interesting that mr caro's biography
[3:40:23.660 --> 3:40:29.900]  never ever once in four volumes mentions billy sol estes
[3:40:29.900 --> 3:40:34.540]  mr estes does not exist he's been airbrushed out of history by mr caro
[3:40:34.540 --> 3:40:38.060]  why because he and linden johnson were stealing money
[3:40:38.060 --> 3:40:42.140]  hand over fist also remember the context here
[3:40:42.140 --> 3:40:45.740]  they may it may be in book five but people should read your book about the
[3:40:45.740 --> 3:40:50.060]  man who killed kennedy because it goes in it goes into all of this
[3:40:50.060 --> 3:40:53.820]  detail but but you know johnson was a was a new
[3:40:53.820 --> 3:40:57.340]  dealer and that been a progressive on civil rights and all of these other
[3:40:57.340 --> 3:41:01.260]  things that the new york times thinks thinks
[3:41:01.260 --> 3:41:05.260]  important uh things uh venerable things
[3:41:05.260 --> 3:41:09.100]  safely uh but you know they're included nixon the eastern establishment
[3:41:09.100 --> 3:41:13.900]  hatred of nixon goes back to at least to his first congressional
[3:41:13.900 --> 3:41:17.340]  campaign and certainly the senate campaign against helen gehegan
[3:41:17.340 --> 3:41:20.700]  douglas they never forgave him for being right about algerhiss
[3:41:20.700 --> 3:41:25.020]  and for being right about widaker chambers and and they want to keep dancing
[3:41:25.020 --> 3:41:28.780]  on his grave and and as far as this story is concerned
[3:41:28.780 --> 3:41:32.380]  there's nothing in these notes that all that that is
[3:41:32.380 --> 3:41:39.500]  confirmation that is proof positives um that that nixon personally
[3:41:39.500 --> 3:41:47.260]  intervened to um prevent a ceasefire from occurring in vietnam
[3:41:47.260 --> 3:41:51.180]  the ceasefire wasn't even on the table well again
[3:41:51.180 --> 3:41:55.740]  the story they have to tell to perpetuate the idea that nixon was an evil man
[3:41:55.740 --> 3:41:59.900]  rather than a flawed genius well again context
[3:41:59.900 --> 3:42:03.660]  let's not lose sight of the fact that nixon always believed
[3:42:03.660 --> 3:42:08.700]  that john kennedy had beaten him by using classified information regarding the
[3:42:08.700 --> 3:42:12.940]  bay of pigs and therefore had cheated so it was not going to happen to him a
[3:42:12.940 --> 3:42:17.340]  second time secondarily as even walt rostow who
[3:42:17.340 --> 3:42:20.540]  worked for lbj said nobody needed to tell them to
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:24.140]  south vietnamese to resist and not give in to johnson's deal
[3:42:24.140 --> 3:42:30.140]  they weren't inclined to take the deal anyway so uh this is very clearly what
[3:42:30.140 --> 3:42:35.260]  happened johnson as president employed a
[3:42:35.260 --> 3:42:38.140]  last-minute maneuver to try to elect ubert
[3:42:38.140 --> 3:42:42.700]  humphrey there was nothing behind it nixon figured out exactly what he was
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:47.100]  doing uh and thwarted it but the truth is
[3:42:47.100 --> 3:42:52.460]  there was no opportunity for peace no the war would not have ended many years
[3:42:52.460 --> 3:42:58.060]  earlier that is all liberal bs okay well they're they're
[3:42:58.060 --> 3:43:01.020]  defending their own team and their own turf it was
[3:43:01.020 --> 3:43:04.780]  you know it was johnson who expanded the war it was nixon
[3:43:04.780 --> 3:43:09.180]  who grew down the war and ultimately brought the americans home and
[3:43:09.180 --> 3:43:12.220]  successfully perfumed pursued the policy of i think
[3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:16.540]  vietnamization and if the democratic congress that
[3:43:16.540 --> 3:43:20.460]  was elected after nixon's resignation hadn't pulled the rug out from
[3:43:20.460 --> 3:43:23.660]  underneath the south vietnamese we never would have had the vote people
[3:43:23.660 --> 3:43:28.540]  the vote people in the genocide um the we experienced but that's not what
[3:43:28.540 --> 3:43:31.980]  um that's not the way history likes to tell the story because the way the
[3:43:31.980 --> 3:43:35.580]  historians the contemporary historians like to tell the story the liberals like
[3:43:35.580 --> 3:43:38.860]  kennedy and johnson are always the good guys and the bat and the conservatives
[3:43:38.860 --> 3:43:42.140]  like nixon and reagan are always the bad guys you know they so they tell the
[3:43:42.140 --> 3:43:47.260]  same story about reagan only it was george bush and bill kasey
[3:43:47.260 --> 3:43:50.940]  made a secret trip to paris to meet with
[3:43:50.940 --> 3:43:56.780]  representatives of the ayatollah to um get them to agree that they wouldn't
[3:43:56.780 --> 3:44:01.820]  let the hostages go until after the november 1980 election
[3:44:01.820 --> 3:44:06.140]  very interestingly the actual first person
[3:44:06.140 --> 3:44:11.260]  who came up with the idea of dylan trump running for president united states
[3:44:11.260 --> 3:44:15.100]  was none other than richard millhouse nixon
[3:44:15.100 --> 3:44:22.860]  nixon met trump in george steinbrenner's box yankee stadium uh in 87
[3:44:23.420 --> 3:44:28.540]  and he called me the next morning we had a regular saturday morning phone call
[3:44:28.540 --> 3:44:33.020]  and he said your man's got it you know he's really got it and i said sir he
[3:44:33.020 --> 3:44:37.420]  said trump he's really got it if he ever runs he'll win
[3:44:37.420 --> 3:44:41.020]  shortly thereafter trump receives a note from
[3:44:41.020 --> 3:44:45.580]  nixon which is very typical nixonian circum
[3:44:45.580 --> 3:44:51.260]  location in which he says dear donald uh mrs nixon saw you on the mic douglas
[3:44:51.260 --> 3:44:56.700]  show thought you were excellent and she says if you ever run for office
[3:44:56.700 --> 3:45:01.100]  you will win and mrs nixon knows about these things
[3:45:01.100 --> 3:45:05.100]  well of course it was nixon's observation not mrs nixon's
[3:45:05.100 --> 3:45:10.140]  uh but from that uh came a weekend in houston
[3:45:10.140 --> 3:45:16.060]  where the trump's the connelly's john connelly and his wife nellie
[3:45:16.060 --> 3:45:21.020]  uh and the nixon's spent a weekend uh getting acquainted
[3:45:21.020 --> 3:45:24.060]  and nixon came away from that telling me
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:29.740]  over a long period of time that donald trump would someday be president
[3:45:29.740 --> 3:45:36.780]  therefore it's not surprising to me that trump runs as the candidate of the
[3:45:36.780 --> 3:45:42.460]  silent majority the candidate of the forgotten americans
[3:45:42.460 --> 3:45:46.220]  the candidate of law and order and of course
[3:45:46.220 --> 3:45:50.220]  in the final analysis the candidate of peace
[3:45:50.220 --> 3:45:55.740]  does this sound familiar to you absolutely and i'm not the least bit
[3:45:55.740 --> 3:45:59.420]  surprised and i'm not the least bit surprised that his
[3:45:59.420 --> 3:46:03.660]  victory came from the same kind of people who switched their
[3:46:03.660 --> 3:46:07.020]  allegiance from the democrats to the republicans for richard nixon
[3:46:07.020 --> 3:46:11.500]  in 1968 and 1972 and who came through in a big way for ronald
[3:46:11.500 --> 3:46:17.020]  reagan in 1980 and 1984 because trump talks about issues that people care
[3:46:17.020 --> 3:46:21.260]  about like jobs jobs and of course jobs um
[3:46:21.260 --> 3:46:23.820]  and and so i think i think there are lots of
[3:46:23.820 --> 3:46:28.860]  interval comparisons to be made between trump nixon and reagan and they're not
[3:46:28.860 --> 3:46:32.060]  they're not identical and i'm not trying to suggest that they're all
[3:46:32.060 --> 3:46:35.820]  identical or they're or they're thinking is alike or there's
[3:46:35.820 --> 3:46:39.260]  there's an affinity for a certain kind of an orthodoxy
[3:46:39.260 --> 3:46:45.260]  ideologically or politically or tactically but they understand each of
[3:46:45.260 --> 3:46:48.860]  them in their own ways understands the american electorate and
[3:46:48.860 --> 3:46:53.660]  understands what's necessary to win the presidency and i and i think
[3:46:53.660 --> 3:46:58.060]  they've demonstrated that clearly um i think that the that the that the
[3:46:58.060 --> 3:47:00.700]  liberals at the left at the new york times and the
[3:47:00.700 --> 3:47:05.180]  washington post and everyone else are trying to set up the comparison between
[3:47:05.180 --> 3:47:09.100]  nixon and trump because they want to destroy trump the same way that they
[3:47:09.100 --> 3:47:13.100]  believe they destroyed nixon um they want to use
[3:47:13.100 --> 3:47:16.700]  the politics of personal destruction they want to use
[3:47:16.700 --> 3:47:20.540]  ethical complaints they tried the same thing against reagan
[3:47:20.540 --> 3:47:24.780]  didn't work because reagan had a it was a different kind of a president a
[3:47:24.780 --> 3:47:29.100]  different kind of a guy and it wasn't until um iran contra which was a
[3:47:29.100 --> 3:47:33.260]  which was a a very thin thread on which to hang
[3:47:33.260 --> 3:47:39.340]  an attack on reagan after all ultimately uh they're going to try to do the same
[3:47:39.340 --> 3:47:42.300]  thing to trump and they're going to try to do the same thing that the trump
[3:47:42.300 --> 3:47:45.740]  senior appointees you see this you see this now with what senator
[3:47:45.740 --> 3:47:50.300]  truck sumer the new democratic leaders saying that he wants he wants a week
[3:47:50.300 --> 3:47:54.220]  for each controversial nominee and he gets to decide who's controversial he
[3:47:54.220 --> 3:47:58.940]  wants all of their tax returns and and he wants one day devoted to panels to
[3:47:58.940 --> 3:48:02.860]  come in and beat up on the president's nominee so much for the honeymoon
[3:48:02.860 --> 3:48:06.620]  so much for the president's power of executive appointment
[3:48:06.620 --> 3:48:10.620]  you know schumer has a thin majority uh and
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:14.300]  and he's going to work it to the max to try and prevent trump from doing anything
[3:48:14.300 --> 3:48:18.620]  they're trying to try and stop to use the trump phrase to try and stop
[3:48:18.620 --> 3:48:22.700]  trump from making america great again because he would rather have the
[3:48:22.700 --> 3:48:27.820]  country descend in the spiral of social and economic chaos until they can get
[3:48:27.820 --> 3:48:32.700]  their progressive act together and and try and turn us into a european style
[3:48:32.700 --> 3:48:36.060]  liberal welfare state yeah i have to laugh looking at the
[3:48:36.060 --> 3:48:38.940]  headline from richard pearlstein we should hope
[3:48:38.940 --> 3:48:43.100]  that donald trump is as successful as richard nixon if i may go through it
[3:48:43.100 --> 3:48:47.100]  he ended the war in vietnam he opened the door to china
[3:48:47.100 --> 3:48:51.580]  he reached a salt agreement an arms limitation agreement with the soviets
[3:48:51.580 --> 3:48:56.780]  he single-handedly saved israel from nihilation in 1973
[3:48:56.780 --> 3:49:01.260]  he desegregated the public schools he began the environmental protection
[3:49:01.260 --> 3:49:04.700]  agency he gave us federal revenue sharing
[3:49:04.700 --> 3:49:10.620]  he desegregated the trade unions he quadrupled the amount of money for
[3:49:10.620 --> 3:49:14.460]  minority enterprise and for black colleges
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:18.700]  we should be so lucky to have a president as successful
[3:49:18.700 --> 3:49:25.260]  uh as richard nixon uh so uh it has been a delight for me because
[3:49:25.260 --> 3:49:28.460]  you and i can talk kick this subject around
[3:49:28.460 --> 3:49:32.700]  all night usually over what nixon used to call a silver bullet
[3:49:32.700 --> 3:49:37.580]  as you know he was very proud of his martini making skills so
[3:49:37.580 --> 3:49:42.140]  when i get to washington next let's hoist a silver bullet in honor
[3:49:42.140 --> 3:49:46.460]  of the man who first thought that donald trump should run for president that
[3:49:46.460 --> 3:49:51.420]  would be richard i millhouse nixon i'd be happy to do that

[3:54:58.220 --> 3:55:02.620]  eastern medicine natural healing and herbology i'm a homie path about 45
[3:55:02.620 --> 3:55:06.220]  years and i just live and breathe that stuff
[3:55:06.220 --> 3:55:10.940]  so we're on the same vibration there hey listen
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:14.460]  uh now i have a question for you i finished your book
[3:55:14.460 --> 3:55:19.500]  lbj of the manager kill kennedy yes love that book man that
[3:55:19.500 --> 3:55:23.660]  that was so deep at anybody who wants a good read
[3:55:23.660 --> 3:55:27.980]  um then grab that book anyway i have one question
[3:55:27.980 --> 3:55:31.580]  it's been seen on me ever since i saw jack ruby shoot
[3:55:31.580 --> 3:55:38.220]  um uh uh uh i was one shot in and kill uh leigh hurry
[3:55:38.220 --> 3:55:42.140]  as well what was it i have two questions that's one
[3:55:42.140 --> 3:55:48.220]  what was going on in in jack ruby's mind how did they get him to do that because
[3:55:48.220 --> 3:55:52.620]  didn't he know that his life was going to be over once he made that shot
[3:55:52.620 --> 3:55:55.980]  well it was over whether he did or whether he didn't you see the problem
[3:55:55.980 --> 3:55:59.980]  was that jack ruby even though the warren commission told us that he had
[3:55:59.980 --> 3:56:05.580]  no known association with organized crime was in fact a soldier for carlos
[3:56:05.580 --> 3:56:10.860]  marcello who controlled the mob in both louisiana and texas
[3:56:10.860 --> 3:56:14.700]  the problem here was obvious oswald was starting to talk what did he yell when
[3:56:14.700 --> 3:56:18.940]  he was in public i didn't shoot anybody he said i'm a patsy
[3:56:18.940 --> 3:56:25.180]  they needed to shut oswald up and quickly uh and the designated hitter was jack
[3:56:25.180 --> 3:56:29.100]  ruby in fact jack ruby's club the carousel club
[3:56:29.100 --> 3:56:35.500]  was actually owned by carlos marcello and ruby was only fronting for him
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:39.580]  a second part to that question i'm sorry
[3:56:39.580 --> 3:56:43.820]  oh yeah well i have one more question go so so what what you're saying is that
[3:56:43.820 --> 3:56:47.340]  ruby's life was over anyway everything was over for him anyway
[3:56:47.340 --> 3:56:53.740]  well and in fact ruby was visited by a couple physicians while in in jail i
[3:56:53.740 --> 3:56:57.580]  we believe he was injected with a cancer causing virus
[3:56:57.580 --> 3:57:01.660]  and he would die shortly thereafter but never remember this
[3:57:01.660 --> 3:57:06.780]  pardon me never forget this you can see this on youtube where you see uh two
[3:57:06.780 --> 3:57:11.900]  deputy sheriffs pulling jack ruby down a hallway
[3:57:11.900 --> 3:57:14.860]  and they say jack jack how could this have happened
[3:57:14.860 --> 3:57:18.140]  and ruby said this never would have happened if adelaide stevensson had
[3:57:18.140 --> 3:57:21.500]  been vice president they said jack what do you mean
[3:57:21.500 --> 3:57:25.020]  what are you saying and ruby said look at the man at the top
[3:57:25.020 --> 3:57:29.180]  the man at the very top he's talking about linden
[3:57:29.180 --> 3:57:33.340]  bangs johnson all right great question
[3:57:33.340 --> 3:57:40.460]  let's go to uh danny in florida
[3:57:40.460 --> 3:57:44.940]  roger why was nixon removed from office was there a specific incident or
[3:57:44.940 --> 3:57:48.140]  thing he was doing that the globalists didn't like
[3:57:48.140 --> 3:57:51.580]  yes it turns out that he was for peace oh my god
[3:57:51.580 --> 3:57:56.220]  you see when nixon was elected the hardliners thought that they were now
[3:57:56.220 --> 3:57:59.820]  finally going to be able to do whatever they wanted in vietnam
[3:57:59.820 --> 3:58:04.140]  when they learned that nixon was not only going around his own national
[3:58:04.140 --> 3:58:08.060]  security apparatus to begin a discussion with the chinese
[3:58:08.060 --> 3:58:11.660]  opening salt talks with the russians and ending the war
[3:58:11.660 --> 3:58:15.500]  good god nixon was for peace we've got to stop this guy
[3:58:15.500 --> 3:58:19.260]  so he was essentially although he made many mistakes on his own
[3:58:19.260 --> 3:58:23.020]  taken down by his own hand the reason they did so
[3:58:23.020 --> 3:58:28.620]  was because he was not for war he was indeed a peacemaker
[3:58:28.620 --> 3:58:32.460]  thanks again for coming and joining us at the info wars dot com and
[3:58:32.460 --> 3:58:54.220]  we'll see you shortly
