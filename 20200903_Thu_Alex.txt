[00:30.000 --> 00:56.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[00:56.560 --> 01:06.560]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:06.560 --> 01:07.560]  We think just like that.
[01:07.560 --> 01:08.560]  Let me see.
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.560]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will still be on their way.
[01:13.560 --> 01:14.560]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:14.560 --> 01:15.560]  Damn it.
[01:15.560 --> 01:16.560]  Why?
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.560]  Because while the transmission may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[01:21.560 --> 01:22.560]  their power.
[01:22.560 --> 01:29.560]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[01:29.560 --> 01:33.560]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:33.560 --> 01:34.560]  You designed it, sir.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.560]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:35.560 --> 01:37.560]  You told me every television in London.
[01:37.560 --> 01:40.560]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.560]  And where once you have the freedom to object to something, and speak as you saw fit, you
[01:45.560 --> 01:50.560]  now have senses and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity, and subjecting
[01:50.560 --> 01:51.560]  your submachine.
[01:51.560 --> 01:52.560]  How did this happen?
[01:52.560 --> 01:53.560]  Who's to blame?
[01:53.560 --> 01:57.560]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.560]  They will be held accountable.
[01:59.560 --> 02:06.560]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.560]  I know why you did it.
[02:08.560 --> 02:09.560]  I know you were afraid.
[02:09.560 --> 02:11.560]  Who would it be?
[02:11.560 --> 02:13.560]  War, terror, disease?
[02:13.560 --> 02:19.560]  There were a myriad of problems to be inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[02:19.560 --> 02:20.560]  common sense.
[02:20.560 --> 02:22.560]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.560]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.560]  He promised you order, he promised you peace.
[02:29.560 --> 02:33.560]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:39.560 --> 02:41.560]  There is a war.
[02:41.560 --> 02:43.560]  It's happening now.
[02:43.560 --> 02:45.560]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:45.560 --> 02:48.560]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:48.560 --> 02:50.560]  We are the resistance.
[02:50.560 --> 02:52.560]  We are the Info War.
[02:59.560 --> 03:01.560]  You are the one they called president?
[03:01.560 --> 03:02.560]  I am.
[03:02.560 --> 03:04.560]  Neil before son.
[03:04.560 --> 03:14.560]  You are not the president.
[03:14.560 --> 03:20.560]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[03:20.560 --> 03:23.560]  I'm the man they're protecting.
[03:23.560 --> 03:34.560]  I'm the president.
[03:53.560 --> 04:04.560]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[04:04.560 --> 04:15.560]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.560]  Alex Jones.
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.560]  Scott, Russian, Scott.
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.560]  Info wars comes to mind.
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.560]  Reputation's amazing.
[04:32.560 --> 04:34.560]  I will not let you down.
[04:34.560 --> 04:59.560]  I will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[04:59.560 --> 05:04.560]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, or Howard Stern,
[05:04.560 --> 05:07.560]  they come out and they attack Info War saying,
[05:07.560 --> 05:13.560]  Jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses.
[05:13.560 --> 05:19.560]  And he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storeable food if they can.
[05:19.560 --> 05:22.560]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true,
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.560]  because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep.
[05:26.560 --> 05:29.560]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.560]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago,
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.560]  and what I said last week more than ever.
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.560]  Get your high quality storeable foods at infowarsstore.com.

[05:43.560 --> 05:47.560]  Infowarsstore.com and their delivery is now one to two weeks.

[06:28.560 --> 06:31.560]  The great awakening is here.

[07:03.560 --> 07:06.560]  60 days out.
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.560]  September 3rd on this live Thursday transmission.
[07:10.560 --> 07:24.560]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm going to be here for the next four hours.
[07:24.560 --> 07:31.560]  Things are always urgent here with the transmission.
[07:31.560 --> 07:34.560]  The world is a very dangerous place.
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.560]  And if people aren't informed, if people aren't involved, if people aren't engaged,
[07:39.560 --> 07:45.560]  they always fall to nightmare, tyrannies, horrible systems run by psychopaths
[07:45.560 --> 07:50.560]  and their devilish minions below them.
[07:50.560 --> 07:56.560]  You know, there's a lot of things I know that I'm not at liberty to tell you.
[07:56.560 --> 08:03.560]  But this is what I can tell you and I think you already know this.
[08:03.560 --> 08:09.560]  For this corrupt technocracy, for this corporate anti-human world government to fully take over
[08:09.560 --> 08:24.560]  and carry out its devilish designs, it must absolutely must
[08:24.560 --> 08:37.560]  have America fall and have Western values of real human empowerment and Christianity destroyed and devalued.
[08:37.560 --> 08:45.560]  That is the game plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.560]  Now, what does it mean when the United States isn't here anymore?
[08:50.560 --> 09:11.560]  I'm going to lay that out. You know, a lot of people laugh at folks fleeing out of New York, New Jersey, Illinois, California, Michigan.
[09:11.560 --> 09:19.560]  And they're not just fleeing the fact that they're poor or there's crime, they're fleeing because they're starving to death.
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.560]  They're fleeing because they're addicted to drugs. They're fleeing because they're on their last leg.
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.560]  They're fleeing because the country has been put into artificial collapse.
[09:29.560 --> 09:38.560]  And Trump was desperately trying to prop up things to at least get control of the government so we could negotiate to the Chai comms and others
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.560]  because we had been positioned for total collapse and humiliation.
[09:43.560 --> 09:52.560]  But there were enough loyal forces to the Republic and to sanity and to their own self-interest who were not on the globalist payroll
[09:52.560 --> 10:01.560]  to rally against the NWO whose great sin was being arrogant and get Trump in.
[10:01.560 --> 10:10.560]  But getting Trump in just got us back on the field to play this deadly game for all the chips and all the marbles in our children's future.
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.560]  And so, obviously, I talked to Roger Stone.
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.560]  I talked to a lot more people than that and I'm going to leave it at that because I've been asked not to get into who I talked to.
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.560]  But I can tell you the President is under absolute siege.
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.560]  I can tell you the level of harassment, the things he's going through.
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.560]  I've been told, Jones, we know what you're going through. You're lucky you're only going through this.
[10:32.560 --> 10:41.560]  And I've been told what the President's going through directly by... I'll leave it at that.
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.560]  And it's bad, folks. And that's why I get so mad at the Q thing is not that folks are waking up and having fun with it
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.560]  and going and researching things and getting into their secret agents and the fun mystery of it all.
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.560]  I know what's going on.
[10:56.560 --> 11:02.560]  I really am inside of it and it's not about me going, oh, I've got more magic contacts than people.
[11:02.560 --> 11:10.560]  That's not what this is about. It's about I know how much trouble this country is in and I'm not going to lie to you about that.
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.560]  Because we need people to be engaged and informed. I don't tell people this stuff to scare you.
[11:15.560 --> 11:17.560]  I tell you so you can get ready and be prepared.
[11:17.560 --> 11:25.560]  Now, here's the big announcement. You can see the live feed of the show today has a very frightening, sounding, horrifying title, but it's true.
[11:25.560 --> 11:32.560]  Emergency broadcast.
[11:32.560 --> 11:38.560]  Globalist planning, massive world oppression if Trump wins or loses.
[11:38.560 --> 11:45.560]  Alex Jones is going to lay out the absolutely horrifying facts of this incredibly important Thursday transmission.
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.560]  Not to scare you, but to see if you can get ready.
[11:49.560 --> 11:55.560]  And I kind of shot that headline out as I walked in here two minutes, three months ago. So let's let's it's not a proper headline.
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.560]  I'm glad I said pull that up. It's not to scare you, but so you can get ready.
[12:01.560 --> 12:03.560]  So you can get ready.
[12:03.560 --> 12:09.560]  So I'm working around the clock as much as I physically can in this fight.
[12:09.560 --> 12:15.560]  And I just want you to know that we rallied back. We took control of the country to a certain extent.
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.560]  We got the UK brings it. You've seen Bolsonaro. You've seen the EU's in trouble.
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.560]  But now they're launching everything they've got back in humanity and they're going to contest the election.
[12:25.560 --> 12:28.560]  We first told you that now they're on record saying they're going to do it.
[12:28.560 --> 12:31.560]  They're calling it a red mirage. Now Facebook has joined in on it.
[12:31.560 --> 12:37.560]  We first broke that two days ago. It's now official.
[12:37.560 --> 12:47.560]  And they're not going to quote, take the president's speech or his video. They're saying if he declares victory the day after the election.
[12:47.560 --> 12:55.560]  They're telling you that they're taking control of the election and they're going to tell the public that Trump lost.
[12:55.560 --> 13:05.560]  Michael Bloomberg's own PR firm is running the entire thing and Zuckerberg just put $300 million into it to push the lie that these 80 million ballots
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.560]  they've randomly mailed out are legitimate and we can't have the final tally till they've all been counted.
[13:10.560 --> 13:17.560]  What the hell does that mean? They've poisoned the well.
[13:17.560 --> 13:23.560]  So our republic is fighting for its life. We're in dire straits, ladies and gentlemen, dire straits.
[13:23.560 --> 13:27.560]  And I need you to hit the streets. I need you to get involved.
[13:27.560 --> 13:34.560]  I need you to speak up and expose this and delegitimize it and circumvent their censorship and circumvent their garbage
[13:34.560 --> 13:37.560]  to everyone you know now if you want to win.
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.560]  Anyone telling you that this isn't a close football game is working for the enemy.
[13:42.560 --> 13:46.560]  Trump has his ads running that it's dire straits. America will end.
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.560]  That we are in incredible trouble. That the enemy is dangerous.
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.560]  That they will absolutely dominate and enslave you and break you financially if they get control.
[13:55.560 --> 13:57.560]  And it's all true.
[13:57.560 --> 14:00.560]  And then you've got other people telling you everything's fine.
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.560]  Trust the plan. Go to sleep. Everything's good. That's not true, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:05.560 --> 14:12.560]  And I'm not here fighting with the Q people. I'm talking about folks in general that think Trump's a shoe in and oh, the polls show he's going to win.
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.560]  They're doing that so you are passive and they're going to challenge it regardless.
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.560]  We've got to have the discussion about what we're going to do about that.
[14:20.560 --> 14:23.560]  And then I'll tell you this separately when we come back.
[14:23.560 --> 14:32.560]  When I tell you that there's going to be food shortages. There already are and starvation in this country. There already is the third world at double the rate it was a year ago.
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.560]  That's all coming out now, but that's that's the facts.
[14:35.560 --> 14:40.560]  But I'm hooked in to multiple big supply chains around the country and the world.
[14:40.560 --> 14:46.560]  And I talk to high level individuals that run the factories that supply the grocery stores.
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.560]  And I've got some really important news and I'll show you.
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.560]  News articles. Paralleling all of that.
[14:54.560 --> 15:06.560]  As well, guys, will you pull me out of yesterday's stack that big food shortage food line break down the food pantries running out in the supply chains breaking down stack. Thank you.
[15:06.560 --> 15:09.560]  But before I get to all that when we come back.
[15:09.560 --> 15:15.560]  I'm just going to tell you about what info wars is going through behind the scenes.
[15:15.560 --> 15:22.560]  And I try to just leave that out because it really makes the enemy happy to tune in and you'll hear about what they're doing what they're up to.
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.560]  But I mean at this point you need to know because it's it's it's Alamo level stuff.
[15:26.560 --> 15:27.560]  Okay.
[15:27.560 --> 15:33.560]  And I've sent my letters out I've asked for reinforcements and I'm asking them was reinforcements from you.
[15:33.560 --> 15:36.560]  And you have to understand that this is a very serious situation.
[15:36.560 --> 15:46.560]  Now, beyond that they've officially announced to the state government of Ohio FEMA camps for people who they think might have COVID.
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.560]  And if you have a running nose or someone saw you cough, they're going to grab you and put you for a month in a jail cell.
[15:51.560 --> 15:53.560]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.560]  This is their cover for total martial law.
[15:57.560 --> 16:02.560]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[16:02.560 --> 16:12.560]  The New World Order Chai Kham Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.560]  They are openly working this at the highest levels of Democratic Party.
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.560]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[16:20.560 --> 16:28.560]  Trump is going they will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist.
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.560]  They will then trigger race riots and violence.
[16:31.560 --> 16:34.560]  They've already beta tested around the country.
[16:34.560 --> 16:37.560]  We are not living in normal times.
[16:37.560 --> 16:44.560]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era.
[16:44.560 --> 16:45.560]  We are.
[16:45.560 --> 16:51.560]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America is being exposed and removed.
[16:51.560 --> 16:55.560]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[16:55.560 --> 16:57.560]  Spread the word now, Paul Reverez.
[16:57.560 --> 17:05.560]  It was a sleeper product. It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[17:05.560 --> 17:15.560]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack, 13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[17:15.560 --> 17:23.560]  It's available right now at 60% off for a limited time when you get it with survival shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[17:23.560 --> 17:26.560]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[17:26.560 --> 17:34.560]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us even reorder it.
[17:34.560 --> 17:38.560]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.560]  It's in stock now.
[17:39.560 --> 17:49.560]  Take advantage of this new combo special part of a larger cell you have and free shipping on these cell items like eight pack power stack and X2 at infowarstore.com.
[17:49.560 --> 17:56.560]  Take advantage and get eight pack power stack with X2, 60% off and free shipping biggest deal on this ever.
[18:49.560 --> 18:52.560]  It is Thursday, September 3rd, 60 days out from the election.
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.560]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[18:54.560 --> 18:59.560]  All right, I've got an incredible amount of world news that brings into Chris Focus.
[18:59.560 --> 19:08.560]  What we told you was coming from Spain and Australia, North Korea and China under UN Directives was being beta tested there and is now here in the United States.
[19:08.560 --> 19:13.560]  They've announced that Democrat state governors will begin forcibly arresting you.
[19:13.560 --> 19:23.560]  You have a contact tracer, which is a former Clinton level initiative or Obama core member saw you have sniffles cough.
[19:23.560 --> 19:33.560]  Or if you say you have a sore throat, you will then be forcibly taken to a jail cell at a FEMA camp that they've gotten FEMA to agree to fund.
[19:33.560 --> 19:37.560]  So mainstream news is sort of getting text messages last night.
[19:37.560 --> 19:39.560]  Ohio Department of Health.
[19:39.560 --> 19:46.560]  It circles up on infowarstore.com Ohio Department of Health partners with FEMA to create shelter facilities for people exposed to COVID-19.
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.560]  Notice exposed.
[19:47.560 --> 19:48.560]  You're not even tested.
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.560]  They just take you if you quote have symptoms and they say the symptoms are coughing, runny nose, anything else.
[19:53.560 --> 19:56.560]  But the borders, the Democrats want to keep wide open.
[19:56.560 --> 19:58.560]  That's that's coming up next segment.
[19:58.560 --> 20:02.560]  We have a guest on from Australia about they didn't just go arrest one lady.
[20:02.560 --> 20:04.560]  Oh, they were busy beavers.
[20:04.560 --> 20:15.560]  Going to the houses of 80 plus people that dared to speak out against the unending COVID lockdown or to point out the CDC's own numbers that 90 plus percent of the test are false positive.
[20:15.560 --> 20:17.560]  That's now all over the news.
[20:17.560 --> 20:21.560]  They tried to suppress it since last weekend, but that failed.
[20:21.560 --> 20:24.560]  And we've got massive.
[20:24.560 --> 20:35.560]  Election meddling by the Democrats and how they openly are saying they plan to scuttle the election. And now it's not my analysis from a year ago or more.
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.560]  Now it's it's public.
[20:36.560 --> 20:38.560]  So we've got big developments on that front.
[20:38.560 --> 20:43.560]  Facebook joins red mirage plot won't allow false victory claims from Trump on election night.
[20:43.560 --> 20:50.560]  They also says that Facebook declares call written house actions mass murder and says his lawyers aren't allowed to speak.
[20:50.560 --> 20:54.560]  He is not allowed to speak and no one is allowed to raise him money for his defense.
[20:54.560 --> 20:56.560]  So the weathermen they think are wonderful.
[20:56.560 --> 20:59.560]  And of course, Twitter won't let his lawyer speak either.
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.560]  And I mean, this is this is the total management control of what we're going under.
[21:05.560 --> 21:09.560]  Because we put up with it and Congress put up with it and Trump put up with it.
[21:09.560 --> 21:14.560]  Big tech is racketeering internationally like they've done in China to suppress the population.
[21:14.560 --> 21:20.560]  It is racketeering organized crime practices, just like Hitler did when he first got in control of Germany.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.560]  He took away banking of people.
[21:22.560 --> 21:23.560]  He took away businesses.
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.560]  It took away people's right to contract and that's their plan.
[21:26.560 --> 21:28.560]  And that brings me next to this issue.
[21:28.560 --> 21:36.560]  You've heard how they're targeting all these conservatives, not letting them have go fund me accounts and then if another group funds them, they take the bank account away from that group.
[21:36.560 --> 21:39.560]  That's what they've done to everybody.
[21:39.560 --> 21:42.560]  And what they've done to Laura Loomer, they've done to us.
[21:42.560 --> 21:50.560]  I've just not made a big deal about it and found some workarounds, but they are rapidly closing those as well.
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.560]  Also, and I'll cover this more in the last segment of the salaries.
[21:54.560 --> 22:02.560]  It's really important for everybody to know I wouldn't get up here and tell you there's going to be food shortages and food spike increases in the cost of food just for no reason.
[22:02.560 --> 22:05.560]  I would tell you that because I really have the sources and the research, the info.
[22:05.560 --> 22:08.560]  Now, I told you that eight months ago now it's all public.
[22:08.560 --> 22:09.560]  It's happening.
[22:09.560 --> 22:15.560]  And people aren't just moving to Texas in the Midwest and the South because they're sick of where they live.
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.560]  They don't have work.
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.560]  They don't have jobs.
[22:17.560 --> 22:18.560]  It's all shut down.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.560]  It's ghost towns.
[22:19.560 --> 22:24.560]  These are refugees and the third world is collapsing and more refugees are coming.
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.560]  This is the organized collapse of the West.
[22:26.560 --> 22:28.560]  The globalists don't want wealth.
[22:28.560 --> 22:29.560]  They don't want choice.
[22:29.560 --> 22:30.560]  They don't want independence.
[22:30.560 --> 22:33.560]  They want vertical consolidated integration for a technocracy.
[22:33.560 --> 22:46.560]  So what I tell you, what I tell you that you need to get ready and you need to be very busy telling folks about info wars.com.
[22:46.560 --> 22:50.560]  It's because being prepared is key and spreading the word about the broadcast.
[22:50.560 --> 22:53.560]  That is the antidote to the globalist poison is key.
[22:53.560 --> 23:02.560]  And I know you know that, but I'm telling you, we have seven major suppliers and a couple of smaller suppliers of high quality organic and wild harvested.
[23:02.560 --> 23:08.560]  Top of the line supplements that we get that are private labeled or our proprietary designs.
[23:08.560 --> 23:13.560]  We came up with in many cases like turbo force or brain force or X2.
[23:13.560 --> 23:16.560]  You know, three, four months ago, a lot of them were late.
[23:16.560 --> 23:18.560]  They couldn't get certain stuff.
[23:18.560 --> 23:26.560]  We had to wait, but we thought, oh, maybe it's going to come back of the seven now five are two, three, four, five, six months behind.
[23:26.560 --> 23:29.560]  And now they're just saying, Hey, we're going to have to give you back the money.
[23:29.560 --> 23:31.560]  You put us a down payment on that.
[23:31.560 --> 23:33.560]  We just can't open.
[23:33.560 --> 23:34.560]  Nothing's coming in.
[23:34.560 --> 23:37.560]  It's not being produced in the raw areas.
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.560]  If one person gets COVID, nobody dies, but the whole plant has to shut down.
[23:41.560 --> 23:43.560]  And it's happening to food distribution centers.
[23:43.560 --> 23:45.560]  It's happening to warehouses.
[23:45.560 --> 23:49.560]  It's why you can't get a lot of furniture you want to order or just all sorts of things you want.
[23:49.560 --> 23:52.560]  There aren't there anymore.
[23:52.560 --> 23:57.560]  And so the globalist want a global depression, whether Trump gets in or out.
[23:57.560 --> 23:58.560]  He's trying to prop it up.
[23:58.560 --> 23:59.560]  He's trying to save it.
[23:59.560 --> 24:01.560]  We want to let Trump, that's great.
[24:01.560 --> 24:08.560]  But all of this COVID lockdown and going after the dollar and all the media attacking the dollar and attacking the stock market.
[24:08.560 --> 24:13.560]  That's part of a larger plan to bring us into a depression for four or five years to bring in contact tracing.
[24:13.560 --> 24:15.560]  It's the martial law cover.
[24:15.560 --> 24:18.560]  Not going to give you a depression and say, we're going to track you now.
[24:18.560 --> 24:19.560]  Where are you going?
[24:19.560 --> 24:20.560]  What you do for political reasons.
[24:20.560 --> 24:23.560]  It's being done for COVID, but don't leave your house.
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.560]  You can't have a rally unless it's one of our rallies, whether it's Europe or Australia or the U.S.
[24:28.560 --> 24:30.560]  You notice it's the same.
[24:30.560 --> 24:35.560]  This is how they freeze the opposition, the nationalists, the patriots, the counterrevolution with COVID.
[24:35.560 --> 24:37.560]  And they freeze your businesses.
[24:37.560 --> 24:42.560]  You're not essential while they destroy your currency and bring it to your knees.
[24:42.560 --> 24:44.560]  So horrible times are coming.
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.560]  Absolute hell on earth.
[24:46.560 --> 24:51.560]  And maybe if Trump gets elected, we can have a soft landing, but I don't think so.
[24:51.560 --> 24:53.560]  And I just have to tell you the truth.
[24:53.560 --> 24:56.560]  I just can't soften stuff for you and I can't lie to you.
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.560]  That's why the enemy wants you to think everything's handled.
[24:58.560 --> 24:59.560]  Everything's great.
[24:59.560 --> 25:00.560]  It's not great.
[25:00.560 --> 25:03.560]  They purposely collapsed all the blue cities and blue states.
[25:03.560 --> 25:04.560]  It is hell on earth.
[25:04.560 --> 25:07.560]  There are thousands of suicides a day.
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.560]  There are tens of thousands a week of drug overdoses.
[25:11.560 --> 25:14.560]  The media has pedophilia all over it.
[25:14.560 --> 25:16.560]  They are breaking our will right now.
[25:16.560 --> 25:18.560]  I don't believe they're going to win in the end.
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.560]  God promised that, but you have to know that people are in for a root awakening.
[25:23.560 --> 25:27.560]  So you need to get your storable food at infowarstore.com right now.
[25:27.560 --> 25:29.560]  They have the food one to two weeks.
[25:29.560 --> 25:30.560]  They built their supply chain up.
[25:30.560 --> 25:33.560]  They expanded when others contracted in the last eight months.
[25:33.560 --> 25:40.560]  But I guarantee when people figure this out, they're going to end up in eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks and stop sales again like they did.
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.560]  They believe and I believe that by January of next year, even though Trump will hopefully be inaugurated,
[25:46.560 --> 25:49.560]  the global depression is going to be so evident.
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.560]  And the left's going to keep the riots going and the breakdown of supply chain is going to be so evident.
[25:53.560 --> 26:00.560]  And the people think of the world's ending because it kind of is in a way not having the infrastructure operate.
[26:00.560 --> 26:03.560]  The supply chain is going to break down massively as it already has, but even worse.
[26:03.560 --> 26:10.560]  So I'm telling you, if you want to get the supplements and you want to get the t-shirts and the books, the films,
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.560]  there could very easily come a point where we can't get any of these items because a lot of them,
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.560]  you notice of our catalog of 60 plus items like 9 or 10 are already gone.
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.560]  And a lot of them were big sellers. You can't get it.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.560]  You can't get it.
[26:25.560 --> 26:29.560]  Especially complex formulas or something like 8-pack Power Sector became very popular.
[26:29.560 --> 26:31.560]  Just got 13 pills, 13 different things.
[26:31.560 --> 26:33.560]  Four or five of them we can't get.
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.560]  So that products, what we've got is what we've got.
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.560]  This is bad, folks.
[26:37.560 --> 26:39.560]  I have to run my own infrastructure.
[26:39.560 --> 26:40.560]  I'm not just a talk show.
[26:40.560 --> 26:41.560]  So I know business.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.560]  I know infrastructure.
[26:42.560 --> 26:43.560]  I'm involved in everything.
[26:43.560 --> 26:45.560]  That's just the way God had it.
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.560]  I was trained by necessity and all of this.
[26:47.560 --> 26:50.560]  Pull myself up on my bootstraps with your help together.
[26:50.560 --> 26:56.560]  But I'm telling you, you need to get the supplements because I don't even know how long we can operate into the future.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.560]  There's a nauseating sense to it.
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.560]  Not a sense of triumph, not a sense of victory.
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.560]  Not a sense of completion.
[27:07.560 --> 27:13.560]  A sense of sixth nausea that we were right about the world government.
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.560]  We were right about the anti-human plans.
[27:16.560 --> 27:23.560]  We were right about all the horrible things the globalists and their satanic order wanted to do to us.
[27:23.560 --> 27:28.560]  Now we sit here, warning people for decades, trying to get people ready,
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.560]  trying to stop what was coming.
[27:30.560 --> 27:32.560]  But you know what?
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.560]  Revelations and God's Word says it's coming so you can't stop it.
[27:36.560 --> 27:39.560]  And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger plan
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.560]  that we come to the point in our own psyche, our own spirit, our own will
[27:44.560 --> 27:49.560]  that we submit to God and realize God's in charge of God as a part.
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.560]  And the devil is set as the tester.
[27:52.560 --> 27:54.560]  And now it's up to us to make the right decision.
[27:54.560 --> 28:20.560]  That's what it's really always been about.
[28:20.560 --> 28:25.560]  Plus, I go out just like with info and I bring you the very best items,
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.560]  the very best products that I personally use and I love.
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.560]  So go to infowarstore.com, check out the products,
[28:32.560 --> 28:35.560]  get some today, share them with friends, review them,
[28:35.560 --> 28:38.560]  and know that you cannot lose because you're funding the info war.
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.560]  Let's fight the globalists. Plus these are great products.
[28:41.560 --> 28:44.560]  But I want to thank you for keeping me in the game.
[28:44.560 --> 28:46.560]  I want to thank you for funding our operation.
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.560]  So continue to spread the word and fund info wars at infowarstore.com
[28:50.560 --> 29:16.560]  and I salute you once again.
[29:16.560 --> 29:41.560]  Thank you.
[29:41.560 --> 29:46.560]  And I want to explain that again. Your support of info wars has stood
[29:46.560 --> 29:50.560]  in defiance of George Soros, the globalist Hillary and all these comebacks.
[29:50.560 --> 29:53.560]  So great job. You built what we've done.
[29:53.560 --> 29:58.560]  I salute you.
[29:58.560 --> 30:07.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:07.560 --> 30:17.560]  September 3rd, Thursday, 60 days now.
[30:17.560 --> 30:21.560]  Do I feel sorry for info wars that we've been persecuted and attacked
[30:21.560 --> 30:24.560]  and lied about and how they've battled to shut us down?
[30:24.560 --> 30:27.560]  No, I feel sorry for the children of this country and the world
[30:27.560 --> 30:31.560]  being subjected to the brainwashing and poisoned vaccines
[30:31.560 --> 30:34.560]  and fluoride and pedophilia and devil worship.
[30:34.560 --> 30:37.560]  So before I cover some really dark scary news,
[30:37.560 --> 30:40.560]  not to scare you, but to help you get ready,
[30:40.560 --> 30:43.560]  we've got something light for you dealing with our little buddy,
[30:43.560 --> 30:47.560]  Brian Stelter, a new take on our Mars attacks.
[30:47.560 --> 30:52.560]  Don't run. We are your friend, Parable.
[30:52.560 --> 30:56.560]  So I would say, you know, if anything that's happening at CNN
[30:56.560 --> 30:59.560]  and anybody who buys your book,
[30:59.560 --> 31:03.560]  it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation.
[31:03.560 --> 31:05.560]  And I don't believe in dividing our nation.
[31:05.560 --> 31:07.560]  It hurts our great nation.
[31:07.560 --> 31:10.560]  And so CNN is really the enemy of the truth.
[31:10.560 --> 31:13.560]  And that's my opinion. Thank you.
[31:13.560 --> 31:16.560]  No American is an enemy of another American.
[31:16.560 --> 31:19.560]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[31:19.560 --> 31:21.560]  What?
[31:21.560 --> 31:23.560]  What?
[31:29.560 --> 31:32.560]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[31:32.560 --> 31:35.560]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[31:35.560 --> 31:39.560]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[31:39.560 --> 31:41.560]  They came in peace.
[31:41.560 --> 31:46.560]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[31:46.560 --> 32:15.560]  No news of what is the enemy of America. Bill Gates wants you. Take the vaccine.
[32:15.560 --> 32:25.560]  Don't run. CNN's your friend. This is CNN.
[32:25.560 --> 32:50.560]  Lovelace wants corporate slaves so you can be phased out in an orderly fashion.
[32:50.560 --> 32:56.560]  And again, you can see the disaster. You can see the breakdown for yourself.
[32:56.560 --> 33:01.560]  You can see this is 21st century war that our republic and the whole planet is in.
[33:01.560 --> 33:05.560]  But if they can gaslight everyone through corporate control, through big tech,
[33:05.560 --> 33:11.560]  and tell you don't believe your lying eyes, don't believe your empty stomach,
[33:11.560 --> 33:14.560]  then they believe they can win.
[33:14.560 --> 33:18.560]  The minute they thought they got the West in enough debt with fiat currency,
[33:18.560 --> 33:24.560]  these private banks signed us on to, they had the great reset.
[33:24.560 --> 33:29.560]  And we told you eight months ago in pieces we put out, seven months ago,
[33:29.560 --> 33:33.560]  February and March, called the great resets, that this was a great reset,
[33:33.560 --> 33:39.560]  that they were using COVID to bring in the global depression in the post-industrial world.
[33:39.560 --> 33:45.560]  And then within two months of us telling you that's what this was, they came out.
[33:45.560 --> 33:48.560]  They saw Schwab, the head of Davos, all of them, and said exactly that.
[33:48.560 --> 33:52.560]  And it's not again that we're that smart. We know their game plan.
[33:52.560 --> 33:56.560]  We understand their operations. We've done our research.
[33:56.560 --> 34:02.560]  And did you know that almost every major nationalist or conservative or patriot leader in the world
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.560]  has either been arrested or harassed or sued or had their bank accounts taken away?
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.560]  You go, how is it happening in the UK and Brazil and the US? Don't they have leaders?
[34:11.560 --> 34:16.560]  We have corporate governance and the libertarians were fooled. I was fooled.
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.560]  The big think tanks were like, oh, the state withers away and then it's this corporate utopia
[34:21.560 --> 34:27.560]  where you have all these choices, but instead the corporations get together and form their own government.
[34:27.560 --> 34:35.560]  Being a quote libertarian fiscally, economically was the dumbest thing I ever did.
[34:35.560 --> 34:38.560]  And Tucker Carlson admits that he was an idiot as well.
[34:38.560 --> 34:43.560]  But you buy into it and they've got the big DC think tanks and, oh, yeah, the state will just wither away.
[34:43.560 --> 34:47.560]  No, you get a bigger state. The corporations control to control you.
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.560]  And then at the stake, it's out of hand. They just break it up and they operate as a government.
[34:52.560 --> 34:56.560]  And that's how they're doing it, just like Hitler did and just like the Bolsheviks did,
[34:56.560 --> 35:01.560]  where they wouldn't let anybody that wasn't part of their party, even if you submitted to them,
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.560]  it didn't matter. You'd be their slave. But if you were a party member, then you could have bank accounts.
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.560]  Then you could have commerce. Everyone had to come to you.
[35:10.560 --> 35:17.560]  Just like when George Washington wasn't a nobleman by blood, so he couldn't open the business.
[35:17.560 --> 35:24.560]  He couldn't even throw an official party. You had to get a nobleman to come to your party to have a party.
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.560]  You had to go through them to even have a job or be able to sell land.
[35:30.560 --> 35:37.560]  So that's all these fascist and communist recreate is a system where you have to go through them.
[35:37.560 --> 35:41.560]  And then once they've got you with big tech and all the rest of it,
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.560]  oh, you're not going to have the lawyer on Facebook or Twitter saying,
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.560]  it turns out Kyle Rittenhouse was being chased and attacked and they were trying to grab his gun and saying,
[35:50.560 --> 35:56.560]  killing. You don't get a defense. Your lawyer doesn't get a voice in America.
[35:56.560 --> 36:04.560]  I mean, this is absolutely getting out of control.
[36:04.560 --> 36:11.560]  And notice it's every aspect of life and hundreds of thousands of paid ADL and southern primary law center
[36:11.560 --> 36:14.560]  trained individuals like Bolsheviks.
[36:14.560 --> 36:22.560]  Commissars are now in control of all of big tech and media interface with CNN and MSNBC saying what can it can't be said
[36:22.560 --> 36:27.560]  from Australia to the UK to Spain to the United States to Canada.
[36:27.560 --> 36:35.560]  And they're coming to people's houses and making mass arrests in Australia and in Spain and now in England
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.560]  and in Scotland are the stacks of news are just arresting everybody.
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.560]  If you criticize the government or political correctness or COVID.
[36:44.560 --> 36:53.560]  And when the CDC came out and said 90 plus percent of the test are fake false positives and 90 plus percent 94 percent had co morbidity.
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.560]  They censored all that.
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.560]  Thomas Jefferson was famously asked what is the limit to which.
[37:03.560 --> 37:10.560]  Tyrants will take us and he said the limit you will accept and that's absolutely true.
[37:10.560 --> 37:21.560]  And so we're going into slavery high tech horrible with a fascist control system above in a technocracy with a communist ideology below it.
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.560]  With a dumb down mindless divided population.
[37:25.560 --> 37:26.560]  So.
[37:26.560 --> 37:30.560]  I don't tell you all of that.
[37:30.560 --> 37:39.560]  To scare you I tell you to the understand the more you give in the worse it gets look at this graphic I've got right over here I'm going to walk over
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.560]  communism is behind the Hoover Dam.
[37:43.560 --> 37:55.560]  Hundreds of billions of gallons of water that could be life giving to crops and humans and more unless it's unleashed in improper way it'll destroy the lives of tens of thousands of people little kill thousands of people.
[37:55.560 --> 37:57.560]  It's a weapon.
[37:57.560 --> 38:02.560]  Communism is held back by info wars and by your resistance and by your prayer and by Trump.
[38:02.560 --> 38:08.560]  But here it is communism's up here behind the dam you've got info wars holding it back and you're down here.
[38:08.560 --> 38:14.560]  And just like Donald Trump told you they're not after him they're coming for you.
[38:14.560 --> 38:16.560]  And this is real.
[38:16.560 --> 38:22.560]  So I'm going to tell you again because the straits are dire for everybody but they really want info wars off the air.
[38:22.560 --> 38:30.560]  If you want to get the supplements or the books or the T shirts or the films or the high quality swareable food it's all in stock now.
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.560]  But a lot of the supplements won't be there in the future.
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.560]  The food is there for now one to two weeks delivery you need to get your orders in not just for you.
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.560]  I don't know how long we'll be able to continue operating this system and self funding.
[38:45.560 --> 38:54.560]  They've taken our sponsors they've taken everything away and they are behind the scenes running intelligence operations against us to sabotage and shut us down.
[38:54.560 --> 38:58.560]  And at a date in the future I'll be able to tell you about it or you'll you'll see it on the news.
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.560]  Okay.
[38:59.560 --> 39:01.560]  But you see what's going on.
[39:01.560 --> 39:10.560]  You need to get your orders in now it's a patriotic duty for yourself in the world the country and common sense and you need to understand I've never lied to you consciously I've made mistakes.
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.560]  But info wars on a scale of one to ten are worse threats before or a two.
[39:15.560 --> 39:18.560]  This is a nine.
[39:18.560 --> 39:24.560]  They've got people out on the street ladies and gentlemen with contracts out to kill me.
[39:24.560 --> 39:25.560]  Okay.
[39:25.560 --> 39:37.560]  It's all coming down they're trying to indict the entire Trump family right now in the Southern District of New York and also in the state with the attorney general the minion of Soros Latissa James this is they're going after everybody.
[39:37.560 --> 39:49.560]  This is a real war and I need capital to go in the next year and stay on air and we don't have the reserves to do that if they make some of these moves so get the money to us now so we can operate go to info wars store.com.
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.560]  You can also donate at info wars store.com and the support us section.
[39:54.560 --> 40:01.560]  This isn't about me taking credit in fact it's the opposite it's about getting you to understand that you have all the power.
[40:01.560 --> 40:14.560]  Going back three weeks ago they had the entire Austin Greenbelt shutdown and they have the spillway by Barton Springs shutdown as well as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years or so.
[40:14.560 --> 40:16.560]  It's a damned up spring.
[40:16.560 --> 40:26.560]  Well we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud.
[40:26.560 --> 40:37.560]  And now despite the fact that they still say the parks are closed you get out to any area you'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using Barton Springs there in Austin, Texas.
[40:37.560 --> 40:47.560]  So Bill Gates and the globalists give the orders to the UN, the UN gives the orders down through the National Health Services like our NIH and we all follow it like dutiful slaves.
[40:47.560 --> 40:54.560]  Stop complying with your own enslavement. Stop following the orders of these globalist traders. Start being free again.
[40:54.560 --> 41:16.560]  Going back more than 20 years ago I coined the term the false left-right paradigm from reading the books by Carol Quigley, Zbigniew Brzezinski and others, how they described powerful institutions and foundations, successful takeover of the left parties and right parties in Europe and the United States.
[41:16.560 --> 41:28.560]  It didn't mean those parties didn't have differences before. They were able to get control of the leadership of both and manipulate the public with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something.
[41:28.560 --> 41:43.560]  With Trump and with our populist movement taking over the Republicans, this is a real populist movement. Doesn't mean it's perfect. And you know it's real because the Democrats, the power structure, the China comms and the entire old Republican leadership have all endorsed Joe Biden.
[41:43.560 --> 42:00.560]  That's why I'm supporting Trump. It's about Americanism, not globalism. It's about ending the one-sided trade deals by defending our borders, by defending the right to Second Amendment and pro-life. And Trump's doing all of that.
[42:00.560 --> 42:18.560]  You hear that? That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[42:18.560 --> 42:41.560]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu. They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place. They're not even promising to have a cure to it all. They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[42:41.560 --> 42:55.560]  It's a final frontier. It's the year 2020. It's not coming. It's here. And submission is blood in the water.
[42:55.560 --> 43:01.560]  I'm going to say something right now. It is one of the most important things I've ever said, so please listen very, very carefully.
[43:01.560 --> 43:12.560]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown. They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates.
[43:12.560 --> 43:25.560]  It is beyond critical. It is life and death for you and your family to understand. No matter where you live on the planet, but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end.
[43:25.560 --> 43:33.560]  The United Nations has admitted that. First it's a month, then it's six months, then they say, okay, it's two years. They're now saying two years.
[43:33.560 --> 43:42.560]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal. No more gatherings, no more anything. Constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work.
[43:42.560 --> 43:48.560]  And the way they say they work, they change your DNA. This is the culling of the planet.
[43:48.560 --> 43:58.560]  This is the beginning of the straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed. Do you understand?
[43:58.560 --> 44:11.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:11.560 --> 44:23.560]  All right, let's jump right into it. I'm going to start getting into more of the news right now, but I just want to add one more thing here.
[44:23.560 --> 44:37.560]  When I put up this graphic for TV viewers and describe it for radio listeners, I'm not exaggerating that you've got the dam of the Republic and what's left of freedom of speech and the Second Amendment that symbolized my info wars is the tip of the spear.
[44:37.560 --> 44:44.560]  And you've got the destructive force of communism just waiting to crush you and your family.
[44:44.560 --> 45:01.560]  And so when I get up here on air and I tell you that now is the time to tell everybody you know about this broadcast in band.video and 2020ElectionCenter.com, that URL has not been banned by the enemy platforms as of now.
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.560]  You can share the videos that way. That will change the course of history.
[45:06.560 --> 45:11.560]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't. They're going to contest the election.
[45:11.560 --> 45:19.560]  They're going to say Trump lost. They are super pissed that I'm on air first exposing the red mirage and they're planning to contest.
[45:19.560 --> 45:27.560]  We did that. You did that. You kept us on air. We did the analysis first. It's now gone mainstream. We continue to be the epicenter.
[45:27.560 --> 45:36.560]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want and you need to stop right now.
[45:36.560 --> 45:41.560]  And they're very, very serious. Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping child molesters. This is not going to happen.
[45:41.560 --> 45:49.560]  So they are moving now to destroy me. It's okay. I need to hold on as long as possible.
[45:49.560 --> 45:59.560]  And so I'm telling you, go to infoworkstore.com at your high quality shortable food. It's dropped ship on my page rated super high quality one or two weeks before the big rush comes and order the supplements.
[45:59.560 --> 46:09.560]  Because I got to tell you, I have to make the decision in the next week on whether I'm going to have everything go to full price because we can't get most of the supplements anymore because the supply chain is breaking down.
[46:09.560 --> 46:16.560]  Not just for us, but everybody. And I won't get the crap that they've got out there and downgrade our products and, you know, reformulate them and make them weaker.
[46:16.560 --> 46:22.560]  That's how that works. You change the formula. You have to reformulate it. We're always reformulating because they get better.
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.560]  I'm not going to reformulate and sell you the type of crap from China and stuff. We don't sell any supplements from China.
[46:27.560 --> 46:34.560]  Most are stuff right here in North America. Some of us from South America and places like that. Some of us from Greece.
[46:34.560 --> 46:42.560]  But the point is, is that I'm telling you stuff's breaking down. It's bad. Okay. And it's not just that. It's all the other attacks.
[46:42.560 --> 46:48.560]  So we're going to be in this together. I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm sorry for America.
[46:48.560 --> 46:55.560]  And when Trump gets back in, which they're going to probably not be able to stop him because America is waking up, they're going to bring in the depression.
[46:55.560 --> 47:02.560]  I don't know how he's going to hold it off. That's why they've paid off all the right wing pundits to say, oh, we're devaluing things.
[47:02.560 --> 47:08.560]  The dollar's dead. Trump shouldn't be doing stimulus. If we don't do the stimulus, we're going to totally collapse. That's their plan.
[47:08.560 --> 47:15.560]  That's what he's doing long term will be bad. We don't have a choice anymore. Anybody that understands economics knows that.
[47:15.560 --> 47:20.560]  We need political power and control of our country because it's ideology that can build everything back.
[47:20.560 --> 47:27.560]  If we don't have the ideology of the Republic and America and freedom, it won't matter. They're making their move.
[47:27.560 --> 47:34.560]  I'm getting chills right now. Every channel, every show, the dollar's dead. America's over. Wall Street now bearish on the dollar.
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.560]  They're on and on and on. They're making their move.
[47:38.560 --> 47:46.560]  And empires and republics fall very, very incrementally and from rotting with him, but then finally like an old barn, when a tornado comes by, they blow over.
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.560]  They blow down. And they're huffing and they're puffing, trying to blow our barn down.
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.560]  And Trump's trying to put in some new logs, put in some new spikes, put in some new nails.
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.560]  He's trying to shore things up with sandbags because the storm's here.
[48:01.560 --> 48:08.560]  And it's the global government New World Order storm to bring down the Republic and bring in the post-human era and lock everything down.
[48:08.560 --> 48:11.560]  And Trump's fighting the lockdown.
[48:11.560 --> 48:18.560]  Remember people that told you, oh, it's a secret thing Trump's doing? Well, he rounds up all the bad guys. Don't come out of your houses.
[48:18.560 --> 48:27.560]  All the left is told to boil out of their nest and go out and burn everything down and destabilize the country so they can run headlines that America's over and America sucks and Trump caused this.
[48:27.560 --> 48:36.560]  But the good news is people see through it and they see through who's behind the riots and who's behind the COVID hoax, exaggeration.
[48:36.560 --> 48:47.560]  And so we're turning the corner, but I'm telling you, the enemy, if you look at their minions like Pelosi and others, are not going to give up.
[48:47.560 --> 48:50.560]  And they are going to push harder than they ever had.
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.560]  So everything in four words is done for 26 years. Everything you've done in your life of being informed and being involved is building towards this point.
[48:57.560 --> 49:02.560]  And this isn't a normal time. And I know you know that. And I salute you and I thank you.
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.560]  But when you call in thanking me for trying to self-preserve myself and you, we're in the same boat, brother.
[49:09.560 --> 49:16.560]  So I get it. I appreciate you just as much as you appreciate me, but I'm telling you, now is the time because I need to know.
[49:16.560 --> 49:20.560]  I got to decide the next week with what we've gotten our coffers with only enough to operate.
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.560]  If I sold both my houses, okay, which I don't even care about, I've got the mortgaged to pay for this place.
[49:27.560 --> 49:32.560]  It would not operate us for a month and a half. I don't, I'm not rich. I don't have all this money. The media says I have. Okay.
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.560]  Got a nice truck and ice car and stuff like that. I got, I got insurance for my kids. I'm doing well.
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.560]  I don't care. I don't need more. I'm happy. I don't need the house on the hill.
[49:41.560 --> 49:50.560]  But what I'm saying is, is that I don't have the gasoline to go into the future with the things they're pulling and the things they're doing unless I get a big chunk of money in.
[49:50.560 --> 49:52.560]  So here's what I need you to do.
[49:52.560 --> 50:17.560]  I need you to go to infowars.com to the live show feed today that says emergency broadcast, globalist planning, massive world depression in front winds or loses. And if you scroll down in that, there's a link to infowarstore.com and the donate page where you can sign up for recurring donations or you can sign up for one time donations.
[50:17.560 --> 50:30.560]  And if folks would simply go there and make a major donation, there's also a P.O. box on there. I know people got money out there. It's always sad how it's the poor people that do most of the donating because I run into on the street and they're great people.
[50:30.560 --> 50:45.560]  That's great. But the middle class and the rich people hold on to it. They could turn, you know, a piece of coal into a diamond in their rear end and you're going to lose it all because Soros and the enemy spend their money to dominate you and you won't spend money to fight them.
[50:45.560 --> 50:58.560]  I will give both my arms right now to defeat them. I did my life too. I don't give a rat's ass about money. Money's energy. Money's a weapon. Money's a bullet. I fire out of the barrel of a gun at the enemy politically.
[50:58.560 --> 51:11.560]  And the information war. I'm just telling you, folks, this is serious. And the country needs to be prayed for and you need to pray for yourself. And I'm telling you, we make it easy. We got things that make your life better.
[51:11.560 --> 51:20.560]  We got things that are essential you need. And we've got the information warfare. And I'll ask you to support our local radio stations.
[51:20.560 --> 51:34.560]  Spread the word about them. Become a sponsor. Thank them. Ties the local radio station. This show, and I'm not saying we're good, does more for pro-life, more against the Satanist, more to bring people to Christ than the little fake country club churches all day that people give all their money to.
[51:34.560 --> 51:44.560]  Donate to your local radio station. Send them 100 bucks a month, $10 a month, whatever you've got. Give them your word of mouth. Go and eat at the restaurant that sponsors them. You've got the power. Use it.
[51:44.560 --> 51:55.560]  The less try to bully us, dominate us, destroy us. And I don't want them to win because they're pulling out the stops. They've committed crimes that are insane. It's all coming up next hour.
[51:55.560 --> 52:07.560]  We have a special guest from Australia. John Lorraine is going to be coming in as well. But if you go to infowarstore.com, you see the Support Us link over on the right-hand side.
[52:07.560 --> 52:16.560]  And if you click on that, you'll find the different websites and the donation page. There it is. Support Us. Right there. Click on that on the right-hand side.
[52:16.560 --> 52:27.560]  I mean, you need a four-stage eye on filter. We have the best and lowest price because that's what I do. We have the best horrible food, highest quality you're going to get unless you pay five times more.
[52:27.560 --> 52:38.560]  infowarstore.com. The best prices. It's all there. But we've only got the ability to do business now. We're not going to have it much longer if the enemy has their way.
[52:38.560 --> 52:46.560]  I suggest, I'm telling you, I used to say support infowars. Rescue infowars. Save yourself. Save the world. We're in this together.
[52:46.560 --> 52:54.560]  Because let me tell you something. Communism's up here. Infowars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting. And you and I are all down here with our families.
[52:54.560 --> 53:02.560]  My children are right here with pedophiles and devil worshipers and forced inoculations and FEMA camps coming for us and war.
[53:02.560 --> 53:15.560]  If we don't fix this now, we're going to have to fight. And you know, I really need to repeat because the sick part of me just hopes it goes down.
[53:15.560 --> 53:26.560]  Because all you devil worshipers and trash that have been pushing and pushing and pushing forever, you better hope you fail in your operation and you don't push us into the fire.
[53:26.560 --> 53:35.560]  Because I swear on the altar of God, you will pay. And quite frankly, I'm so alive right now. I'm so glad.
[53:35.560 --> 53:45.560]  Soros and Bill Gates hate me. That's the greatest honor in my life. It's the greatest thing in my life next to my children.
[53:45.560 --> 53:53.560]  That I'm real. I'm all in. And you know me by my enemies and I know our audience of activists. It's you they hate because they don't have your will.
[53:53.560 --> 54:00.560]  They don't have your soul. They don't have your heart. They don't control your destiny. They sure as hell don't control mine.
[54:00.560 --> 54:10.560]  So we're trying to hold the dam against the Satanist and the armies of hell and we pray to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father for to lead God and direct us against this enemy.
[54:10.560 --> 54:18.560]  But I need money to fight a war and I need word of mouth and I need prayer and I need action because that dam's going to come down.
[54:18.560 --> 54:25.560]  That dam's already got holes in it. And the enemy's telling you don't stick your fingers in it. Don't block it. Everything's fine.
[54:25.560 --> 54:35.560]  Peaches and cream are on the other side. No! You know it's not peaches and cream. Crops told you hell's coming. One way or another.
[54:35.560 --> 54:41.560]  Only questions. We have a president in the middle of the fight against the New World Order or is it going to be us that does it?
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.560]  But we know we're not giving up.
[54:45.560 --> 54:51.560]  The Democrats are just going more and more left. Many positive about socialism liking it more than capitalism.
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.560]  Many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical are now mainstream.
[54:57.560 --> 55:04.560]  The radical left has taken over the Democratic Party and Joe Biden is marching in lockstep with them.
[55:04.560 --> 55:10.560]  Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle class families with trillions in new taxes.
[55:10.560 --> 55:18.560]  If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut. Promising amnesty and healthcare for 11 million illegal immigrants.
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.560]  Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.560]  Promising to shut down energy exploration, killing jobs and hurting America's economy.
[55:27.560 --> 55:30.560]  I guarantee we're going to build fossil fuel.
[55:30.560 --> 55:40.560]  Joe Biden's America. The radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it. They've already taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
[55:40.560 --> 56:04.560]  Don't let them take over America.
[56:04.560 --> 56:14.560]  Arrested. Attacked and threatened. Because we are effective.
[56:14.560 --> 56:22.560]  The great awakening is here. Go to band.video. Download the videos and share.
[56:22.560 --> 56:30.560]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[56:30.560 --> 56:41.560]  And never give up the fight.
[56:41.560 --> 56:48.560]  infowar.com
[56:48.560 --> 57:02.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:02.560 --> 57:23.560]  The United Nations recently sponsored a two and a half hour piece of propaganda directed towards the people of the Pacific Islands called Pacific Unite, saving lives together, referring to the fake pandemic that is officially killed only 0.003% of the population.
[57:23.560 --> 57:33.560]  Crowds of people protesting outside of Buckingham Palace chanting pedophiles.
[57:33.560 --> 57:46.560]  Prince Charles found the time to open the UN mind control concert by stating how climate change is to blame for this dreadful pandemic accelerating and terrifying impacts of climate change.
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.560]  Disgraced world leaders made appearances to push the vaccine as the only solution.
[57:52.560 --> 58:02.560]  In order to find the safe and effective vaccine, we must unite to keep ourselves and each other safe.
[58:02.560 --> 58:11.560]  The creation of a vaccine will be fundamental to the world's recovery. When one is developed, it must be distributed equitably, including to the Pacific region.
[58:11.560 --> 58:21.560]  And for some reason, there was much discussion about LGBT rights, and the entire event was hosted by a bearded transvestite.
[58:21.560 --> 58:46.560]  This desperate and bizarre piece of propaganda culminated with a musical production which is best experienced for yourself. Enjoy.
[58:51.560 --> 59:05.560]  Show it down, a brokenhearted, trying to smile again
[59:05.560 --> 59:14.560]  Give me shots, I'm aborted, I love the bill gates
[59:14.560 --> 59:16.560]  Oh, I need a mask, Bill Gates.
[59:30.060 --> 59:31.060]  Oh!
[59:33.060 --> 59:34.560]  A New World Order?
[59:38.060 --> 59:40.060]  A whole new rise with our New World Order?
[59:40.060 --> 59:42.560]  How? How's the rise again?
[59:42.560 --> 59:43.560]  Inject me.
[59:44.560 --> 59:47.560]  We'll rise, we'll rise again.
[59:47.560 --> 59:49.060]  We'll rise like that skull.
[59:49.560 --> 59:52.560]  We'll rise and our skin will fall.
[59:53.560 --> 59:56.060]  We'll be in graves, we'll be in graves.
[59:56.060 --> 59:59.060]  We'll be in sterilized, we'll be dead.
[59:59.060 --> 1:00:01.060]  We'll be dead, we'll be dead.
[1:00:01.060 --> 1:00:03.060]  Oh yeah, oh.
[1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.060]  We're gonna kill our children.
[1:00:07.060 --> 1:00:10.560]  Thank you, Bill Gates, for the shot.
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:23.560]  There's a new lifestyle. You don't get no food now.
[1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:30.560]  Features in our hands, we must protect it. Rise up, stand up and unite.
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:51.560]  Under Bill Gates, around the world, we're closing bodies, COVID-19 on the rise. A New World Order, behind closed doors. Let's tell our past, we will survive.
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:01:01.560]  We will rise, we will rise and our skin will fall.
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:07.400]  Take your shots be a skeleton. That's how the death begins
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:14.460]  You know we gotta air the Mars attacks again come in the next second
[1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:19.380]  I gotta have some humor and I'm gonna launch the pure absolute analysis stand by stay with us
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:24.280]  It's just we're inside the world government. Here's what I should have said earlier
[1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:28.880]  You can't have info wars on the air when everything we said comes straight
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.480]  And you can't have America with people guns and freedom and private property when nobody else has it
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.480]  That's why they're coming for you. That's why submitting won't work
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:43.840]  But all the sheep will think they get ahead by groveling to the system. That's all over. Oh
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:49.160]  My god
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:52.400]  Oh my lord save us
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:02:01.400]  Constantly whether it's the New York Times the Washington Post or Howard Stern of a blue name and they come out and they attack him full
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:08.280]  War saying Jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:15.360]  And he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they can and now everything
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:21.260]  I'm warm people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep
[1:02:21.260 --> 1:02:24.340]  This is the corporate planetary takeover
[1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:27.220]  So yes, I stand by what I said ten years ago
[1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:34.140]  What I said a year ago and what I said last week more than ever get your high-quality storeable foods at info wars store comm
[1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:40.940]  That's one of the key checkmarks of the checkboxes. You've got to have checked off info wars store comm and their delivery is now
[1:02:41.060 --> 1:02:48.400]  One to two weeks get it before the next big rush comes take action get the best horrible food at the best price now
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.440]  Get info wars store comm and it supports the info
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.680]  So I would say you know if anything that's happening at CNN and
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:19.920]  And anybody who buys your book, it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation and
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.000]  I don't believe in dividing our nation. It hurts our great nation and
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:29.600]  So CNN is really the enemy of the truth and that's my opinion. Thank you
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:43.760]  No American is an enemy of another American. No news outlet is an enemy of America
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:59.760]  No news outlet is an enemy of America
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:22.240]  And Trump is trying to bring peace to the set all these wars, and that's what they say
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:32.400]  No news outlet is an enemy of America. Bill Gates wants you take the vaccine
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:37.600]  Don't run. See you later friend
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:41.600]  This is Bill Gates
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:49.600]  You know, I don't know what they're calling that new video
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:52.240]  We had none of new Mars attacks since the last election
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:57.200]  But they're saying, you know, they keep saying the media is the enemy of the people. We are not the enemy of the people
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:01.760]  And that's the Mars attacks. The aliens are saying don't run. We are your friends. We're not your enemy
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:05.360]  We're not the enemy of the people as they as they rig on everyone laughing
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:09.440]  So now we've replaced Alex Jones. You're truly being zapped as the peace dove
[1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:12.480]  The peace conference with the alien ambassador to Brian Stelter
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:14.320]  shooting Trump
[1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:16.320]  It's just ridiculous. By the way
[1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:21.680]  I am ripping off Mark Dice. Everyone's doing it now when you do Stelter's voice. Mark started that like three years ago
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  We had already been exposing Stelter and making fun of him. We were the first but he did the funny voice thing
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:31.760]  So that's actually what Stelter said. I just voiced over it. Not as good as Mark Dice, but
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:34.320]  Mark did a video a few weeks ago where he showed
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:37.120]  Like dozens of other commentators
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:42.320]  Famous ones, you know, making fun of Stelter and I can tell you I've had requests
[1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:44.320]  From the White House
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:50.000]  And I've had requests from the number one Fox News host. I mean literal request like repeatedly
[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:53.920]  Will you make another Brian Stelter parody?
[1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:56.800]  And so you've got it
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:03.120]  We're gonna have some fun and I've got to get as soon as that's posted the band out video. I think it's supposed to be a minute now
[1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:05.120]  They were going with a
[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:11.120]  Video of Brian Stelter turning into an alien or something silly like that or Brian Stelter appointed ambassador tomorrow
[1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:14.080]  Stelter appointed ambassador to mars or ambassador to earth
[1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:17.040]  There it is. Brian Stelter appointed
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.520]  truth ambassador
[1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:21.520]  On mainstream media. That's funny
[1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:28.640]  So that's the headline. We weren't sure this morning. The piece wasn't done. It's got 1,711 views. Just one of it banned on video
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:30.640]  Make it the feature video
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:35.600]  Because you know what I need to have a little bit of fun. That's not as full pennywise face
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:37.920]  That's them like 10 years ago. Can we put pennywise up, please?
[1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:40.880]  I'm gonna show him one full demon on folks
[1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:46.320]  All right, um, you know, it's almost hard after that super hardcore. There it is
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.560]  It's it's hard to get super hardcore after that last hour being super hardcore
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.400]  Gosh talk about not being self aware. Good lord. Oh look at that. Sorry
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:02.320]  Again, as Jeff said many times, I'm not saying Brian Stelter is a child monster
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:05.120]  I'm saying if I was a Hollywood producer
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:07.360]  and I was gonna
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:09.520]  cast a new pennywise that eats children
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:12.320]  No makeup needed. I mean
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:17.760]  This this this I would walk the other side of the street if I saw that walk at parts. I mean that is a
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:20.720]  demon clown that's a
[1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:25.600]  That's a flesh walker right there folks. That's not from these parts
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:30.800]  Better not long enough. You learn how to spot them. It's not very hard. That's a full-on one right there
[1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:36.800]  I'm completely unself-aware. Okay, let's stop get him off the screen. Excuse me. I only handle so much. Oh, uh
[1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:42.720]  Look at the self-satisfied look to all right. Let's just stop there. Um
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:50.240]  It's true people ask why do you get so serious and screw around a lot
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:55.360]  It's hard to sit there and look at this. I had to read all this and look at all this
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.680]  And now I got to cover it and it's just unbelievable
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  Let me just try to do this way
[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:10.880]  Please lord
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:16.880]  The worst globalist takeover scenarios that we indeed predicted
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:24.880]  Have now come true
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:30.000]  But it wasn't coming true it was already there it was already happening
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:34.080]  And so people need to understand
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:37.360]  When I'm freaking out about australia
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.120]  Say they're gonna have forced inoculations and arresting people to try to protest
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  for protesting online
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.840]  When I get upset about spain and months and months you can't leave your house
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:53.760]  When I get upset about that it's because the un's running it. They've written white papers. I've shown you the white papers
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:58.000]  Event 201 lockstep and others and there's an exact plan
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And there's nothing more frustrating
[1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:07.440]  Than knowing an exact plan and knowing how horrible it is and knowing what it ends in
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:11.040]  And knowing these horrible scum are going to do this everybody
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:17.520]  And sterilize everybody and give us cancer and the new vaccines actually change your dna. That's cancer
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:22.800]  They make your whole body do a chain reaction replication where you're a new gmo creature
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:29.200]  It's enough for monsanto to make the corn where it doesn't produce new viable seeds or soybeans
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  But now it's everything it's us
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:35.600]  And and it's so over the top
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:38.480]  People don't even know what they're hit by
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:42.400]  It's like being hit by a bus. It's just such a huge lurch of suddenly
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:47.040]  There's pedophile tv shows and everyone's getting forced inoculations. I know it's going to make you really sick
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:51.520]  And oh it goes in and changes your cells forever and it takes over your body
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:57.040]  And and it's just and it and bill gates is and bill gates is on tv like for izakari is like the whole economy is going to be
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.360]  Shut forever
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:02.160]  Laughing and it's it's psychotic
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:08.320]  So, let me just give you the news from today the overhead shot, please
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:18.560]  Australian police pay home visits to 80 people warning them that they'll be arrested if they protest against the lockdown online or in person
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:22.320]  Was it just the one lady
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:29.520]  Ohio Department of Health partners with fema to create shelter facilities for people exposed to covet and they say that oh
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:31.520]  If you
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:36.560]  Have sniffles a cough. We don't even test you. We just take you and lock you up for a month
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:40.240]  in a non-congregant shelter so in a jail cell
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:42.560]  And I've got the letter
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:47.200]  Which bob barns texted me in like two in the morning that guy must not be awake during the day. He's a great guy
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.120]  We didn't get him on about this. He said these are actual fema camps. He laid it out and it's all right here
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:54.240]  And they got fema, which is a bureaucracy not trump. He's do something
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:59.840]  To to to to do because the state asked for it's the state actually built fema camps says right here fema camps
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.920]  And the Ohio is this is bad as Hawaii the worst states are
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:11.440]  Ohio and hawaii and they're all following the UN edict and the governor is in here saying
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.480]  You will be taken by force to these facilities
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.120]  If we deem
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.040]  That you don't have a place to stay or you won't stay
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  And they give them phones
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:28.080]  If you don't have a phone, they go here's a phone. It monitors where you are. It's the social credit score
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:33.200]  It's what China was doing, you know six months ago. It's all been beta tested. It's all been rolled out. It's all been prepared
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:34.320]  It's all here
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:39.440]  And now it's happening so fast usually this would be a top story for weeks and the media would defend it and now it's just
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:43.440]  Blip blip blip blip blip blip blip police are arresting those online in the uk
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.920]  Those in germany the those that organized demonstrations against this
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:51.280]  Now they've got camps for you and they've got political officers
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.840]  From the dnc and the global clinton initiative that are the ones that decide to spot people
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:03.920]  And just get you used to seeing folks not just drug out of a restaurant for not wearing a mask or not wearing it properly. No, no, no
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.800]  You're you're you're they finger you and the police dutifully show up because they're all bullied under the political system
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:13.440]  Now so they're going to growl with the left and bow to the left and yield the left
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:18.800]  The police are dangerous folks because they're controlled. They're not bad people on average. They've been bullied in the stockham syndrome now
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:22.560]  So they just show up instantly and billy club you and and then the media's like good
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:26.480]  You've got some black guy beat him up or that's a lady choke him take him to the femur cam
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:32.400]  We come back though. They say listen report anybody not wearing a mask during sex
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:40.000]  So they want to be involved in your sex life everything. It's all the most absurdist things they can say to condition you and to get you ready to submit to this
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.920]  So here's the deal all you and denial aren't going to be able to live in denial anymore
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:47.360]  Either get on your knees prepare to serve satan or fight back

[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:40.240]  And i want to explain that again your support of info wars has stood in defiance of george soros
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:46.880]  The globalist hillary and all these comebacks. So great job. You built what we've done. I salute you
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:55.360]  This is a maximum alert a maximum alert as of taping this alert you're 82 days out from the election
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:00.880]  As many of you know in the last year. I pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:05.200]  And other globalist organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:11.200]  So their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:17.280]  Then they are openly now wargaining. This is in the new york times having democrat states and cities
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:23.280]  Succeed from the union just like they've ignored trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:27.600]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal. They are saying they're going to have their own
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.760]  separate inauguration not in dc. They said in a another city
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:34.320]  Colossia said this when they crown
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.320]  Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:42.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war. This is their public criminal plan
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.480]  We should be praying. We should be spreading the word. We should be demanding Trump won the office to expose this criminal activity
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:54.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:57.760]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.760]  I
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:24.080]  All right, we're back. Let's just plunge straight into the news right now
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:31.040]  Australian police pay home visits to 80 people saying no free speech allowed. They actually said to the bar association
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:39.200]  In austral that was upset about this. They said listen black lives matter is important and is allowed to these groups or not
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:45.440]  And that's exactly what the blaseo said. They said oh well black lives matter is allowed to have demonstrations, but synagogues churches and
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:48.560]  Moss can't
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:52.400]  It's about rubbing your nose in it. Let's continue
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:54.400]  In the article Ohio
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:58.720]  Oh, it's getting FEMA centers ready where if they think you have it you disappear
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:01.360]  And then they have fake tests that are 90% false positive
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:05.920]  All of it is a fraud a cover for rounding people up and arresting them next year
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.040]  This is all just the pre-programming getting the spies ready
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:14.160]  You know, I hadn't been out to eat in a long time and I went out to eat with some family last night
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:20.080]  And I literally wore the stupid mask in the restaurant kabuki theater then take it off it where you're eating
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:22.880]  And then as I'm getting up by I'm sitting by the door
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:30.080]  I get up and it's not on the lady goes you to put your mask on and I said you need to get reality foushies of fraud
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:32.080]  This is martial law
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.080]  The manager was like, oh Alex. I'm a fan. I understand. I was like, yeah, whatever and I walked out the door
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.000]  I actually said you're all a bunch of slaves, but
[1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.000]  I've been going to that restaurant since high school
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:49.280]  And you can't even go there because they're all enforcing because they're all virtue signalers
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:51.600]  It feels good to follow the little
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:54.640]  Neurotic rules and oh, I got to wear this mask to save my life
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:17:00.480]  They didn't even really use a real deadly virus as their cover and the gate says, oh, the really deadly one's coming
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:03.200]  So everyone cowering to this
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.120]  Has ensured that they're going to release the mega viruses now
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:10.080]  Everybody get that
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:12.320]  I believe in you
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.720]  I believe in you though. I believe you're going to get the word out and stop this and really good things
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:21.280]  Are happening
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:25.680]  On a daily basis right now where it's all coming out that it's a fraud. So let's go over this
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.920]  I have the crew running up to be giving me this article over and over again
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:33.520]  Even though we we were reporting this last saturday and so was
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:38.160]  Gateway punnett, but now it's mainstream news. So everybody's like freaking out about it and you're right
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:43.600]  I should have led the show with this the cdc says 90 percent of the tests are
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:46.960]  False positive. Uh, we had a short
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.800]  headline
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.720]  Was it friday or was it sunday guys type into a search engine
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:58.960]  90 plus percent of covet tester false positive info wars dot com
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:04.400]  Type that in you're going to get last week before anybody even put the numbers out because I went
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:07.840]  And I looked at them and we hired a statistician to look at them
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:10.560]  So I went and but I didn't even get this from a statistician
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.440]  I went and did it with a calculator at home and I've asked the statistician to do it as of last week
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.600]  It's not about me bragging
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:22.000]  But again, there's there it's not the crew's great, but there's not a
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:25.280]  There's not an understanding that we're the tip of the spear
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:29.840]  Here I'll pull up on my phone
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.520]  No, that's that's that's uh, that's that's today folks. That's yesterday
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.720]  We ran out live show
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:38.160]  headline
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:40.720]  This show not the new york times this one
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.720]  alex jones
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:44.720]  austin texas, man me
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:50.560]  Kaden, it's not about the credit. It's about reality. We ran a headline last week for the live show
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.840]  CDC admits
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:57.840]  90 percent
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:02.560]  Of covid test false positive
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:12.400]  Have every available person search that I'll get it during the break so
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:17.600]  It's hard to search it though unless you use duck duck go there pretty good searches in it
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.360]  We're all our stuff's blocked, but
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:23.760]  I'll go to rebroadcast. I mean, it's not the crew's bad. I have to have this article now. I have to have it
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:27.920]  I can't do the show now. I need some time to get it. Anyways, everyone's running in
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:37.120]  Here it is. I mean here it is new york times on covid 19 test up to 90 percent of people's testing positive
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.200]  Carry barely any virus many are not likely to be contagious
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:49.440]  And that's even a fraud the test test for viral debris of any viral or bacterial infection that you've had in the last decade
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:56.800]  Here's another one new york times report claims 90 percent of covid positive americans not contagious
[1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:01.280]  Here's what I was talking about earlier
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:03.440]  wear a mask while driving
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:08.880]  And people do that too wear a mask while having sex and avoid kissing new people
[1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:13.040]  Canada's top doctor says other un minion. Oh, yes
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:18.320]  More absurd like everybody wants to take the mask off in public. Oh wear it in your house by yourself
[1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:26.560]  Democrats make people in zoom meetings by themselves to put it on this is you can't be seen without the mask peer pressure show it at all times
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:32.800]  Covid hysteria students excluded for turning
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.680]  Their heads in class remember the uk put signs up last week saying do not turn your head
[1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:44.080]  Do not look at people that spreads covid more insane more ridiculous stand on your head
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:47.200]  When I say jump ask how high
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:50.480]  On and on and on
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:52.480]  On and on and on
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:54.560]  On and on and on
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:56.560]  On and on and on
[1:20:57.280 --> 1:20:59.280]  And that's how all this works ladies and gentlemen
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:04.160]  Oh, but they've got their vaccine suddenly ready in a month
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:09.600]  They say remember I told you they'd have it by the fall when they said oh two years at least that was to make the artificial
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:15.920]  Scarcity like it's that's magic thing. Oh, oh, sorry. We don't have it for you. And I said that's a ploy
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:18.640]  They've already developed it. They already have the vaccines
[1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:24.000]  I showed you all the patents five years ago two years ago a year ago billable indicates front groups
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:29.200]  And we're right again. We're right again. We're right again. We're right again
[1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:32.800]  We're right again. We're right again. We're right again. We're right again
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:39.440]  We're and I'm getting myself to because I sat right behind them in that office right through that door
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  And I said 90 of covid test
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  false positive cdc
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:49.680]  I will show you the article. I will get it. It's gonna happen
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:55.840]  So australia and ohio
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:57.840]  So
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:04.960]  Are the microcosm
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:09.360]  Of all of this
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.040]  Now there's another headline
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:21.760]  But that's from july not last week. It's not a big deal guys. It's not your fault. I'll find it
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:26.000]  I'll remember the exact headline. I'll pull it up. It's not about us proving. We're right
[1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:31.440]  It's that no one else went and did with a calculator when they admitted with how many of the tests were fault
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:33.600]  I mean every nfl player they tested
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:37.120]  That was false positive. It was all for every one of them was false positive
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:42.800]  They had thousands of clinics across the united states starting in florida that had 100 percent
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:51.760]  Infection rates. They weren't doing the test. They were just getting the insurance money. It's a lie
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:23:01.040]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on but you sit there and you talk to some stupid dumb person
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:05.760]  I mean people now at the park walk up and say get your mask on
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:12.560]  Because they have no power but now they've given the authority to go hymn peck someone to go get in their face
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:18.880]  But as soon as you stand up they turn and they run because their whole identity is about bossing people around
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:21.680]  I'm gonna get into the censorship
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  I'm gonna get into the un takeover
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:30.400]  The food shortages what's happening in australia with a special guest and the major election meddling and it's now official
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:32.400]  They're gonna contest it and they're not gonna
[1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:38.000]  They're saying the president won't be allowed on the internet. He'll be blocked by ai from saying he won
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:44.480]  Wow, we're living in a science fiction movie folks. It's incredible. We're in a lot of trouble
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:48.000]  But if we admit we are we can stop it a lot of folks tell you

[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:14.240]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:18.480]  So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:21.680]  But both are concentrates and our first product got rave reviews

[1:26:49.520 --> 1:27:09.520]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:21.440]  Over 180,000 americans have died from COVID-19. This is the phrase countless health officials and politicians have stated over and over again
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:26.960]  To drill into the heads of the american public that coronavirus is actively killing everyone no matter your health background
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:29.360]  And it will kill you too
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:34.720]  But there must have been a misstep in cdc reporting on coronavirus death numbers because
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:40.560]  New cdc reports are showing that the number of deaths where COVID-19 was the sole cause of death
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:43.040]  Is closer to around 10,000
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:48.400]  The cdc has updated information in regards to how they count coronavirus deaths to read that
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.200]  Only six percent of the 180,000 deaths are solely due to coronavirus
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.800]  Other deaths added to the COVID-19 death count have two or more serious conditions or causes tied to that death
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:02.560]  With the overwhelming majority of the deceased in a much older age range
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:07.680]  And while these numbers could easily stem a lot of the coronavirus fears and anxieties we've seen
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.480]  The media has still of course remained silent on it
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:15.920]  Let's also not forget a couple months back when we saw the cdc send out directives for states to include probable
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.560]  Aka unconfirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and deaths to their official counts
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:28.960]  Remember this council meeting in calling county texas where one confirmed case plus 16 probable cases of COVID-19 turned into 17
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:31.040]  confirmed cases added to the total count
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:37.040]  State of texas dshs has informed public health departments that they are
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:40.480]  They have adopted a revised definition
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:44.080]  For COVID-19 probable cases
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:45.760]  So
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:52.480]  For confirmed case it stays as saying you still just need PCR, but now they've added a probable case definition
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:56.160]  Uh, so that still gets counted towards the case count
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.400]  It's different. It's not confirmed. It's probable, but it's still a case
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.880]  So at the end of this definition
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:07.280]  There are 15 different options on how you could be classified as a probable case
[1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:13.040]  Based on this diagram and what they report. There's a total of 17 cases now
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:18.000]  One is still only confirmed because that was that original index case
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:24.080]  Who then had all these contacts underneath in orange and all the rest of them became probable
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:26.880]  But they are still considered a case
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:35.680]  These various news stories of texas officials having to adjust total coronavirus deaths to lower than what was previously reported then followed suit
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:43.840]  Also, despite a huge drop in overall deaths, which we can clearly see again on the cdc website and before you say that's because we've been in a lockdown
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:49.440]  Let's not forget that there has been large gatherings of protests and rioting throughout the nation since May
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:55.760]  Big cities like los angeles chicago and new york are still severely locked down and families have been unable to open their businesses
[1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:00.720]  Go to church or send their kids back to school. And if your kids are back in school
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:04.960]  This is an example of what their lives may look like in new york governor
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:12.720]  Andrew Cuomo deployed a SWAT team of 71 contact tracers and eight case investigators upon a new york state university in
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:16.960]  Oneonta after 105 students tested positive for covid-19
[1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:21.680]  After hearing of the new cases the university decided to suspend all in-person activity
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.200]  And students will not be allowed to leave campus for the next two weeks
[1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:30.720]  Facilities such as the library will be closed and dining services will deliver meals to the residential halls
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:32.720]  They will be allowed to go outside
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:37.680]  But they won't be allowed to gather in groups and bus service to and from campus will be suspended
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.520]  As students are forced to conduct all of their classes online from now on
[1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:46.880]  This type of environment sounds eerily reminiscent of another place where you're confined to a room
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:51.920]  You have no option to leave in or told when and who you can go outside with and when you can eat
[1:30:51.920 --> 1:30:54.480]  I just can't put my finger on the place
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:02.480]  So while covid-19 deaths continue to drop the actual number of deaths where covid-19 is the sole cause is closer to 10,000
[1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:09.280]  Instead of 180,000 our media health officials and politicians still refuse to let us get back to life as usual
[1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:11.280]  And New York seems to be leading the way
[1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:13.280]  Mainstream media
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:15.280]  Government cover-ups
[1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:17.280]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:19.280]  Well, so does he
[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:24.240]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:30.880]  Well, you've played a few minutes of savannah hernandez very important video the savannah hernandez report section of band on video
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:32.880]  CDC reveals the truth
[1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:37.680]  I'm covered 19 death numbers. It's huge. They're trying to suppress it get that out
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:43.040]  If you want to win and defeat this and ever have things turned back on universities from australia to the united states
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:48.160]  Or all under you and directives where you go into little jail cells now and a cell phone tracks where you go
[1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:53.920]  You're not allowed to leave the campus. This is the prison planet. This is beyond the communist chinese
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:57.200]  Social credit score. They're going directly to where you're locked down
[1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:02.080]  All based on a virus that they synthetically created so they own the treatment of it
[1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.680]  Which only kills really old people and those that already have comorbidity
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:10.240]  But it is a real virus, but the response to it is a giant hoax now
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:12.800]  we played
[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:18.320]  Disgusting frightening nauseating footage yesterday of a woman in
[1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:20.800]  Melbourne australia
[1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:23.600]  Who was organizing a demonstration this saturday?
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:28.720]  And we'll talk about her in her organization and who she is in a moment
[1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:34.160]  We turns out they went to 80 people's houses and did this
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:40.880]  And we're getting reports in australia. But it's not denying it that some city council members in other cities are disappearing
[1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:43.520]  And being taken to federal lockdown
[1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:50.400]  Australia has been a prison colony and never really got out from under the crown. It's got great people in it, but it is enslaved
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:52.720]  But hey here in the u.s. They've got fema
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:56.400]  Under democrat request setting up fema camps. We're going to be doing a demonstration
[1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:59.760]  Under democrat request setting up fema camps where people will be forcibly held
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:04.480]  You cannot make this up. They're saying don't have sex or if you do wear a mask
[1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:07.040]  This is total cult programming
[1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:12.800]  They're telling children in the uk under u.n recommendations. Don't look at people in the eyes. That can give it to you
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:14.960]  This is voodoo folks
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:16.960]  This is hysteria. This is new rossies
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:22.080]  Children are getting in trouble that walk the wrong way or or i mean it's it's total control
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:25.200]  Now syrian girl's been coming on with us for i don't know six seven eight years now
[1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:30.800]  And uh, she is a refugee of syria. Her family was not a fan of Assad previous to that
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:33.360]  They were in the ruling party and actually kicked out of the country
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:39.760]  But she's accurately exposed the u.n staging false flags or the u.n's exposed the false flags that uh, she first exposed
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:46.080]  She's exposed the white helmets. She's been a great source of information for us for a very long time. She lives in australia
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:48.080]  She goes by syrian girl
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:52.720]  At twitter at partisan girl patreon syrian girl and she's a great
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.840]  Brain and she joins us for the next 50 minutes or so ahead of the honor Lorraine joining us
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:02.320]  Uh to talk about a lot of this and more here today, but
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.080]  australia
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:10.320]  epicenter of control ohio and hawaii here. They admit her beta test universes are beta test. What's happening in australia?
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:13.360]  We know it's coming here next
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:19.280]  Well, how far is this going to go? What is your research view on the syrian girl? Thanks for staying up till one in the morning to join us
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:26.320]  My pleasure is always alex. It's always great to be on your show. Um, yeah, well we
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:30.960]  australia was shocked to see the footage of that young lady
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:37.840]  in her pajamas broadcast around the world getting arrested for uh, making basically a facebook post
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:41.040]  um to try to get a protest against lockdown
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:46.800]  And the reason that's so hypocritical is that the BLM protest was allowed
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:53.920]  You know just a month prior and it was probably the reason why there was such a spread of the virus in the first place
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:58.640]  um, so it seems to be that some protests are allowed and some are not
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:05.440]  And people are sick of that now australia is as you said yourself, you know, it started off
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.160]  the intention of being a prisoner island
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:15.200]  And uh, it's basically still that seemingly. Um, the police here have
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.160]  um, are acting in a way that I've never even seen them act before
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:26.320]  Did you see if it's not just this case? There was another case where a woman wasn't wearing a mask
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:32.160]  She actually had a doctor's certificate that would like she doesn't have to wear it
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:36.880]  it's a it's against the doctor's orders for her to wear the mask and uh, that a
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.640]  A police officer didn't even wait to hear her excuse and just started choking her
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:45.680]  On camera. Yes, you showing it right there
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:49.760]  So we've never seen the like of this before
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:51.600]  um, and
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:53.040]  No matter how
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:56.880]  And by the way, if the mask isn't suffocating you him choking her
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:02.000]  Our neck is I mean this is she she these people are are shameful
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:05.360]  I mean it's
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:09.280]  It's so unnecessary. It's so completely unnecessary. Um
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:15.920]  Look the virus as you said is real. I know someone who almost died of it. There are are over the age of 65
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:22.960]  Um, or at least I know of someone so yes, but it doesn't uh, give you the right to do things like this
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:25.040]  It's just it's not that
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:29.680]  You can never be bad enough to uh to do this and let's be clear though
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.720]  It's not as bad as a normal pneumonia or flu, but there are some people who it appears did die of this
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:36.080]  Syrian girls stay there
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:39.840]  We'll come back and talk about it though the test of almost all been false positive
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:46.960]  Which puts you to database for the rest of your life 90 plus percent false positive and 94 percent of the death died of something else
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:49.120]  comorbidity
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:51.440]  It was a sleeper product
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:56.640]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it it's become one of our top five best sellers
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:02.880]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack 13 different pills filled with super nutrients vitamins
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:08.800]  Minerals and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night. It's available right now at 60
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:13.120]  Off for a limited time when you get it with survival shield x2
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:17.440]  That's now back in stock. This has changed my life and so many other people's lives
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:24.000]  Now here's the problem some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:26.400]  Are not available for us even reorder it
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.040]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have it's in stock now
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.880]  Take advantage of this new combo special part of a larger cell
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:41.600]  We have and free shipping on these cell items like eight pack power stack and x2 at info or store dot com

[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:57.360]  There's a nauseating sense to it not a sense of triumph on a sense of victory
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:00.240]  Not a sense of completion
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:03.760]  But sense of sixth nausea
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:07.760]  Though we were right about the world government. We were right about the
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:11.280]  Anti-human plans. We were right about all the horrible
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:14.160]  things the globalists
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:17.360]  And their satanic order want to do to us now we sit here
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:24.560]  Warning people for decades trying to get people ready trying to stop what was coming, but you know what?
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:29.040]  Revolations and God's word says it's coming so you can't stop it
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.880]  And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger plan than he
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:35.760]  Come to the point in our own
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:41.920]  Psychic our own spirit our own will that we submit to God and realize God's in charge of God as a power
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:44.960]  And the devil is set as a tester
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.720]  Now it's up to us to make the right decision. That's what's really always been about
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.840]  I'm not gonna lie to you
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:55.840]  I want to stay in the fight against Soros and Hillary and the new world order
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:00.080]  And the only way I do is if you buy a lot of products at info or short.com
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:05.200]  You got to sell a lot of vitamins and a lot of minerals and a lot of fish oil
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:11.840]  And a lot of t-shirts and a lot of water filters to fund an operation in the face of the globalist and all the dnc lawsuits

[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:44.160]  Your support of info wars has stood the defiance of george soros the globalist hillary and all these comebacks

[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:55.760]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:05.920]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:12.960]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:14.960]  It's alex jones
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  I've noticed two different key phenomenons
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.680]  And and it's more complex just these two but these are two dominant ones
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:27.200]  Well, there's three but there's a lot of people that are so altruistic and have so much empathy
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:34.720]  That they just love another group being abused or hurt because they have good genetics good spirit good understanding
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:41.360]  That that's gonna affect them. They don't know why they're upset. They see somebody suffering. They don't know why they're upset by seeing something wrong
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:46.800]  They don't even think that it's empathy. They just they just have the empathy because their head screwed on straight
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:54.160]  Those people are like always. Oh, you're such a loving good person alex you you uh, you really care about these downtrodden groups
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:59.200]  They're sterilizing you really care about the africans. You really care about the australians being put under this
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:01.200]  You really care about the hawaiians and I
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:09.440]  Have the empathy, but I know what it is. It's my brain goes. I'm next and it turns out we are this is all coming here
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:13.840]  It's world government. So I want to explain something. I am so sick of people going
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:18.240]  Why do you care what happens to the syrians or why do you care what happens to the australians?
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:24.160]  Or why do you care about what happens to idiots in new york? Because the same thing got control there is coming here, baby
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:26.880]  so
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:31.200]  I need to get the people that don't get that. I mean so many people say to me they go jones
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:37.520]  Why do you care about the rich people in the stock market? I have nothing to start by the way and they go nothing against it
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.520]  I'm just it is a giant bubble
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  but people say
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.760]  Well, who cares if it collapses because every company we know basically surviving on it
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.320]  I'm not I'm not glad that we're on a corrupt life raft, but we're on the corrupt life raft
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:52.400]  There's a bunch of piranhas around us and we're bleeding
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:56.240]  So I'm just trying to give people to understand that you have to get involved
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:02.160]  It's not a virtue to not care and I know our audience gets all that but I'm talking to the lost sheep out there the prodigal sons
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:05.680]  to understand that
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:08.160]  Yeah decades of corruption a hundred years of whatever
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  Not caring would get you ahead
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:12.880]  temporarily
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:15.920]  Not with god, but now not caring will get you killed
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:19.120]  so I'ma tell listeners
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:25.040]  You need our word of mouth. We need yours this transmission is is game changing because we're original research
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  We don't I don't go out and get some other talking heads thing and then I'll pull that sound smart
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:31.440]  I'm gonna say that I go out and I really know what I'm doing
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:36.480]  I really talk to the experts and do the research and I tell you what's going on and it's about as accurate as it gets
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:41.520]  The enemy hates it because their best brains are like cooking this stuff up and they know I can see right into it
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:46.080]  That's why they want us off the air folks. You need horrible food
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:50.640]  We've got high quality at a very low price the we got the best place because I go out and get you the best place
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:54.480]  The most reliable I've had a relationship 12 years with these folks. That's what I want is a marriage
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:58.880]  Not a one night stand with organizations not with you. I mean, I don't want I don't be sexual
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:02.960]  It's an allegory. I don't want a one night stand folks. I want a long-term relationship
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:07.920]  I want us as a community to have children together. That's really what you know us with you. We're the
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:14.080]  Bridegroom you know the crisis of groom where the bride. I mean actually allegory is I want a relationship
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:17.920]  And and I'm just telling you I wouldn't tell you something unless I totally know it's true
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:24.160]  The smartest thing you can do other than getting firearms is get water filtration and swirable foods. We have it infowarstore.com
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:28.240]  And I'm and the company we're partnering with has it ready to ship within one or two weeks
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.720]  They really ship it in like four or five days, but they've got that for a buffer for some special items people order
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.560]  Some things get held up
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:38.880]  While you still can get your swirable food orders in and while you still can get it in force t-shirt
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:44.080]  Get a supplement make a donation because they have tried to shut us down and the attacks have been incredible
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.080]  And the latest ones that I can't get into yet have just been unbelievably ridiculous
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:52.560]  And I just want to stay in the fight. So I need your financial support go to infowarstore.com
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:55.360]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up now if the next 45 minutes with
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:45:01.120]  Sure, and girl. I appreciate coming on get into whatever you want about covet Australia where that's going
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:05.360]  Why are you the epicenter? I know you want to get into antifa, which I know helped attack Syria as well
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:08.400]  I mean, you're an expert on this. Tell us what's happening
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:16.640]  Absolutely. Well, what might come to you which is coming to us is mandatory vaccination
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  But the vaccination is the mandatory part is sort of more of a soft
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:27.840]  Loved mandatoryness where if you don't get vaccinated, you're not allowed to go to work
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:33.520]  And you're not allowed to get unemployment. So basically they've made everybody
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:37.360]  Into you know pushed into poverty and they're
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:43.760]  Saying that they have to starve unless they take a vaccine that is hardly even been tested
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:46.400]  Or you know, it's kind of been rushed
[1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:49.680]  And I think that the agenda behind all of this is control
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:55.760]  That it's not going to be just uh, you know, take this vaccine or you won't be able to go to work
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:02.080]  It's going to extend beyond that it's going to say think these things or you're not going to be able to go to work or
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:09.520]  You know get unemployment or uh travel for example, and of course bill gates has everything to do with this
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:11.520]  his
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:13.520]  ID 2020
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:15.520]  where he wants to
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:22.320]  sell and I sell a special type of vaccine to governments where uh, people are tattooed
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:25.440]  with uh quantum dots that
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.880]  Say that they've been vaccinated or not, which means that you're no longer a free person
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:37.680]  You're basically tagged like cattle and you're no longer allowed to move or work or or
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:41.840]  You know, uh without having something tattooed on you
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:48.480]  Uh, that says you've been injected by an unknown substance and I say this as a scientist. I say this as a chemist
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:50.880]  um a vaccine
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:51.840]  is
[1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:56.640]  You know, it works vaccines work for some viruses
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:01.520]  And they are safe if they've been tested, but for certain viruses
[1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:08.960]  Uh, uh, it can actually make things worse and uh, even Fauci himself said this uh, or Fauci
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:14.000]  However, you pronounce it. Well, but I would use I mean sure we know about all the the the vaccine side affects the problems
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:15.680]  It's what else is in the vaccine?
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:16.880]  Is it a trojan horse?
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:17.920]  Have they spiked it?
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:23.600]  Have they tan it or do they accidentally grow it on monkey kidneys and give 100 million americans sv 40 cancer?
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:25.680]  I mean, that's the problem
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:29.920]  Well, you know what the problem even if the vaccine is perfect
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:35.040]  The problem is the the demand of control. I mean people should have autonomy over their own body
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:39.120]  Well, that's it the precedent is we put in your body what we want when we want and we track you
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:42.880]  Exactly and that is really dangerous
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:45.760]  Well, keep going. Sorry. You're making right points. Oh
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:54.000]  No problem. Um, so Australia, of course is gonna be where they try to roll this out because people are used to just following
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:55.760]  what the government says
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.920]  we're not in the same place as the americans are um and uh
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:09.360]  Uh, it's most people unfortunately will not all but most people, you know, they don't see anything wrong with it. Um, and they will trust it
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:11.120]  so
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  that is uh
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:18.480]  Once they have that here it's it is going to roll out in other countries and I think
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:25.040]  The uk will be next and then after that the us are they going to have they're going to have some difficulty with the us
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:32.000]  But um, the the people who will refuse the vaccine will be in minority and they will have very difficult time
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:34.800]  Like they will not be able to work. They will not be able to eat
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:38.880]  I'll tell you this when people die these vaccines the people that did it are going to pay
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:44.320]  I mean the people on the top they're assaulting us. They violated the geneva convention and the nuremberg
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:47.360]  precedence and they will pay
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:52.400]  I mean what else is next that it's going to start with vaccines as I said
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:58.240]  It's good. Then it's going to end with political opinions. I think so um, but all he is they're not letting people's
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:02.640]  The lawyers for kyle rittenhouse cannot even read police reports
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:05.680]  On tv and cannot put clips on twitter or facebook
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:11.440]  Rittenhouse's lawyers go on fox news and read the police report that he was trying to save people
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:15.120]  Had a fire extinguisher putting out a fire when they attacked him with guns
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:19.600]  And and and they said no we are the judge. You are a mass murderer
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:27.200]  You are not his lawyer who's famous and well known cannot even be on tv. This is unbelievable zuckerberg is becoming god
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:33.520]  Well, it's like you said, you know things that happened in syria are happening in the united states
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:37.600]  And that's what I can see happening on the streets of the u.s. Right now. It's a color revolution
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.280]  I said that very explain you already face soros. You've got the floor out here
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:43.840]  This segment next segment explain what we're facing
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:52.480]  Well, soros is doing a color revolution. It's to get biden reelected. They he just before it all happened
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:54.800]  You know, he said he needed the black vote
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.200]  And it just so seems that every
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Four years just before an election
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:04.000]  Black lives matter trends and then after the election it just stops trending
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:09.280]  And suddenly black lives don't matter anymore after the election is over
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:16.720]  So, uh, that's the whole point of this. We had the media fueling racial hatred in the united states
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:22.080]  In the lead up to the death of george floyd. I'm not saying that the police are
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:25.280]  Obviously the police aren't perfect. We know that. Yeah
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:28.240]  They they just cherry picked a few bad examples
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.920]  Well, um, they once shot an australian woman, uh in in the u.s. Uh, what she was and but she's white, you know, but they
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:38.480]  Yeah, no, no. He was the somali. So it was okay. Yeah
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:45.920]  Yeah, so they interject the race thing into it because of the election and biden and that guy was a bad cop when a white guy shoots
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:51.120]  A black guy and it's wrong. I say it's wrong. That guy was crazy and just shot her for no reason in a in a in an alley
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:56.240]  But doesn't be like we blame every black person for it or we blame every cop
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:00.720]  Yeah, I mean there is are there are issues
[1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:09.440]  Uh, but I think that they they have chosen to specifically highlight the race issue in order to get the democrats to vote
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:12.800]  Um, and they're happy to set the country on fire to achieve it
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:17.440]  And then we saw some of our things in syria and syria. We had uh, you know, hold on
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:20.640]  We're gonna come back. I want you to explain color revolutions what they are
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:25.920]  In the short segment the long segment lay out what you witness and what we're seeing here the soros brags. He did
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:31.200]  Ukraine he did syria. He's done it all and he's doing it again. And who does he represent the Rothschilds?
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:34.720]  The Rockefeller interest bill gates total enemies of humanity
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:37.200]  Bill Gates is gonna pay
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:42.240]  This isn't about me taking credit in fact, it's the opposite. It's about
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:44.800]  Getting you to understand that you have all the power
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:52.400]  Going back three weeks ago. They had the entire austin green belt shut down and they had the spillway by barton springs
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:59.760]  Shut down as well as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years or so. It's a damned up spring
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.480]  Well, we went down there and we
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:05.920]  Got in the park at different areas around town
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:09.520]  In the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.040]  And now despite the fact that they still say the parks are closed
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:18.000]  You get out of any area you'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:20.720]  Actually using barton springs here in austin texas
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.320]  So
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:27.760]  Bill Gates and the globalists give the orders to the UN the UN gives the orders down through the national health services
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.880]  Like our NIH and we all follow it like dutiful slaves
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:38.400]  Stop complying with your own enslavement. Stop following the orders of these globalist traders. Start being free again
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:45.360]  Going back more than 20 years ago. I coined the term the false left right paradigm
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:50.320]  From reading the books by carol quickly speaking brazilian others how they described
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:52.560]  powerful
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:54.560]  institutions and foundations
[1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:56.640]  successful takeover
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.040]  Of the left parties and right parties in europe and the united states
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:03.680]  It didn't mean that those parties didn't have differences before
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:11.200]  They were able to get control the leadership of both and manipulate the public with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:13.280]  Like wwf wrestling or something
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:16.720]  With trump and with our populist movement taking over the republicans
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:20.400]  This is a real populist movement doesn't mean it's perfect
[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:28.400]  And you know it's real because the democrats the power structure the china comms and the entire old republican leadership have all endorsed joe biden
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:32.240]  That's why i'm supporting trump. It's about americanism not globalism
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:39.520]  It's about ending the one-sided trade deals by defending our borders by defending the right to second amendment and pro-life and trump's doing all of that
[1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:45.680]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:00.560]  Jay dyer and sam trippley are going to be hosting the fourth hour that should be interesting
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:04.000]  syrian girls here with us right now from australia middle of the night
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:07.760]  But she wants to get into color revolutions start getting into it right now
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:11.120]  So we know our enemy and to know how serious the situation is what we're facing
[1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:19.360]  Sure. Well, you know george soros. He he funds a lot of these organizations like
[1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:22.880]  um, what do you call it in america?
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:25.760]  It's not get up. It's uh
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:33.760]  I forget it's a now something where they they basically fuel protests. Um, so
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:40.240]  So it's uh, he has like he funds them all black lives matter and if uh, he he funds them all
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:46.880]  He has a lot of little splinter organizations that fund these groups. Um, including the stuff about global warming
[1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:54.480]  Uh extinction rebellion for example, so uh, what what you can tell this telltale signs of a color revolution
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:56.880]  You have the media
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:04.880]  Uh, and the corporations suddenly they're all they're all part of the rebellion suddenly they're all promoting their resistance and
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:10.960]  Everybody has to have a black square as their profile photo or their races. Um,
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:16.400]  You know, it's suddenly like he has a black square as their profile picture
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:20.800]  So that is his first sign the corporations are on board second sign
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:26.560]  Uh, the media especially in the u.s. I think you could everyone realizes now the media is quite left
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:31.760]  Uh democrat controlled. Um, and they have been on board and fueling it
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:40.160]  You have the politicians and amongst the democrats are also, you know, trying to keep it going. Um, so it's
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:47.680]  You know, it has establishment backing. That's how you know, it's a color revolution and uh
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:51.440]  It's interesting that they had mostly peaceful protests
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:57.280]  And your media saying the protests are mostly peaceful because guess what they said the same thing about syria
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:03.120]  You know at the start in 2011 work when cops were getting, uh, their heads cut off
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:08.480]  As as well in 2012 and getting hit with his swords and killed
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:15.600]  It was mostly peaceful protests. Um, so it's this exact same thing that i'm seeing
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:24.640]  Um, and they're playing off both sides and they're creating a destruction. There's looting in syria. We had looting. Not only did they loot like, uh
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:30.240]  Companies and cars and and dealerships. They looted, uh
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:35.360]  Factories and the equipment that makes the products not just the products
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:41.840]  But the actual infrastructure of the factories were looted and sold to turkey in order to buy guns
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:49.200]  And they looted like priceless thousands of year old artifacts like the torah the 2000 year old torah scroll
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:55.600]  And you know things from syria's history antiquities. They're ending up in museums around the world
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.560]  Um, they looted that so I can see that with the united states
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:06.480]  There is an attack on the culture and the history of an identity
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:12.240]  Of the united states in the same way that there was such an attack on syria and I I don't think
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:14.640]  Especially I want to get into antifa
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:19.520]  Antifa have been supportive of the Kurdish groups in the northeast syria
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:23.680]  And now the Kurdish groups you guys have to understand are antifa as well
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:30.560]  The pkk the ypg the stf and trump himself said he doesn't really like the Kurds that much because he knows
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:35.040]  That they are they have shared the same ideology as antifa
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:42.560]  They all follow a man called marie bookchin. This is very important. You have to look this up. It's a book called the
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:45.440]  the
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:52.080]  The ecology of freedom. This is what this book is called and that is the book by which these anarcho marxists
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:55.680]  The the ideology which they follow
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:00.000]  And that is the ideology that built the chas autonomous zone
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.840]  And it's the same ideology that's building the autonomous zone in northeast syria
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:09.280]  Now we've had actually american and british antifa
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:15.920]  Come to syria to fight alongside the Kurds to build this sure their international communist revolution
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:21.360]  Brigades and they brag about it the radio listeners. We've been showing everything you've said stay there back in 60 seconds
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:23.520]  So you'll continue to have the floor
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:29.840]  Lay out the history of this and then how we defeat it here in the united states with syrian girl from australia
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:34.480]  We'll be back on the other side. Please remember our website start news wars dot com info wars dot com
[1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:38.320]  And band off video but band off video is banned on twitter places to share
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:44.480]  So go to 2020 elections center dot com 2020 elections center dot com and you can share those links. We'll be right back
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:52.960]  The new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government
[1:58:53.440 --> 1:58:56.240]  But world government is only the control grid
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:58.240]  now
[1:58:58.240 --> 1:59:03.920]  Intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:10.720]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:18.560]  That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing god
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:28.480]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation
[1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:30.560]  I know this sounds insane
[1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:36.240]  But if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record. You have been warned
[1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:40.800]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:47.360]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of earth
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.800]  All right, serian girl is our guest. I'm not one to challenge your host
[1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:03.760]  She's in australia. She grew up in seria. Her family was part of the ruling party got thrown out by Assad
[2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:10.080]  She doesn't support Assad that she was against the islamist. This group's working with the globals of al-qaeda taking the country over everything
[2:00:10.080 --> 2:00:17.040]  She exposed the false flags all of it got documented. She's one of the most accurate people we've ever had on the last six seven eight years now
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:24.480]  But she's getting into color revolutions and who funds them and what they're doing and how the media is behind it
[2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:27.840]  All the big powerful corporations is this is the establishment
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:30.960]  And and something's always worse after they take over
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:36.160]  And they're about destroying cultures and nation states and and and vibrant independent groups
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:42.560]  And they'll bring in refugee groups that they then manage as a client state so they can have their agenda
[2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:47.040]  Be covered up because they supposedly represent the Kurds or the black people or whatever
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:50.800]  But all of it is a catchpaw all of it is upon all of it is a cover
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:56.560]  Like the un saying we love children to give us money to unicef when they're helping starve children to death and kill them in mass
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:00.880]  It's a formulae and sherry and girl was laying it out beautifully. Please continue
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:09.360]  Sure um now they i'm tifa which of course they should list as a terrorist organization
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:11.840]  um it began its
[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:14.880]  Existence just before world war two in germany
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:19.280]  Um as a the military wing of the communist party there
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.360]  So back then every political party actually had its own militia
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:31.920]  And the militia of the communist party was and tifa and in the beginning they were very pro-soviet union
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:36.400]  But because of some kind of internal politics, they turned into
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:42.800]  Trotsky got kicked out because he was exterminating everybody and then that's the natural Nancy became along very sophisticated, you know that
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:46.720]  Yes, so initially they were pro-trotsky
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:51.040]  And a lot of them a lot of antifar still trotskyists to this day
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:53.840]  And of course, but you're also the neocons
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:02:01.120]  Uh, the the trotsky the the trotskyists are probably um, I'm going to say the second
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:03.840]  Worst because the first would be the anarcho
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:08.960]  uh communists, I think the follow marie bookchin. Um, so this
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:12.880]  after the trotsky thing happened, uh, the
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:16.800]  Antifa ideology morphed not so much into
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:26.960]  uh, just pure communism, but anarcho communism or anarcho syndicalism and uh, they that is why in the chas, you know, they had built these
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:29.440]  uh, little farms like
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  Because of the ecology
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:33.120]  aspect of things
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:38.560]  Um, and they're basically a lot of them if you looked at the chas a lot of them were saying we want another rojo
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:44.640]  Rojava we want a rojava revolution in the united states now rojava is this
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:47.920]  Uh, is supposed a narco communist
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:55.520]  Utopia that they're trying to build in the northeast of syria. This is sold to the united states people as
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:00.320]  The Kurds are finally getting their own territory. This is what biden
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:05.840]  Is going to try to push if he ever gets into power that the Kurds are finally getting their own state
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:11.840]  But really just like ukraine, they want control of the key gas pipeline oil pipeline nexus point
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:17.840]  Precisely and not only that the northeast of syria is actually the bread basket of syria. It contains all the wheat
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:20.320]  so they're actually
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.920]  Uh, the the rojava is being built by the ypg Kurds
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:33.920]  Which are affiliated with the pkk whose leader is ocalan, which is a terrorist under the united states law who follows
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:39.840]  Antifa's marie bookchin ideology. In fact, he was friends with marie bookchin
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:46.560]  With marie bookchin. He was personal friends with him. So that's why it's not, you know, they're also like anyone can be antifa
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:53.200]  Just be antifascist. No antifa is an ideology. They have a flag. They have they want to create a state
[2:03:53.680 --> 2:04:00.560]  They are a militia. It it fits. I mean, you could say the same thing about isis. You can say well anybody can be isis
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:05.280]  You just have to have isis ideology and and blow things up. Yeah. Yeah, exactly
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:11.600]  Anyone can be isis just like anybody can be antifa and it's not okay to use violence against people
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:18.400]  If you happen to disagree with them, uh about about anything including race. So, um, I don't
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:21.840]  Well, that's it. It's basically use the gijo analogy like cobra
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:24.880]  But imagine if cobra had better pr and said we're killing nazis
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:31.040]  Well, when cobra took over your town or kill they go cobra's here to fight hitler. Give us your money and women
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:36.800]  We control your power plants now. Hail cobra. You're nazis if you don't support cobra
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:44.000]  And meanwhile the leader of cobra is an ancient nazi sympathizer george soros. So he pulls his mask off the funny part is
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:46.560]  I'm actually a nazi. Hail cobra
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:54.880]  And I think that's why trump tried to get out of syria. He knows what these groups are he said so himself and you know
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:05:02.880]  You know, if so many words like, oh, you know, they weren't there for us in world war two. They they they're only good fighters
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:08.240]  If we're bombing for them and uh, you know, he said some things about the courage
[2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:10.640]  Which shows that he kind of knows what they're about
[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:17.440]  But he got so much pressure for that that he had to sort of stall the pullout unfortunately
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:23.840]  And I fear that using what Biden himself said in his debate that he's gonna try to
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:29.520]  You know push the same ideological line about those poor Kurds the sympathy for the Kurds
[2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:35.120]  They need their own state. They've been marginalized. The thing that people have to understand is northeast syria is a mixture of
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:42.960]  Like lots of different ethnicities not just Kurds. So and but when it comes to the united states, it's interesting that I saw
[2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:48.400]  Uh, uh in the autonomous zone that they had that they were doing segregation
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:54.400]  They were also trying to segregate people along the lines of race. You know, they had regions where like
[2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:59.200]  Was black only in regions that you know, white people couldn't be
[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.400]  It's madness. It's a real that's a prison model just like the schools
[2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:09.840]  And just like america now where you have the black area the white area the spanish area the asian area
[2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:12.800]  And then you have the leaders at the warden the governor
[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:16.400]  Or the warden or the president under their system
[2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:23.200]  The the mayor is the warden and then they only have bosses. It's a big to burzinski wrote about this in several of his books
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:24.240]  They set this up
[2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:29.280]  There's only a few leaders of each gang and then the groups take under the gang leader because they're fighting the other group
[2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:33.520]  But really the gang leaders meeting once a week with the other gang leaders decide how to control things
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:40.560]  Absolutely, and I I I quite feel quite bad for uh kyle
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:46.800]  Rittenhouse that poor child, you know putting that situation and I don't think it's a good idea to
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:49.440]  Well, basically what they want is to people to fight
[2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:54.720]  So I would say in spite of the fact that it must be hard to watch the country burn
[2:06:55.360 --> 2:07:00.560]  Um, no, I agree. I I think it looks great and as a man. I like fighting back against communists, but
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:05.440]  When you go engage them, it's what they want. What they don't want is a real war where you go after the leadership
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:15.520]  Exactly exactly exactly right. Um, and that's not what's happening. I mean, you know, the so-called
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:24.480]  Antisabi alam the protest movement that uh, they think a lot of them don't think that they're backing biden and harris
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:27.280]  They think that they're fighting the establishment
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:31.760]  Yeah, they don't even know that 90 of the donations they get go to the democrats the democrats run them
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:40.080]  They don't see that they're not actually they haven't actually provided an alternative and therefore since
[2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:42.640]  The media controls the narrative
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:46.720]  It's going to end up just backing biden and harris. So they're not really
[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:50.480]  Fighting the establishment as much as they would like to think that they are
[2:07:50.880 --> 2:07:54.880]  Um, it's not going to go anywhere. You could I could see that from the beginning
[2:07:54.880 --> 2:08:01.040]  And these things again, like I said last time, you know last election after the election was over
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:06.960]  Somehow black lives didn't matter anymore. You know some somehow we weren't talking about it anymore. Um, so
[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:10.880]  I don't I don't think that uh, unfortunately
[2:08:11.360 --> 2:08:17.360]  They you they cannot say that they are fighting the establishment because they haven't even really identified it
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:23.600]  I mean, it's not just trump. You know, that's that's what they want to make it out like trump versus the protesters
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:31.360]  It's harris was uh, the prosecutor, you know, biden was one of the people that, uh, put all these
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:34.320]  stringent police
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:36.400]  powers in when he was
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:38.160]  vice president only
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:39.280]  like
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:45.360]  Sorry, no the vice president. I forget exactly what he was but not he was a u.s. Senator when he put in minimum sentencing for black people
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.960]  Uh, and you know, it's and he doesn't apologize about it. But here here's the deal
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:53.040]  They thought they could beat trump. So that's why they kind of got out of his way up front
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:57.280]  Then they lost and they thought well, we'll have a cover color revolution on his back now
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:03.040]  That's failing they're getting more and more desperate and as trump just pulls them out as chai con globalist agents
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:04.080]  It's over for them
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:09.120]  But he's got to get even more hardcore and just lay out who the real players are because that's the truth
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:14.320]  And if americans are faced with the end of their country the end of the dollar the end of our success and enslavement
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:18.080]  You know versus freedom and justice they need to go that way. But then
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:22.080]  We can't have an armless despair in this political war
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:27.840]  We have to then root out the democrats because they're a globalist force that don't believe the country should even exist
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:29.840]  They want
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:34.160]  To destroy us. They want to dominate us. We don't want to destroy them. We don't want to dominate them
[2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:36.160]  They're doing it to us. They started it
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:42.000]  So we have to have the outlaw of the democratic party and the eradication of it politically and we have a new second party
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:45.440]  We have a new second party. I'm serious folks. That's what we've come down to right back
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:52.640]  Like out long the nazis it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your gps
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:58.960]  Location I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:05.120]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and androids
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:08.240]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:12.400]  Where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:16.160]  Share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:19.920]  Including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:24.000]  Just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:31.760]  Transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:36.800]  Surveillance scores based on information. This is the global chinese communist social credit score
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:44.800]  Get your protection privacy pockets at info war store.com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks infowarstore.com
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:53.440]  The democrats are just going more and more left many positive about socialism liking it more than capitalism
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:59.360]  Many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical are now mainstream
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:06.720]  The radical left has taken over the democratic party and joe viden is marching in lockstep with them
[2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:13.040]  Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle-class families with trillions in new taxes
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:20.160]  If you elect me your taxes are going to be raised not cut promising amnesty and health care for 11 million illegal immigrants
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:26.000]  Shoulders shift for 11 million undocumented folks promising to shut down energy exploration
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  Killing jobs and hurting america's economy. I guarantee
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:38.480]  We're gonna be a fossil fuel in joe biden's america the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:45.120]  They've already taken over joe biden and the democratic party. Don't let them take over america
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:52.560]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:03.280]  You know
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:04.720]  I'm not into celebrities
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:07.520]  But I got to say I was a little kid watching russell mania
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:11.280]  when he did the whole incredible ballet
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:15.200]  With uh, andre the giant who weighed like 500 pounds
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:17.200]  hulk hogan
[2:12:17.200 --> 2:12:19.200]  hulk hogan called in to the show
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:23.840]  Like eight years ago people said that's hulk hogan. They called up a florida affiliate
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:28.320]  And later I know somebody that knows hulk and he says you were calling alex jones. Oh, yeah. I love alex brother
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:29.360]  It's good guy
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:32.560]  You know like him and I never tried to reach out to get hulk hogan on but we should do that
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:35.520]  In fact darryl like six months ago. I meant to tell the producer
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:38.240]  We ought to really get hulk hogan on because I know he's a big trump supporter
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:44.960]  He's not made a big thing about it. I just looked at info wars.com. Look at this hulk hogan claims his friend received a mail-in ballot
[2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:50.800]  For his dog hulks a very truthful guy. This said it happened. We know dead cats are getting them
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:53.840]  media
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:58.160]  Said trump was engaging in baseless conspiracy theories when he made similar claims
[2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:04.560]  But it's actually true. They're scraping any name in a public database off facebook off twitter off anything
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:08.560]  And so people's dead families
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:10.640]  It's the same address. You're getting a ballot
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:14.080]  Like if you wrote a bituary on facebook our cat spot died
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:20.240]  Five years ago, you're getting them. This is confirmed. I mean, if you're a new listener, I can play the newscast
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:22.240]  But I don't want to take up time from our gas
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:24.240]  uh, but hulk tweeted
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.560]  crazy stuff a friend of mine just got a
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:30.880]  mail-in ballot for his dog nugget now even dogs can vote hulk hogan
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:33.360]  I mean
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:38.880]  Syrian girl, this is crazy. I mean, we've caught the globalist staging chemical attacks staging fake elections
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:40.880]  They backed the air up spring overthrowing
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:45.280]  us allies putting the muslim brotherhood in to blow up hundreds of churches
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:50.400]  I mean, this is crazy and and and they've succeeded everywhere else people go. Oh soros won't succeed here
[2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:53.200]  Well, he sure as hell try and hit me
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:00.960]  I noticed that a church was also burnt during these riots in front of the white house
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:04.560]  So that also reminded me of what happened in Syria
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:11.120]  You know, I just want to make it clear also that just because I think that the riots are
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:15.200]  A color revolution and they're being destructive. They're
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:20.640]  Not helping at all. It doesn't mean that I don't think that there aren't serious issues
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:23.360]  with police brutality
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:29.440]  Like we saw in australia like we see in the united states. I use that as their cover. They use that as their cover
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:35.520]  Yeah, it's just the cover and it's they're not actually going to succeed in changing that with what they're doing
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:37.680]  It's actually probably going to make it worse
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:42.880]  So they are giving them an excuse to behave the way that they are
[2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:48.800]  Well, exactly is they're going to run good cops off and only bring in corrupt thugs who work with the system who'll be totally protected
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:53.840]  Yeah, and as we saw, you know at the beginning of the entire
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:58.160]  Black class matter protests, you know, you had some
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:03.440]  Old men getting shoved and having their head cracked open. I'm not going to
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  Stand here and say that things like that are okay
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:11.600]  But we have to remember that eric garner was choked death under obama
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:18.160]  Uh, you know, uh, the uh, the kid that was shot with a toy gun. He was 12 years old. I forget his name
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:20.880]  Um, he was shot under obama
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:28.640]  So to claim that this thing this issue is a new thing that is happening under trump
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:33.440]  Is a complete and utter lie that democrats are trying to sell
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:37.200]  Well, also, it's mainly democrat cities that do the most extreme training for whatever
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:42.720]  Officers have to instantly react. They are so well trained now. They instinctively shoot
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:46.160]  So they see what looks like a gun. They don't think they shoot their train
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:51.920]  It becomes extinct of maybe that's a little too much. It saves a lot of cops lives. It's a very dangerous job
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.080]  But the instinctive shooting of the shooting simulators is what's doing this
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:16:02.400]  You think your cop wants to shoot innocent person and face murder rap? No, they are in these situations
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:06.160]  I mean a cop gets called because the guy's robbing and trying to rape a woman
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:09.440]  He just in Florida the other day. He comes the guy shoots him in the chest
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.840]  The cop shoots the guy and kills him
[2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:17.920]  They're they're having protests and riots when it's on video that the guy shot the cop. I mean, this is insane
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:21.760]  So that's how much they're paralyzing things
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:25.120]  We're even when the guy's on video shooting the cop. Let's play the video
[2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:28.800]  Let's back it up. We'll play it right now. Go ahead and start it from the beginning. Go ahead
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:31.840]  It may be a lot
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:17:00.100]  I don't have my keys please part
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:24.080]  How would you like that job where you randomly get called because someone's a burglar, assaulting
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:30.160]  a woman, you show up, the guy's black, you're white, he shoots you in the chest, you shoot
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:34.040]  him and kill him, and people say, we don't care, you're still bad. That is crazy, Syrian
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:35.040]  girl.
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:43.560]  They are twisting and obfuscating facts a lot. I think that it's interesting that they
[2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:51.320]  had that story with the, I forget his name now, but the man who was jogging and you know,
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:55.440]  they would sort of give you little tiny bits of information.
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:58.200]  They didn't show you the guy was breaking in houses. They didn't show you they caught
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:02.760]  the cops on him. They didn't show he was like driving up in parks, getting the cops' faces,
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:03.760]  yeah.
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:06.800]  Yeah, so it's clear that they're trying to create something here. They're trying to
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:10.240]  create divisions and they're trying to have people argue over these things.
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:15.240]  If anything, since the media and Obama, you can't get cops to do stuff now, actually.
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:21.320]  They've paralyzed the police. I mean, we certainly can't get them to do anything. I mean, well,
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:27.320]  they can't seem to stop the destruction of businesses and the riots. I think that, you
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:33.640]  know, the police do serve a purpose. You can't have a country without them, unfortunately.
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:42.520]  That's the reality of the world. So, of course, they need to have their training sold, especially
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:43.520]  if they don't stop.
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:47.440]  Well, let's say it. The instinct of shooting saves cops' lives. It gets innocent. People
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:51.560]  killed. But then when you go to the job every day and people are shooting at you, what do
[2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:55.400]  you expect? The world isn't perfect, is my point.
[2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:59.920]  Yeah, absolutely. You're absolutely right. It's not.
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:03.720]  All right. In closing, I want to get you back more often than every six months. Come on
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:07.320]  the nighttime shows, the election countdown that's in the morning in Australia, not the
[2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:11.000]  middle of the night. Come on, David Night Show. We love you. We appreciate you. How

[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:27.720]  Thank you.
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:30.920]  Hey, no, thank you. Join us. Join us whenever you want on the nighttime show, especially
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:34.520]  because I know that's in the morning for you. And that is, of course, the election countdown
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:38.600]  will continue right through until whatever happens till we get shot, shot down, shot
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:42.960]  down. I mean, it's, I'm not giving the enemy any enjoyment here talking about it, but I
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:47.120]  just want to tell listeners we need your prayers, we need your support. And come on, give it
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:50.080]  a family member, tell us you got cancer. They're kind of cool, but I got cancer. Let's go have
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:54.080]  fun. And one day, oh, you know, your uncle's dead. He died of cancer. You go to their funeral.
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:57.560]  And I'm not trying to be dramatic folks. It's just that I'm not a big victim here. I don't
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:02.200]  squeal and squawk. They're tearing the living that's not out of us. They got, they got PIs
[2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.960]  following me. They're suing me up one side down. They're harassing all of our institutions,
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:09.200]  all our suppliers. We need your prayers and support. Syrian Girl, thank you so much. It's
[2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:11.920]  great to know you're out there.
[2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:14.800]  And that's what's great about this though, is there's so many great people like her and
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:20.240]  so many new people like Carlos Zapata coming online and all these other people that I never
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:23.880]  heard of just kicking ass. I feel good. I've done, I carried my mission out. I want to
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:29.840]  continue. I want to continue, but only you'll keep me in the game. And that means you've
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:32.640]  got to go now. I don't know how long we'll be able to take orders folks. I'm just leaving
[2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:36.720]  it at that infowarstore.com. Get your orders in now. Plus you need storeable food. Get
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:45.160]  them in now infowarstore.com. They're at backstage with us coming in studio. The Honorable Rain.
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:50.400]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything. They also bet
[2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:54.880]  because they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will adapt to being a slave.
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:21:00.080]  You will learn incrementally to submit. So think about and remember the phases of the
[2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:05.880]  Fauci fraud. Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie. They lied about
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:10.280]  where it came from. They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:18.280]  exaggerated the death rate at 4%, but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping. Then they
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:22.280]  set the test up to count almost all false positives. They put the names of people that
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:27.000]  died of other diseases in the COVID column. They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.560]  now or six months later. Now they say it's permanent. You got to wear masks forever and
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:34.680]  force inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere you go and what
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:38.840]  you do. The global social credit score and the UN is the boss. Anybody questioning it
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:43.000]  is censored off the internet loses their job. That's called 21st century tyranny. That's
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:48.440]  called world government takeover. Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, the Washington
[2:21:48.440 --> 2:21:52.760]  Post, or Howard Stern, of a blue name and they come out and they attack him full war saying
[2:21:52.760 --> 2:21:59.240]  Jones claims civil war is coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[2:21:59.240 --> 2:22:03.760]  and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food
[2:22:03.760 --> 2:22:08.160]  if they can. And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:14.280]  all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep. This is the corporate planetary
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:19.680]  takeover. So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what

[2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:54.240]  country. The new world order shy com globalist syndicate is making its move to implode the
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:59.520]  dollar and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election. They
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:03.960]  are openly work aiming this at the highest levels of democratic party. Nancy Pelosi and
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:08.680]  others have gone on television and said they will contest the election. Trump is going.
[2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:14.160]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:18.440]  that will be called a racist. They will then trigger race riots and violence. They've already
[2:23:18.440 --> 2:23:24.360]  beta tested around the country. We are not living in normal times. When these type of
[2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:28.640]  things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:33.600]  they're living in such a criminal era. We are. We are living in the period where this
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:38.640]  criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America is being exposed and removed. Now
[2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:42.440]  is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country. Spread the
[2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:47.760]  word now, Paul Revere's.
[2:23:47.760 --> 2:24:13.760]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:32.720]  John Lorraine is with us. She's been doing weeknights here with our destroyers and others
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:39.160]  and knocking it out of the park. I had a feeling that when she got here to our offices, she
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:45.800]  would kick it into the next level and she has. Don't forget, I do a special basically
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.920]  commercial free. We run six minutes ads for local TV and radio stations, but we don't
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:54.480]  have any ads. So there's no network ads and we do the Saturday Live, what we're calling
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:59.960]  it, not Saturday Night Live, Saturday Live, two to 4 p.m. Then I come back with a show
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:05.120]  been doing 16 years in that slide. That's four to 6 p.m. And then we've got the new
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:10.440]  Sunday Live with Owen Shroyer, six to eight right after that. John Lorraine and others
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:16.560]  are hosting the election countdown weeknights seven to nine. And it too only has six minutes
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:21.560]  of breaks a show because there's so much breaking after we're on air, so much happening.
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:24.560]  So I just said to John Lorraine, I said, I want to get you on today about some other
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:28.200]  stuff. But what about this Pelosi thing? You said, Oh, I want to bring that up. Now they
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:33.360]  had a brutal press conference link on m4s.com where they showed that this was not a setup.
[2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:37.160]  She knew it was empty. You know, she knew what she was doing. She knew that it was an
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:42.360]  open facility. And it just shows the hypocrisy of light foot saying, Well, I get a haircut.
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:47.480]  You don't are all these other mayors and people or how Democrats keep their businesses open
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:52.280]  that nobody else can. This is crazy. What do you make of this? Well, it's funny, Alex,
[2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:56.360]  you mentioned that because I haven't even gotten my hair cut professionally or colored
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:00.520]  or anything since March. That's why my hair is looking pretty Aretha Franklin II pretty
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:07.080]  crazy. And you know, I'm I'm a normal American, right? But I'm not allowed to get my hair
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:12.360]  done or my nails done and businesses. The lawns have been closed. They've been shut
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:20.160]  for the last couple months. Why is that? But yet Nancy Pelosi can walk her butt into a salon
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:26.840]  and sneakily get her haircut and died or whatever blown out. And by the way, she wasn't wearing
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:33.480]  a mask either. And I don't care. I want businesses to open. I want salons to open. Okay, because
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:38.200]  all of this is ridiculous. We know that the rate of morbidity is so low now, especially
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:44.400]  even CDC has admitted it. But yet she's calling for all these businesses to remain closed.
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:49.560]  She's the one who's saying that all of us need to stay at home. Businesses and salons
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:53.680]  need to remain closed. And that's the big problem I have with all of this. That's what's
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:59.080]  so disgusting and sinister about all this. And then she had the goal after that to blame
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:04.480]  it on the salon and say that it was a setup. You can't get much more disgusting and sinister
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:08.200]  and hypocritical that to blame it on the salon. Everybody's already seen the videos.
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:12.200]  We won't play. She's like, literally, it's a conspiracy against me when they're all they're
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:18.960]  all going out. They're not wearing masks. De Blasio, Cuomo, Schumer, none of them are
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:23.640]  they all know it's BS, right? Yeah, they all know it's BS because when you catch them
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:27.680]  in private, you're going to find them without a mask. You know, are you really thinking
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:31.120]  that they're going to be wearing a mask 24 seven? And they know as we wake up, they go,
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:36.280]  don't wear it during sex and wear it. You're in Wisconsin. Yes, the Democrats make them
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:39.640]  in the meetings, even though they're at home, wear a mask in the meeting, right in a Zoom
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:45.400]  conference or in a Skype conference. So because they want to set a good example, right? To
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:50.120]  comply. And now, by the way, in an Uber, if you're caught not wearing a mask and this
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:53.760]  speaks to the social credit score that you always talk about in an Uber, if you're not
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:57.040]  if you're caught not wearing a mask one time, then the next time they're going to make you
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:02.080]  take a selfie of yourself with a mask wrapped on to you before you can even it's all an
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:06.480]  active submission ahead of the university's already starting in where it'll be on your
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.040]  phone and you can't leave the campus and attracts you. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I saw our universities
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:14.640]  now have face scanners, which when you come in, they want the doors closed if you're not
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.800]  wearing a mask. Right. Exactly. I mean, talk about this. Hope you like that. Boom. Right.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:25.920]  And we have Bill Clinton to on tape with Eric Garcetti, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, and
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:30.760]  with Bill de Blasio and with Gavin Newsom talking about how we need to test and trace
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:35.440]  and contact everybody. And it's Bill Clinton's company that is behind the. What's wrong
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:39.000]  with that? And then he gets state funding. I thought like the governor of Texas gives
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.680]  it to him through Google. That is the best impression ever. The auto array. Let me ask
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:51.800]  you a question here. I did not. How bad is this going to get? We see, he's the one that's
[2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:59.440]  behind everything. You're a little old for me. I know I am a little bit old. By the
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:05.440]  way, I like your kind of jungle girl here. You like it? It is super Amazon. Austin isn't
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  a shutdown. I gave my wife's number. She'll get you this along. Okay, cool. Yeah. It's
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:11.920]  not that you need it. You've signed up. You're working with us the next six months. I know
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:17.600]  I'm so excited. I'm so excited. Yeah. I'm so excited to be here, guys. And I'm telling
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:23.080]  you why too. Because you can't go anywhere else and actually speak the truth without
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:27.320]  getting censored or banned. And I actually had a struggle before I started working with
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:32.000]  info wars. I couldn't find articles anywhere. I would think, okay, where can I find? Where
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:37.200]  can I find articles on the CDC and the low death rates? Where can I find articles? The
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:42.720]  truth about mass or hydroxychloroquine. And guess what? Within a minute of trying to find
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:47.000]  it, everything was vanished from big tech, from Google and everything. But info wars
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  always had the information. Info wars always had the articles. So I think why not be at
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  the front lines of this fight with someone who is the general of the fight? And you
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:59.320]  are putting yourself on the target. Most men are scared to do that, but we're really proud
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:03.720]  of you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I hope that I probably have more balls than
[2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:07.960]  a lot of these liberal men, but you are the general of this war. You are the general.
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:10.400]  I don't want to be the general. I'm glad. I mean, tell you do a better job than I will
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:14.000]  put you in charge. I don't know about that. I'll go play golf, which I used to play. I
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.880]  played 20 years. I used to play golf. Oh my God. I'll go play golf a little. You can
[2:30:16.880 --> 2:30:21.680]  host a show. No, I don't know. Young Swipper nappers do it. Swipper nappers. That might
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:26.360]  be too much a responsibility, but I'll try. You know, I could be a quite the warrior S.
[2:30:26.360 --> 2:30:30.200]  It was funny that it was one of my child custody battles. I love my ex wife. She's such a sweet
[2:30:30.200 --> 2:30:34.480]  person, but she didn't make the false statement that I told my daughters. They could never
[2:30:34.480 --> 2:30:38.880]  be professionals. Oh my God. My daughters are astronauts if they want to be. That's
[2:30:38.880 --> 2:30:42.680]  the funniest thing about her because you've always, you seem like you're very empowering
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:47.400]  to women. Like you want women to be in course and you have daughters. Of course you would
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:51.200]  say you. Of course he would. The media is like Jones believes women should be barefoot
[2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:54.680]  and pregnant. Only when they want to be, you know, right? Well, yeah, they tell me I need
[2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:58.560]  to go back to the kitchen because I don't have, you know, I don't have a brain. So they
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:01.520]  think I need to go back. Well, you got a better brain. I want, I know, I want you in the front
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.800]  lines. Yeah, because the men are refusing. So they say when men won't be men, women have
[2:31:05.800 --> 2:31:11.280]  to step up. That's true. And look, but it's the Marxism that has created this, uh, these
[2:31:11.280 --> 2:31:16.480]  weak men, right? Marxists have created these men who don't know how to fight and don't
[2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:20.200]  have the will to fight anymore. And that's what happens. Well, that's what the Greeks
[2:31:20.200 --> 2:31:23.560]  would say. The Greek women would say, I mean, they're up to your right. Yeah, they would
[2:31:23.560 --> 2:31:27.160]  say to their husbands, you come back with your shields are on them because in a battle,
[2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:29.880]  have you dropped your weapons to rhyme? Now they say, you come back with your shields are
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:33.520]  on them. That's what we need is women demanding men go to the next level and that makes us
[2:31:33.520 --> 2:31:38.080]  all more strong. Right. Exactly. But, but feminism has been very intelligent, you know,
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:41.640]  with brainwashing men to believe that they, you know, that they need to disown the alpha
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:46.240]  male, you know, the alpha male is bad demonizing the alpha male, demonizing the strong man,
[2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:51.840]  demonizing masculinity, but a glorifying the weak little wussy soy boy in the Antifa,
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:55.720]  uh, you know, soldiers, if you call them soldiers. And that's just because the corporate
[2:31:55.720 --> 2:32:00.400]  want to just roll over everybody. Yeah, exactly. And they know that strong men create strong
[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:06.160]  nations and create strong families. Weak men allow, uh, communism to take over. There's
[2:32:06.160 --> 2:32:11.840]  nothing sexier than an empowered, uh, strong woman, but then who also has all the great
[2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:15.320]  feminine aspects of children. That's what we want. Right. I mean, real conservatives
[2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.800]  and nationalists want powerful women. Are you kidding? Right. And what liberals don't
[2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:22.680]  get is I can be in the kitchen. Okay. I can cook. I know how to cook. I'm Italian and
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:26.360]  Spanish, but I also have a brain too. And I can be feisty and I could be strong when
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:31.200]  I need to. And what, what they don't get is that they feel like it has to be one or the
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:33.400]  other. You either have to be feminine and be a,
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:38.040]  They just want some of the corporations control. They want women to the husband to be the state.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:42.040]  Exactly. They want the husband. Well, yes, of course they, they want to put that back
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:47.000]  up. Why don't these women destroy their power? I mean, look at that. They destroy their femininity.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:50.960]  Right. They were so beautiful before. And then feminism happened. Now they're like
[2:32:50.960 --> 2:32:56.760]  like, they do. And feminism really is a cancer. I mean, look at what it does. It infects all
[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:02.040]  these women and it has them disowned their greatest power, which is their femininity.
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:09.480]  Damn right. So that's that. So this is why we need to be at the front lines of the fight
[2:33:09.480 --> 2:33:12.920]  at info wars. And this is why we're here. And we're going to have this new generation
[2:33:12.920 --> 2:33:15.960]  of info warriors that are really excited. And I think there's going to be more women
[2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:19.600]  too that are going to come out and, well, you really came through on the sky when I
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:22.680]  met you in DC. I know about your work for years, but I had a feeling once you got in
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:28.320]  a big studio, you were going to kick ass. And this is like, I like having you here. I'm
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:34.440]  excited. Good. I hope I've delivered Alex. Delivering the good. Woohoo. So much fun
[2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:38.240]  the next six months. I love it. Yeah. Just keep us on air, folks, because they are scared
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:44.000]  of us. So they are bombing a little hell out of us. We'll be right back with more analysis.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:49.880]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert. As of taping this alert, you're 82 days out
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:54.640]  from the election. As many of you know, in the last year, I pointed out statements out
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:58.680]  of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:05.040]  to win in a landslide. So their strategy will be to contest the election. If they fail to
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:10.200]  successfully steal it, then they are openly now wargaming. This is in the New York Times
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:15.240]  having Democrat states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:21.240]  policies and coronavirus and kept their areas locked down. That is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:25.000]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in DC. They
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:31.880]  said in another city, Pelosi has said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris, ladies
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:37.680]  and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war. This is their public criminal plan. We
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:41.240]  should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won the
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:48.840]  offense to expose this criminal activity. There's a nauseating sense to it. Not a sense
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:58.440]  of triumph, not a sense of victory, not a sense of completion, the sense of sixth nausea.
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:04.280]  Though we were right about the world government, we were right about the anti-human plans,
[2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:10.360]  we were right about all the horrible things, the globalists, and their satanic order wanted
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:17.080]  to do to us. Now we sit here, warning people for decades, trying to get people ready, trying
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:22.680]  to stop what was coming. But you know what? Revelations in God's words says it's coming
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:27.240]  so you can't stop it. And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger plan than
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:33.720]  He. Come to the point in our own psyche, in our own spirit, in our own will that we submit
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:39.720]  to God and realize God's in charge of God as a power. And the devil is set as a tester.
[2:35:39.720 --> 2:35:44.720]  And now it's up to us to make the right decision. That's what it's really always been about.
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:49.760]  I'm not going to lie to you. I want to stay in the fight against sorrows of Hillary and
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:55.960]  the New World Order. And the only way I do is if you buy a lot of products, then FullWarsHore.com.

[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:38.000]  Your support of info wars has stood the defiance of George Soros, the globalist Hillary and
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:48.720]  all these comebacks. So great job. You built what we've done. I salute you.
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:38:06.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:13.560]  You know, you can wink. More stuff happens in a day than in a year. They've announced
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:17.360]  FEMA camps run by the Democrats. A lot of people up that they are suspected to have
[2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:24.120]  covered in Ohio. They are Zuckerberg says the red mirage, Trump will appear to win,
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:29.160]  but Trump's not allowed to say he's the winner. That'll be blocked. And now he's got a ban
[2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:32.840]  Republican ads on Facebook, which we knew was coming. I mean, they're getting desperate.
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:37.760]  What are they going to do next? I don't know. But today it's it's disgusting
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:43.600]  because they say that the Russians were meddling in the election, right? And that or that Trump
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:47.920]  is meddling in the election. Isn't this the biggest election meddling ever? I mean, this
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:52.880]  is clear cut election meddling. How is it not? I agree. Have you heard the latest ABC
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.600]  News two days ago came out and said in US intelligence suppressed evidence of Russians
[2:38:57.600 --> 2:39:01.760]  saying Biden has cognitive problems because US intelligence said there was no evidence
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:05.680]  when the Democrats brought it forward. Right. I mean, you can look at him. He can't talk
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:10.000]  that the Russians told you that. Do you know that, folks? He looks like like, wait, you
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:14.080]  have a blue shirt. The Russians told me that, but you do have a blue shirt. Yeah, I know, right?
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.360]  And it's not like Russians, you know, ordered people to walk into the booth in 2016 and vote
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:24.400]  for Donald Trump. I mean, that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard. But this is,
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:30.560]  you know, this is the give me liberty or give me death theme of the week, right? Over and over,
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:35.520]  we're seeing how our liberties are being taken away. COVID is the cover for everything.
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:40.800]  But the election is the main reason why. But even scarier is that people say that, oh, all of this
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:44.640]  is just going to stop at the election. It's not going to stop at the election. This isn't the end
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:49.840]  game. The election is just a pit stop for the for the Marxist left, right? Just the first pit
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:54.240]  stop. Oh, they're making their move. This is full on global commie revolution. Right. It's a full
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:40:00.400]  on comic comic global revolution. They want us in masks. They want us. I think Fauci is talking
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:06.640]  about next, you know, goggles and gloves and even headcarves, scarves. I can see very clearly what
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:09.520]  they're going to do next. They're going to say, well, now we're going to normalize, you know,
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:14.640]  head coverings, right? Because, you know, your hair is unsanitary. Your hair is dirty. You're
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:19.200]  dirty. You're bad. You're dirty. You're bad. Filthy. I see three year olds walking around with
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:24.800]  masks now in the airport, you know, by the way, in the airport, you know, I got banned from Delta.
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:28.880]  So that was number one. I'm a naughty girl because I'm banned from Delta. When you were asleep,
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:33.600]  your mask, your Sharia, your burka slipped down. Yeah, my burka slipped down. So guess what?
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:37.760]  With it. So four days later, when I was flying on a different airline, I think they might have
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:44.480]  changed this because of me. I don't know. But now it's I was walking in with that same Trump mask,
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:49.200]  and they stopped me and said, Oh, no, you're not allowed to have that kind of mask, no bandana,
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:54.720]  no kind of mask like that. You have to have an approved mask. So I had a buy for $3,
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:01.360]  their own approved mask. Okay. So in order to board the flight, that was number one, the first
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:05.600]  change, the second change they did, which I wonder if it was because of me, they now on the loud
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:10.160]  speakers say, we're going to walk around. We don't have any drink service. We don't have any food
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:13.680]  service in our plane. So we're just going to be walking around every few minutes to make sure
[2:41:13.680 --> 2:41:19.840]  that your mask is worn correctly and in place. So their job is keeping you as prisoners. Yes.
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:24.080]  So it's not enough to wear a mask, which is dehumanizing enough, remember, and it's humiliating
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:29.600]  enough. But now you have to wear an approved mask. And now it has to be in place and in the correct
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:33.440]  place the whole time we're riding the plane. Well, I predicted months ago they were going to do that.
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  This is all. Yeah. And oh, yeah, look at that. Stozy, right? What was her? What was the deal
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:43.360]  with her guitar? Didn't it look like she was trying to use that as a weapon? Like she was all too
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.200]  happy to kind of like spear me with this. Well, that's what the four turners seems are is they
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:53.600]  use low level people as their miners. Right. And guess what? These waitresses on airplanes,
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:41:58.240]  aka flight stewardess, they don't have any drinks anymore. They don't have any food anymore to do.
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.160]  They have nothing to do now except for police. They've become that that's their only job now
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:07.760]  are little Stozy's to write up reports and to and to ground you or ban you for the global
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:12.400]  social credit score, which is now here. Exactly. And same with now ubers, you know, now people
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:16.800]  are marking you as one star. If you're an Uber passenger, if you didn't comply correctly,
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:22.640]  it's all it, you know, it's all just about compliance. And even there was an IQ test last
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:28.000]  week, a new study out that says that people who don't comply with shutdown orders and mass
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.880]  and social distancing, they're less intelligent than people who do comply. And then another one
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:38.720]  saying women love mass. Oh, yeah, women. They're saying that mass are sexy, according to women.
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:42.720]  What kind of women are you that you think a mask is sexy? I'm sorry. I think a mask looks like a
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:47.760]  cuck. It looks like you're strangled and you're suffocated. Well, I mean, obviously these studies
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:51.520]  are all bogus. Right. Well, the studies are done. Why do you think the real studies are coming out,
[2:42:51.520 --> 2:42:58.640]  which we already knew that it's nine out of 10 tests are false positive. Only 9,000 something
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:03.920]  died on 180,000. This is crazy. That's huge. And we all we all know this, but of course,
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:07.600]  they're quietly rolling that out, you know, and not making a big deal. I mean, that should be
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:14.000]  wall to wall covers that guess what, you know, only 9,000 of the 180,000 deaths that we keep
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:19.520]  touting every day are actually solely and specifically dead from Corona virus. And even
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:23.280]  that, I think that is pretty inflated. Why do you think even mainstream media is having to
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:27.360]  admit the truth now? I think because everybody already knows it. So just stay relevant. They're
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:32.560]  doing it. I think so. I think they're starting to walk back a little bit, you know, and I think
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:37.280]  they're trying to kind of cover their ass a little bit. But, but they're, you know, sadly,
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:40.720]  there's enough people that go right along with it. You know, there's enough of the,
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:45.600]  the, the useful idiots and sheeple that are just carrying the. Who are these people that
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:50.560]  get off on following BS? Like anybody with half a brain now knows this is a fraud. Why are they
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:53.600]  so into it? I guess they've already committed to it. They don't admit they're wrong. I think
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:56.480]  they don't want to admit they're wrong. I think they don't want to admit they're wrong. I think
[2:43:56.480 --> 2:43:59.600]  they, I think they think that if they admit they're wrong, they're somehow bad and they're
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:04.880]  going to double down and triple down because they have their leaders, their gods like Nancy Pelosi
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:10.960]  and Bill Blasio saying that the virus is super serious. So serious. We need to give ankle monitoring
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:15.920]  bracelets around you. If you get enter or exit New York city or things like that, you know,
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:20.880]  in the Bahamas and the Caribbean, apparently, if you go there, you have to have a two week long
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:26.560]  mandatory quarantine with an ankle monitoring bracelet around you. I mean, that's house arrest.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:32.080]  And in Australia, same thing, you know, do people not think that that's going to be widespread if
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:37.360]  we don't push back? You know, what are we thinking? They think the slippery slope situation is wrong.
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:41.360]  Oh, you know, you why do you believe in a slippery slope? That's a conspiracy theory.
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:46.240]  It's not the U.N. came out and said America's bad. It has guns. Take the guns this week.
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:49.920]  The U.N. is saying get rid of our police. The U.N. is saying open your borders.
[2:44:49.920 --> 2:44:54.160]  The U.N. is saying follow our COVID rules. You must take the shot. This is global government. It's
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:45:00.960]  here. Yeah, exactly. And so but what police is going to replace the normal place that's going
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:05.920]  to be the U.N. police, right? It's a U.N. You know, they're they're mandated police. It's not
[2:45:05.920 --> 2:45:10.240]  like there's just going to be no police. Aren't they going to bring in a certain type of police
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:14.000]  that they control? That's what it means. Yeah, exactly. The U.N. is a show up in blue helmets.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:17.680]  They can take your police over and now you're there. They're in your little uniform. Right.
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:22.320]  That's what it's takeovers like. Yeah, exactly. So the good old boys, I ever see a blue helmet.
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:28.560]  Well, they're here, brother. Mm hmm. And when people say, Oh, the vaccines aren't that dangerous,
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:34.080]  you know, they're they're not really understanding that, you know, a nano chip inside you or,
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:40.000]  you know, hydrogel or something. That's, you know, changing your DNA structure is actually
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:43.840]  kind of a big deal. They don't even know what they're doing. They're mass experimenting on us.
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:47.760]  They admit it. Mm hmm. Yeah, they're mass experimenting. I didn't sound to be a guinea pig
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:52.320]  for your made up crap. No, no, I didn't at all. And then they're skipping, by the way, the guinea
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:56.320]  pig trials, aren't they? Like there aren't any skipping animals are going directly to us. Now,
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:46:00.880]  I'm an animal advocate. But in this case, you know, in these cases, I think that well, here's the
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:05.200]  deal. They're doing whatever they want right now. It was already decided. Right. And I think animals
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:08.960]  in this, you know, they should take one for the team, because I don't want to be a human guinea
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:12.880]  pig. The problem is, is that the last test of this coronavirus vaccine, it killed all the
[2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:17.920]  ferrets killed all of them. It killed all the ferrets, all ferrets, all the ferrets. Wow.
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:21.280]  And Bill Gates started been doing tests on this for about 10 years. Right. They've already got
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:24.800]  the vaccine ready. Yeah. Well, they said it'll be two years. I said, well, it'll be the fall. Now
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:28.880]  they're like, yeah, it'll be fine. Yeah. And we're not predicting. We know what they're going to do.
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:34.560]  Right. Exactly. I'd love to say, oh my God, Alex Jones is a super genius, 500 IQ. No folks,
[2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:39.280]  I'm smart enough to read their white papers because they keep coming through. Yes. And they have
[2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:43.360]  legal jurisdiction at this point, right? To remove children from their families and to remove
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:48.160]  people from quarantine or to mandatory claiming they have the power that they really don't in
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:52.960]  the US, but in Australia and Europe, they're doing it. And it's, it's totally, there's no pushback,
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:57.120]  right? No, which didn't normalizes it. But then the contact tracers are run by the Clintons.
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:00.880]  Yeah, exactly. It's the Clinton. I forget what, what's the company name specifically,
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:05.200]  but it is the Clinton run global, global, that Clinton global initiative,
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:12.320]  global, global initiative. And mouthful. Yeah. So you should look at the Bill Clinton contact
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:17.920]  tracing. I did a video strung together of these clips and it's creepy. You know, we have Bill
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:22.320]  Clinton saying there and he's rubbing his hands together talking about it. It's gonna be great.
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:28.480]  We got a million people ready. Oh, but what he's, he's happy about is each state, they get contracts
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:33.120]  like the governor of Texas gave like 400 million or look it up or something like that.
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:40.000]  Yeah. To Google to do this. So is the end game. So, so why Clinton is rubbing his hands together,
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.240]  why they're so excited for the contact tracing? Obviously it's to track and trace all of us,
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:49.440]  but another nefarious goal. Do you think it is like basically to have legal kidnapping?
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:53.920]  That's it. That's it. It's a medical ID. It's a global ID. They control it.

[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:40.160]  Going back more than 20 years ago, I coined the term the false left right paradigm
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:45.200]  from reading the books by Carol Quigley speaking to Brzezinski and others how they described
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:54.400]  powerful institutions and foundations, successful takeover of the left parties and right parties
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:58.880]  in Europe and the United States. It didn't mean that those parties didn't have differences before.
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:03.600]  They were able to get control the leadership of both and manipulate the public with the illusion
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:09.440]  of change and the illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something. With Trump and
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:14.080]  with our populist movement taking over the Republicans, this is a real populist movement.
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:18.240]  Doesn't mean it's perfect and you know it's real because the Democrats, the power structure,
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.920]  the China comms and the entire old Republican leadership have all endorsed Joe Biden. That's
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:28.800]  why I'm supporting Trump. It's about Americanism, not globalism. It's about ending the one-sided
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:32.320]  trade deals, it's about defending our borders, it's about defending the right to second amendment
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.480]  and pro-life and Trump's doing all of that.
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:40.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:56.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:03.600]  Today I want to talk about the astonishing revelations that have come out in the last,
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:09.520]  well, two years, three years really if you think about the Nexium stuff, but you know Hollywood
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:17.120]  has really undergone a total revealing of its dark underbelly. I wrote two books on this topic
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:23.440]  about four years ago and I covered a lot of this material before it came out so it's exciting in a
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:29.760]  good way to see all the stuff coming out and being exposed. If you remember the striking thing that
[2:51:31.200 --> 2:51:34.880]  came to the fore with the Nexium cult was that it was immediately connected to elite
[2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:42.000]  billionaire families. You've got this smallville television show that was very popular maybe a
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:48.640]  decade ago and then come to find out 10 years later, the producer, all these people, Keith
[2:51:48.640 --> 2:51:53.840]  Renier, they're running this trafficking cult that's connected all over the globe. It has a pyramid
[2:51:53.840 --> 2:52:00.480]  scheme element to it. It's got all of these layers and all these concentric rings and at the same
[2:52:00.480 --> 2:52:05.040]  time they're branding women. They're trafficking and branding women, all the kind of stuff that
[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:10.640]  actually comes to the fore in the tales that we read about Satanists like Alistair Crowley.
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:16.640]  Crowley was known to brand his women with the mark of the Whore of Babylon or something of this
[2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:22.960]  matter but what this shows is that there is a kind of satanic occultic underbelly that's been in
[2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:28.240]  Hollywood for a long time. We can go all the way back to the Black Dahlia Avenger case.
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:34.000]  If you think about the Black Dahlia, most people think there's a large consensus that
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:41.200]  George Hodel was involved in the Black Dahlia case due to his associations with famous surrealist
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:48.400]  artists like Man Ray and the sort of satanic Saturnalian imagery that Man Ray's art had with the
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:55.280]  human sacrifice components to it and a lot of people think that because Hodel was involved in
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:53:01.040]  these circles and these ritual murders that it also connected beyond Hodel if you read his son's
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:07.200]  book, Steve Hodel as a book Black Dahlia Avenger. He cites that there were directors like John
[2:53:07.200 --> 2:53:10.720]  Houston that were running around in these circles as well. I'm not saying necessarily that means John
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:16.320]  Houston was involved. It's just that you'll notice that a lot of times the people that take the fall
[2:53:16.320 --> 2:53:23.680]  or are accused of the event are really the patsies or the underlings for the people who are really
[2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:31.520]  doing the high level stuff and in this situation, you've got directors who work directly with the
[2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:38.800]  OSS. I think if I recall, John Houston did work with screenwriters who had served in the OSS.
[2:53:38.800 --> 2:53:44.960]  Other famous Hollywood directors like John Ford spent a lot of years in the OSS and that's relevant
[2:53:44.960 --> 2:53:54.480]  because a lot of the intelligence assets from the OSS period went directly into not just Hollywood
[2:53:54.480 --> 2:54:02.080]  but also things like advertising. They went into consulting, Lipman, these characters, Paley, Sarnoff,
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:07.360]  the founders of the major networks came out of the OSS intelligence apparatus as did a lot of
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:11.440]  these people who went into Hollywood. There's a great book that actually covers this really in
[2:54:11.440 --> 2:54:17.280]  depth by Dave McGowan called Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon where he looks not so much at the
[2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:21.760]  Hollywood side. That's what my book does is kind of look at that side. Dave's book looks at the
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:28.400]  music industry side, how a lot of these figures in the counterculture scene were directly from
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:34.240]  high level military intelligence families. A lot of people don't know that Jim Morrison's dad,
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:40.240]  Admiral Morrison, was actually involved in the Gulf of Tonkin event. He was breaking on through
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:46.960]  to the other side way before Jim was and so a lot of people think that it's reasoned in Dave's
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:54.160]  books that is that maybe Jim Morrison wasn't as much of a counterculture rebel as we tend to think.
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:55:00.160]  Maybe Jim was actually put in that position due to the high level connections that his family had
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:06.080]  and the same goes for a lot of the movers and shakers in the Laurel Canyon scene that they seem
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:11.760]  to have these high level military intelligence families in their background. That also again
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:17.040]  connects to the cults that Dave covers and so when we come back hopefully we'll be able to connect
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:26.080]  our hot, hot, hot, hot comedian Sam Tripoli. They said, Daria said don't cuss but let me tell you
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:30.720]  some. Sam's face itself is almost a cuss word. He's like an incarnate cuss word so I'm going to
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:42.000]  try my hardest not to cuss when we talk to Sam Tripoli of the Temple Hat podcast after this break.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:54.720]  You hear that? That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:55:54.720 --> 2:56:01.440]  coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:07.280]  and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society. They're outlawing people being
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:12.480]  able to get colds or the flu. They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:18.080]  place. They're not even promising to have a cure to it all. They're just inflicting new phobias
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:24.240]  on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:32.880]  change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft. It's a final frontier. It's the year 2020.
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:55.680]  It's not coming. It's here and submission is blood in the water.
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:01.680]  And we have one of the hottest, if not the hottest man in all of LA, probably the hottest.
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:07.120]  The internet has voted him hottest probably of all time ever. Mr. Sam Tripoli, what's up, Sam?
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:12.240]  Mr. Dyer, how are you, brother? Good to see you. Good to see you. How are you?
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:18.560]  Look, there's nobody better, I think, to cover this because I've been listening to your podcast
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.800]  the last couple of years and you have hit on some information, some really hype shows about
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:30.160]  Hollywood Colts, the pedo angle and all this stuff that I had never seen anywhere else.
[2:57:30.160 --> 2:57:34.240]  I think you did a show that really caught my attention maybe a couple years ago that wasn't
[2:57:34.240 --> 2:57:38.080]  necessarily about Hollywood, but it was something to do with like Catholic universities or schools
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:43.040]  and like a Catholic society that was involved in the pedo stuff. But you have really been
[2:57:43.040 --> 2:57:48.240]  deep into this. You're in the LA Hollywood scene. You kind of know how things work there.
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:52.240]  Tell us about some of the deep research that you've come across.
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:59.520]  Well, you know, to be honest with you, I've been very blessed to have some great researchers
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:05.600]  come on the show and have really enlightened me on some stuff. In particular, you know,
[2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:12.080]  most of the Ivy League schools and their involvement in the opium trade wars and how
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:19.360]  basically every Ivy League school was founded by an opium family that ran opium dealing all over
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:25.760]  the world. From there, you get a skull and crossbones and how they were basically
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:33.680]  skull and crossbones was founded by the Russell family, I believe it is. And that's just a way
[2:58:33.680 --> 2:58:40.720]  for them to, in fact, give their kids a heads up. And once you get into that skull and crossbones,
[2:58:40.720 --> 2:58:46.080]  you start looking into things called the Boulay. And that's where like a guy who's been on info
[2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:54.160]  wars, Bishop Larry Gators came on and really broke down what the Boulay is. And it's a super
[2:58:54.160 --> 2:59:01.200]  deep man and how the Boulay are there. They can't join the skull and crossbones at the highest
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:06.960]  levels. They're there to protect the table and how how crazy that whole is, the whole thing is.
[2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:13.520]  And when you see what's going on with the NBA right now, hip hop, and sadly, a lot of black
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:18.400]  culture. Yeah, you see all this occult stuff going on in there. I mean, like I grew up with
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:23.360]  rock and roll and, you know, you talk about Satanism and all that stuff, like people get weird
[2:59:23.360 --> 2:59:29.680]  satanic panic. But man, if you look what's going on, hip hop was just happening in these on MTV at
[2:59:29.680 --> 2:59:36.720]  the VMAs. It's kind of crazy, dude. I know you had to see the VMAs. It sucks when we're in this
[2:59:36.720 --> 2:59:41.040]  industry, buddy, we got to watch this stuff that we don't like just so we can talk about it. But
[2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:45.920]  man, I mean, it's just like, especially when they showed on all the Viacom channels,
[2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:51.280]  like Nickelodeon, it's crazy, right? Yeah, I like that you started out with that,
[2:59:51.280 --> 2:59:57.280]  that skull and bone stuff, because the skull and bones is where the OSS will come to be formed,
[2:59:57.280 --> 3:00:03.120]  right? And the OSS actually took over the old French opium networks of where the French
[3:00:03.120 --> 3:00:08.880]  intelligence agencies would traffic the opium. The OSS took that over. And so the whole origin
[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:12.480]  of the intelligence agency, a lot of people don't know this is actually the drug trade. So I'm glad
[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:16.960]  that you hit on that. And what is the drug trade? It's the black market, right? It's stuff that's
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:22.000]  not legal, but has to be done on the side, on the down low. And if you read people like Brzezinski,
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:27.520]  they talk about the fact that the elite have to also control not just the normal open markets,
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:32.880]  but also the black markets. So hence the CIA, OSS, they've always been involved in those black
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:37.440]  markets, running and controlling, making deals with those groups, the mafia as well. In fact,
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:43.600]  there's a great book just on this, the CIA mafia link by Charles Ashman, if anybody's interested
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:47.680]  in that topic, but that ties into a question I want to ask you about. Had you heard this crazy
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:52.880]  story? Can I just say one quick thing, Jay? One quick thing about what you just brought up
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:59.920]  is like if you actually take a look at the CIA and the mafia, you know, the CIA, as we know,
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:07.120]  was basically founded by Nazis and the Nazi relationship with the Vatican. Okay. And if you
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:12.960]  take a look at all these mafia family, all this organized crime in Europe, Latin America,
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:20.000]  and North America, the Italians, the Latins, the Irish, all these groups meant they are, hey,
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:27.280]  they have a very heavy Catholic background. So it's, it's almost like the Vatican and my whole
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:34.000]  theory is Jesuits, they're playing both sides of the ball. They are both the law, the order and
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:39.680]  the dark side or the black markets like you were mentioning. So I think I like that was a bit, you
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:44.960]  know, I Jordan Peterson on and he kind of broke that down for me. And I was like, wow, you're 100%
[3:01:44.960 --> 3:01:50.160]  correct. Yeah. In fact, I'm glad you mentioned that because that a lot of people don't think that
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:55.760]  that ties into Hollywood, but it does. In fact, I for a long time was duped by this. I thought
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:00.000]  that while the Jesuits aren't really that high level, then I came across a great book by and
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:05.200]  he's actually a traditional Catholic himself. He did this big huge expose of the Jesuits,
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:10.160]  John Courtney Murray Time Life Magazine and the American Proposition. And what this book discusses
[3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:16.480]  in like 800 footnotes is the fact that the CIA co-opted the Catholic Church. A long time ago,
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:22.160]  that's a big part of why Vatican II happened to make the Catholic Church an engine of American
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:26.720]  power elements, Time Life Magazine, Henry Luce, these people actually came up with a thing called
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:32.000]  the Doctrinal Warfare Program where they would co-opt the Jesuits mainly. It was all John Courtney
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  Murray's one of the most famous Jesuits literally tied at the hip with the CIA. And so you're
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:40.960]  absolutely right, Sam. These guys really are almost near the top of that pyramid. That's why
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:48.720]  the Vatican is so embroiled in this pedo stuff. And, you know, you're getting back to Hollywood
[3:02:48.720 --> 3:02:55.040]  and like what's going on with, let's say, you know, I know it's sports, but the NBA, it is
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:03:00.400]  entertainment and what's going on with the NBA right now and how super political it is.
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:08.000]  To the point, my friend, where it is hurting their bottom line. I mean, next season, there is allegedly
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:14.240]  that the salary cap is going to go down. And, you know, we can apply that also to YouTube and
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:21.200]  Google when they change their algorithms. The, you know, the money that they made went down.
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:25.440]  So what does this mean to me? This is so what I've always said, man, whether it's network
[3:03:25.440 --> 3:03:33.280]  television, NBA, all these sports, they're all like the side chick of these giant rich men,
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:41.360]  these giant rich organizations, and that the real money is in God's. Okay. And, and that is
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:50.320]  gold, oil, drugs, slavery. That's where they make the real money in and everything else is lower
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:58.320]  and expendable. You know, when, when Nike allegedly loses so much money for how political they get
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:04.320]  with the NBA and every and all these sports things, do they change the way they operate? No,
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:09.440]  they just keep going because the more we're fighting over the how political entertainment is,
[3:04:09.440 --> 3:04:14.000]  the less we're taking a look at all these things that you're seeing on the screen right now and
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:21.440]  all the like the manipulation of money markets and slavery, you know, and all that stuff.
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:28.320]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of amazing that you could have, for example, one of the most famous cases
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:33.840]  for mind control and this sex slave operation type of thing. If you read the famous Walter
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:37.920]  Bower book, which is, which is really good. I recommend this book, Operation Mind Control.
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:43.120]  There's multiple chapters that deal with the, what was the she was the supermodel of her day
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:49.280]  back in the 50s and 60s, Candy Jones. And Candy Jones was one of the first to be experimented on
[3:04:49.280 --> 3:04:54.800]  with this kind of suppressing and putting the, the information in the alternate personas. And
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:05:00.640]  she, she demonstrated this kind of easily hypnotized propensity and that's why they chose her.
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:04.240]  And so what they would do is they would send her out on the USO tours. So here's a direct
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:09.200]  connection between entertainment supermodels, you know, Zoolander type stuff, right? Like she's a
[3:05:09.200 --> 3:05:15.600]  supermodel who's going out on the USO tour with Bob Hope and these people, right? And she's delivering
[3:05:15.600 --> 3:05:22.000]  these, you know, this information and allegedly also involved in like the sex, sex operations as
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:28.320]  well. So it's just amazing to me that the first instance that we know of this in terms of like
[3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:36.000]  a famous person was a supermodel. Well, you know, there's, there's so much involved with all this,
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:42.080]  you know, I mean, like if we take a look at like, you know, the history of Obama and who his grandfather
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:49.520]  was and whose grandfather was ninth cousins with, it's like, it goes so deep, man. And it's all
[3:05:49.520 --> 3:05:55.200]  meant to be programming and to get us all to go along with a certain narrative and also for us
[3:05:55.200 --> 3:06:01.280]  not to pay attention to what's really going on. Yeah, it makes me think of that clip. I know you've
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:05.360]  seen it, Sam. I think we talked about it last time we did a show. We were talking about Mariah
[3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:09.200]  Kerry and we're talking about Brittany. And it makes me think of that clip. I think it was
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:14.400]  Bob of Wattles is interviewing Whitney and she goes, oh, and she goes into this. She goes into
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:19.280]  this other persona where it's like a kid, right? She's like, oh, you stink. What is that? It doesn't
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:23.600]  make any sense, right? I mean, I think there's evidence as we talked about in that show that
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:28.560]  that this is, this is happening to Brittany. We got a break coming up here. We're talking to Sam
[3:06:28.560 --> 3:06:34.480]  Tripoli. We're getting all the ten full hat, ten full hat podcast. Everybody be sure and follow Sam
[3:06:34.480 --> 3:06:38.240]  over the temple hat. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:44.880]  I'm going to say something right now. It is one of the most important things I've ever said. So
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:51.840]  please listen very, very carefully. Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the
[3:06:51.840 --> 3:06:58.480]  lockdown. They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill O'Millan the Gates. It is
[3:06:58.480 --> 3:07:02.480]  beyond critical. It is life and death for you and your family to understand. I'm not a real
[3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:09.440]  living planet, but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:14.720]  going to end. The United Nations has admitted that. First it's a month, then it's six months,
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:20.000]  then they say, okay, it's two years. They're now saying two years. They're now saying you'll never
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:26.240]  go back to normal. No more gatherings, no more anything, constant force inoculations that they
[3:07:26.240 --> 3:07:32.160]  admit don't even work. And the way they say they work, they change your DNA. This is the
[3:07:32.160 --> 3:07:37.280]  culling of the planet. This is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:42.400]  you're slowly tortured to death and killed. Do you understand? This isn't about me taking credit.
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:46.560]  In fact, it's the opposite. It's about getting you to understand that you have all the power.
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:53.120]  Going back three weeks ago, they had the entire Austin Greenbelt shutdown and they had the spillway
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:59.760]  by Barton Springs shutdown, as well as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years
[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:06.640]  or so. It's a damned up spring. Well, we went down there and we got in the park at different
[3:08:06.640 --> 3:08:11.840]  areas around town in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud.
[3:08:11.840 --> 3:08:16.560]  And now, despite the fact that they still say the parks are closed, you get out to any area.
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:21.200]  You'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using Barton
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:26.720]  Springs there in Austin, Texas. So Bill Gates and the globalists give the orders to the UN. The UN
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:31.840]  gives the orders down through the national health services like our NIH and we all follow it like
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:38.000]  dutiful slaves. Stop complying with your own enslavement. Stop following the orders of these
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  globalist traders. Start being free again. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:09.600]  Jay Dyer together with Sam Tripoli of the Temple Hot Podcast, also the Broken Simulation Podcast.
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:16.400]  And as I was looking back at Dave McGowan's famous book, Weird Scenes of the Canyon, I was
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:22.080]  reminded of the section where he talks about Brian Wilson who, according to Dave McGowan,
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:27.280]  would go into fugue states, would go into alternate personas, presumably from, I guess,
[3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:35.040]  a lot of years of LSD and Beast Boy bombing his mind out on hallucinogens. What's wild is that
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:42.800]  there's a clip of Tim Leary himself saying that if you want to blame the counterculture on anybody,
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:48.000]  he says you can blame the CIA, right? So Tim Leary is working with the CIA. There's ample evidence
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:51.600]  in Dave's book that the Grateful Dead were actually connected to the CIA as well. And this was a big
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:58.800]  distribution test to do the kinds of things that began on individuals being tested with the drugs
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:04.960]  and then to expand it to the whole culture. You know, Sam, we covered Brittany recently.
[3:10:04.960 --> 3:10:09.760]  Don't you think she's a great window into this kind of a thing with free Brittany? You did a
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:16.640]  great show on that. Oh yeah. Well, you know, every time we get the occult killers, I call them back
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:22.720]  together. The listeners, the swarm who listen to my podcast, I call them the swarm, they love it,
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:28.320]  and they come out and bunches to check out the video. And you know, Brittany is a part of this
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:35.360]  Disney Mickey Mouse Club that we've seen just, I mean, how many people have gone through this system
[3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:41.600]  and gotten churned out, you know, and we're finding out right now that her somebody running
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:49.040]  your social media is fast-forwarding her social media. So it seems like she's talking crazy
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:54.000]  and acting crazy. I mean, just think about that. So as you know, Jay, you discovered that I am
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:11:01.600]  somewhat of a local celebrity. I've been in a Brittany Spears video and I played creepy paparazzi.
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:09.440]  And, you know, that was a big, that was a big video for her because, you know, up to that point,
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:15.200]  she'd had a boyfriend who later on we found out was drugging her. And her father, it came in and
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:20.960]  decided to, you know, put a stop to that. But now we're seeing what's going on. Yes, this is it.
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:28.800]  That's the Brittany Spears video. By the way, this was based off a video I made called Fake Heat.
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:34.320]  So if you want to check that out, you'll see it was done by a very, I'm in all of it. One of the
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:39.840]  greatest video directors of all time, Wayne Isham, and his producer, Dana Marshall. And that was a
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:45.120]  big moment because it kind of like her dad came in and saved her. But now we're seeing like what
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:50.640]  seems to be a hostage situation. But why is she Christina Aguilera? And we just thought that
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:55.760]  Bella Thorne talked about it. All the things that go on with these girls who are who are in the Mickey
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:12:01.120]  Mouse Club. And it's like they become these MK Ultra, what they call sex kittens. And they're
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:05.920]  kind of used to put out this whole, I mean, if you look at her earlier stuff on the like Rolling
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:12.320]  Soul magazine, we talked about that, like how crazy that that shoot is and how they talk about
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.200]  her and how her early videos when she was like 14 or 15 years old, how she's portrayed. It's,
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:24.160]  it's really scary and kind of disgusting. Yeah, she even had, I think about 10 years ago,
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:30.160]  one of the brief boyfriends was a military black ops guy who died in an Afghanistan helicopter
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:35.120]  crash. So she seems to have these kind of handler type of figures that move in and out of her life.
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:39.440]  You know, she's reported herself in different interviews as claiming to have
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:44.400]  multiple personalities. So I think that what we see is that there is a definite pattern.
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:49.200]  I'm glad you brought up the Mickey Mouse Club people. This is a constant pattern we see with
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:53.600]  those people. A lot of people don't know as you and I discussed that it's the CIA that actually
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:58.640]  helped Disney get the land to create Disney World. I mean, I think Disney World is like a giant
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.280]  mind control experiment personally. I don't know what you think about it, but it seems to fulfill
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:09.360]  all the checkmarks of like all the, you know, mind control characteristics. I mean, and what do we
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:14.560]  see? We see a little, you follow these pop stars from the time that they're innocent teens and then
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:18.880]  they grow up into, they go through this Madonna, the Madonna innocent to the horror phase, right?
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:25.920]  And that's what takes our youth, our girls, right? In America or the world now, that they also go
[3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:31.600]  along, you grow up with them and transform into this sort of, you know, horror babble on type
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:39.200]  of imagery. Yeah, I mean, we see that right now with Cardi B. I mean, that whole WAP video she
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:45.520]  puts out, like, that's not, I mean, like, I know I'm an older guy, but I mean, I went through NWA,
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:51.920]  Madonna and all the stuff Madonna did. So it's like, it's not like I haven't seen Edgy before.
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:58.880]  That is just lowbrow stupid. And somebody put out the funniest meme on the internet. They said,
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:04.960]  you know, Cardi B writes music for women who don't shower for breeze their panties, you know,
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:10.800]  I thought that was hilarious. And it's just, it's, it's just lowbrow stupid. And even people
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:17.040]  within the industry who make music videos talked about how lazy that is. But that, you know, and
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:23.840]  this is Cardi B who openly talked about how she used to rob men she was on dates with, right?
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:30.720]  And then like we just saw a slew of stories about strippers and prostitutes robbing Johns,
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:37.360]  robbing Johns, and that's what they do. They're there to take young, pressurable minds and give
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:43.920]  them bad advice. The same thing with the Kardashians who are straight up witches, right? They, they,
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:49.360]  they live this dangerous lifestyle by making these dangerous choices that the money that they make
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.640]  can clean up. And then young girls watch it and they think they can make those decisions and it
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.360]  just costs them. And that's kind of where it is. And I have this whole theory that women go through
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:06.240]  stages in terms of who they're attracted to. And whatever stage they get pregnant in is the stage
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:10.320]  they're in for the rest of their life. Okay. So if you get knocked up by a rapper, the only date
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:14.880]  rappers, if you get knocked up by a lead singer in a band, you're only dating guys in lead singers
[3:15:14.880 --> 3:15:20.880]  and bands. So, but that's what they're doing right now, you know. Yeah, that's why it's exciting to
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:25.280]  see, you know, Kanye kind of break free and call out this stuff. Do you remember when the
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:30.080]  Kardashians maybe four or five years ago, they sent out that Christmas card and it had like
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:33.760]  all this occult symbolism and it had like an all seeing eye hidden in the background and their
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.280]  weird Christmas card. I think they're absolutely right. They're totally witches. Oh, and dude,
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:44.640]  everybody they date, they crash and burn. I mean, like they just literally steal their souls
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:50.320]  and they just become empty shells and you know, I mean, I mean, go through the list of pro athletes
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:55.360]  that the Kardashians dated and just tell me how many of them ended up well.
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:05.680]  Not a lot. We see it all the time. Right. Do you remember a lot of these elite, you know,
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:09.600]  they seem to the really, really wealthy types that are always in the Hollywood circles. They
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:14.320]  also seem to get caught up oftentimes in sex cult. Do you remember what happened to Peaches
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:20.080]  Geldorf? Do you remember that story where she got into the Crowley sir? Yeah, so Peaches. Oh, yeah.
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:26.240]  She got all into the Crowley sir of mainstream news and she ends up dead a few years later.
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:31.920]  And why is that? Well, this is out of politico. This is this is a great connector story because
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:36.320]  you remember Anton LeVe. I know it's sort of that's sort of like the pop, you know, satanism stuff.
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:43.200]  But if you remember Anton LeVe was in the circles of Jane Mansfield, right? She was his Hollywood
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.320]  starlet for a while. And then Sammy Davis Jr., famous member of the church satan. Let's not
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:56.880]  forget that as politico reported, there was a famous case of Anton LeVe being connected to a plot
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:04.320]  with the 100% satanic Ted Kennedy. Yep, I got a whole theory on that you want to talk. And
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:10.000]  after the whole break, that satanism is just a bunch of theater dorks who think they're just oh,
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.560]  I'm so dangerous so they can get like goth chicks. And they're just all theater and cosplay guys
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:21.600]  like they go watch Rocky or a picture show every Saturday night because they think that's dangerous.
[3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:27.520]  It's garbage. But there's a higher level Luciferianism, you would agree, right? And I'll get into all that too.
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:29.760]  Yeah, for sure. I have my whole theory on that.
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:35.920]  Well, we'll get into that when we come back from the break with Sam Tripoli of Temple Hat.

[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:34.800]  in defiance of George Soros, the globalist Hillary and all these comebacks. So great job.
[3:20:34.800 --> 3:20:37.200]  You built what we've done. I salute you.
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:45.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:58.560 --> 3:21:03.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? I'm Jay Dar. If you're
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:08.880]  hungry, you get a little bite of that right there. You want a little piece? Are you hungry, Sam?
[3:21:09.600 --> 3:21:13.360]  You look like you've been wanting to eat. You look like you've been wanting to eat some man.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:20.320]  But listen, you think I'm joking. You think I'm joking. In the 1970s, I think the CIA actually
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:27.280]  did research into not just the occult and Satanism, but cannibalism. Yes, the CIA was researching
[3:21:27.280 --> 3:21:32.720]  cannibalism. Not just, we all know, you know, remote viewing. I know you've done shows about,
[3:21:32.720 --> 3:21:36.320]  you know, Stanford research doing the remote viewing. So they were also studying like the
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:43.120]  hardcore dark arts type of stuff. And I don't think that's accidental that at the same time,
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:47.840]  you know, this is right after the sixties counterculture, we start to see things get worse
[3:21:47.840 --> 3:21:53.520]  and worse and worse. And nowadays, nowadays, what is Katy Perry promoting in her videos,
[3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:58.800]  cannibalism? You've got Richard Dawkins, people coming out. We must, we must eat people. It's
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:03.520]  time now to feed people to people. Dawkins is saying there's nothing wrong with eating people.
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:08.480]  These are actually satanic ideas. I mean, Crowley himself talked about the, you know,
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:13.360]  taking a heart out of a dead entity and eating the heart fresh to, you know,
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:20.160]  to imbibe the power. It's an old cannibalistic practice. And I mean, I think this sounds crazy,
[3:22:20.160 --> 3:22:25.680]  but I mean, we are literally seeing the promotion of literally the most degenerate types of stuff,
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:31.120]  even cannibalism. And I think it's because they've studied this stuff intentionally and want to
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:39.200]  promote it in a ritual. I completely agree with you, Jay. I can see here's the whole thing, Jay.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:46.080]  Anything label culture is 100% manufactured by the CIA. If you go back to the hippie culture,
[3:22:46.080 --> 3:22:52.560]  right? I mean, the CIA's, I mean, you brought up before you brought up the Grateful Dead,
[3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:59.360]  they were the house band for the CIA's guy who made all their acid. They used the CIA to distribute
[3:22:59.360 --> 3:23:08.320]  acid around the country. You know, the Laurel Canyon Studios, which were the house where all the
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:15.680]  really great bands of the 60s and 70s came out of. That was CIA controlled. And then, you know,
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:23.440]  let's get in the hip hop man in the role of gangster rap and NWO. I mean, NWA, which sounds
[3:23:23.440 --> 3:23:33.360]  a lot like NWO and their role in like pushing this culture of thugs and on people. I mean,
[3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:38.640]  you listen to old school rappers, they talk about how like, you know, hip hop used to be so empowering
[3:23:38.640 --> 3:23:44.560]  that it became really into gang banging and like everyone stopped fist fighting and everyone started
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:50.560]  bringing guns. And this plays in to the military industrial complex and their use of the prison
[3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:55.600]  complex and privatized prisons. And that, you know, goes back to what I'm talking about. Gold,
[3:23:55.600 --> 3:24:00.960]  oil, drugs, slavery. I was listening to some of the old rap, like the, you know, like the Curtis
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:05.760]  Blow, Grandmaster Flash, you know, he's like white lines. The more you see, the more you want. It's
[3:24:05.760 --> 3:24:11.200]  a song against drugs. And now you fast forward to like Rick Ross and it's all about how you've got
[3:24:11.200 --> 3:24:16.320]  to deal drugs. It's a total flip. And I found articles, I think you've covered it too, where
[3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:21.600]  they actually talked about CIA high level corporate people talked about creating that whole hip hop
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:29.440]  culture as a social engineering tool. 100%. And, you know, it goes back to the Travestock Institute
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:36.640]  and you just have a bunch of dork sitting around going, how can we just manipulate the masses?
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:42.960]  And I must say something here. I think the N word is a manipulation too. I think that's a complete
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:48.880]  other side up. And I've had rappers from public enemy down talk about the same thing. I mean,
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:56.000]  you have, you get the Boulay to convince people to call themselves the word that the slave masters
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:02.080]  used to call them and not only call each other, defend it like it's some special right. Like,
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:07.040]  because the black community thinks the white community gets to do things that they can't do,
[3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:12.480]  which I think they think we can just go to the bank and just ask for 50 grand. Like, would I
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:18.800]  be doing stand up comedy? If I could just walk to the bank and get 50 grand? No, I mean, so this
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:25.440]  is the manipulation they do to use us to fight with each other. Yeah, it reminds me of somebody
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:31.360]  should dig up. I remember back in the 90s, when I was really getting into cinema and film, I remember
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:36.800]  reading interviews. And I think there's video interviews as well of Quentin Tarantino. Somebody
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:40.800]  should dig about because they would be, they would be pretty devastating to the present day,
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:45.200]  Quentin, because, because he used to say, he used to say, you know what, we should eff and say,
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:49.360]  we should eff and say the N word, we should just eff and scream the N word from the top of every
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:53.680]  building. Right. And I mean, he would in the interview, though, he's saying it, right? So like,
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:26:00.640]  yeah, yeah, within 15 years, he's gone from like, we should scream that to like,
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:04.000]  you ought to be put to death if you say that. Well, I guess Quentin needs to kill himself.
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:09.040]  And because like, he was defending this, this stuff, you know, 15 years ago, but that's the
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:14.560]  weirdness of the like, mind control that you can defend something five, 10 years later,
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:19.040]  you need to die for, you know, saying this or something. It's the most ridiculous thing,
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:25.760]  but it goes back to what all social justice warrior stuff is, which is you, you get angry
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:31.520]  about the past, because it's impossible to change the past. So you can cry about it all the time.
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:38.240]  Like BLM is really angry about its systemic racism in America, right? And it's really,
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:43.120]  and it is wrong, but nobody's talking about slavery and Libya right now, because you would
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:49.040]  actually have to do something then. And the BLM is listen, man, Marxism, any, any,
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:57.600]  any ethnic minority, uh, anyone gay, female, if you're a Marxist, you have no clue of the
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:04.240]  history of communism. And straight up the women who started the BLM movement have stated over
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:10.320]  and over that they are Marxist. And that in itself is another Psyop go to their mission
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.720]  statement. They literally say they want to break up the, the, the fan, the nuclear family. Okay.
[3:27:16.720 --> 3:27:23.120]  Which we all know part of the drug war has been that they destroyed the black family unit and
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:27.760]  they've destroyed any chance of there being generational wealth to be passed down. And
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:34.000]  that's a big part of how you help your children ascend to a higher social level is through
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  generational wealth. You do really well. You pass it on your kids and they do really well.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:41.600]  And they pass it on to their kids. That was ripped away from the black community.
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:49.920]  Bishop Sam Tripoli preaching it baby. No, I totally agree though. If you think about the fact
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:57.360]  if you think about it, the, the, it's mind blowing because if you've read Shea, I've read Shea.
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:03.680]  I've read, I've read Marx. I had grad classes on Marx. Marx was like fiercely racial, right?
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:08.960]  Shea, he said awful things about black people and all the other ethnicities. And so the idea
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:15.600]  that this would be what would appeal to minorities is kind of mind blowing because it's, it's like
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:20.720]  the founders of this whole thing are completely anti minority. They're completely elitist. That's
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:25.760]  the, that's the double mind double think of the Marxist type of movement is that it's always
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:31.520]  so supposedly appealing to the masses, the proletariat, but it's run by the most elitist,
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:35.760]  the most zillionaire families on the planet. And they always fund Marxism and communism and
[3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:39.600]  socialism to consolidate wealth and transfer it to those families.
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:46.560]  And dude, they, they are, they're, they're witches. I mean, they, they're a straight up
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:54.160]  videos of them talking about summoning spirits, man. And I'm like, dude, like even in my shows,
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:29:00.560]  when we do shows on the occult, like I don't want to know anything about how summoning spirits
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:06.080]  or letting any dark forces in, dude, I don't want to get into that, ma'am. We've done a whole show
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:12.080]  recently about, you know, drugs and alcohol and how like you see homeless people and they're talking
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:17.840]  themselves. I think they're, I think they're haunted. I think those are spirits inside them.
[3:29:17.840 --> 3:29:23.760]  I mean, what do we call liquor spirits? And where are your liquor stores? They're on every
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:29.360]  single corner, man. I mean, it's straight up occult stuff. Yeah, it's not accidental, by the
[3:29:29.360 --> 3:29:34.720]  way. If you've seen this new Beyonce film that they put out, she's, she's incarnating herself as
[3:29:34.720 --> 3:29:40.800]  the goddess. She's calling herself the incarnation of the goddess. She's obviously a figure that
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:46.400]  Black Lives Matter looks up to. Other of the big pop stars, as you said, have pretty much openly
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:52.720]  come out as witches or into Wicca witchcraft, whatever. If you remember several years ago,
[3:29:52.720 --> 3:29:59.600]  when Katy Perry was doing, I guess it was either VMAs or Grammys or something like that, she came
[3:29:59.600 --> 3:30:05.280]  out as the scarlet woman riding the beast from the apocalypse. And now she, in her newest video,
[3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:11.360]  she's openly presenting herself as a witch. So I think that this is, this is intentionally being
[3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:15.760]  put into the culture. The Black Lives Matter women are witches. As you said, they're openly
[3:30:15.760 --> 3:30:18.800]  talking about this. That kind of blew me away. I didn't think they would be that open about it,
[3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:23.840]  but here they are just saying it. So they're, they're incarnating this goddess idea on purpose.
[3:30:25.360 --> 3:30:31.440]  And, and it's just to manipulate this group of people into making horrible decisions that
[3:30:31.440 --> 3:30:37.440]  isn't what the universe is about. Yes, we're with Sam Tripoli. Alex Jones show will be back in a
[3:30:37.440 --> 3:30:43.680]  moment. The Democrats are just going more and more left. Many positive about socialism liking
[3:30:43.680 --> 3:30:50.000]  it more than capitalism. Many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical are now
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:56.800]  mainstream. The radical left has taken over the Democratic Party and Joe Biden is marching in
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:31:02.320]  lockstep with them. Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle-class families
[3:31:02.320 --> 3:31:07.040]  with trillions in new taxes. If you're like me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.
[3:31:07.040 --> 3:31:13.520]  Promising amnesty and health care for 11 million illegal immigrants. Citizenship for 11 million
[3:31:13.520 --> 3:31:19.920]  undocumented folks. Promising to shut down energy exploration, killing jobs, and hurting America's
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:26.720]  economy. I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel. In Joe Biden's America, the radical left get
[3:31:26.720 --> 3:31:32.560]  whatever they want and you get to pay for it. They've already taken over Joe Biden and the
[3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:42.240]  Democratic Party. Don't let them take over America. There's a nauseating sense to it.
[3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:49.680]  Not a sense of triumph, not a sense of victory, not a sense of completion,
[3:31:50.880 --> 3:31:57.040]  but a sense of sixth nausea. Though we were right about the world government, we were right about
[3:31:57.040 --> 3:32:04.160]  the anti-human plans. We were right about all the horrible things the globalists and their
[3:32:04.160 --> 3:32:10.720]  satanic order wanted to do to us. Now we sit here, warning people for decades, trying to get people
[3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:17.200]  ready, trying to stop what was coming. But you know what? Revelations and God's words says it's
[3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:21.520]  coming so you can't stop it. And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger
[3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:28.480]  plan and we come to the point in our own psyche, in our own spirit, in our own will that we submit
[3:32:28.480 --> 3:32:34.240]  to God and realize God's in charge and God has a power. And the devil is set as a tester.
[3:32:34.240 --> 3:33:03.280]  And now it's up to us to make the right decision. That's what it's really always been about.
[3:33:04.400 --> 3:33:10.000]  Plus, I go out just like with info and I bring you the very best items, the very best products

[3:33:56.640 --> 3:34:01.360]  and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:06.400]  remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:10.880]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:14.880]  reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months. Some of our staff like it more

[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:03.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. If you
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:09.120]  want more of this kind of analysis, you can of course get signed copies of my book at the website
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:14.160]  in the shop at jaysanalysis.com. That's the Turmeric Hollywood sex cults and symbols in film.
[3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:18.640]  I got one point I want to make Sam and then I want you to take over and give you the floor.
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:25.360]  One of the things that pops up in what I think are high profile rituals like these big Super Bowl,
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:31.280]  VMA, Grammy ceremonies. We see everything from Masonic symbolism with pink getting awards. We
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:38.160]  see Brittany with the snake. We see Beyonce up there in the metropolis transhumanist outfit.
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:48.000]  If you remember, she actually donned the entire metropolis persona there where she's the robot,
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:53.440]  the AI that comes alive at the base of the inverted pentagram. I thought that was pretty
[3:35:53.440 --> 3:36:02.720]  wow when she did that. A common factor for ritual seems to be things like sacrifice. I remember
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:07.760]  for a long time I was skeptical of this idea, but then I remembered that if you read about the mafia
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:13.360]  and the history of the mob, a lot of times there is this notion that you do kind of have to commit
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.720]  a kill or commit a sacrifice or something to bind you to the group to make sure that there's just
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:23.600]  dirt on you. Even if you don't believe in the superstitious magic level of it, at least there's
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:29.440]  dirt on you that you've been implicated and compromised. That makes me think of the case
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:36.080]  of somebody like John Lennon. There's a great book by Fenton Bregler talking about how Mark
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:41.600]  David Chapman had these CIA connections. He seems to have been trained, perhaps have been one of
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:47.600]  these kind of MK Ultra type guys. What do you think about that theory that there is a kind of,
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:52.080]  even if it's not a spiritual, I think there is a spiritual component too, but just at a kind of
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:57.520]  a control level, if they've got dirt on you for sacrificing somebody, what do you think of that?
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:04.080]  Oh yeah, well there's a whole bunch of that stuff. The initiation, the sacrifice is what it's all
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:11.600]  about. That's how you get to the highest, highest of levels. Where you're known as one name by
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:18.800]  everybody. Even your mom knows the name to get to that level. There is sacrifice within the hip
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:25.520]  hop community. It's called a blood sacrifice. Within politics, it's pedophilia. People don't
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:30.080]  want to come to grips with that, but the price of admission to the highest levels of those things
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:38.720]  is pedophilia. If you look at a lot of the Beatles and the symbolism in a lot of their art,
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:45.600]  on their records, on their albums, there's a lot of occult, dark arts with that. The whole thing
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:51.200]  was that, you know, the guy who shot John Lennon, CIA, but there was also that the doorman at his
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:57.760]  hotel or where he was, the condo they was living in, was also CIA. We can get into all of that
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:04.080]  the role of the CIA, especially in hip hop. When they blow you up and they make you huge,
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:10.480]  and I call this moment, I'm a real boy, right? They have this moment where they think they're
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.760]  a real boy and they want to go off the reservation. They don't like that. They don't like when they
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:20.080]  get you really big and then you try to go off on your own. And that's when you see a lot of these
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:25.040]  guys get taken out because they want to control the message. Now, if you make it on your own or
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:29.200]  you do your own thing, that seems to, they don't see the mind that, but when they blow you up,
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:35.600]  that seems to be the big thing. And it really is just liking gangs, jump-ins. Gangs have you go
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:42.000]  out and take somebody out, a rival gang member, and that is how you are initiated into the gang
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:47.200]  so that they know you won't snitch on them because they could snitch on you. Same thing with black
[3:38:47.200 --> 3:38:51.920]  male. I mean, getting into the queue, some people are in the queue, some aren't, but the, you know,
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:56.640]  there was a queue drop listing all the Democrats and all the Republicans who have stepped down
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:39:02.240]  because they've been busted with a pedophilia. That's how you control people. And it is in a
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:09.600]  short game. It's a long game over decades, if not centuries, to control these guys. And that's
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:18.400]  another big thing. If you take a look at like HIPAA and BLM, there's a lot of talk of queer
[3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:23.040]  tolerance. And again, I don't care what anybody does with consenting adults. That's your whole
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:32.400]  thing. But, you know, the black culture, homophobia is widely accepted. I mean, it's just the truth.
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:39.360]  So when people go crazy on Dave Chappelle's doing trans jokes, and he's so edgy, that's not edgy
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:46.400]  a black comedian doing trans jokes, because in the black community, homophobic jokes is acceptable.
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:50.560]  And it's just like, you know, and then you can get in the cloning dude and all that stuff. It's
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:56.160]  really interesting. Yeah, well, I think a lot of people don't know that there have been so many
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:03.360]  cases of the same types of patterns of stuff being documented and coming out. We have this amnesia
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:07.680]  when it comes to news stories. We don't remember that like in the last 10 years, there have been
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:13.040]  countless cases of rappers killing other rappers, rappers coming out talking about the fact that
[3:40:13.040 --> 3:40:17.840]  it was a hit. This guy was killed for sacrificial purposes. There was dirt on this guy. It was
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:22.000]  going to come out. It's the same in politics. As you just pointed out, it's the same in the
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:26.640]  Roman Catholic Church with its scandals. And again, I mean, there have been famous cases,
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:32.720]  Franklin Scandal, Franklin Cover-Up have all documented this for decades. And it's because
[3:40:32.720 --> 3:40:36.720]  that's part of the control structure. I liked that you highlighted all of these different
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:42.320]  areas that they all kind of tie together. You've got high level military guys like Aquino,
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:47.600]  who was Temple of Sat, right? He just passed away. And I don't know if you've seen it, Sam.
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:55.040]  Yeah, right. If you've seen it, but there was a clip. I think it's John Lennon, I think on Dick
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:41:00.480]  Cavett before he gets shot. And he kind of lays out the big plan. He's like, you know what they're
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:03.760]  going to do, mate? You know what they're going to do, mate? They're going to kill us all. They want
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:09.120]  to depopulate the whole world down to like 500 million, mate. That's the big plan. And then he's
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:16.480]  gone. Yes. Have you heard that? Yeah. I mean, like, when you give out inner secrets,
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:23.200]  they take you out. And listen, man, when you sell your soul, you are disposable.
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:28.880]  And some people that sell their souls go to the highest levels, JZ, Beyonce,
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:35.760]  all these politicians on Jeffrey Epstein's flight. Or you could sell your soul and they
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:40.880]  can instantly get rid of you. They could throw you out like a paper cup. Oh, I want a glass of
[3:41:40.880 --> 3:41:46.080]  water. I don't want. And you just throw the paper cup out. It's the exact same thing. It doesn't
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:52.000]  matter. Once you sell your soul, they could do anything they want with you. It's like when in
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:56.880]  a sports, you sign a contract, a guarantee contract, they can trade you to Siberia. There's
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:01.440]  nothing you could do about it. And that's the same thing with these occult stuff. When you sell your
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:07.040]  soul, they can do anything they want with you or no longer control your destiny.
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:13.600]  Yeah. And again, I think if people find this hard to believe, I mean,
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:17.520]  given what's come out in the last four years, it should not be hard to believe. Remember,
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:21.280]  remember all the different cases, right? There's been Hastor, there've been Penn State,
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:28.400]  there've been Savile, there've been the MPs in the UK. There's been cases in Ireland.
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:32.960]  There've been, there was the Dutro case, the Dutro affair of the highest elite in Belgium,
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:39.360]  Roman Catholic Cardinals, Prelates, nobility in Belgium, all involved in this trafficking
[3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:45.360]  sacrifice, literally being done in castles, like Dracula level stuff, right? Going on in Belgium.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:50.080]  There was a million people in Belgium that marched in the streets after this when it came out.
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:55.760]  I mean, like everybody says, consider whatever they want about Trump. I mean, like I, there's
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:43:00.960]  good, I like Trump. I think he's, I like Trump because mostly the people I find annoying hate
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:06.240]  him. So I like him, you know, and he's done a lot of things that I like. But I mean, like,
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:14.320]  everyone's like, where's the big names? I'm like, dude, 2019 humongous child sex trafficking pedophiles
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:22.080]  got arrested, Epstein, Naxiom, the Profmans are huge. Nobody knows the name. The Profmans are huge.
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:32.320]  John of God, Nader, well, oh, El Chapo, everybody thinks El Chapo was just about drugs. El Chapo
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:39.920]  was involved with child sex trafficking. These are huge, huge arrests. And just recently,
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:45.200]  all these arrests that are happening right now, I mean, supposedly Epstein's girlfriend got arrested
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:51.520]  and look at all these arrests has happened the last two weeks. It's humongous. And this is a
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:59.120]  pedophilia, say 10 sacrifices. These are the, this is the initiation into the highest levels.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:06.080]  And they have to show it. It's also magic. They don't even, it's ritual magic because they don't
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:10.640]  even hide the fact that they do it. It's like in your face, right? There's, I've seen images of the
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:16.480]  Jonas Brothers. They wear t-shirts of Crowley. You see Jay-Z wearing the Do What Thou Will shirt.
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:22.560]  They literally throw it in the face as a kind of hidden in plain sight type of thing, lesser magic.
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:28.000]  They're showing you what they're up to as they turn around and act like they don't do it and pretend
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:32.240]  that they don't do it when they, when they display it, right? I mean, they're openly into there.
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:34.080]  You see the Crowley with the all seeing eye. I mean,
[3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:42.720]  yeah. Aster Crowley, brother, real quick to say, Aster Crowley was the Carlos Mencia of occultism.
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:47.680]  He jacked everything, just rewrote it and tried to act like he was, and then all these stories
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:52.880]  about him being this Jane Bond. All I know about him is he's Barbara Bush's dad. That's all I know.
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:45:00.560]  Now you're with the terrorist. I'm going to have to say, Sam, Sam's with the terrorist now.
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:06.800]  He's got the musher gashish. All right. So you and sold the bush. All right. It was a great
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:13.520]  interview. Sam, tell us where everybody can find you. You can find me at Sam Tripoli across all
[3:45:13.520 --> 3:45:20.960]  social media or Ronan Sam Tripoli or Sam Tripoli, Tim Fowler podcast, my patrons, patreon.com,
