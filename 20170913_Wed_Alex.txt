[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:21.000 --> 00:32.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.000]  When I first got involved in news and political action 25 years ago,
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  a lot of the old timers came to me that had been politically involved.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  They educated me about the private fellow deserve, about globalism.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  That's what I learned about Ron Paul.
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  They told me Alex, at the bottom of the rabbit hole, they're devil worshipers and pedophiles.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  And despite the fact that I've grown up in the richest county in Texas at the time, Rockwall, Texas, outside Dallas,
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  and despite the fact that I'd seen some of the occultism and some of the really rich people, billionaires and others,
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  that lived in the area, I still just didn't believe it.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  I thought it was just localized to what I saw.
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  But now after 25 years of being deeply plugged into what's happening in the real world
[01:29.000 --> 01:39.000]  and focused 16 hours a day on news and information and sources, I can tell you 100%.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  But you already know this too. It's all over the news these days. They can't hide it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  It's just oozing out from the floorboards.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  Like John Wayne Gacy, the stench of the dead bodies, the cops finally come over, he invites them in for coffee.
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  They could smell the rotten meat coming out of the vents in the floor as they drank coffee.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  They couldn't wait to get out and get a search warrant.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  In the case of the globalists, the deputy pope's been caught kidnapping and raping over 100 children.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  Every globalist you turn around is constantly getting caught.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  You've got skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, those are just gateways into it.
[02:16.000 --> 02:25.000]  And then here it is today, the president of the Washington Post and his wife were hardcore black magic practitioners.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  She's written a book about it. She believes they killed people with black magic.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  That's up on infowars.com right now. It's from Breitbart, gatekeepers of DC society. Sally Quinn comes out as a cultist,
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  use hexes to kill people and she wants you to know how powerful she is and she can kill you now.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  Talk about lunatics.
[02:53.000 --> 03:01.000]  But why is that so interesting? Without even trying in today's stack, and we have the audio of it coming up in Hillary's own voice,
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  Hillary Clinton, I wanted to make voodoo dolls of reporters, lawmakers and stick them with pens.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Now you have to understand the Clintons have had vacations in Haiti. They visited voodoo priests.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  They've spent weeks in voodoo churches. They practice demon possession.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  That's what voodoo is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.000]  Whether you believe it or not, it is the trying to get spirits to come into you.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  And I've had guests on that work for the Clintons. It's even come out. Tony Blair's wife is into it.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Francois Mitterrand, I mean, they're all into it.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  It was in the London Telegraph years ago that Tony Blair every morning goes into his little chapel and falls to his knees,
[03:50.000 --> 04:02.000]  flopping around on the ground, flopping around on the ground when he's possessed by the spirit of the light.
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  Tony Blair every morning becomes possessed, falling on the ground, having a convulsion.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  He believes the spirit enters him.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000]  This is just today's news. Her new book. How much she loves voodoo.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  The former president, Ben Bradley of the Washington Post,
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  had his wife, she believes, kill people for him with hexes.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  Here's Hillary. Here's another one, though. Oh, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  resigns at her fifth child sex abuse allegation.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  And surprise, surprise, he looks just like John Wayne Gacy.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  They all look like John Wayne Gacy.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  Pastored looks like John Wayne Gacy. Menendez looks like John Wayne Gacy.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  The deputy pope looks like John Wayne Gacy. They always look the same.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  It's weird. They can even be black. They look the same or Hispanic.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise,
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  So much is from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  and to profit from it?
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Join the InfoWars.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Spread the information.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  Educate yourself and others.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  The truth shall set you free.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.000]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  It's made in the USA.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  and it supports the InfoWars.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family

[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield.

[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's InfoWarsLife.com
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  I am your host Alex Jones. We're going to be here for the next four hours live.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  There is so much incredible news and information to cover.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  But the first thing I'm going to get into is the fact that when you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole in this world,
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  you find Satanism and you find pedophilia.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  And every day, despite the fact that the globalists are trying to hide this information,
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  it is coming out in mainstream news.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  Look at this New York Mag headline.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  Clinton linked the Satanic rituals involving kidnapped children and Marina Abramovich.
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  That was them last year making fun of it, but look, they're not making fun of it now.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  Hillary Clinton has come out in her new book. We're getting the audio right now
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  and talked about how she likes to practice voodoo.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  But look at this story.
[09:50.000 --> 09:58.000]  The CEO of the Washington Post, the president, vice president until his death in 2014,
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  his widow, Ben Bradley's widow, Sally Quinn, the lady of DC as she's known,
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  one of the top socialites of the Democratic Party and Republican Party, both friends with JFK.
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  That's how Bradley got a start, says that they conducted Satanic rituals,
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  black magic rituals and killed people.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  That's the headline.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Gatekeeper of DC Society, Sally Quinn, comes out as an occultist,
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  use hex to kill people.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  When you read what she was into, it's black magic.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  What does John Podesta admittedly go to in the emails?
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  Not the pizza place they diverted people off on to in DC.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  In New York, he's invited by Abramovich who says she does real rituals,
[10:49.000 --> 10:57.000]  Aleister Crowley rituals with blood semen, you name it, children attending the events,
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  and these are just the public gateway events.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to show any more of it on there.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  Just get her off, little vampire off it.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  So that's who these evil, selfish, grasping people are.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  And there's more.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  It's in the news every day.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  More high-level cardinals busted with little kids.
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  The deputy pope caught being indicted for kidnapping and running hundreds of little boys.
[11:31.000 --> 11:41.000]  And now Seattle Mayor Ed Murray resigns after fifth child sex abuse allegation of raping children.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  And then take a look at Ed Murray's face and then pull up Ted Bundy.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Pull up John Wayne Gacy.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  That's what he really looks like.
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  Pull up Senator Menendez on trial right now and just look at the faces on these.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  The mayor, Bill de Blasio of New York's right-hand guy got caught with hard-core child porn.
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  Never even got mentioned in the news that he was connected to the mayor.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  Look at Wiener, Anthony Wiener.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  Look at Dennis Hastert.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  Look at all of them, they have the same little piggy faces and the same little piggy eyes.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  And that's who's in power.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  That's your speaker of the house.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  That's your mayors.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  That's who's in charge.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  And all the boys are running around chasing your little boys.
[12:40.000 --> 12:52.000]  The girls are putting on black cloaks and doing satanic rituals and telling you in autobiographies that they killed people during rituals.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  Now, why are they telling you they killed people?
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  Because they believe they're losing right now.
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.000]  And in black magic, if you can tell somebody you did it or you're going to do it, it ups the power.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  It's called lesser magic.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  I don't believe in it, they do.
[13:13.000 --> 13:22.000]  I'm like an anthropologist, a sociologist, a psychologist, a lay psychiatrist looking at crazy people with their magical thinking.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  But this is the psychopathic behavior.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  It's the mindset, it's the criminology.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  Every day, just today, Hillary, I love voodoo.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  I want to use voodoo against my enemies.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  Then we have that whole history of her.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  You heard that here years ago that she's into voodoo.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  Let's get Larry Nichols on today to give an answer to the phone.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  You heard it from countless others.
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  I've read it in the newspapers about her back when she was first lady.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  I've talked to folks in Hollywood.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  They say it's rampant.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  The child molestation, the devil worship.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  Hillary Clinton.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  She wanted to make voodoo dolls of reporters lawmakers and stick them with pens.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's just part of her coming out.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And then gatekeeper of DC society, Sally Quinn, comes out as an occultist.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  She used hex to kill people.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And again, she believes she's killing people.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  You and I, we need normal people.
[14:19.000 --> 14:30.000]  We look at our thought leaders, our media and our culture overlords and ruling class often times wonder how they can be so venal, dishonest in pursuit of what they want.
[14:30.000 --> 14:38.000]  And what most of, and what they most want of us all is control of our lives.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  And it just goes on how they want to run our lives completely.
[14:42.000 --> 14:50.000]  So again, we look at the ruling class and often times wonder how they can be so venal, dishonest in pursuit of what they want.
[14:50.000 --> 15:00.000]  What they want most of all is to crawl over our lives over normal people, those of us who do not want to control anyone.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  We just want to be left alone.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Exactly.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  Very, very powerful, very, very simple.
[15:06.000 --> 15:19.000]  And so you see the devil worship news, the devil worship information going from just being rumors, the child molestation, the pedophilia, the occult from rumors to their.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  They're getting busted across the board.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  So now they're trying to normalize it.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Yeah, we're devil worshipers.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  Yeah, we like kids.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  What's she going to do about it?
[15:30.000 --> 15:48.000]  They're desperately trying to condition you through MTV and through Viacom and through sexualization of children and through tolerance training that the government gets to sexualize your five year old children and start telling them about sexual preferences
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  and sexual acts.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  Those are pre acts of serious pedophilia.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  Those are grooming and sexualization preparation.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  And it's come out against the British royal family.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  It's come out against the British and aristocracy of Europe as well.
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  It's come out that the BBC is just riddled.
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.000]  Now it's breaking an elite pedophile ring supermarkets been discovered in Portugal.
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with refugees and third world populations the UN can control.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  Sir Edward Heath was a pedophile says police chief.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  Astonishing claim is made that the former PM is guilty of vile crimes covered up by the establishment.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  Close quote.
[16:35.000 --> 16:42.000]  And then you read this to put it bluntly. This is from the memoir.
[16:42.000 --> 16:51.000]  We're now learning that the queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes according to her own memoir that she murdered three innocent people.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  And then it goes into how she killed him.
[16:54.000 --> 17:03.000]  And this is just what they're putting in their memoirs.
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  Now why do you think back in 1987 they'd have somebody like Martin Sheen in a movie.
[17:10.000 --> 17:26.000]  All the believers come out and have a whole production about voodoo cults in New York City and voodoo cults in DC and voodoo cults in Chicago and voodoo cults running and controlling.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  Politics.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  When we come back I'll play the actual trailer for you.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Now, because the one we had on screen tonight just adds up.
[17:38.000 --> 17:47.000]  I found it back there on my computer or John back there and give it to you if you want to go ask him.
[17:47.000 --> 17:54.000]  But continuing ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand who you're dealing with.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  You want to be left alone. You want to be wholesome. You want to have a nice life. You don't want to run people's life.
[17:59.000 --> 18:07.000]  You're not a megalomaniac, narcissist, sociopath or psychopath or masochist who wants to hurt people.
[18:07.000 --> 18:13.000]  And so you're blind to the fact that they organize themselves into positions of power and get into positions of power.
[18:13.000 --> 18:37.000]  And that's why every civilization has histories and stories and legends about how groups get together and become evil and become possessed and start doing horrible, vicious, evil things to people.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  And how demon possession, a spirit comes into the world and takes control of people.
[18:43.000 --> 18:55.000]  Whether you believe in the spirit world or not, there is a mass mental illness that develops in complex civilizations of people falling to an evil computer program.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  Falling to psychopathic activity.
[19:00.000 --> 19:09.000]  In ancient Greek cities, they would start having people go insane as well and start living in the catacombs or in the hills.
[19:09.000 --> 19:17.000]  And a lot of times on weekends, they would have vampire hunting forays to go out and kill the crazy people.
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  Because the crazy people would grab you in the night, drag you into a cave and drink your blood.
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  They had the same thing in Eastern Europe, the same thing in Western Europe, the same thing in Africa, the same thing in Mesoamerica.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  Every culture had vampires.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  They don't live forever.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  They're not really Count Dracula, but they want to grab you or your child and suck your blood.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  They want to torture you.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  They want power over you.
[19:46.000 --> 19:58.000]  And Hillary Clinton and all the rest of the top Democrats and that babbling idiot Pelosi guaranteed you can watch her know they're devil worshipers, they're blood drinkers.
[19:58.000 --> 20:07.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk and you want guarantees and you want it all tax free.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  That's a tall order.
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  That's true.
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  But you can have tax free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[23:56.000 --> 24:24.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, so when I say Nancy Pelosi is one of these occultists,
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  I know that she was friends with the lady that shows that she was a black magic witch
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  and one of the top Democrats in DC and married to the guy that ran the Washington Post forever.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And when I say she's a blood drinker, I mean the fake wars they've launched,
[24:38.000 --> 24:44.000]  the Arab Spring, the abortions they support, the Planned Parenthood, all of it.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  Their actions supporting and covering up the sexualization of children in schools.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  So if they're not physical devil worshipers that get down on their knees to the devil,
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  they get down on their knees to almighty power and to corruption and to the system.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  And it's time that we see through it, understand it, and know why Hollywood and all the culture tells us
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.000]  what's going on up on top of the castle at night. They tell us through art and through literature
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  so that when we actually speak up about the real thing, people think,
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  oh, that's just entertainment, that's just, that's just Count Dracula novel.
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.000]  Just like they have GeoStorm coming out about weather modification and global weather control.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  They admit it's going on, it's happening, so oh, now that the public's awakening,
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  here's a big movie, so people say, oh, you just heard about that in a movie.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  But if you just joined us, top Democrats, gatekeeper of DC society comes out as a cultist
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  who believes that they killed three people using black magic. That's the headline.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  Hillary Clinton wanted to craft voodoo dolls of Congress and the media.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  I have a clip of that. We're going to play here in a moment.
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  And then we have the trailer to the 1987 film Believers with Martin Sheen.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  And no, I'm not saying Martin Sheen's into voodoo, he's into yoga and as a Buddhist, I know him.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  The point is, is that this is just all part of art imitating life or life imitating art.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  There's this submerged system of occultism and pedophilia. Here's another one.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray resigns after fifth child sex abuse allegation.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  Senator Menendez is in trouble for it. It's everywhere, every day.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  And now we've just gotten used to it where it comes out and then nothing's done.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  Here's Hillary Clinton dreaming of voodoo dolls.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  It was like quicksand. The more you struggle, the deeper you sink.
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  At times I thought I must be going crazy. Other times I was sure it was the world that had gone nuts.
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  Sometimes I snapped at my staff. I was tempted to make voodoo dolls of certain members of the press and Congress
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  and stick them full of pins. Mostly I was furious at myself.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  There you go. Let's play the trailer for the 1987 film The Believers. Here it is.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  Coming from Orion Pictures.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  The Believers
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  More than anything else, Cal Jameson wants to leave the horror of his old life behind.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  Help! Help!
[27:38.000 --> 27:44.000]  Now in his new life, he's about to discover that the real horror is just beginning.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  You had it out! Don't you come any closer! You see what they did to the kid in here?
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  You said he found a body young at all about a religious paraphernalia, right?
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  A religion as old as time. One life from YouTube has come. Versus an unimaginable force for evil.
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  This ritual's being performed now. One life from so yes. Nothing can stop them.
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  The power you can't imagine. Want them to know who you are? Do you?
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  What have they done to you, Sean?
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  I can't move. No one can help you.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  They got my seal! Look to me at him!
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  You looked into his eyes and you both saw the power of the man who killed them.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Jessica!
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  They know who you are.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  This was chosen, Cal. When he found the show, it was a sign we want you to join us.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  Help! Help!
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  Help!
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  Help!
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  Let me go!
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  Help!
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  Help!
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Help!
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  The Believers.
[28:50.000 --> 29:00.000]  Alright, so the film is, there's a nationwide network of devil worshippers practicing Voodoo, taking over political systems.
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  And when you study Barack Obama and his wife, when you study the Clintons, they all go to Voodoo Shaman.
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  They have honeymoon on Haiti. They're constantly around it.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  It's in all the literature. Tony Blair does Voodoo Rituals.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  It's transphalometer on. It's all there.
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  And then they write memoirs saying, we kill people with this stuff.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  We're talking leaders in DC.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  Now, they're totally insane.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  That's certainly for certain.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  These people are dangerous. They're scum and they're everywhere.
[29:37.000 --> 29:47.000]  We got to call their bluff and just like if the clown have no fear of them, that breaks their will and their father, the devil's will, with the name Jesus Christ.
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[30:07.000 --> 30:12.000]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties or in his possessions.
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.000]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  That is the ultimate concern.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power,
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[30:42.000 --> 30:48.000]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  FriendForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide,
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[31:13.000 --> 31:17.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.

[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[31:35.000 --> 31:42.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  Available at infowarslife.com
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[32:30.000 --> 32:37.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[32:37.000 --> 32:43.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:45.000 --> 32:51.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[32:51.000 --> 32:59.000]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[32:59.000 --> 33:04.000]  But it is fascinating. I mean, lasers, really, to change the weather?
[33:04.000 --> 33:11.000]  That's right. Well, instead of doing a rain dance, we physicists are firing trillion-watt lasers into the sky
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.000]  to actually precipitate rain clouds and actually bring down lightning bolts.
[33:16.000 --> 33:23.000]  Even in the 60s, the CIA used this to bring down monsoons during the Vietnam War to wash out the Viet Cong.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  Well, a ledge, too. A ledge, too.
[33:25.000 --> 33:26.000]  A ledge, too, right?
[33:26.000 --> 33:33.000]  These clouds were located up in southern part of North Vietnam and would need to make rain down on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Highway 1.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  A ledge, too. A ledge, too.
[33:35.000 --> 33:46.000]  My name is Ben Literacy. I'm the first person to ever see the cloud with the intention to cause it to do military damage.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  This is the heart of 1776. You're a new white male!
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  Also, what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones?
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  Info wars help to fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking alive.
[34:30.000 --> 34:38.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  All right. I want to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today as we intersperse a lot of key news and information.
[34:51.000 --> 35:00.000]  But where do you think we go from here? Now that every day, another senator or another mayor of a major city,
[35:00.000 --> 35:10.000]  or another major Hollywood person, has to step down or is indicted for molesting children and trafficking in children.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  And then what do you make of all these top Democrats coming out and saying,
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  yeah, we do satanic rituals. Yeah, we do voodoo. Yeah, we kill people.
[35:22.000 --> 35:36.000]  He's just joined us. Gatekeeper of DC Society, Sally Quinn, comes out as an occultist, says she uses hexes to kill three people.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  And to show how crazy she is, she didn't like what an astrologer told her, so she says that she killed the astrologer.
[35:42.000 --> 35:50.000]  Now, whether she's completely insane, really did have her physically poisoned or killed, or the woman just died of natural causes,
[35:50.000 --> 35:57.000]  it shows how completely disconnected from reality these insane people are.
[35:57.000 --> 36:09.000]  And how they all get together to the point where somebody like Diane Feinstein gets up on television and says,
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  if you're a Catholic, you can't be trusted to be a federal judge because of your extreme dogma.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  They're so disconnected that the Christians are who have to be banned. They're the bad ones, not them, not the occultists.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  And then Hillary Clinton wanted to craft voodoo dolls of Congress and the media.
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  That story's up on infowars.com, Clinton linked to satanic rituals involving kidnapped children, and Marina Abranovic.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.000]  What were they going to do back in November of last year when that broke? That was in New York.
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  That was in the emails. Oh, make it about a pizza place, because the code words were about pizza.
[36:44.000 --> 36:51.000]  So you just pick a pizza place, you focus on that, a pizza place that has fundraisers so you can have a bunch of names involved,
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  so folks take debate, and then make all satanism and all kidnapping and all pedophilia about that.
[36:56.000 --> 37:07.000]  So if I say, oh, the mayor of Seattle just stepped down over a fifth sex abuse report of a small child,
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  how dare I say Hillary's killing people in a pizza place? Because there's no such thing as pedophilia.
[37:12.000 --> 37:19.000]  Even though this is in the Seattle Times, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray resigns after fifth child sex abuse allegation.
[37:19.000 --> 37:26.000]  They're not going to be able to brand everything on the pizza gate and then claim that there's no such thing. And it's all a Salem witch trial.
[37:26.000 --> 37:35.000]  There's no such thing as devil worshipers. There's no such thing as satanism when it's rampant.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  And just look at these people.
[37:38.000 --> 37:55.000]  So I want to get your take on that, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 is the toll free number for you to join us, 800-259-9231.
[37:55.000 --> 38:05.000]  The websites are infowars.com and newswars.com and of course, prisonplanet.com.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  Now, let me get into some of the other huge news we've got here.
[38:09.000 --> 38:19.000]  And you're welcome to talk about any topic you want, but I'd like people to comment on the occult, on the pedophilia, on just why have we allowed these people to get in place everywhere
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.000]  and why are they more and more bragging about it out in the open because they're getting busted so they're trying to act confident and normalize it.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  That's why.
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.000]  First-time callers also are welcome, 800-259-9231.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  Now, why are they mad at Trump? Because he's not a devil worship or a pedophile. Seriously, he's not in the club.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[38:44.000 --> 39:01.000]  White House fuels optimism amongst U.S. manufacturers as manufacturing surges, just 36,000 new jobs in manufacturing in August alone since August.
[39:01.000 --> 39:12.000]  Continuing, U.S. middle class incomes reached highest ever level in 2016, Census Bureau, highest middle class ever, bouncing back.
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.000]  Now, a lot of that's inflation, but at least the number's up from what it was in the last decade. We've been in a 10-year recession.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  Obamacare's out-of-pocket cost for specialty drugs increases 16% in one year.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  Hillary should be prosecuted over destroyed evidence, says Judge Napolitano.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  Rasmussen poll, more than half say Clinton should retire.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  White House Justice Department should look into prosecuting Comey for leaking classified info.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  He did it, cut and dry, and lied to Congress before saying he'd not been involved in leaks.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  And we knew now the date he had been leaking. He is a liar.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  Poll, more Americans have a gun in the home than ever before. Good news.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  U.S. Senator says on the Equifax hack, somebody needs to go to jail.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[40:01.000 --> 40:13.000]  You know, I remember seeing Illinois, California, Wisconsin, a bunch of other states try to pass or pass laws that got to their governor's desk last year
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  to let all illegal aliens, not just naturalized folks, vote.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  And here it is from Fox 5 DC, reporting it like it's a good thing.
[40:26.000 --> 40:38.000]  College Park to allow non-U.S. citizens the right to vote in local elections.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  Think about that. College Park to allow non-U.S. citizens the right to vote in local elections.
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  We have the video of the vote. They voted to do something no country's ever done in the history of the world.
[40:51.000 --> 40:59.000]  Take people. It says fresh off a boat, fresh over the border. They joined six other towns. See, it's already spreading.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  Just in that state, allowing illegal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  That's illegal aliens to vote in municipal elections.
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  They've had bills pass in California and pass in Illinois that get to the governor's desk.
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  But it's so illegal and creates such a constitutional crisis that they have never signed them.
[41:25.000 --> 41:45.000]  But now, in Maryland, that's seven towns, seven towns that illegal aliens can just show up to,
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  with not even a real ID. So that means they can go around in the names of dead people, the Democrats,
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  line them up, they load them on buses. We have three Democratic officials on video,
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  high level ones nationally. We have the head of the New York elections who's a good guy saying it's all fraud.
[41:58.000 --> 42:05.000]  It should be stopped. He was removed. All the people engaged in fraud, admittedly, they weren't removed.
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  They were promoted. And they give somebody on average 10 names of dead people who are on the voting rolls,
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  who've died, they call the numbers out of the obituary, they index people on the voter roll,
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  and they drive you around. And your name could be Hans Christensen.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  And it's somebody from Mexico or somebody from China just walking up, no ID needed,
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  in these Democrat states, and you vote. Total organized fraud, organized crime.
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  And then the average Democratic constituent knows that and thinks they're fighting for some socialist utopia
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  and by getting illegals to vote, they're going to get power and then take all the rich people's money
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  when it's the ultra-rich that engineered this to destroy the middle class and implode the country
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.000]  and bring in a police state. So they're using our openness to do this.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  And it's totally criminal and it's why we've got to have voter rules in all the country
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  and we've got to have state laws saying, well, I think there already are state laws.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  The state laws already say who can vote. In fact, there are state laws on voting.
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.000]  And it's the federal constitution as well. It's citizens. 18 years of age, you're up.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  If you've got a dishonorable discharge, you can't vote or own a gun. If you're a felon,
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  but illegal aliens, they can vote.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  Most areas felons can vote. I'm all for it. I think once you've served your time, you should be able to whatever.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  I think felons are able to have guns because they're going to have guns anyways.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  And if they've righted themselves, they've a right to defend themselves.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  We let felons have guns about 50 years ago, but I'm digressing.
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.000]  I see these articles all the time where with a straight face, they're like, they deserve to vote.
[43:50.000 --> 43:57.000]  So San Francisco's voted to let illegals vote. They'll call them undocumented migrants.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  Remember, they were called illegal aliens until just about five years ago.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  But then the media said, the word is undocumented migrants and you'll use that word.
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.000]  And we all dutifully use that word. And then that comes into the nomenclature.
[44:09.000 --> 44:20.000]  And don't use the word mother and father or boy or girl. You're all purple penguins now.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  And we've got all the little books for the five-year-olds about Heather has two mommies
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.000]  and daddy has a friend that comes over and lives and daddy turned into a girl or mommy turned into a boy.
[44:30.000 --> 44:38.000]  So we can brutalize and sexually abuse the minds of little children trying to screw them up as hard as we can.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  And salon everybody else says pedophilia is good.
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  That way the mayor of San Francisco or the mayor of whatever other city ends up getting in trouble,
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  the mayor of Seattle who just stepped down, they won't have to step down.
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.000]  Hell, you can take your little five-year-olds into him.
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  He can maybe take them out on dates at night. You can dress your son up.
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  Some little knickers for him. Take them on into the mayor.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  Hell, dress your son up like a little girl.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  Bring them into him. Maybe put some clown makeup on the mayor.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  Maybe dress him up like hit the clown. That'll make it more fun for your child.
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  After all, it's just tolerance.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  And then the real way they're hurting your kids is the vaccines.
[45:24.000 --> 45:31.000]  Yes, I know you can learn immunity from a vaccine, but they have vaccine damage immunity since the 80s.
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Tens of billions have been paid out secretly to damage children.
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.000]  The inserts say they can kill you or give you type 1 diabetes or cause narcolepsy
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  or cause all sorts of neurological disorders, cancer, liver failure, leukemia.
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  It all says it on the inserts, but they never want to give you the inserts.
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  They just say safe and effective. It's for your baby.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  And the doctors, they don't want to take the vaccines. They're all dodging them.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  They know how dangerous they are. It's what it does to them and their nurses.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  There's some of the most unvaccinated groups out there. They falsify the reports for each other.
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  But when you come in, they intimidate you for the big guild, big pharma, and tell you, it's the law.
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  They say, no, it's not the law. They say, you're right. It's not the law, but I choose not to give you service.
[46:15.000 --> 46:23.000]  I choose not to render care. You take your son, your daughter, your baby, you take them and you leave
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  because you're endangering everybody else. Really?
[46:26.000 --> 46:33.000]  If you take the flu shot or the hepatitis shot and it protects you from it, why should I have to take it if you're protected?
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  The truth is hepatitis and all these diseases are way up.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  All the major measles, mumps, rubella, and shingles breakouts, it turns out, are from the vaccines.
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.000]  And they know full well. And the average doctor knows full well.
[46:50.000 --> 46:56.000]  After they pressure you at the hospital to give your kid a vaccine, the nurses say, you know, we don't give them either.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  And we've had nurses on whistleblowing. It's been in the news.
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  We're in the preemie ward. It just started again about six years ago.
[47:03.000 --> 47:10.000]  Six years ago, they changed the federal regulations. It's not a law and said everyone, including pregnant women, need a flu shot.
[47:10.000 --> 47:21.000]  Even though they know it massively increases miscarriage via autoimmune response.
[47:21.000 --> 47:32.000]  But what they tell the doctors and what they push on them is you're part of a scientific elite.
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.000]  And we know these vaccines are damaging people, but overall they help greater than they hurt.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  So it's up to you as a practitioner of this new twisted Hippocratic Oath to go out and do it.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  But here's an example. They tell you it's safe and effective. No side effects to your face.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  They'll give you an information sheet that says, oh, they're every once in a while, there's a few problems.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  If you go out and look for the inserts online, they have watered down ones that say very rare.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  Will you get narcolepsy or cancer? Those aren't the inserts.
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  We have a file in there that shows the real inserts where it says the hundreds of things it can and will do to you.
[48:07.000 --> 48:15.000]  And then everyone knows family members and others that have gotten sick and gotten hurt from the vaccines.
[48:15.000 --> 48:28.000]  Oh, look, moderate problems, seizures, nonstop crying, high fever, brain damage, serious allergic reactions, long term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  Oh, wonder why they don't have a shot. Permanent brain damage.
[48:32.000 --> 48:40.000]  Now, that's not an actual insert. What they found is some whitewash where they put information is based on the DPAPVIS.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  No, you get it from the insert. Well, whatever the crew just found, we have an old file actually, Rob do has it.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  Please get that. I'll just cover it next segment since we got into this.
[48:47.000 --> 48:55.000]  I'll show you the actual insert. Every year, the Dell Children's Hospital, when they give all the kids, there are five or six more shots,
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  some of the three things per shot, triple jabs to go to school. Their pancreas just fail and they tell them, oh, it's genetic.
[49:01.000 --> 49:10.000]  You have type one diabetes. No, it's in the inserts that the MMR shot and others cause a autoimmune response in the brain and in the pancreas,
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.000]  and that many times the pancreas then fails. Then they put your kid on drugs. The pancreas sometimes comes back.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  They put your child on drugs and the pancreas is wiped out permanently.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  They've got extra tents all set up knowing full well what they're doing.
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  Yeah, see, what they did was put out a whitewash article we just showed that said, oh, it's very rare, but they said it's based on this.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  Then they show the CDC whitewash paper. But what you've got to read is, and that's bad enough,
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  what you've got to read is the actual pharma insert that comes with the injection vial.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  The actual vial. Yes, here they are. They just ran them into me.
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.000]  These are the little papers that come with it in the vaccines that show you what it actually does.
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.000]  When we come back, I'll show you. These are the ones that show how it can kill you, all the things.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  And it doesn't say it's rare. No, no, no. This is what it actually says.
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  See, they have levels of BS hoping as you dig, you don't actually legally,
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  they're trying to pass the law without doing this, still tell you this is probably going to really hurt you really bad.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  Oh, this garter still shot might sterilize you.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  And remember, the doctors will sit there with a straight face because they've got $200,000 of bills to pay from school.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  They went through internship and went through all this brainwashing.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  They have got to sit there and tell you safe and effective and lie to you and bully you.
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  But if you ask for the insert and you tell them you want them to sign a form saying they'll pay for liability if your kid gets hurt,
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  they'll go ahead and leave you alone and not even make you take the shot.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  There is no law. You do not have to take the shot. And this is a way to brain damage your children.
[50:55.000 --> 51:18.000]  It's in government documents.

[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  Thank you.
[54:26.000 --> 54:42.000]  You know what I'm going to do?
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  I'm going to do an entire special report.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  I'm going to shoot this afternoon that I'm going to air on the broadcast tomorrow.
[54:47.000 --> 54:54.000]  Because when I get into vaccines and the fraud and the fact that they know that they're involved in social engineering with them,
[54:54.000 --> 55:00.000]  and the fact that doctors know and are told these vaccines will kill certain numbers of children,
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  they will cause brain damage,
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  but the greater good for herd immunity will be served.
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.000]  And so you've got to triage and realize that you're going to have children collapse in your hospitals,
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  in your clinics, and that you've got to have a way to respond to that.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  And when it is serious enough or they die,
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  you then fill out a form and give it to the federal government because then there's a secret court
[55:24.000 --> 55:32.000]  that carries out the adjudification of it and the payment of millions of dollars per family to the children.
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.000]  And then vaccine makers have total immunity to be able to hurt and maim as many people as they want
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  and bear knowingly for a decade sent out millions of ampoules of factor 8 blood product
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.000]  that had HIV and hepatitis in it killing hundreds of thousands of people.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  But why I got mad earlier is the crew's amazing.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  They hear me talking about something. This isn't scripted.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  They just search engine and of course always find what I'm saying.
[55:58.000 --> 56:06.000]  But they found, document can please, the Walgreens insert online and the CDC fact sheets.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  You see all these BS sheets?
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.000]  These will tell you, yeah, I can make you die or give you cancer, cause narcolepsy or epilepsy
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  or pancreatitis that then leads to type 1 diabetes.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  Okay, they admit it all there. But they say, I don't really worry. It's rare.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  No, it isn't. Under law.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.000]  What you want to read is what comes in the actual injection bottle
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.000]  where they may give 20 vaccines out of one bottle. They don't want to give you these.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  I've grown up around medical management. My dads manage hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  I grew up around this stuff. It's how I know.
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  This, this is thrown in the trash.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  These come. It's Bible page thick material.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  And baby, I've got like 15 of them here.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  I've got them all. Let's just randomly pick one right here that I see highlighted.
[56:59.000 --> 57:05.000]  This is a measles mumps rubella vaccine put out by Merkin Co.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  Here, let's just start reading line one.
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.000]  It may cause vascularitis, digestive system, pancreatitis.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  That's shut down the pancreas, diarrhea, vomiting,
[57:18.000 --> 57:26.000]  pretosis, nausea, endocrine system shut down, diabetes shut down, hematic, lymphatics.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  I mean, the doctors all went to medical school.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  They listen, my dad was told all this.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  That's why they always held back. I didn't want to give more vaccines.
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  I worked for a large animal vet off and on for three years.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  He'd call people in and say, listen, don't give your dog a rabies shot every year.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  It's very toxic. They don't need these other shots.
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.000]  They only did it once every seven, eight years because he knew his, his, the animals,
[57:51.000 --> 57:57.000]  he was a large animal that was also small animals were getting sick from the vaccines.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  And right around the time that I wouldn't went to college and didn't work for a vet anymore,
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.000]  they changed the state regulations where they didn't say vaccinate dogs every year.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  But they had it where your dog or cat comes in.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  And to get care, they go, oh, it's time for kitty shot.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  Then you wonder why, oh, what's wrong with kitty? Oh, he's got kitty aids.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  His autoimmunity is gone. We don't know.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  Lots of kitties are dying. Most of the doggies are dying.
[58:21.000 --> 58:27.000]  They got allergies. Their hair is falling out because it's what's in the vaccines.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  The government's been caught putting syphilis in vaccines.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  Why would you trust anything they do?
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  And the doctors and the government know it's killing you.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  They admit it in the insert. It's a fact.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[59:02.000 --> 59:07.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[59:20.000 --> 59:26.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  at the same time.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  We're getting results.
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  and winning because of your support.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  Caveman is back in stock.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  People absolutely love it.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  or by calling toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[59:48.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:55.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Okay, coming up, we've got huge news on the economy.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  We've got news that pot smokers should know, beware.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Killer pesticides and poison are in many of the crops.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  So if you love marijuana or hate it, you need to hear this information
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  from John Rappaport and infowars.com.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  We've got Russia Fires, Yars, ICBM at test range, 6,000 kilometers away.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Successfully, that's a mobile missile.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  We have just got so much on the Iwan Brothers breaking.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  We've got more articles just out today.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I didn't even see this one.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Washington Post, they find a link between flu vaccine and miscarriage.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  Well, doctors always, the inserts always said don't take it.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  If you're pregnant, it causes an autoimmune response in miscarriage.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  I just, it's so sick, but they commit crimes too big to fail.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  They commit crimes that are so insanely big that no one gets in trouble.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  And it's not being done by accident.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  If you just joined us, Hillary admits to loving to practice voodoo,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  her top Democrat friends.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Give me the Wikipedia on these guys.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Former head of the Washington Post, his wife,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  said that they gauge in satanic rituals, including killing people.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  That's the headline.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Gatekeeper of DC Society, Sally Quinn comes out as a cultist,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  uses hex to kill people.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  That's Breitbart.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  That's not Alex Jones.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray resigns at her fifth child sex abuse report.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  He just looks like John Wayne Gacy.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  I mean, it literally is John Wayne Gacy.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  I don't know why they always look.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  It is Haster John Wayne Gacy.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Pull free number to join us.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  I didn't say first time callers at first,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  but I want to get some first time callers in.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  So when you hear these callers hang up,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  we get first time callers a chance at 800-25-99-231.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  What do we do about it?
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  What do we do?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  We realize the people that want to sexualize our kids,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  the people that want sex education for five year olds
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  that includes teaching them how to be transgender or whatever.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  That is 100% using an issue of tolerance to get parents to accept strangers
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  sexualizing your children.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  It is pedophile prepping and sexualization of children.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Period.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  So you don't put up with it.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Period.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  And you break with Hollywood and you break with it all.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Hollywood seeing record low box offices.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  The whole liberal system is falling apart.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Nancy Pelosi can hardly talk. She's so senile.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  I saw a report on drugs this morning about her unable to say words.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  And I thought, oh, that must be yesterday's news.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  She did it again every day.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  She's making up new words and babbling and acting like an insane harpy.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Then I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, Nick, Jason, David, Woody, Justin,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  But I'm going to wait to go to your calls until we come back.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  And I'm going to, as judiciously as I can, get to the latest,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  a one secret server compromises national security.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  That whole thing's unraveling now beautifully.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Nancy Pelosi repeatedly slurbs, flubs the name of Hamilton Playwright.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  And then that was yesterday, the day before.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  She said that Nancy Pelosi orders LGBT group to clap for Obama.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  It says, stop bulleting, not bullying, but bullying the youth.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And of course, it's like 15 times I know of that she said her more.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Well, George W. Bush, you know, is thundered by the Russians
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  and he's a horrible person and we need to look at impeaching him.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  They're like grabbing her dress going, man, it's President Trump.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  Trump, I mean Trump.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  This is their leadership.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  And then you've got her one of her best buddies,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  this doddering Democrat loon over here, Sally Quinn, Hillary Clinton's best buddy.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  I've seen video of Sally Quinn and Nancy Pelosi together.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Can we get this black magic witch in photographs and videos with old Pelosi?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Remember, Pelosi said she never met with a Russian ambassador
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  when Senator Sessions had met with him three times in a year.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  She'd met with him 30 plus times.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  There was photos and video.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Get photos of her with the black magic witch.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  random searches, mandatory identification cards,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  and paramilitary police in our streets.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Due to a request from Listers who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  we have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz is about to know the true meaning of consequences.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  With the permission of through the investigation and will return the equipment,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  but until that's accomplished, I can't return the equipment.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  I think you're violating the rules when you conduct your business that way
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  and should expect that there would be consequences.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Schultz's former IT staffer Imran Awan and Awan's wife Hina may have already been offered
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  an immunity deal from federal prosecutors that will allow the Awans to go into detail
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  regarding exactly what Wasserman Schultz is desperately hiding.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  The fact that this wife is coming back from Pakistan and is willing to face charges as it were,
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  I think there's a good chance that she's going to receive some type of immunity
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  to tell a larger story here that's going to be pretty disturbing to the American people.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  And it's always ironic to me that when you see these kinds of things happen
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  where you have someone that has nefarious or certainly not the best interests of America
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  within the IT system of the United States Congress and they're being paid by a member of Congress,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  it's really pretty frightening.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And the former head of the Democratic National Committee, we might point out,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  who was forced out in disgrace.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Enough of the plot gets even stranger from there.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  A new report by Luke Rosiak of the Daily Caller News Foundation
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  reveals that Awan actually had a second account with access to the House network.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  That account was still active as of yesterday,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  potentially providing Awan secret access to the House network,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  the very same network as we just said he was banned from as a security risk.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  The secondary email is linked to another House staffer who specializes in intel issues
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  and works for House Intelligence Committee member Andre Carson.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Whoa.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Luke Rosiak of the Daily Caller reported now indicted former Congressional IT aide Imran Awan
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Awan had access to all emails and office computer files of 45 members of Congress.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  The fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  if they cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  to acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial account was used,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  meaning Awan could have still had access to the data,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  even though he was banned from the Congressional network.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  The Awans and Imran's brothers Abid and Jamal collectively earned
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  at least $4 million as IT staff for the Democrats from 2009 to 2017,
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  each earning $160,000 a year for what many had deemed as no-show work.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  The Awans would return to Pakistan for months at a time and continue to be paid.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  Capitol Police revoked the Awans' access to the Congressional IT system
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  due to a major breach of data, including the files and emails of dozens of congressmen,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Access requiring security clearances that were likely forged.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats have accused the Capitol Police
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  of being motivated by Islamophobia, but the Awans are rightfully being investigated
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  over charges of tax fraud, bankruptcy fraud, insurance fraud, and extortion.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  In fact, the Awans dug a hole so deep with fraud,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  they will have to spill everything regarding former DNC Chair Schultz
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  and the other Democrats involved in the criminal fleecing
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  and breach of national security of American taxpayers.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Now I'm going to your phone calls live here in the second hour in just a few minutes,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  but I want to get to a few of the latest clips of Nancy Pelosi
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  where she's completely out of her mind.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Pelosi spoke for less than six minutes for prepared text
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  but couldn't get through her remarks without repeatedly slurring and flubbing
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  the name of liberal playwright being honored by the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  was at the Capitol on Tuesday to receive the Freedom Award.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  She repeatedly had trouble saying his name, calling him Lin-Manuel, Madonna,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Ramonda, other times seemed to have trouble speaking all together.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  And look, that happens to everybody every once in a while,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  but she's doing it every time she speaks.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  There's another clip from yesterday where Nancy Pelosi orders
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  the LGBT group to clap for Obama, says,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  Stop Bulleting of Youth.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  It's bullying, lady, and in at least 15 cases,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  because we've got a video that's got them all together in the last year.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  She's called candidate Trump and now President Trump, President George Bush and W.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And they start pulling her arm and she still keeps saying it.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  And then the only person more crazy is Maxine Waters.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Again, she says stuff like, well, the lepo in North Korea and the Putin with Trump in Korea,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  they attack Korea, the Putin and then the only person crazier I guess than that
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  is Congressman Hank Johnson, who literally thinks that Guam is a floating island.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  He doesn't know that islands are mountains sticking up above the ocean
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  or the lake or the river.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  So this is who the global is to put in charge.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Believe me, the people running things above them that have the bills written,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  they know full well what they're doing.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  But the constituency of the Democrats is mirrored by their leadership.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Now, what's scarier than that is the psychopaths like Paul Ryan,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  who's real slick and real smart and who I guarantee he likes American psycho, let me tell you.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  He liked to mount your head on the wall.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  He's got the look.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  I'm not saying he physically carries that out, but he's got the slick together.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  You need to trust me and his action show he's a liar and a globalist.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  But he's competent and evil and they're propping up the Democrats right now
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  against America and the populist movement and Trump's attempt to cut taxes
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  and turn the economy around.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  But just the belief that's coming has White House
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  fueling optimism among manufacturers, record new jobs, AP reports.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Here's another one Washington Post.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  U.S. middle class incomes reached highest level in 2016
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  as we get the numbers a few months later.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Let's go ahead now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  And let's play the latest clip of Pelosi last night. Here it is.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  Okay, so here we are, Lin-Manuel, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda is the great creative talent.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda took the story of our founding
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  and imbued it with a fresh life and infectious spirit.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Lin-Manuel was continuing.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Lin-Manuel, I am truly, truly convinced we celebrate Lin-Manuel Miranda,
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  a man gifted by the muse of history.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Thank you, Lin-Manuel. Thank you, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  He's even laughing at himself.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Woo, you're nuts. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  That is dementia.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  And I'm almost crying because my grandmother until about 92
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  was still always there.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  But then she lost a bunch of weight,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  looked like a concentration camp victim,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  barely beat a stomach infection she had,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  and got down to where she looked like people you've seen
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  in the concentration camp movies.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  I mean, the actual footage.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  I mean, she was almost that skinny. It was crazy.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  And she kind of bounced back, gained a few pounds,
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  and then died quietly in the night.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Her heart just stopped working.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  She went home to Jesus, thank God.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  I'm not glad she died, but thank God she went home to Jesus
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  and out of the pain.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  But she would, when I go there to feed her,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  because we put her in a little medical care place
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  that was about 400 yards from my office
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  so that I could go over there every day.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  She was only in there a few months until she died.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  But we put some weight back on her,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  but I had to physically feed her to make her eat
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  because she'd given up pretty much.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  She'd had cancer, breast cancer for seven years
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  and didn't want to operate it on because her other breasts
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  had been removed.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  So she had cancer all over her body too.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  She was tough as hell.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  But she would do that thing where I'd be talking to her
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  and she'd be there and all of a sudden she'd just disappear,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  get blurred eyes and start going,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  laughing just like Pelosi did.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  So as much as I dislike Pelosi,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  the footage we just showed of your radio listeners
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  on infowars.com, it's on newswars.com,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  it's up on dredgerport.com as well.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  It's very, very painful,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  but it shows how the elite are so arrogant
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  that they have a woman with clear, clear dementia
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  and it comes and goes.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  That almost crying laugh,
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  that is exactly what my grandmother looked like.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  And I've had other family members that,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  you know, you go visit that are very senile.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  Let's play it one more time.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  But again, they say she's the leadership they need.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  This is who they have in there.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  Let's roll it again.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  Okay, so here we are,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  Lin-Manuel, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda is the great creative talent.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda took the story of our founding
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  and imbued it with a fresh life
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  and infectious spirit.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Lin-Manuel is continuing.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Lin-Manuel, I am truly, truly convinced
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  we celebrate Lin-Manuel Miranda,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  a man gifted by the muse of history.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  Thank you, Lin-Manuel.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Thank you, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Now here's the sad part at the end.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Just look at that.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  That is...
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  Can we back that up and just slow it down,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  slow the audio down too, maybe five times?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Anybody that's seen a family member
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  who's got a brain tumor
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  or is completely senile with Alzheimer's,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  you've seen that and it's very painful.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  In fact, my grandmother's husband,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  my grandfather, was only senile
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  about the last six months.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  He had multiple strokes
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  and he would do that exact same thing
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  and beg me not to leave the nursing home
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  and he would just cry and cry and grab my hand.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  And I'd go spend two hours there,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  but it was just soul draining to be around it.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  But imagine, that is the Democratic leader
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  of the House of Representatives
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  making a full-on dementia Alzheimer's face.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Let's play the audio. Here it is.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  Good. Come on.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  She's so scared.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  She knows she's losing her mind.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  Oh, this is sad actually.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Wow, she is so freaked out and so scared.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Oh.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  Oh, I'm not feigning being sad.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  I'm actually really sad right now.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  This is haunting. This is like a horror movie.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  Just look at it.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  She's sick of the crowd. She's sick of the power.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  She's at the end of the line.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  You know, I had a lot of family here in Texas
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  back when LBJ was president.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  And I still got even more friends who were alive then.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  And I've got some friends that are related
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  very closely to the LBJs.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  And they had a business that the president would come into
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  because he was a big horseman.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  And they sold saddles and cowboy boots.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  It was a famous facility.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  It's moved from downtown to north Austin.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And the point is, is that he came in about a month before he died.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  And they said to the president, his cousin said to the president,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  he said, who's another big old mean, tough, smart guy,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  said, is it true you're sad for the war
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  and you're hanging around all these hippies and smoking dope
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  and doing all this stuff and that you're sad for what you did
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  and everything, and he goes, LBJ had grown his hair out.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  He had heart attacks.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  He goes, absolutely right.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  I just want my soul back.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  I'm so scared.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  I wanted power.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  I wanted to be the boss.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  I ended up running the country, being the president.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  All the elites worked for me, everything.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  I've heard the story from the people that actually heard it
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  because other folks were there and then people that heard it
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  secondhand, I've heard the story twice.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  And he said, I'm scared now.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  And I don't know how long I'm going to be alive.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  And about a month later, he died of a heart attack in the air
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  being flown from his ranch outside Austin,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  the San Antonio Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  And so many of these people gained the whole world
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  but lose their soul.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell any more stories about LBJ.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  I'll stop right there because I've got family stories too.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  I mean, he had a whole squad of hit men
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  even when he was in the Congress.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  He just went around killing people.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  Everybody was scared of him.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  But he didn't lose his mind before he died.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  His heart had gone out and he was scared.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  All the stuff he'd done, he was real sad
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  about all the GIs that had gotten killed.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  He wasn't doing it for PR purposes.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  And you look at somebody like Nancy Pelosi
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  in that ghostly footage.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  The headline isn't that she bumbled over the name four times.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  That's what she's trying to say.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda, you watched the whole speech.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  I watched a larger clip of it this morning.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And she is just whacked out of her brain.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  And that's how dementia works.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  It's in, it's out.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  It's like waves.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  It's in, it's out.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  You're sitting there talking to your grandmother?
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  One day she's fine.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Next day she's talking to her dead brother in the room
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  and doesn't even see you.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  Same thing with Pelosi.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  And again, the recklessness of them
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  with McCain stumbling around with a terminal brain tumor,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  he can hardly talk.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  She can hardly talk.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  Look at the wages of death.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Let's play the clip one more time.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Okay, so here we are.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Lin-Manuel, Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda is the great creative talent.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  Lin-Manuel Miranda took the story of our founding
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  and imbued it with a fresh life and infectious spirit.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  Lin-Manuel was continuing.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  Lin-Manuel, I am truly, truly convinced.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  We celebrate Lin-Manuel Miranda,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  a man gifted by the muse of history.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Thank you, Lin-Manuel.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Thank you, Lin-Manuel, Madonna.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Thank you.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And now the total tweet.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  Now, let's go to yesterday.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Columbia Greenlight speech.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  We've got Mike Servas coming up there.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  They're trying to ban him from that speech,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  show all the great free speech going on in this country.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Here's Nancy Pelosi, orders LGBT group to clap for Obama,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  says, stop the bullying of youth.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  There it is.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  Our city is blessed with a large LGBTQ community
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  and a strong history of legacy, of advocacy for equal rights.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  And we were very proud of the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  and President Obama was so very much a part of that.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Now, let's hear it for President Obama.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  That's an applause line.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  I'll tell you when it's an applause line
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  if we're not kind of in sync.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  And now we're fighting for something called the Equality Act,
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  a historic comprehensive bill,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  and I will continue to do everything in our power
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  to end discrimination in the workplace
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  and in every other aspect of life
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  that ensures that all American families are viewed equally
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  in the eyes of the law.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  That's an applause line.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Keep telling folks to applause.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  And stop the bullying of the LGBT community,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  youth in our schools and in our society.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Stop the bullying of our kids.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Innovation must be about inclusion.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  That's what Sam's about.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  Sam Altman, all right, applause line.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  That's enough.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  By the way, inclusion, really?
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  You're bullying while you want to pass.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Because if anyone's feelings are hurt,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  that person's arrested or banned,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  but then only the protected groups have this new royalty
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  to run around everybody getting in trouble.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  And this is a report here we've got where Mike Sernovich,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  they're trying to ban him from speaking at a major university.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  He's going to join us coming up saying,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  quote, we don't let hate mongers and white supremacists speak.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Well, A, he's not a hate monger or a white supremacist,
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  but B, you're reading the quotes by the people.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  What they mean is we don't let free speech happen.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  We want to ban free speech.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  We're in control of free speech.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  So that's all coming up right now, though.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I covered mainstream news earlier.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Hillary Clinton, I wanted to make voodoo dolls of reporters,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  lawmakers, stick them with pens,
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  and one of her good friends,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  her and Nancy Pelosi's good friends,
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  they go to their parties and her husband's funeral.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  Here it is right here in the Washington Post,
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  celebrating Ben Bradley's life and times.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  There's Nancy Pelosi right there in the story,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  celebrating the life and times at the wake for her husband,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  and her and her husband reportedly killed people.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Here's the headline,
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  gatekeeper of DC society, Sally Quinn comes out as an occultist,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  says she used hexes with her husband to kill people.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  If she didn't like the astrology thing that you gave her,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  the reading, she says she'd have you killed.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Whatever that means,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  and that's Hillary and Pelosi's big, big buddy,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  but meanwhile, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  resigns after fifth child sex abuse allegation.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Boy, my surprise.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  We got the audio of Hillary talking about voodoo coming up,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  but right now, who's been holding the longest?
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Is it Nick?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  Is it Jason?
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Is it Steve?
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  Is it Woody?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  Is it Justin?
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  I believe it's Nick in North Carolina.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  Yeah, can you hear me, brother?
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  I can, sir, go ahead.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  Hey, thanks, man.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the LGBT
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  and political correctness.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  I've been active duty Army for almost 18,
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  almost going on 18 years,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  and I want to say within like the past six years or so,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  give or take, plus or months one,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  but in the military alone,
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  political correctness has taken a complete right turn
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  where it almost went from night to day.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  It almost seemed as if all of a sudden,
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  you couldn't say certain things
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  or you couldn't write certain things.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  I'm not saying racist or sexual things,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  but just because I'm an infant for unit,
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  I've been an infant from in my whole career,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  and it blew me away as far as how higher-ups,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  at least within the military,
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  were so scared of a backlash
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  just because someone made an innocent offhand comment.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  But I notice if you're not in like a big business,
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  big corporation or the military,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  you can't do certain things.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Well, that's because it's a larger agenda.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  Once they get you to accept that,
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  then you'll accept anything,
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  including sexualization of children.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  It's social engineering,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  and the whole thing is hidden by the national security state,
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  which is the definition of the occult,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  which means hidden.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Nick, did you want to comment on the occult
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  and top Democrats admitting they're into black magic?
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Do you want to comment on that?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  Uh, yep.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  We're going to come back. Stay with us.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers,
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  if they can make money.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  where you can drop another million dollars
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  you can do to prepare.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  and doing anything to act on that realization
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  increases your chances of survival.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  will help you to weather storms,
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  to absorb an economic shock,
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  or to protect you from home invasion.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  while you educate yourself and others
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  and work for the best-case scenario.

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  We are on the march.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  So from California to Maryland,
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  major towns and cities are voting
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  to let illegal aliens vote.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  Without IDs.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  So citizens don't need IDs.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  Illegals don't either.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Just taking vote over and over again.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Conservatives won't engage in fraud,
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  so they're going to be in trouble.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  College Park to allow non-citizens the right
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  to vote in local elections,
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  including undocumented immigrants.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  That means illegal aliens
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  to vote in municipal elections.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  This is globalism.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  But you can't go to their countries and vote.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  They'd laugh at you.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Now, we have massive reverse censorship going on.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  It's really what I call it.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  It's just another form of censorship.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  Yahoo News.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  Amazon deletes one-star reviews
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  of Hillary Clinton's book that's already at 50% off.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Despite being promoted by every establishment media outlet,
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  it's now dropped out of even the top 10 on Amazon,
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  even though they're buying it themselves
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  and trying to prop it up.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  No one wants to read it, which is too bad,
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  because a lot of the books about yours truly
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  and how she loves Voodoo and the rest of it.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  And that ties in with this report.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  We welcome all speakers.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Columbia Greenlight Speech by controversial Mike Cernovich.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  They go on in the CBS News Report to call him a white nationalist,
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  which he actually fights with those groups,
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  but he believes they have free speech.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  I think they should do away with giving people
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  with hate speech a platform.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  You mean do away with the First Amendment.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  That's what Trayon Fulton added.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  So he's going to be speaking there,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  but I just love how we're going to let the Nazis speak.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  But then that's not, as everybody knows,
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Mike Cernovich, who he is.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  It just shows the next level of deception,
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  and then that's going to tie in.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  He's just with us briefly.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Then we're going to go to Jason and Stephen and Woody and Jason
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  and Nick and everybody else.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Patiently holding.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  We'll finish up with Nick getting into the occult.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  It turns out the former president and CEO
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  and vice president before his death of the Washington Post
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  that helped bring us globalism and sell out America.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  He and his wife, there's a new memoir out by Herb,
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  where she says they killed people they disagreed with.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  She killed them.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  And she believes she did it with black magic.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  And then I've got the articles with Nancy Pelosi
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  being her best buddy, basically,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and being at their wake for her husband,
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  and so much more.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  Sally Quinn throws Ben Bradley,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  one of his last A-list parties,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  gatekeeper of DC society.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Sally Quinn comes out as an occultist,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  used hex to kill people,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  and Hillary Clinton's in her new book saying she
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  thought about turning to voodoo.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Meanwhile, Seattle Mayor Ed Bradley
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  resigns after fifth child sex allegation.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  I saw his photo.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  I thought it was John Wayne Gacy.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  So just more of this every day.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  So Sernovich, I want to get into how they're galloping forward
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  with not just trying to censor us online
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  and ban you online or real Alex Jones online
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  or Ed Sernovich online trying to restrict us,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  blocking us, admitting they're doing it.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  But now, oh, let's stop you from speaking at a university.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  And it's almost like too much that Columbia would even,
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  wow, they're radical.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  Other universities have just banned conservatives from speaking.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  So I guess they're going to send some violent groups out
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  to teach everyone a lesson.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  How dare you?
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  Well, let's get this controversial speech right now.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  What would you say at Columbia?
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  You wicked, wicked devil.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  Yeah, it's very amusing, as always,
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  how upset these people get.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  Over essentially, I'm nothing.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  I'm going to give a talk.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  My talk, they didn't want to ask me what my talk is about,
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  which I find fascinating.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  They're all mad about a talk without asking me
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  what my talk is going to be.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  That just shows you they're not fact-based.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  They're not reality-based.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  I'm actually going to give a talk on new media and journalism
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  because Columbia University has a journalism school.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  And I'm going to say, look, here is how a regular,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  average Joe Mike Sernovich was able to become
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  a highly influential national security reporter.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  Here's how to use new media.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Here's how you use Twitter, Periscope.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  Here's what a meme is.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  So even if they're your enemy,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  you're going to give them tricks to the trade,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  but they don't even want that
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  because they want the power to shut you up.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  They want authoritarianism.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  They don't want a degree in journalism, Sernovich.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  They want a degree in Jack Buddhism.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Exactly.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  I'm here for everybody.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  I view it like this.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Hey, if a liberal comes to my event
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  and they're able to do what I do better than people on my side,
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  hey, that's life, man.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  May the best man or the best woman win.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Their Darwinian competition is what-
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  By the way, we don't sit there and claim
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  we're in Amish outfits or something.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  We consider ourselves to be populist.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  I mean, the average so-called liberal gets around us
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  behind the scenes and goes, man, you're super cool.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  It's liberals that aren't cool.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  We're not trying to make you live away.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  You're trying to make us live away.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Exactly.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  And I tell them, hey, you want to break news?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  You want to do journalism?
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Why would you not want to hear from one of, I mean,
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  how many people know more about social media than I do?
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  You know, maybe four or five people in the country.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  So why not rather than read Hillary Clinton's book
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  where she cries about internet stuff
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  that she doesn't know anything about?
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  Why don't you say, wow, here's one of the people
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  who led an online movement against Clinton.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  Why don't we go ask him?
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Well, you know, how do you get hashtags trending?
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  How do you think up a hashtag?
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  How do you think what's going to be hot for the day?
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  How do you get views?
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  How do I, as a Columbia journalism student,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  develop a worldwide brand and reputation like you have?
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And that's what I'm there for, to talk to everybody
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  about how to do real journalism.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  In fact, they should be clamoring if they wanted
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  to even defeat you to know what you know.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  That's how just devoid of common sense they are.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Yeah, I read their books.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  I read Noam Chomsky and Saul Linsky.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  I've read The Postmodern Thinkers, Eric Fraum, Markuza.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  I've read all the Postmodern Thinking,
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  the Cultural Marxist, the Frankfort School.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  I've read Hillary Clinton's book.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  When it came out, I had pre-ordered it
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  and I stayed up late at night.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  The minute it hit my Kindle at 12, 34 a.m. my time after midnight,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  I stayed up and I read the book.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  In one hour, you sent me the screenshots of what she said.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Exactly.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  I was up reading it because as a journalist,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  my job is to understand what somebody
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  who almost became President of the United States
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  is thinking, doing, how she's living, even though it's a lie.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  So yeah, I screen-capped you, actually.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  I was up.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  That's funny you mentioned that.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  Yeah, for those of you listening in, I was up reading the book
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  and then I found some stuff about Alex in the book.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  So I screen-capped and texted Alex
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  and the very next morning, he's up on it.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  And that's what I'm going to teach these Columbia kids.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  If you're doing real journalism in 2017 in the current year,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  you're always on.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  You're texting people, you're breaking stories,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  you're connecting with people.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  If Hillary Clinton's book comes out at midnight,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  then I'm going to stay up till two or three anymore.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  I'm going to read it.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  If they mention Alex Jones, I'm going to send it to him.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  He's going to find it when he wakes up
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  and he's going to talk about it.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  That's real journalism and that is how we work every day.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  But we can't let this not see evil.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  In fact, we have the CBS News piece about Cernovich.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Let's play that short little piece.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  I'm going to play a clip from Hillary here.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  Here they are discussing the fact that
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Columbia Greenlight's speech
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  by controversial white nationalists.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  That's their headline.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Talk about defamation.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Here it is.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  Columbia University, considered one of the most diverse colleges in the country,
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  will soon be the stage for controversial speaker,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  white nationalist Michael Cernovich.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  Cernovich has been quoted as saying,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  diversity is code word for white genocide.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  If Columbia is a diverse university,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  they should welcome people who might not agree with them.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  The Columbia University College Republicans group invited Cernovich
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  and the far right founder of the English Defense League,
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  to speak on campus.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  But many students say that's a bad idea.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  I think it's incredibly insensitive to minority students
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  and just anyone who could potentially be victimized
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  by the speaker that they've invited,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  because he is a white supremacist.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  What should the university do?
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  I think they should do away with
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  giving people with hate speech a platform.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  While no date has been set for the speakers this fall,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  Columbia University has given the appearances a green light,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  saying, quote, we welcome all speakers
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  invited by our student groups,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  as long as we can ensure that the event will be orderly and safe.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  We reached out to the college Republicans
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  to ask them how and why they chose these speakers,
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  but they declined our request for an on-camera interview
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  and a written statement.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  The college Democrats group believes it's a stunt.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  There are important and valuable intellectual conservative leaders
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  that they could have brought to campus,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  but instead they've chosen to bring provocateurs.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  I mean, the whole point of this, like, charade is to have attention.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Many say the speakers should be allowed on campus.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  They do have a right to speak and be heard,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  but we also have a right to protest.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  People on both sides hope any protests don't get out of hand.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  In Morningside Heights, Hazel Sanchez, CBS 2 News.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  So, just obvious lie.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  They don't show where he's a white supremacist
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  or whoever says it because they don't have it.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  And it is true that major universities are saying,
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  we want white genocide.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Whites are evil. Get rid of whites.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  That's the leftist crazy garbage they're preaching.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  We do expose that because we expose racism
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  and people pushing genocide,
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  just like we protest the white supremacist.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  So, again, the only tenuous connection they have
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  with some quote out of context is that, Mike,
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  when they know full well that the actual white nationalist movement
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  that you've been pointing out took over the alt-right
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  absolutely hates you.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  So, they do the same thing to me with Tom Brokaw saying,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  I'm an unalloyed racist with showing no proof.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  The real threat are these groups trying to ban free speech.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  Exactly. And when she goes,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  what did you mean by that quote?
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  You know, they didn't include my response.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  And my response was that these people on college campuses
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  have said they want to kill white people.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  There are hashtags, kill all white men.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Right now, the number one trending video on YouTube,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  which YouTube has allowed to trend,
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  the ADL allows to trend, involves a child being lynched,
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  a child being lynched,
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  and YouTube and the ADL,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  which has banned many of your videos,
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  so they are actively making editorial choices
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  about what should be allowed on YouTube.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  They have made that the number one trending video on YouTube.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  So, of course, they do want to kill people.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  They're glorifying murder pornography involving children.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  I would love to hear them defend that at YouTube,
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  why we should be showing images of a child being lynched.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And by the way, I got up at 6 a.m. this morning
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  and saw Paul's story, frontpageofmfullwars.com,
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  frontpage of News Wars.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  I watched the video and it was so shocking
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  that I somehow repressed it,
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  didn't even come in and tell the crew I wanted to cover it.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  Guys, please print me the article.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Describe for folks, again,
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  the article and videos on infowars.com,
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  this is a Black Lives Matter inspired video
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  where they're going to kill a white child
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  to show them what it's like
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  to make the child think they're guilty,
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  I guess, and commit suicide.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  Right. The video is so shocking
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  that when I saw the clip initially,
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  I thought, oh, God, you know, I'm being hoaxed,
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  you know, because a lot of people send us fake stuff
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  so then they can go to BuzzFeed and go,
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  ha, ha, ha, you know, we got them good this time.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  I go, there's no way this is real.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  So I did my research again at midnight
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  because that's what you have to do
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  when you're in real news, you have to work all the time.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  And I found the video, and those of you listening,
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  I don't know if they'll want to play the video
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  because it really is appalling.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  There's a rapper who, by the way,
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  was accused of beating up his pregnant girlfriend.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  He gave her multiple black eyes.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  So this is the kind of person that YouTube glorifies
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  as a domestic, a real domestic abuser,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  but they'll call all of us massage-ness.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Meanwhile, if you beat up your pregnant girlfriend,
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  YouTube will make you the number one training video.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  So as you watch the video,
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  it shows a white child and a black child separated
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  and the performing artist, as you were,
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  the Black Lives Matter activist, takes a noose
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  and he ramps the noose around the white child's head.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  The Black Lives Matter activist then moves over to the right
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  and you can see him pulling on the rope.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  And as he's lifting the rope, you can see two young child's legs
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  dangling in the air as he's being suffocated and murdered.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Anybody can watch the video for yourselves.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  That is exactly what happens.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  The image of the child's legs dangling in the air
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  would traumatize pretty much any parent.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  That's why you have to be very careful if you do watch it.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  But again, just as a matter of journalism,
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  I had to watch it and it was quite appalling
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  and I don't see how any parent would watch.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  And then I was watching this morning.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  They don't even make a point of why they're doing it.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  And there's this thing where they say,
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  I'm in a feminist magazine to abort your white baby.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  Michael Moore will be better off when there's no white people.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  They're the ones pushing the racial clash.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  The leftist white's leading it.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  And then meanwhile, you've got major Democrat leaders in the news
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  saying, I'm in black magic. I kill people.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  Leaders of the Democratic Party.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  What is going on with these people?
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  Well, Seattle's mayor recently had to drop out of the race
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  because he was accused of five sexual molestation events,
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  including his younger cousin.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  And I saw something very telling.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  Maybe the crew can find it on my Twitter page
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  where Chris Coloso of CNN goes,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  Ted Cruz liked a Twitter pornography image
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  and one of his staffers did it.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  And he compared that to the Seattle mayor
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  who committed potentially pedophilia
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  and sexual abuse of a minor.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  And that's how CNN treats it.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  He said, oh, somebody on your staff accidentally likes an image
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  involving consenting adults, by the way.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Well, hey, it's just another sex scandal,
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  just like this mayor in Seattle
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  who's accused of molesting people
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  and committing all kinds of heinous crimes.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  So that's where the media is right now.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  And their mind, pedophilia,
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  is just another form of adult pornography.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  So for them, if you're at CNN,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  you don't see a difference between watching adults
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  engaging in sexual activities consensually
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  and somebody like the Seattle mayor
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  who's accused of molesting people,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  because to them, it's just all sex,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  whether it involves a minor or not.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  And they want control of our children.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  They want to sexualize our children.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  That's the end goal to take full control of the species.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And if we'll accept pedophiles sexualizing our children,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  if we'll accept all this, we'll accept anything, Mike.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  Yeah, well, that's the goal.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  The end game of postmodernism
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  and deconstructing society and Western morality
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  is first you destroy the family,
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  then you create broken homes.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Broken homes, you now have higher levels of criminality among men.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  But tell people there are no differences between men and women
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  because then they won't figure out what's really going on.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  So what happens is because men and women are different in various ways,
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  is that if you break up the nuclear family in the home,
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  the boys become criminals
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  and the women become sexual slaves.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  They engage in different patterns, so they're groomed.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  We saw this, of course, in the UK.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  We see this all the time with Rotherham, the rape gangs.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  So the postmodernists, they deconstruct the American family,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  which allows them to create the opiate epidemic,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  the heroin epidemic.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Men commit all these crimes.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  And then that leads women who are now vulnerable
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  to grooming gangs and pedophilia gangs,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  and that's the media's end game.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  And now it's all over the news that Muslims are allowed to rape women
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  and that Muslims get better welfare or better housing.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  And then do you see the police chief in Finland saying,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  no, we want terrorists. They can teach us.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  We want to put full-grown terrorists in high schools
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  because they put 30-year-old men in high schools
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  in some weird experiment to brutalize the young people.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  I mean, this is just fantastical acts of total domination, Mike.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  Yeah, and Sweden has actually said
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  they're not even going to investigate rape anymore
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  because there's so much rape in parts of Sweden
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  that there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  So just like if you live in San Francisco,
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  you know what the police will tell you?
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  Leave your car door unlocked and don't leave any valuables in it
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  because the thieves are going to break into your car anyway.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  They're going to break your window,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  and it isn't like the police are actually going to do their jobs.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  Well, in Sweden, they're now saying,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  hey, if you have a kid, just let your kid get raped.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Hopefully they don't fight too much
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  because then they might actually get really hurt
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  and we're not going to investigate it either
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  because, hey, we got other priorities in that Sweden.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  All right, stay there, my friend.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  I'm going to come back to one more segment with you
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  and callers. I'm going to get to you next hour.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  I promise I got certain of a chance this was breaking
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  with them trying to ban his free speech,
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  but the third hour is coming up.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Nothing but calls.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  Nick, Steven, Woody, Justin, Jason,
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  all of you, stay with us.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth,
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  control, and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk,
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  That's a tall order, but you can get all of that
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  That's true, but you can have tax-free access
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  NASA PAC technology.

[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  Fully Cooked, Fully Hydrated,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  Ready to Eat Right from the PAC Bacon.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  Or Warm and Serve.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Life-saving, Ready to Eat Bacon.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  10-year shelf-life bacon.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  Understand, folks, there aren't any black people
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  being hung by white people.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  The numbers of police shooting black people
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  are at around 100 a year.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  Let's say all those are illegitimate.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  3,000-plus blacks get shot every year in Chicago.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  90-plus percent by other blacks.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  But it just doesn't matter.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  Black on black doesn't matter
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  because the media is making it racial.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  It's made up.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  It's not real.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  If anything, the cops are slow-rolling
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  into black neighborhoods so crime's going up
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  because the cops are scared to respond
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  because they're getting spit at.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  I don't want to hate black people.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  I don't want to sit there and show the footage
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  of all the looting being just black people.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  But that's because the culture has sold the idea
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  that it's okay because you're robbing the rich guy.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  And the left has programmed this.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  There weren't black people looting 60 years ago.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  This is MTV and the modern culture
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  with a group of people just like everybody else
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  that wanted to be invited into the power structure
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  and they got invited in by the scum
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  that runs it to be destroyed.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  And every group of people is being targeted the same way.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  All of our youth are being turned into thugs.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  They're targeting them.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  I'm going to get final comments from Cernovich,
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  but I got so mad last hour
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  with even the Washington Post admitting
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  that vaccines are brain-damaging children
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  and causing miscarriages.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  I didn't even plug and I skipped two breaks.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  I need financial support.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  You need caveman.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  You need X2.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  You need the fluoride-free
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  with Coital Silver and I9 toothpaste.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  We've got huge specials.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  You need air filtration systems.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze is not a luxury.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  It's a necessity.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  It's incredible what it does for your home and your family.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  Support the broadcast.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  Spread the videos.

[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  Buy the products.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  I salute you all.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  Knock off.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  The knockout sleep aid is 40% off.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  40% off.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  Z-Shield heavy metal detox fire.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Knockout is amazing.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Whatever you do, make the commitment.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  One of the last freedoms is to financially support us.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  One of the last freedoms
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  is to physically support somebody.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  So we're all in this together.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  These bullies know they're losing control.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  Mike, I don't just say this to put a good face on it.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  But this is for all the marbles.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  They're pushing so hard and so vehemently
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  because they know they're losing control.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  They know they're being brought out to light.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  That's why they're going, yeah, we devil worship.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Yeah, we're into kids.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Hoping then that somehow makes us shut up and go away.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  I don't see it working.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  But again, the truth is we've got white people everywhere
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  being beaten and attacked and killed right now,
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  not the other way around.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And you've got the sickening culture trying to invoke black folks
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  to start a race war.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  What do we do?
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Yeah, that's why you can't feed into the climate hysteria
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  and hate.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  They want people to hate each other.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  They want us to hate each other.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  And we have a higher calling as freedom fighters.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  We have a higher calling to bring love into the world,
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  to bring compassion into the world.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  And then what we're doing is when we bring love and when people
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  tell me they hate me, I go, thank you, I love you.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  And I hope that one day you learn to love people back.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  That's why I handle all these people now is to just spread love.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  And when you do that, they will see that they're being manipulated
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  by the wicked, manipulated by Hollywood, manipulated by YouTube.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  YouTube wants murder.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  YouTube and the ADL want white children to be lynched,
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  to be hanged alive.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  They want this to be the number one training video.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  And what we need to do is to just call out YouTube,
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  call out the ADL, ask them why they will not disavow this.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Why does the Southern Parvy Law Center ADL
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  and all these groups who aren't even black,
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  why do they hate white people so much?
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  It's what they're pushing.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  Yeah, that's how they raise money.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  They just hate everybody. They hate black people.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  Think about it.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  They just want to get us all clashing,
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  and if they can get the whites to turn into racists,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  is the plan, and go crazy, then they can win.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  Exactly, then they make more money.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  But nobody hates black people more than the ADL.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  Nobody hates black people more than the Southern Parvy Law Center.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  That's right, Mike. Thank you so much.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  Ed Sarnovich on Twitter.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with your calls. Stay with us.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  Nothing but calls. I promise. Bam, bam, bam.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Get ready. On the occult.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  Why do top Democrats now admit their devil worshipers
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  who kill people?
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  That's Breitbart. They admit they kill people.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  In the history of M4's life, we brought out a lot of amazing products,
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality, and so many others,
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process,
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  designed for maximized effects.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products,
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  and this part is most important.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  And ResSecure, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:59:45.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  Alright, I promise I'm going to finish up with these calls
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  that are holding patiently.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  Let me have a special guest joining us.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  I sound like a guy that goes through a buffet and overloads his plate too much.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  My eyes get too big for my stomach.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  It is just insane what's happening in the world today.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  The admissions of vaccines causing brain damage in the Washington Post,
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  North Korea, more mayors getting busted for raping children reportedly,
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  or stepping down Swedish police legalized rape,
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  saying the Muslims can rape people.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  That's mainstream news right here.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  It's total insanity.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  Hillary admits she loves voodoo.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Top Democrats say they do black magic rituals and kill people.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  You can't make this up.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  The gatekeeper of DC Society, Sally Quinn, comes out as a cultist,
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  used hex to kill people.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  It's insane.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  But right now, Nick in North Carolina, thanks for holding.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  You wanted to get into the occult.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  What do you think about all this occult stuff?
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  I didn't used to believe in the occult and things,
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  but the point is, I didn't believe in the movies that rich people were into it,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  but they were telling us what's going on.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  What do you think is happening?
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  I think for one, they're out of their mind.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  I've only had one experience with this.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  I was a young man, I just won the army,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  and I accidentally walked in on a fellow soldier who was conducting these type of rituals,
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  and I immediately walked out.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  I went up as a Catholic and I saw it.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  I knew it was weird, and knowing what I know now,
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  knowing that these people that are in power,
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  that are into this type of thing,
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  that are essentially governing the world or the country,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  whatever you want to call it,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  that they're into these type of things is frightening,
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  because it is the complete opposite of what it means to be a Christian.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  So, they have to be exposed.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  I mean, the only way to do it is to do what you're doing and what we're doing right now.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  Straight up.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  What do you make of Nancy Pelosi suddenly not even being able to talk in public,
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  looking like she's completely out of her mind?
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  Well, like you were stating earlier, my grandmother,
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  or my great-grandmother rather,
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  she passed away almost six, seven years ago.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  She suffered from dementia, and I saw that clip,
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  and I felt the same feelings that you stated,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  that you said that you felt from your family.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  I saw it, and I was like, that's weird.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  That is bizarre.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  Something's wrong with this woman.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  Absolutely, it shows how disconnected they are.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  Let's talk to Woody in Washington, and Justin, Steve, and Jason.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  Go ahead, Woody.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing today?
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  Good, brother.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  Yeah, you know, I think there needs to be an investigation into the Satanic Church in America.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  I mean, you know, they're supporting abortion, uniting with Planned Parenthood.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  There's an article in Breitbart today about their, you know, in Missouri with lawsuits.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  Who's funding these people?
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  You know, they're hiding behind the First Amendment,
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  and we don't know what their real agenda is.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  I think there should be an investigation into the Satanic Church.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  Well, their agenda is power, and they want power over children, and it's a fact.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  And the Satanists always say, oh, we're not really into God.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  We just want personal power and sex.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  We don't want to hurt kids.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  No, it's always about kids.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  It's always about kidnapping kids.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  It's always about aborting babies.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  How many top abortionists have come out later and admitted,
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  I'm a devil worshiper. This is a ritual.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  Well, it's getting into the realm now where the power,
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  I mean, I actually know people that know people,
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  they claim that they have spouses that are into this,
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  that they're devout devil worshipers.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  So this is getting really, and then you had Fox putting on that television show Lucifer,
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  glorifying the devil and making him seem cool and sexy.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  There's a really, really evil intensity behind the scenes.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  That's right. Evil is coming out of the closet.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  Thank you so much, Woody.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Even in Justin, then our next guest.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  This is a direct violation of our fourth amendment,
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying,
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  where we now know that police are collecting information
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  It's already here.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  This is Darren McBreen, and I invite you to join the Resistance.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  TheWars.com
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  I set out to develop Caveman,
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.

[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  to enhance your life.

[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  to toxic ingredients.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Visit InfowarsStore.com
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  and learn more about the new EmRick's Essentials line
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  of organic products.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  That's InfowarsStore.com.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  We'll have open phones through this hour.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  After I get through these three callers that have been holding a while,
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  we're going to open the phones up for stand-out on earth changes,
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  the aftermath of the hurricane, the other hurricane,
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  Jose and more.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  But I saw this video at about 6.30 this morning when I got up
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  It was here in my stack of articles.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  I didn't even think about it until Mike Cernovich mentioned it
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  and it hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  It shows a bunch of Kaepernick whiny baby type people implying
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  that blacks are getting lynched everywhere, being persecuted
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  and murdered and masked by white people,
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  which statistics show for every white person that attacks a black person,
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  10 white people are attacked.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  That's just FBI numbers.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  And I'm not a racist person.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  I feel sad about this.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  It's a minority of racist black folks that are doing this
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  that believe it's their right to do it.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  Just like the head of the new Black Panther Party says in Houston,
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  go out and loot whites.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  Go out and attack whites.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  Don't rob in your own neighborhood.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  So they show simulated crimes,
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  the police attacking black folks lynching,
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  and then they show a black guy teaching a black child
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  how to murder white people.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  And he's saying, fine, you've been killing us.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  We're now going to teach our children to kill you.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  The total breaking of Martin Luther King's idea
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  and the social compact,
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  and it's not like whites are actually doing this statistically.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  It's black folks saying,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  we're going to intensify the 10 to 1 violence.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  Some areas 40 to 1.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  So what is YouTube doing?
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  I'll put a video out criticizing ISIS.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  And they'll put a strike on us and ban the video saying it criticizes Islam
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  for quoting what ISIS says about gays and Christians and others,
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  how they're going to kill them.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  I put out a civil rights video, YouTube will ban it.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  But they are allowing to trend a number one,
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  a rap video that's on infowars.com,
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  where it shows them murdering what looks like a six-year-old white boy.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  So it is a simulated snuff film lynching of a little white kid
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  because he deserves it.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  We're going to teach young black kids to kill white people.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  And this is all done as a stunt to get attention.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  It's what's advertised.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  It's what's pushed.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  It's the total chip on the shoulder culture.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Where why do you have in Miami and Fort Lauderdale
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  and all over the Caribbean every video,
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  nothing but black people looting with machetes and sledgehammers
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  and everything else? Why?
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  Because they've been told you deserve to do this.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  This is how you get ahead in life.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  No, it's how you get put in prison.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  And it's Hollywood in the system doing it.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  And then the majority of black people who aren't involved in crime,
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  they end up culturally getting the blame.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  This is a sick plan.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  We'll get Stan Dayo's take on it coming up.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  Physicists, researchers, great scientists.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  But I promise to finish these calls.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Jason in Connecticut on the big announcement.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  This is not me. This is her own autobiography,
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  top Democrat, Sally Quinn,
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  married to the late head of the Washington Post,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  Ben Bradley, saying they engage in black magic
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  and, quote, killed three people.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  Now, they're obviously completely mentally ill,
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  but Hillary said she likes Voodoo as well.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  That's in her new book.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  And the mayor of Seattle resigns after a fifth child comes forward,
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  saying when they were a small child, he raped the hell out of them.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  Every day some new mayor, somebody stepping down for this.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  I mean, this is an army of evil.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  Jason, what do you think is going on?
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  Well, it's definitely generational.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  I mean, these people are definitely born into it.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  So let me get into what I was going to say about Michael Bloomberg.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  So Michael Bloomberg is building his new Bloomberg place in London,
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  which is actually in the city of London.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  And it's actually built on an old Mithraeum,
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  which is a temple of Mithras.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  Now, that temple of Mithras, the cult of Mithras,
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  was the most popular cult in ancient Rome.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  So and the priests of Mithras would, they would become possessed,
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  and they were inspired to castrate themselves.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  And after they castrated themselves,
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  they would dress in women's clothes and speak like a woman
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  that we refer to as women right after that.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  You know, you're really showing your historical smarts, Jason.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  You know that there is a Mithra temple in the old city of London
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  where the Romans had their city.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  It's the financial head of the world.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  It's its own private city inside London.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  I knew there was a Mithra temple there.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  I know that Mithra priests basically were crannies,
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  but I did not know that Bloomberg was building on that site.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  Yes, right over that site.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  And they're actually opening it up so you could go and see this
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  after the, his Bloomberg place is built.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  I think it might be built right now.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  But actually, an author, Tracy Twyman, she talked about that a lot.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  She's on your buddy's show, Freeman Flies.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  She was on there in July.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  She would be a good person to get on about that
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  because she really goes into Bloomberg's place in the occult,
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  all the occult aspects of that.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  She also talks about the Knights Templar,
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  which is definitely connected with pedophilia.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  And the rights of these Knights Templar, the initiation rights,
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  the word, sodomy, et cetera, to give themselves power.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  And, you know, people or boys as young as 11 were inducted
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  into the Knights Templar.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  So that's why you get all the pedophilia kind of stems from that.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  Wow, we're searching.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  What do we search?
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  Bloomberg building on Mithra site?
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  Where did you see this?
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  You could do, it's on the London Mithraim, a future for the past.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  Mithraim, it's M-I-T-H-R-A-E-U-M, a future for the past.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  And it's on, actually, Bloomberg.com.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  I understand.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  London Mithraim, a future for the past, Bloomberg.com.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Or just Mithraim, Bloomberg.com, put that into the search engine.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  And we will pull that up.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  That is amazing.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Listen, I've been around big Hollywood people.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  I've been around globalists.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  I've been around it.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  They're all obsessed with the occult.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  Some of them are into black magic, some of them are into New Age,
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  or others have become Christian because of their awareness of it.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  The London Mithraim, a future for the past.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  There it is.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  Bloomberg's new European headquarters in London will be located.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  This is a year ago they said it.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  On the UK's most significant archaeological site,
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  a temple dedicated to the Roman god Mithras,
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  a stewardess of the ancient site of artifacts.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  Bloomberg is creating an innovative museum experience
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  that will change the way we encounter archaeology.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  This video explores the history of the site,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  the mysterious cult of Mithrism.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  And it goes on and provides a sneak peek
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  on the forthcoming exhibition.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  Wow, thank you, Jason.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  That's a powerful caller.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Coming up, we're going to have Stan Dayo with us.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  We'll go a little bit the next hour.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  So he has plenty of time.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  I got a little bit behind today.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  I appreciate Stan Dayo, as you can see on TV,
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  waiting for us with all his great insight.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Two more callers are going to write to Stan Dayo
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  and then open the phones up for you to talk to Stan Dayo
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  on other subjects.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  But I know he knows about the occult as well.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  Justin in Arkansas.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  That was an amazing caller we just had.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to talk about
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  pedo-gate or pizza-gate,
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  just the mass pedophilia that goes on in the United States.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  There's 800,000 missing children a year,
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  and how is this not front-page news?
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  That's right.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  They also always spin it,
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  because the numbers as high as a million,
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  they go, oh, a lot of them are runaways,
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  but if you index it, you're talking a good
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  250,000 below the age of five.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  Now, that's a quarter-mill little kids getting grabbed,
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  confirmed, and a lot of those kids above five
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  are getting kidnapped, too.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  And I just wanted to tell the listeners,
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  you know, investigate this for yourself.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  Be careful, but talk to your local officials,
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  talk to your local cops.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  They know what's going on.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  They're not allowed to do anything,
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  but there's groups of us, patriots, regular Americans,
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  we want to find out what's going on, we want to stop it.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  Well, I agree the time's coming where
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  it's not going to be some revolution or something
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  going after the government.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  These pedophiles, people are already going after them,
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  is what I'm told.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  A lot of them are falling down, hitting their heads.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  A lot of them are going for a swim.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  I mean, it's already happened.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  They're terrified, and I've talked to local police
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  off the record in my town in Little Rock State Police,
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  and they tell me, you know,
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  if you talk about this to the wrong person,
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  you could end up facing down the river.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  Or worse.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  Well, you know it's the state police that helped
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  expose Bill Clinton in your state, finally.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  They were also the ones covering up for him,
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  but yeah, Bill Clinton's involved in all this stuff.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  Yeah, the voodoo, 1975, in Bill's book,
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  him and Hillary went to the voodoo ceremony in Haiti.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  Not to mention all the other scams they run in Haiti.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  That's right.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  They said they had their second honeymoon in a voodoo ritual,
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  and then Obama talked about it too.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  That's what I mean. You can't make this up.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  In fact, I've got a copy of the book here in the office.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  Which one is that where he admits he likes voodoo?
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  My life, Bill Clinton.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  Yeah, what page is that?
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  We can search it.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  Just Bill Clinton talks about voodoo rituals in my life.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  And then Hillary, what do you make of her
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  in her new book talking about voodoo?
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  I think that the political elite are just
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  throwing it in our faces.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  They're openly admitting it now.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  And just everything, the decency,
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  they're desensitizing us to all this.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  The pedophilia, the devil worship, the voodoo, murder, everything.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  Well, they're going to start,
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  don't you think the way the world works in history,
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  they're going to start getting desensitized and something else?
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  Well, there it is, Washington Post.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  See, when I say there's lots of news articles about this,
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  There it is. That's why I get so upset.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  The news screen, Washington Post,
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  the time Bill and Hillary went to a voodoo ceremony in Haiti.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  And now their best buddies are admitting
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  that they were killing people with voodoo.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  Now, whether that's true or not, these are crazy people, brother.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  Yeah.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  And if anybody wants to kind of take a look
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  and they haven't really researched this any,
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  there's two good documentaries they can watch.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  Number one, who took Johnny about the story of Johnny Gorsh?
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  Yes.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  It's a very powerful documentary.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  And then Conspiracy of Silence.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  It was filmed in 1994.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  You know who released Conspiracy of Silence on the Internet, right?
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  Who?
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  Oh, I'm not bragging.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  I didn't even want the credit.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  I released it.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  Yeah.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  It had been made for Discovery Channel and Never Heard.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  We're the ones that put it on the Internet.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  Well, you were a hero, Alex.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  No, I'm not.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  No, I'm not.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  I couldn't help it.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  We put it out.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  All right. God bless you, Justin.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  Let me tell you folks, these people mean business.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  They are rising up.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  Now, Stephen, we're going to get to you,
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  but I got to go stand out straight ahead and we'll work in 800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231,
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:20:11.000]  and we'll be right back.
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  Thank you.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  Thank you.
