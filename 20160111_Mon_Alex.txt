[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:35.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Roger Stone some of the brains
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.880]  behind the Trump victory march is going to be joining us for a full hour ladies and gentlemen
[00:42.880 --> 00:55.240]  coming up today on this Monday worldwide broadcast the 11th day of January 2016 Paul
[00:55.240 --> 01:03.880]  Joseph Watson will be joining us dealing with the latest info wars dot com article about the
[01:03.880 --> 01:16.920]  public development of what radical Muslim culture calls conquest by rape or the terrorism of rape
[01:16.920 --> 01:23.800]  that is being directed at Europe and the United States and other areas by design shocking footage
[01:23.800 --> 01:30.800]  of the radical jihadist in the Middle East raping and torturing women and of course famously
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.640]  they've grabbed female reporters off the streets while they're reporting how great they are and
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.160]  how wonderful it is they overthrew the Egyptian government remember that and then they take a
[01:40.160 --> 01:46.360]  woman and a hundred plus people gang rape her and then the feminist all make excuses about it
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.560]  because it doesn't fit into the proper narrative that's all coming up today and now Merkel says
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.920]  you know what it's 10 million more migrants see first it's 100,000 then 300,000 then a
[01:58.920 --> 02:05.040]  million then three million then oh I'm afraid it's total invasion and after 10 million it'll
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.960]  be 50 million and after 50 million will be 100 million and after 100 million will be 300 million
[02:09.960 --> 02:17.080]  because there are a billion 200 plus million Muslims and about half of them are total sympathizers
[02:17.080 --> 02:24.040]  with jihadist you know that woman that quotes silently protested wearing her hajib standing
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.640]  up at the Trump rally who was escorted out for standing up behind Trump obviously try to disrupt
[02:28.640 --> 02:37.600]  things turns out she's hosted parties for the convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center
[02:37.600 --> 02:45.880]  bombing Muslim woman 56 kicked out of Donald Trump event and booed by audience after standing
[02:45.880 --> 02:52.480]  silent protests when he suggests Syrian refugees are affiliated with ISIS affiliated most of them
[02:52.480 --> 02:58.600]  are invaders that got kicked out well now there's a new article detailing exactly what she's been
[02:58.600 --> 03:09.560]  connected to supporting Sharia law and jihad she supports wearing a full beaky pursuit a full
[03:09.560 --> 03:17.160]  barca but to get in the event obviously she's had her head and stuff covered up and I'm just sorry
[03:17.160 --> 03:22.520]  my daughters aren't gonna put the hood on their head and I'm not gonna throw them into public
[03:22.520 --> 03:27.080]  schools they get intimidated as I've got a jihad gang into doing it that's happening more and more
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.400]  as impressionable kids get scared under gang mentality matter what the gang is white supremacist
[03:33.400 --> 03:39.320]  black supremacist Crips bloods Mexican mafia but more and more there's Muslim pressure groups
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.960]  in schools are in Europe especially and the children especially girls go under Stockholm
[03:44.960 --> 03:53.440]  syndrome and convert to Islam at age 14 15 and then get on a plane and fly in to be sex dolls
[03:53.440 --> 04:01.200]  for the jihadis remember all the young women in England and France and in Australia getting on
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.320]  airplanes running away from mommy and daddy with their little spoiled rotten cards because it was
[04:06.320 --> 04:12.120]  such a radical thing and then getting to the hellish pits and being you know used and passed
[04:12.120 --> 04:19.440]  around by the jihadis and then crying and making phone calls back mommy mommy get me out mommy mommy
[04:19.440 --> 04:28.120]  so this is the wages of tyranny is complete enslavement and humiliation it's all coming up
[04:28.120 --> 04:35.400]  oh my gosh there is just so much to cover today it is all incredibly important strap
[04:35.400 --> 04:43.480]  yourselves in get ready we have multiple jihad attacks in the US Canada and France and the media
[04:43.480 --> 04:49.760]  including Fox News I was on the elliptical this morning and and they said radical you know
[04:49.760 --> 04:56.720]  shoots police officer in America no he was a jihadi but they won't say it even on Fox
[04:56.720 --> 05:04.200]  president Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about until now for
[05:04.200 --> 05:09.560]  one thing he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare
[05:09.560 --> 05:14.400]  that's right Obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.680]  requirements because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to
[05:18.680 --> 05:24.240]  support the socialist program once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was they
[05:24.240 --> 05:28.720]  wanted exemptions from the very same law they force on everyone else which Obama gave them
[05:28.720 --> 05:34.440]  president Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother so-called charity
[05:34.440 --> 05:39.400]  the Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a nonprofit
[05:39.400 --> 05:44.400]  application within just one month from the Barrick H. Obama Foundation additionally the IRS
[05:44.400 --> 05:49.400]  illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's taxes and status you can find
[05:49.400 --> 05:55.640]  out more from the article on info wars dot com entitled 75 times Obama broke law during presidency

[07:55.000 --> 08:23.000]  888-253-3139 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[08:25.320 --> 08:38.520]  David Bowie 69 died of cancer yesterday an unnamed cancer i personally really like
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.600]  david bowie's music the full spectrum of it is it's all good a lot of it is excellent
[08:48.040 --> 08:53.320]  and what's even more interesting is his movies like the hunger the man who fell from space those
[08:53.320 --> 09:13.320]  are excellent 1970s and 1980s movies listen to this lyrics right here
[09:24.120 --> 09:33.400]  so there goes David Bowie making the jump in the hyperspace didn't agree with a lot of his politics
[09:33.400 --> 09:40.440]  but definitely a very very talented artist and i tell you can't get a more english uh or welsh name
[09:40.440 --> 10:00.520]  than his real name good lyrics his real name was david jones that's why the old british navy
[10:00.520 --> 10:07.320]  called the bottom of the ocean david jones's locker because so many david jones's went to the
[10:07.320 --> 10:13.240]  bottom of the sea that's the most common name at least uh in olden times in jolly old england is
[10:13.240 --> 10:19.640]  david jones that's my dad's name i wonder why my grandparents gave him the most common name there is
[10:20.440 --> 10:27.000]  at least uh in jolly old england but uh david jones at age 69 is dead and it's not my father
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.840]  but i tell you i got up this morning about 6 30 went in turn on the computer david bowie's dad
[10:32.840 --> 10:37.400]  real name david jones i knew his name was david jones but when you look at it and basically the
[10:37.400 --> 10:45.160]  same age as my dad it gives you a jolt that man i want my dad to be around as long as he can be
[10:45.160 --> 10:51.640]  that that's my personal angle on the whole uh david bowie situation and my parents are obviously
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.720]  david bowie fans and so i grew up listening to it and my mom you know showing me david bowie movies
[10:57.720 --> 11:07.480]  uh and we've got so much huge news here to cover but it is in understanding that we're all
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.560]  just flesh and blood we are not immortal
[11:17.560 --> 11:25.400]  on this plane of existence
[11:27.880 --> 11:33.480]  and so many people don't even think about the fact that you are here today forever gone
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.520]  but that what you write and what you speak and what you build and what you say goes on
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.920]  and even more importantly if you have children and they have children then the genetics not
[11:44.920 --> 11:50.440]  just of you but of all your ancestors and their instincts and their ideas
[11:51.480 --> 11:58.680]  crystallized are passed on into the future what an incredible alchemy of god the creator
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.640]  and then of course there is a soul science mathematics interdimensional research has only
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.920]  proven it so many atheists that are quantum mechanics experts physicists genetic engineers
[12:10.920 --> 12:18.440]  actually become very religious very spiritual i should say once they begin to really look
[12:18.440 --> 12:27.000]  into how the universe works it was the great mathematician and physicist
[12:27.000 --> 12:37.800]  Albert Einstein that said god does not play with dice when it comes to creation
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.600]  but i certainly get atheists that want to reject the whole religious system
[12:45.160 --> 12:52.840]  as a sophistic sycophantic fraud of men and women setting themselves up as the priesthood
[12:52.840 --> 12:59.640]  to tell you that they are the way to god that they are the way to eternity that they are the way
[12:59.640 --> 13:03.560]  to the mysteries of the universe when they are not most of them not
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.560]  christ over and over again said you do not need to go to these Pharisees
[13:09.560 --> 13:15.080]  and Sadducees that pray up during the Sabbath on the hilltop in front of everybody and tell
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.120]  everybody how good they are and how they follow all of these levitical rules that they're always
[13:20.120 --> 13:29.480]  expanding and twisting know the kingdom of god is in your heart that does not mean you are god or
[13:29.480 --> 13:36.920]  that you are the kingdom of god like the new ageers would say but you are little g made in the image
[13:36.920 --> 13:46.280]  of god and are able to envision and create like god but on a much smaller scale and that is in
[13:46.280 --> 13:55.160]  genesis and you look at what we built so far it's nothing the eye is not seen ear is not heard the
[13:55.160 --> 14:02.360]  mind has never even imagined what we can do and the technocrats know this and they want to hoard
[14:02.360 --> 14:09.240]  all the developments humanity comes out with they want to centralize it all and keep it for themselves
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.360]  and truly play god now i'm going to get into all the huge news here in a moment but here's
[14:14.360 --> 14:25.800]  MIT technology review this is propaganda i have seen similar articles from MIT and from BBC
[14:28.680 --> 14:37.480]  and from other prestigious publications for 20 years since i became a newshound and began
[14:37.480 --> 14:43.160]  reading up to 10 newspapers a day back at that time now it's even more but i scan the instant i
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.120]  saw this headline i knew what it was but i didn't just believe myself i read the article this morning
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.200]  you would have heard this on the show if you've just been listening a year probably 50 times
[14:54.200 --> 14:57.400]  if you've been listening 10 years you've probably heard it thousands of times
[14:59.880 --> 15:06.440]  so they used to talk about it even more all the rest of what we look at is window dressing
[15:06.440 --> 15:19.560]  human animal chimeras are gestating on us research farms and then i knew what the next line would be
[15:20.440 --> 15:29.880]  they're growing human tissue in cows and pigs just like they call babies tissue or embryonic
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.520]  stem cells when they're seven months old being butchered live on a table and dissected they take
[15:34.520 --> 15:40.360]  them out live and then hook them up to apparatus to keep them alive and then harvest them told you
[15:40.360 --> 15:48.200]  that 20 years ago now it's mainstream news i've told you this thousands of times and i've seen
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.320]  this article let's not exaggerate a hundred plus times similar it's always the same playbook
[15:55.000 --> 16:02.760]  oh did you know some firms are starting to implant tissue inside cows inside pigs ladies and gentlemen
[16:02.760 --> 16:11.400]  they're not implanting tissue they're growing humanoids up to 50 and 60 pounds inside cows
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.880]  and inside pigs and i'm going to say something else right now that's what we know was going on
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.440]  30 years ago because when i learned about it 20 years ago it was in research papers
[16:22.440 --> 16:33.320]  declassified 10 years before that so i was 12 years old and they were creating humanoids for
[16:33.320 --> 16:42.760]  organ harvesting inside cows and pigs publicly and i come on air and tell people this without
[16:42.760 --> 16:47.880]  showing an article and we always get emails or comments going there's that crazy nut i've seen
[16:47.880 --> 16:52.840]  national news story saying he thinks they're growing humans and cows or he thinks they're
[16:52.840 --> 17:03.400]  trying to make the fish gay what do you like fish sticks in my fish tank khanye west south park this
[17:03.400 --> 17:12.360]  isn't south park folks they've had thousands of articles thousands thousands sometimes thousands
[17:12.360 --> 17:18.920]  a year for a decade making fun of me about the chemicals in the water causing males to become
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.120]  female and females to become hyper-female by the way making women get cancer at accelerated rates
[17:25.960 --> 17:31.800]  lowering male fertility and how it's making the fish and amphibians bisexual and they make a big
[17:31.800 --> 17:39.400]  joke because they don't want people to be serious and look into this they want to go ha ha she says
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.000]  they're messing with your sexuality aha and then i show pinning on documents
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.880]  they don't want that so we've got all this other huge news and all these important things happening
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.760]  it's a big show today donald trump leading in three big national polls trouncing hillary clinton
[17:54.760 --> 17:59.800]  20 of democrats coming over to him devastating victory i think he's for real i think they may
[17:59.800 --> 18:07.640]  try to kill him we have his shadow campaign head i mean stone left the campaign so he can run things
[18:07.640 --> 18:14.040]  on his own obviously uh that the campaign can't do like super packs and all the rest of it but it's
[18:14.040 --> 18:19.480]  all completely kosher and so he can fire torpedoes about the clinton raping and then the bushes and
[18:19.480 --> 18:24.440]  their drug dealing by the way stone of course was one of nixon's top people one of george bush
[18:24.440 --> 18:30.760]  seniors top people super high level connected one of the top republican strategist uh in the country
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.520]  that's why he works for trump and he's gone full alex jones coming here on air just saying the
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.920]  government runs the drugs uh world government we've got to stop them that's who's advising trump
[18:41.720 --> 18:47.720]  a guy that used to run us operations to get people elected in other countries not just here
[18:48.760 --> 18:54.840]  you could probably guess what kind of guy he is real serious and he's coming on that's all important
[18:57.480 --> 19:04.680]  but human animal chimeras are gestating on us research farms a radical new approach oh it's
[19:04.680 --> 19:09.880]  radical it's new that's how they sell like it's cool we're only having army gun confiscation drills
[19:09.880 --> 19:15.880]  in your town you're very special that's a tactic they use a radical new approach to generate human
[19:15.880 --> 19:24.520]  organs is to grow inside pigs or sheep and then it goes through all of it but don't worry it's tissue
[19:24.520 --> 19:32.280]  no it's not they've been unsuccessful just growing them in their and basically they're
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.480]  they're humans without heads because that even freaks the researchers out too much so they can kind
[19:37.480 --> 19:41.720]  of grow them like they want and they can argue well it's just the person i want those organs
[19:42.520 --> 19:48.760]  but they've had to make the humans the humanoids part cow part sheep part pig to implant them so
[19:49.800 --> 19:54.760]  again MIT here it is we're not making enough i know we can make gay fish jokes and stuff but
[19:54.760 --> 20:01.000]  if you like dying of cancer just keep laughing something just happened that is explained why
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.280]  survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country it
[20:06.280 --> 20:12.840]  caught me totally by surprise and it involves fema i couldn't believe fema tried this until i saw
[20:12.840 --> 20:18.040]  proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but i think you deserve to know exactly what

[24:59.240 --> 25:02.920]  protect the radical jihadists because this is part of a takeover
[25:05.480 --> 25:12.280]  paris police station attacker lived in german refugee shelter a man who tried to attack a paris

[25:26.280 --> 25:32.280]  two men named muhammad try to shoot up nightclub in canada cbc but that's not their headline
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.280]  you have to read into it that their names are both muhammad but oh it wasn't a muslim
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.720]  group that came in and tried to shoot up the bar but they got tackled instantly thank god
[25:39.720 --> 25:45.400]  a shooter of philadelphia police when described as quiet devout muslim yeah he runs up in muslim
[25:45.400 --> 25:52.840]  guards screaming a la akbar and shoots the cop who then starts bleeding everywhere this happened
[25:52.840 --> 26:00.760]  last week they cover it up and i'm watching fox news this morning on the elliptical and my phone was
[26:00.760 --> 26:08.440]  dead or i would have tried to videotape it but it wasn't charged and then the elliptical that i have
[26:08.440 --> 26:13.160]  in the bedroom it doesn't have a dvr on it the tv doesn't have one and so i couldn't rewind it but
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.560]  everybody saw it i'm sure it was like eight o'clock this morning and they go coming up later today
[26:18.520 --> 26:25.000]  radicals in america attacking the police extremist no it was a muslim attacker so then
[26:27.240 --> 26:32.760]  i'm driving in listening to national news radio and they're saying the same thing about the cop i mean
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.800]  it's like a it's five six days after it happened and they won't even say it's a muslim i mean you
[26:37.800 --> 26:41.800]  better believe if it was an nra guy with an nra sticker on his car they just said that
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.040]  look at that headline gunman shoots philadelphia police officer in the name of islam cnbc got it
[26:48.040 --> 26:56.520]  right reuters got it right why didn't fox news because the fox news is there to control conservatives
[26:56.520 --> 27:02.920]  ladies and gentlemen just like the rhino neocon republicans are who are trying to destroy and
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.120]  are in the news today saying donald trump is going to destroy the republican party why because he's
[27:08.120 --> 27:14.440]  a populist like reagan and about to sweep 47 states many analysts say they're there to make sure
[27:14.440 --> 27:20.520]  jeb bush or hillary gets in to continue the giant screw job if a donald trump gets in that they might
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.320]  repeal obama care that's so unpopular and criminal the socialists don't even support it now that's
[27:25.320 --> 27:30.840]  why they got waivers to actually get free health care oh you're an obama group an obama union you
[27:30.840 --> 27:37.960]  do get free everybody else gets triple prizes that's so liberal everything they do is discriminatory
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.800]  and sickening on working americans i don't care what color you are
[27:44.680 --> 27:52.440]  so i've got three articles here where the paris police are attacked the bar is attacked by two men
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.640]  named mohammed attacking shooter of philadelphia policemen ascribe as a quiet devote muslim reuters
[27:57.640 --> 28:05.560]  but you watch fox news and they're calling it extremist and again i didn't want the wars with
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.560]  muslim countries i don't think they're all bad people but the folks they're bringing in that
[28:09.560 --> 28:14.680]  invaded syria are the worst of the worst and by the way coming up paul watson joins us and then

[28:37.960 --> 28:41.720]  really changing a lot of what he said and you know i went and interviewed him and he basically said
[28:41.720 --> 28:46.600]  i've changed i do get mad and say some things i probably shouldn't but i don't want a civil war
[28:46.600 --> 28:53.640]  i don't want to race war and so that's a big deal to have louis fair con i don't want to

[34:34.840 --> 34:39.800]  to several big rock stars and they say that no one they've ever seen party more than lemmy
[34:40.360 --> 34:46.440]  except maybe al jorgensen of ministry and they say that if there's ever a nuclear war the only
[34:46.440 --> 34:53.560]  thing living will be al jorgensen of ministry and cockroaches i've been told that by two big
[34:53.560 --> 34:59.240]  rock stars they the total machines uh ladies and gentlemen we do celebrate the dead the good the
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.840]  bad and the ugly because we're pro human here we we we see the negative in humans but we also
[35:04.840 --> 35:14.360]  see the positive all right um coming up trump is turbo charging in every major poll against
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.160]  celery it's huge it's a landslide unless they steal the election we're going to talk to his top
[35:19.160 --> 35:31.880]  strategist roger stone coming up for a full hour we're also going to get into obviously what's
[35:31.880 --> 35:37.240]  happening with the rape culture and the clinton's and how that ties into the whole muslim culture
[35:37.240 --> 35:42.200]  of raping and why the left loves to actually abuse women so much and how they get away with
[35:42.200 --> 35:47.480]  because it all ties together with these brutalizers i mean i would never think of raping a woman
[35:47.480 --> 35:53.560]  zero zero desire no matter how beautiful they were it just turns my stomach it's the antithesis
[35:53.560 --> 35:57.880]  but a lot of people want it because it's the power they want over someone
[35:59.960 --> 36:05.400]  and i guess that's people that don't have power want power over the innocence but when you've
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.360]  got real power you want to build other people up and that's the problem we're not led by real
[36:10.360 --> 36:17.400]  leaders that want to build civilizations and their fans of humanity we're also going to get into
[36:19.720 --> 36:25.160]  the latest with what's happening with the economy what's happening with science
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.040]  what's happening with russia which is a big brzezinski calling for all these wars
[36:32.040 --> 36:37.480]  and of course coming up in about 12 minutes or so after paul watson leaves us i'm going to
[36:37.480 --> 36:45.080]  air a small first clip of the lewis ferrican interview that'll air next wednesday now the video
[36:45.080 --> 36:52.840]  is up on info wars dot com with the headline lewis ferrican agrees with donald trump
[36:54.280 --> 37:02.200]  on syrian refugees lewis ferrican agrees with trump plan to limit migrants
[37:02.200 --> 37:09.000]  it's it's red linked and the entire i got two hours with it two hours with it
[37:09.640 --> 37:14.680]  there's a few you know bathroom break whatever in there change tape breaks or whatever card breaks but
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.360]  we've got almost two hours of footage it's all incredible lewis ferrican stuff and and again
[37:20.360 --> 37:26.440]  i went there to try to get him to push to not have a race war to not go along with the soros plan
[37:26.440 --> 37:31.240]  he agreed that's a plan he agreed it's happening and he agreed it needs to be stopped
[37:31.240 --> 37:34.440]  you can say what you want about lewis ferrican a year ago 10 years ago 20 years ago
[37:35.320 --> 37:40.680]  they take a lot of what he says out of context some of it i i i disagree with even in the context of
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.880]  you know the full clip that isn't what's happening here i'm trying to be diplomatic he's trying to
[37:45.880 --> 37:55.720]  be diplomatic and and we're actually trying to build a better world does that mean i endorse
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.720]  everything lewis ferrican says absolutely not same thing back at me but it's a big deal because
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.560]  he's one of the biggest black leaders in the world he is a big deal in fact they say a profit's not
[38:05.560 --> 38:10.760]  under their own country to have that quote and that applies to people that aren't profits but the
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.800]  point is that he's even bigger in europe and africa and places and the middle east than he is here so
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.880]  him coming out saying the things he says is powerful about world government new world order that he's
[38:21.880 --> 38:27.080]  been watching me for a long time they would do stuff like turn a computer on and then i'd already
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.560]  be on they'd be oh excuse us and they're like we listen every day we watch every day i was up there
[38:31.560 --> 38:37.480]  in the big boardroom with these guys in the entire leadership of the nation of islam basically
[38:37.480 --> 38:42.920]  and i recognize these faces a lot of them were very successful black business leaders you know
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.240]  people that were well known and i was like i recognize these people's faces and these people
[38:47.240 --> 38:53.720]  that like own businesses your big companies you name it and they were all super serious super
[38:53.720 --> 38:59.400]  focused i was shocked by it i mean they were as serious as like being in a room with a bunch
[38:59.400 --> 39:04.200]  of military commanders or something uh and so that was very refreshing compared to the brain
[39:04.200 --> 39:08.200]  dead public again i'm not endorsing what they're saying you're doing but the globalist are the
[39:08.200 --> 39:14.280]  ones putting the cancer viruses in the vaccines so that lewis fair con is coming up the first look
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.560]  at it the video right now is on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and imagine with lewis fair

[42:07.000 --> 42:11.240]  watson will come back with a loose fair con he's giving us a preview of what's coming up in a big
[42:11.240 --> 42:15.640]  breakdown and more news in the fourth hour he's going to be hosting today he is the editor at
[42:15.640 --> 42:20.840]  large of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com one of the most prolific successful writers in
[42:20.840 --> 42:26.280]  the world today i should just tell you about the success of paul watson his articles alone on info
[42:26.280 --> 42:32.200]  wars and prison planet now get ready for this are read by more than 20 million people on our
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.800]  platforms can you imagine everywhere else they're copied to just an example of how the new york times
[42:38.600 --> 42:44.520]  it's bankrupt it's a joke the patriot movement is the new new york times paul joseph watson from the
[42:44.520 --> 42:51.240]  united kingdom it is great to have you with us i tell you this situation in europe where they bring
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.640]  in millions of refugees they rape and mass they're allowed to rape the new footage of them shooting
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.600]  guns we're going to roll some of that in the background in cologne women with children running
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.520]  and fear the police doing nothing now if you come out and demonstrate against them the police
[43:04.520 --> 43:10.920]  literally attack with tear gas in cologne yesterday paul watson they've announced 10 million more
[43:10.920 --> 43:18.280]  to stream into europe what's the master plan paul watson the master plan alex is to import a bunch
[43:18.280 --> 43:23.800]  of people that will vote for bigger government they become dependent on government their children
[43:23.800 --> 43:29.320]  become dependent on government and it creates a bigger state that's the political motive of course
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.640]  corporations get to hide high them as cheap labor and drive everyone else's wages down so there are
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.000]  number of motives but in fact you have german politicians and this was in my article the rape
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.560]  of europe going before parliament and saying muslim migrants will be the majority in major
[43:47.560 --> 43:53.560]  german cities actual german citizens will be the minority and this is a good thing and anyone who
[43:53.560 --> 44:00.120]  disagrees with that is a right-wing extremist or racist well first of all islam isn't a race
[44:00.120 --> 44:06.040]  i have to say that over and over again second of all this rape culture that's now being imported
[44:06.040 --> 44:13.320]  into the west primarily affects muslim women in those migrant camps for months and months and
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.720]  months we've been reporting on people in and around the migrant camps being raped both muslim women
[44:19.720 --> 44:26.200]  and german citizens swedish citizens norwegian citizens so then when this mass molestation
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.280]  happened in cologne helsinki hamburg stuttgart zürich all these are the european cities
[44:32.280 --> 44:37.800]  the authorities were all oh this is so shocking that this happened who could have possibly foreseen
[44:37.800 --> 44:45.000]  this when for months and months you had top social services organizations in germany saying this is
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  an epidemic of rape in these migrant camps muslim women and young girls children are being raped
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.040]  over and over again what are we going to do about it and of course german european citizens are
[44:56.040 --> 45:00.920]  now being raped as well and it all goes back to what's in the article up on info wars dot com
[45:00.920 --> 45:06.920]  right now which is this phenomenon that's been noted over the past several years called taharoosh
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.360]  which is this custom if you want to call it that of mobs of muslim men
[45:12.360 --> 45:19.080]  men leaping on viciously attacking women sexually assaulting them stealing from them
[45:19.080 --> 45:27.240]  exactly what we saw in cologne and you remember back in 2011 cbs reporter laura logan she was
[45:27.240 --> 45:34.760]  attacked by 200 egyptian men into hea square during the uprising again this is part of their
[45:34.760 --> 45:39.160]  culture there was another dutch journalist who was attacked and that's actually the video in
[45:39.160 --> 45:45.640]  this article completely harrowing attacked in the same way so it goes back to this argument of
[45:45.640 --> 45:52.280]  oh that's just their culture we have to respect it if you criticize it you're racist well i'm sorry but
[45:52.280 --> 45:59.000]  an actual rape culture the molestation of women that's not a culture that should be respect we
[45:59.000 --> 46:05.480]  hear this over and over again it's like in india you know in india duneseth here after here after
[46:05.480 --> 46:14.120]  here has to run a program where they train indians not to defecate on the streets like 600 million
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.800]  indians almost half of the population don't know how to use toilets and it's caused a huge health
[46:19.800 --> 46:26.040]  problem and unicef has to train them to use toilets i'm sorry but that is a bad culture it needs to
[46:26.040 --> 46:31.080]  be resolved and it doesn't need to be imported into the west and it's not racist now you're
[46:31.080 --> 46:35.560]  being racist against people defecating on the street now i think people should go to the white
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.360]  house and defecate on the front fence i'm not literally saying that but if they're so into this
[46:40.360 --> 46:45.160]  i think hillary should have all the defecation but but but that's bad enough right but at least
[46:45.160 --> 46:49.720]  it's not a big thing to rape women as much over there some of it happens but what about mass
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.040]  raping is the feminists are all saying the west mass rapes when the west is what has always fought
[46:54.040 --> 46:58.760]  against that but i mean now i saw feminist groups and mainstream news articles actually blaming
[46:58.760 --> 47:05.400]  german men even after it came out i mean it's just insane why do what is the master plan why
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.560]  do they hate the west so much i'm not talking about the mass rapers the folks running around with
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.040]  guns and cologne even though they have massive gun restrictions in germany the uh the illegal
[47:14.040 --> 47:19.240]  aliens or i guess legal aliens in germany are just running around with semi-auto handguns firing
[47:19.240 --> 47:26.440]  them into the sky firing uh mortar shells they'll burn down houses into people's buildings foaming
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.800]  at the mouth and also doing mac daddy homey g stuff i've noticed that that they've merged with
[47:31.800 --> 47:38.680]  the whole gangster rap thing creating a special mutated culture oh that's that's also comes out
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.960]  like this it's called jihadi cool they've merged with that gang culture because it's you know it
[47:43.960 --> 47:49.480]  feeds into each other one of the other objectives when you talk about the wider agenda is clamping
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.800]  down on our rights so they're going to use criticism of muslim rape gangs to restrict
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.920]  the free speech of people who are critical of government in general and we're now seeing that in
[48:00.920 --> 48:07.160]  on twitter you know back in october twitter released a new policy where they said that sensitive
[48:07.160 --> 48:13.320]  material i'll read it out this is their policy hate speech or advocacy advocacy against an
[48:13.320 --> 48:20.360]  individual organization or protected group based on religion age sex sexual orientation and so on
[48:20.360 --> 48:26.600]  now is being monitored for deletion and censorship by twitter and and in cologne the germans went
[48:26.600 --> 48:32.200]  out the protest and the police attacked them with tear gas but but they let the radical muslims run
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.560]  around in rape i mean again socialism turns the local government into pure evil yeah now they're
[48:39.560 --> 48:45.320]  using it to institute censorship on the back of the biggest shareholder the second biggest
[48:45.320 --> 48:52.120]  shareholder of um twitter being prince alouid bin talal of saudi arabia so now you're seeing people
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.400]  get censored on twitter and you know people say well who cares i don't use twitter well first of all
[48:57.400 --> 49:02.360]  as drudge said we're creating these internet ghettos where all the content goes into social
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.040]  media second of all first it's twitter then it's facebook then it's feminist going to the un and
[49:08.040 --> 49:13.720]  saying isp should cut off people's internet access if they criticize it's already happening in europe
[49:13.720 --> 49:18.520]  and these people that say don't use google don't use youtube don't use facebook don't use yahoo
[49:18.520 --> 49:23.960]  they're idiots it's like i don't care about rush limbaugh let them arrest them or kick them off here
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.840]  they admit that once they get him they're going to get all the talk radio you morons and i'm talking
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.680]  not to our listeners but people that have this attitude even in the liberty movement that if
[49:32.680 --> 49:40.280]  somebody falls you get bigger no we're in an all out war with globalists enslaving us stop
[49:40.280 --> 49:45.960]  competing with each other in the patriot movement we're up against people that want to end our
[49:45.960 --> 49:52.600]  platforms and our ability to get on the field period we're in a fight for our lives people
[49:53.240 --> 49:58.200]  a total fight for everything first amendment second amendment tenth amendment fourth amendment
[49:58.200 --> 50:04.920]  the fighting must end in the liberty movement period go ahead paul yeah and then they say oh
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.520]  forget twitter come and join my new social network it's got like 20 users and nobody looks at no
[50:10.520 --> 50:15.400]  that's not a solution so then you've got we must invade twitter we must invade facebook we must
[50:15.400 --> 50:20.520]  invade youtube as we've done paul stay there i'm going to get the fair con next hour people want
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.080]  to see it it's on info wars dot com it's incredibly powerful where he basically endorses donald trump
[50:25.080 --> 50:29.000]  he told me in a private meeting he said it wasn't off record but we met for 45 months before the
[50:29.000 --> 50:36.520]  interview he said i think donald trump may be the answer to save america but i don't know how to
[50:36.520 --> 50:42.840]  say it because he says things that are bad but so do i sometimes when i'm angry but i think he
[50:42.840 --> 50:48.840]  really is outside the system and he could break it but i i'm not making fun of him that's how he
[50:48.840 --> 50:52.760]  talks i mean i'm sitting in loose fair con i've been talking to him 10 minutes and he's endorsing

[54:13.080 --> 54:14.920]  ladies and gentlemen if i'm ranting
[54:17.400 --> 54:22.680]  it's because my heart's beating fast my blood pressure's up in fact uh i've been taking my
[54:22.680 --> 54:27.000]  blood pressure lately before i work out and after and my blood pressure is up i've lost weight
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.920]  i'm healthier but just physically my blood pressure is up at a physical level because we're watching
[54:33.880 --> 54:38.840]  MIT announced they're growing cloned humans inside cows and pigs that's in the news today
[54:38.840 --> 54:44.040]  i knew that 20 years ago but now it's just being thrown in our face um they're just announcing
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.360]  robots to take over the combat the military they're announcing that they admit women are
[54:48.360 --> 54:52.360]  putting the military to destroy it so they can be forced to go to robots they're actually in the
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.160]  news saying doesn't matter humans are done soon anyways put women in make it like a social club
[54:58.760 --> 55:04.840]  i mean it's crazy when everything we've talked about is now becoming mainstream but then they
[55:04.840 --> 55:11.400]  just get away with it and then meanwhile trump is surging in all these polls beating hillary
[55:11.400 --> 55:20.120]  by three to five points in national polls it's just incredible solicitors alone comes out and says
[55:20.120 --> 55:26.200]  he loves trump paul getting into the whole radical muslim jihad what's the big picture here because
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.680]  i know it's about class of civilizations and take our rights once the muslims you know attack and
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.240]  rape and say that we can't have speech to conform with them we know that's the model but do they
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.520]  really think their own leftist followers are going to put up with being treated like this because
[55:40.520 --> 55:51.480]  it's causing liberal germans uh to basically exodus and mass uh it's causing politicos reporting
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.680]  today that the smallest number basically ever identify themselves as democrats in america
[55:56.680 --> 56:05.480]  top statisticians are saying they think 47 percent uh i don't know it just it just makes my head
[56:05.480 --> 56:11.400]  spin i know that 47 actually so that'd be like 90 some percent of the states uh are gonna go republican
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.040]  and i'm not saying that's gonna save us but it shows the discontent i mean why are they jumping
[56:16.040 --> 56:25.000]  the shark so crazily paul well i just lost the beat there but i mean it's the it's the threat to our
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.680]  rights in general i was in paris like a week ago they've got bag searches to go into restaurants
[56:30.680 --> 56:36.040]  what are two bouncers who are completely unarmed are gonna do when they're overwhelmed with jihadists
[56:36.040 --> 56:41.240]  searching women's handbags i mean what is the point in that it's all about general martial law
[56:41.240 --> 56:47.400]  it's all about general martial law which is the impact of turning western society into israel into
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.360]  jerusalem where it's a complete police state and to go about our daily business we have to go through
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.600]  this because of this threat that they've imported now in canada today last night you had two guys
[56:58.600 --> 57:05.240]  called muhammad shoot up a nightclub barely anyone's even reporting on it they didn't even mention the
[57:05.240 --> 57:10.120]  word muslim because of course this has nothing to do with the religion of peace so you've got left
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.840]  is saying oh what's happening in oregon you know people occupying an empty building in the middle
[57:14.840 --> 57:20.040]  of nowhere is terrorism and the media won't say it's terrorism because white people did it meanwhile

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:41.240]  people say what are you talking about that was his real name like eric blayer was a real name
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:47.080]  in george arwell what would george arwell think about what was happening today this political
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:52.360]  correctness where i'm not a big critic of the of the awesome police department i mean they're
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.200]  compared a lot of departments they're a good department a lot of them are listeners but i
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:04.920]  know for a fact over on south areas uh of east austin over off of six street and other areas
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.480]  there's muggings racial attacks constantly and i've talked to some of the police they're told
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.120]  basically cover it up when there's a tax over off second street nicer areas they're told to
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:21.480]  say it happened up on 35 but now the police chief of cologne has been fired over this
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.240]  saying there were no incidents that night and then being caught that there were just massive
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.200]  incidents and guns being fired and basically martial law and his deputy said no it was like
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.280]  a war zone but we didn't want to panic the public well the local police better say something because
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.720]  they're going to get the blame when all this happens paul we got four minutes left where
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.920]  does all this go how does it all unfold how do we stop it well you're right the very first day
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.800]  day one they came out with a press release the cologne police and said new year's eve was completely
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:57.880]  peaceful there were no incidents whatsoever so the cover-up went into effect from day one but i guess
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.720]  it's that's better than sweden where they had a similar situation uh at a pop concert back last
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.920]  summer again mass muslim molestations of women they covered that up for some six months or more
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:17.720]  because sweden the place where their top expert on islamophobia goes on to join isis where they
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:22.840]  demand people give up their garages to house these migrants so it's got to the level where
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.680]  our own leaders are complicit in this directly complicit in it and now you've got for example this
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.320]  you've got conservatives in britain being banned from major universities from giving
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:39.080]  speeches or participating in debates simply because they might offend trigger feminists
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:46.040]  meanwhile this this islamic cleric has been touring all these universities saying that it's okay
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.880]  to beat women he's been advocating wife beating in all these major british universities there's
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:57.880]  top us muslim professors that say killing and robbing non-muslims is your duty and this is a
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.520]  liberal and the liberals love it why do they hate themselves so much what is wrong with liberals
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.640]  they're not liberals they're sick mental patients it's because they've got this collective white
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.400]  gill which in germany is a hangover from world war two it's also because they're flagrantly racist
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.920]  and it's also because feminists feminist feminism third wave feminism is basically a cult so you
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:25.960]  have to adhere to the cult beliefs to stay in the cult and not be ostracized from it which is why
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:32.920]  only white western males can be responsible for rape culture even though women in colleges in the
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.880]  u.s for example are less likely to be raped than women in the general population it's actually the
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.840]  safest place for them to be but because leftist regressive leftist or racist they can't mention
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:51.400]  the massive muslim molestation problem which has been named and has been carried out in muslim nations
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.120]  especially egypt for years and years and years well i want to know why gun control didn't work
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.280]  and why the muslims have guns in europe if the guns are banned paul you know the germans can't get
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:06.840]  guns but i guess the foreigners can i guess the uh outsiders can well yeah and the austrian police
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.880]  chief has now come out and said that women shouldn't go out at night alone so it's devoid attack so
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.680]  again the feminist whine all day about blaming the victim that's what the authorities have been doing
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.720]  for over a week and again feminists don't give a damn they're too busy complaining about sexist
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.480]  air conditioning so their hypocrisy has been exposed once and man's spreading care about women and
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.080]  man's spreading man's spreading you know beach body ads these are the major issues meanwhile
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.520]  thousands of women get raped they don't have a word and in u.s schools they're making uh boys
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.760]  sit because it's not fair they can stand they're obsessed with how our young boys use the bathroom
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:51.160]  these are truly cult brainwashing sick freaks total enemies of the human species itself and i'm not
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.560]  talking about the radical muslims i'm talking about the liberal scumbag filth they're the real
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.280]  threat thank you paul you'll be hosting the fourth hour president obama is guilty of
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.480]  high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about until now for one thing he illegally gave
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.760]  obama care exemptions to unions that supported the passage of obama care that's right obama gave
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.800]  some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of obama care's requirements because many of
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.520]  them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program once
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.640]  these groups realized just how bad obama care really was they wanted exemptions from the very
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.160]  same law they forced on everyone else which obama gave them president obama also had the irs grant
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.280]  special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity the daily color reported the iris had
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:41.080]  taken the unprecedented step of approving a nonprofit application within just one month from
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.680]  the barrick h obama foundation additionally the iris illegally gave retroactive approval for the
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.960]  organization's taxes and status you can find out more from the article on info wars dot com
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.160]  entitled 75 times obama broke law during presidency this is kit daniel's reporting

[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:40.440]  hour getting into the massive rapes uh all over europe i mean we're talking hundreds for major city
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:46.680]  with radical jihadi's firing guns pulling people out of cars raping women attacking women with
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:52.520]  baby strollers running around thumbing at the mouth i mean we've got a bunch of videos on info
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.920]  wars dot com it is the craziest stuff i've ever seen it's like when they have that cnn reporter
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:02.280]  and others and in in in in uh egypt and they just dragged the woman off and 100 plus people
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.160]  rape her and she's still having to have medical stuff done to her today i mean this is crazy
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:13.720]  town the west doesn't do this but feminists are saying that it's western men the police chief
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:20.680]  came out in cologne and said nothing happened and then when they got caught lying about all that
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.200]  when all that information started to come out the feminist groups came out and said it's worse to
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.400]  criticize the poor little migrants the military age men 80 some percent of them with fake passports
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.560]  these are the people that invaded syria to rape murder and kill there and again that was hillary
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:44.680]  clinton and the state department two weeks ago hillary said that syria is going well look up the
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.440]  quote syria is going well a few days later the state department came out and said we've brought
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  peace to syria thanks to the policy of the last five years which hillary started i mean this is
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:02.760]  the craziest thing it's like giving the captain of the titanic a posthumous award for helping run
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:11.080]  into an iceberg on its first uh mission on its first voyage it's made in a trip uh there from
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:17.400]  the uk over to new york city and it's the same thing with the clinton's for me it's like groundhog
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.800]  day i've been on air since 1995 and i was interviewing larry nickles and jennifer flowers
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.520]  and all the before you ever heard of polyjones before you ever heard of cathleen willie before
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.960]  you ever heard of these women and we've had them all on and it's crazy all these years later i'm
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:41.240]  having them back on and many of these are women that clinton's settled cases with these are professional
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.800]  women i mean i'm sure cosby probably did a lot of what he's being accused of but you know it's
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:51.080]  like cocktail waitresses playboy playmates they go to a party at a hotel they go in a room with him
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.160]  they claim they don't know what happened okay maybe he did date rape i'm sure whether smoke
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.080]  there's fire but with clinton they're at the governor's mansion or they're in a cloakroom
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.920]  or they're in the white house and he says can i talk to you my office please and then rams their
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.920]  head in the wall starts choking them bites their lip the women are all saying the same thing and
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:15.960]  then rapes them these aren't these are professional women folks these aren't bimbo's who you could
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.120]  question and i'm not attacking those women i mean just come on though you listen to a stripper
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.680]  or you listen to a professional woman making 300 000 a year who's a big democrat insider
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.760]  and never made stuff up before they have no reason to say bill clinton's doing this to him
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.240]  and the amount of evidence he's mind blowing he's got a new book coming out on the bushes and i'm
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:41.080]  an expert on them and all of jeb bush's activity with african dictators and drug running and
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.200]  it's all coming out he's got another book on that subject but he he he is a big insider
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.680]  in the nixon and bush administration and others uh the strategist is for six administrations and
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.200]  running big pro-western campaigns in other nations successfully he's a big fish if you look up

[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.000]  points 20 of democrats saying they're coming over to trump this looks like a bigger landslide than
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.880]  reagan top analysts saying 47 states to go republican i want to give you the floor to talk
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.760]  about the grand strategy where we really sit but also how the empire is going to strike back
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.600]  i don't see this crime syndicate we know they're joined at the hip the clinton
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.960]  bush crime syndicate i don't see them giving up the crown lightly roger stone how do we stop these
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.280]  people well alex first of all i'm delighted to be back with you and i appreciate your kind words
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.000]  about the oppo package needed to take down hillary which is entitled the clinton's war on women
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:30.760]  i was very happy to say that this book is done very well despite the mainstream media efforts
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:37.080]  to make the current debate about adultery or marital infidelity or pain in your marriage when
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:47.880]  it's about something far darker serial rape sexual assault intimidation strong arm tactics with hillary
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:55.960]  an accessory after the fact with hillary the woman running for president being the point person
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:02.920]  in the terror campaign to intimidate let's use a word to the left and bully these women into
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:09.160]  silence whether it's silence uh in regard to a subpoena or whether it is silence in terms of
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:15.240]  speaking out and blowing their cover as a racket hillary's the enforcer she's the one who intimidates
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:21.560]  and bullies these people she's the one who hired the heavy-handed private detectives uh paladino
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:30.680]  pelacano ivan duta uh even jerry parks uh to keep uh keep an eye on the way as you know some witnesses
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.200]  in arkansas to him with women had their arms and legs broken well not only that but jerry parks
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.960]  may have been killed jerry parks was a private detective brought in to do uh special work by
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.400]  hillary clinton and vince foster that's who he hired who hired him and he was given a list of
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:53.480]  women and said these are women who either bill has had incidents made where that means assaulted
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:59.560]  bit perhaps exposed himself tried to rape and these others are just women that he had consensual
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.600]  sex with but then dumped and they're they're threatening to come forward and say what they
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:10.600]  know they also need to be handled now when jerry parks tried to collect his eighty three thousand
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.680]  dollar bill after bill clinton's election and after jerry had subs had suppressed the bimbo
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.400]  eruption in arkansas he gave bill his bill for eighty three thousand dollars and bill looked at
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:28.280]  him and laughed he said the election's over jerry you're not getting paid and he said all right
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.680]  well i i have to go forward with what i know about women and about drugs through mina and a week later
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.120]  somebody drove jerry parks off the road and shot him in the head
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:47.240]  so motive means opportunity uh yeah there there's a lot of dirty business here but uh hillary and
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.440]  the mainstream media are trying desperately to duck this the new york times editorial board says
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:58.600]  uh the bill clinton's actions while repugnant uh are irrelevant to hillary no they aren't
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.160]  because hillary is an accessory after the fact she's a full co-conspirator in the cover-up it's
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.440]  not just that she enables this by looking the other way it remains silent she actually threatens
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:18.760]  violence and terrorizes the women and families of the women unlucky enough to be assaulted by bill
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.680]  clinton and i want you to continue again we have roger stone the clinton's war on women a best-selling
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.160]  author uh former head of the trump campaign when he was an exploratory committee four years ago
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.960]  one of the top guys this year until he uh left uh so that he could actually be even more aggressive
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.520]  on his own he's certainly been doing that but you can see his strategy and so much of what trump
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.880]  has been doing successfully uh for those that don't know hillary i know most of our listeners do
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.720]  but the real background from insiders and you've been inside multiple whitehouses not democrat
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.240]  but they admit hillary wasn't just co-president clinton was having sex party and cocaine doing
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:19:00.200]  some diplomatic stuff but hillary was is use the power maven she was in there i mean is that correct
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.640]  from your research well not only that but as i prove in my book it's hillary who gives the go
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.720]  ahead on the assault on the branch dividion combined in wake up that's right those 18 children under the
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:18.760]  age of eight this is hillary the advocate for children who did this janet rino uh lesbian
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:25.640]  her hand-picked attorney general webster hubbell the deputy attorney general who gives the order
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.480]  hillary's lover chelsea's father and we have her call a statement about just kill them take them out
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.800]  and then meanwhile she does the same thing about kadoffy she really is like a villain
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.080]  well in the case of kadoffy though you have to recognize that the nation of katar very wealthy
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:48.600]  or oil arab empire paid bill two and a half paid bill a million and a half for a speech paid hillary
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:55.720]  a million for a speech put 2.5 million into the clinton foundation put 2.5 million into the clinton
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:02.680]  presidential library at the same time they're similarly bribing sarcosi and uh and blair
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:09.400]  who are now fixers in their nations uh and lo and behold the state department decides to reverse
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:16.520]  our policy kadoffy who has renounced his nuclear cape uh aspirations who is feeding us intelligence
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:21.640]  on al-qaeda whose children are being educated in the west the guy who figured out in the greatest
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:27.800]  struggle of time he'd rather be on our side than their side we take him out by going to the national
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:33.000]  credit card borrowing the money for a massive bombing which we can't even pay for because the
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.080]  rebels would have repelled would have not been able to overrun and then we try to take out our
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.360]  allies in egypt i mean it's just crazy no no it's not crazy this is the obama clinton foreign
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:48.840]  policy this has to be willful we are systematically taking getting rid of every ally we have in the
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:54.680]  region those feeding us intelligence and we're inserting the muslim brotherhood willful sabotage
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.920]  what's the end game there and then back into the riping and then an incredible turbo surge
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.720]  of trump it's just unbelievable to watch history for us to cover because alice only donald trump
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.480]  can be hillary clinton because only donald trump has the courage to say no this isn't about bill as
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:15.560]  disgusting as that is it's about hillary as an enabler and an abuser of women a point person in
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.680]  the cover-up so don't feed us this year an advocate for women and girls stuff and then he can talk
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:24.520]  about the i love how he tells her how dare you claim i don't like women when i love women and have
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:29.080]  no history and you protect your rapist husband that that scares the hell out of her well and i'll
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.440]  tell you something else when avanka trump who is the greatest asset donald has and i she's got a
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:40.920]  business to run in a family career she's got uh two i believe small kids but she is uh one of the
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.560]  best dressed women in the world she is poised she's a great add she'd make a great first lady
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:52.200]  she has and she has seen how her father has nurtured women in the business world so i think this i
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.400]  think in the end women will look quite differently at the real donald trump not the caricature that
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:05.000]  the left is trying to paint of him uh but i even today alex uh jeb bush says bill bill bill bill's
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.760]  activities are off limits christ christie says they're off limits casick governor john casick
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.480]  they're off limits all in political bill cosby off limits that you know where's the white flag
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:23.720]  this bill clinton is a cosby type sexual predator uh but hillary is the one running for president
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:30.040]  and she's not irrelevant because again as i said she is running the nuts and sluts campaign to
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:38.280]  discredit uh monica louis to uh make it her fault she was seduced by a man three times her age
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.360]  uh it is it is uh the republicans are waving the right flag if they don't use this issue
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:50.680]  trump has the gumption to do this which is why i remain a strong trump supporter but i must tell
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:57.960]  you alex the lobbyists the insiders the the banking interests the insurance lobbyists the the
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:05.480]  billionaires the coax the singers the bermans the schwarzman the braamans all these guys who are who
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:11.880]  are funding you know marco rubio they're they're the all of the insiders who will take anybody but
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:21.160]  trump abt i agree i'm not not too fine a ted cruise either uh is is uh you know is uh says that this
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.880]  is that clinton is off limits which is an absurd i was about to say that that that you've been a
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:30.200]  big insider but always very principled standing up for real conservative and libertarian ideals
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.200]  but you look at most these people they're just democrats who want to control the republican
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.760]  party and that's why i finally about three months ago uh you know started coming over to trump
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.120]  because there wasn't any other strong leadership there wasn't anybody telling like it was there
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.400]  wasn't anybody going up against political correctness there wasn't anybody pointing out we have all
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.960]  these bad tariff deals and all these deals that ensure our jobs will go but the coup de grace
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:56.200]  was money doesn't lie he's not getting any big hedge fund money he's not getting any big money
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:02.680]  all the big money's going to hillary or jeb bush or rubio that's all you need to know trump or die
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.720]  i mean that's it i'm sorry i mean i i like ran paul i like cruise cruise might have a shot i hope
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:12.840]  he becomes trumps vp we've got to get behind trump it's just true it's a fact and i'm not going to
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.520]  sit here like a coward on the sidelines and then you know just join the whole chorus attacking him
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:24.040]  because it's it's it's the right thing to do to stand with trump plus it's it's even getting
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.200]  democrats to see it's a setup now and they're swinging over to trump can we talk about those
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.480]  numbers some because it's so huge all these big polls these numbers show he would win right now
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.280]  the general election am i wrong no i actually think he's the only republican with any prospect
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:43.320]  of beating hillary here's what's ironic as much as the left beats on him he will get a larger
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:49.400]  percentage of black and hispanic votes than mit romney or john mccain was ever able to achieve
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:55.160]  it's aspirational don trump will put the country back to work this morning i got a call from the
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:03.160]  naacp chairman in leesburg virginia wants to organize the state for trump i asked him i said
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.880]  i was a little surprised by his call and he said will you talk about he said trump means jobs
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:15.240]  trump means opportunity trump means prosperity trump means that there's a possibility for my
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.960]  kids to have a better life than i had uh and i think there's a lot of there's a lot of support
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:25.560]  in the community for that so right there and then blue collar democrats that were we used to call
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:33.960]  raiden democrats now more precisely uh and before that they were nixon democrats they uh uh will
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:40.840]  go to trump in record numbers so uh this will be a very close election uh the clinton's uh i think
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.600]  have made an enormous mistake let's remember hillary called donald out she's the one who played
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:54.440]  the gender card oh you're bullying women and uh and when that happened trump was right back in her
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:02.040]  face how politically incorrect except for he's right on the money she's in it with him she's an
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:08.520]  enabler and that is a fair issue i want to get back into the women i want to get back into the
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.240]  book because this is one of the few things obviously that is that is really going to uh get past this
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.120]  whole gimmick of oh she's a woman you can't criticize women you got to vote for her because
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.080]  she's a woman the fact is if it's not one of her girlfriends she treats women really bad it's kind
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.960]  like obama never visits black communities like other presidents do their unemployment doubles
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.720]  i mean they really seem to have it out for their constituents i don't even understand
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.720]  why they screw their constituents over so much other than just a criminal mentality
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:44.200]  well it's it's even worse than that alex because uh she has taken uh millions of dollars from regimes
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.960]  through the clinton foundation that suppress women or press women don't let women uh drive don't
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.600]  let them vote don't let them be educated don't let them choose their own husband don't let them go
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:01.320]  out and publicly avail uh she on the pay on the issue of pay inequality she's a total fraud no place
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:08.360]  where hillary has been the boss has she ever paid men uh or women as much or more than men not the
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.800]  state department not the clinton foundation uh and not the u.s senate where she certainly had that
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:20.840]  authority so she's a fraud on women's issues broadly she obviously has manifest criminal
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.280]  activities uh when i when i'm hopeful here alex is that the younger people in the electorate
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:31.640]  particularly women who have a generally favorable opinion of hillary by based only what they know
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:38.040]  on a cursory basis that they be educated and everything is back on the table once the clinton
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.320]  has decided she was going to reach for power and they probably had to deal with jeb jeb was the
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:49.400]  was the designated loser in this race he would never raise these issues as he told us today he would
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.880]  take his beating and then going back to making money with the clinton's because the bush is in
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:01.240]  the clinton's profiteer together they're in charity scams together they are skimming charitable
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:08.040]  funds together they're log rolling for their presidential libraries together they rehabilitate
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:14.680]  each other they praise each other uh you know this is very much uh trump is kind of upset the
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:20.360]  gameplay in here we were going to get a heads i win tails you lose barbara calls barbara calls
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:26.760]  clinton her son i mean uh bush calls him his brother this is sickening yes no look you know
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:33.080]  barbara bush when on those rare occasions where she's sober says that uh that bubba is like her fifth

[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:55.720]  together i mean unbelievable the stuff clinton did we know i mean cosby no one said ever brutalized

[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:24.520]  roger stone uh you know very successful political strategies worked in many white houses directly
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.280]  is just getting so hardcore right now coming out about the bushes and drug dealing and the
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:35.160]  clinton's and rape and putting out hardcore books uh exposing it like the clinton's war on
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.800]  women and i was asking you sir obviously you weren't coming you've always promoted libertarian
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.480]  patriot ideas from a very goldwater is when you got involved and you worked with the nixon white
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:48.760]  house saw all that uh but i mean it does seem like you've taken the gloves off please talk about
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.480]  the process what you see in america where you think this country's going and and what's going to happen
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:00.360]  if we don't elect a donald trump or a ted cruiser or rand paul because it looks like all of the world
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:07.000]  the left is going full totalitarian it looks i mean they are and they're trying to stamp out
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.440]  opposition i mean they really are getting up on their hind legs and and going for broke is that
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  because they can see the world's turning against them i mean i talked about these demographics
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:22.680]  here and i want your take on that as well uh gallop share of democrats reaches record low in history
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:31.640]  that's politico economist the hill g.o.p within 47 state wins maybe more out of 50 i mean uh
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.800]  they're panicked right now what might they pull so that's the second question but but but first off
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:42.760]  you're your your evolution sure uh as i said i'm a sentimental republican young republican
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:49.080]  national chairman from 1977 and 1979 learned politics at the knee of nixon worked in three
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:55.320]  presidential campaigns for ronald reagan never a bush republican supported him for vice president
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:01.560]  only after he got on the ticket actively opposed his getting on the ticket inside the reagan operation
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:07.080]  promoting jack kempel buffalo a real conservative recognizing the danger of bush and the whole
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:13.880]  bush family even then uh and uh i i unfortunately alex i came to the conclusion that with the
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.960]  nomination of mit romney both parties had become one party was the wall street party was the party
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:26.040]  of endless war was the party of erosion of our civil liberties was a part of more and more spending
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:32.360]  it was the party of the federal reserve in their paper money making our dollars worthless it is
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:38.280]  it was the party party of banking and insurance and the special interests the party of the lobbyists
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.880]  and both parties are the same obama was going to close guantanamo it's still open
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:50.520]  obama was going to bring home our home our troops from afghanistan now he's planning to send troops
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:57.320]  to syria the the it all stays the same doesn't matter whether the policies are bush or clinton
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:04.280]  or obama or bush or clinton we get the same thing as i said earlier i think jeb is what they call a
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:11.880]  ringer his job was to lose just like his father's job was to lose in 1992 from his long lost friend
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:18.600]  from the cia couldn't work for the cia uh when he was in europe spying on anti-war groups george
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:25.560]  hw bush worked for the cia as early as 1961 on the bay of pigs uh invasion involved in right wing
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.640]  fundraising as an operative for the agency he perjured himself when he was uh in the 70s when
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.480]  he said under oath that he'd never worked in the agency when he was made director out of the clear
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:41.960]  blue well uh he he he had worked there before and he lied about this confirmation absolutely that's
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:47.240]  obvious a long time bush ties to the intelligence community are known well they've released the
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.320]  documents that he was in i mean as you said wall street the bush family lawyer lawyer on wall street
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:58.600]  alan dullis the cia director so if you you see everything you need to know
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:05.320]  and of course you're about to have a book come out about the bushes and the cia and the drug
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.360]  dealing and all the rest of it i tell you have got a lot of ends alex they're really bookends
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.600]  the clinton book talks about their involvement and corruption with the bushes and the bush book
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.240]  tells the other half of that story things i didn't know at the time i wrote the first book these two
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:25.560]  families these two dynasties are in it together and the clinton's are they're really not hardcore
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:31.400]  leftists as much as they're money making opportunists and criminals the clinton foundation is a slush
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:38.200]  front for drifters it's a luxury travel service to augment the five-star lifestyle of bill hillary
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:44.600]  and chelsea clinton uh it is a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million-dollar bribes you're
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.720]  a foreign nation you want to bump off kadafi and replace him with the muslim brotherhood you pay the
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.840]  clinton's you line their pockets and it shall be she does it at the state department general
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:01.960]  electric has a contract on the table a defense contract on hillary's desk they own nbc nbc
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:09.560]  pays chelsea 600 grand for one tv appearance and guess what alex general electric got their contract
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:14.280]  their multi-million-dollar contract so you get it for peanuts i mean you like put in a quarter
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.080]  and you get a million bucks back it's it's extraordinary look the clinton's would steal
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:27.880]  a hot stone uh as people need to know the true story of of the clinton crime syndicate uh the
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.160]  most egregious thing to me here is the fact that the mainstream media lets hillary run around saying
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:39.160]  black lives matter but they don't address the question of bill's abandoned rejected mixed
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:45.400]  race on danie williams danie williams is a fine young man alex he's 30 years old he's a church
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:51.400]  goer he's built a small business put himself through college but he is the son of bill clinton
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.880]  his mother was bobby ann williams uh a cocaine addicted prostitute that bill hired on several
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:06.840]  occasions to pleasure him uh he we know for a fact that danie is bill's son because bobby ann
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:16.360]  tells us she had not been with any other caucasian gentleman uh and uh in 1999 the star owned by robert
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:22.920]  altman a bush crony friend of bill college classmate of bill in georgetown under secretary of the
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:28.360]  treasury a guy who's given over a half million to the various clinton political and financial
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.560]  escapades he owns the star they write that they have a dna test that absolves bill
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:42.680]  alex i went to the current owners of the star they were gracious in opening their files there
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:51.880]  is no dna test danie williams is bill's son banished by hillary it's hillary who told his
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:56.920]  mother and his aunt that they'd be arrested if they came around it's hillary who puts a private
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:03.800]  detective on silencing the rumors uh about bill's illegitimate son it's time for the clittens to do
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:12.520]  the right thing acknowledge love cherish nurture your son don't lecture us about it takes a village
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:18.520]  to raise a child hillary don't tell us about our babies do the right thing by this upstanding young
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:24.680]  man daddy williams doesn't do drugs he doesn't drink he's got to put food on the table bill clinton
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:31.000]  is worth alex 100 million plus dollars so i think african-american voters are going to
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:38.440]  go to trumping's robes when they learn about the clinton's abuse of their black son and the abuse of
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:44.760]  of women and we're showing a picture of danie williams from your book on screen right now
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.320]  i want to continue to expose the clinton's our listeners know their criminals we've had a lot
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:55.480]  of top experts former cia people and others on to expose it including one of their hit men and
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:02.440]  others but shifting gears into big strategy my listeners i'd say 95 percent now support donald
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:09.880]  trump uh i think it's safe to say in reality there's been a collapse mr stone in support for
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.680]  the two parties the nine percent approval rating for congress i think it's manifest now i don't think
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:22.760]  i know they realize everyone's hemorrhaging over to trump nothing works what type of dirty tricks
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:27.480]  are you advising him to look out for obviously i think it's going to happen alex and i think it's
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:33.960]  this is where this race is going because the all of the primaries up to march 14th are proportional
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.760]  and because many of these candidates who have no shot at being nominate still retain
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:45.960]  super PAC funds uh and because of a really obscure rule pushed by the romany people rule
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:54.200]  40b of the of the convention the nominee must have a majority not just win but a majority
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.640]  in at least eight states by all these minor candidates hanging around they're angling for
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.800]  a brokered convention trump could win primaries overwhelmingly in big states but they don't count
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:14.200]  unless he gets a majority now you also have another problem there are 278 super delegates
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:20.760]  to this convention that comprises somewhere uh around five percent of the convention vote let's
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.800]  call it five percent uh those are going to be people who are not elected by the republican
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.640]  primary voters are in the caucuses they're super numeraries a hundred percent establishment
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.120]  alex is not a single donald trump voted there and by the way let me just stop you because
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:41.080]  i want to like ring a bell here for the audience who's paying attention but this is key a lot of
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.560]  republican insiders have said this it's leaked the donors are giving their money to other people
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.680]  like rubio and bush saying it doesn't matter jeb has said in newspaper articles you're never
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:55.480]  going to be president trump will never be you watch we have the delegates so criminals love
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.880]  to brag they admit that they don't care how the citizens vote they're going to steal it there
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:04.680]  forget the electronic voting machines forget diabol the real fixes the delegates so break
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:11.640]  down how they do this and then how we stop them yes i absolutely agree look i i got involved with a
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:16.200]  with a group called the committee to restore america's greatness i'm trying to put together
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:23.160]  a team of veteran convention activists parliamentarians lawyers people who know this process
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:31.400]  who can fight back i we may have to by majority vote or by plurality vote we may have to repeal
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:39.320]  the question of of 840 b just repeal the rule which the convention would have the authority
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:45.240]  to do these super delegates mean mathematically trump needs more than 50 percent of the delegates
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.600]  up for grabs in the conventions and caucuses because it's trump he needs 55 percent and
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:57.320]  that's a tall order the establishment the rubios the bushes the casex particularly
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:03.400]  they ever eat and jab they all see themselves as leading some kind of establishment coalition
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:13.800]  the designated ticket here is rubio the neocon uh it matched with casey the neocon uh two guys who
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:22.200]  are you know case it was a banker and a lobbyist uh and a congressman consummate insider marco rubio
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:29.080]  two terms in the legislature extremely green and if anything worse more of a neocon than jab
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.520]  and of course jab the prince in waiting who was looking for some late maneuver that lets him win
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:41.400]  a back room uh shady stolen republican national convention and i love the headlines about
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.120]  trumps destroy the republican party no they've destroyed it they've destroyed the country
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.480]  no one wants them and and of course you were there when they tried to steal the election
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  the nomination from reagan they they made them broker it to bring in george herbert
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:59.240]  walker bush i mean that'd be bad enough if they said you know take rubio or some other person
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.520]  and they shoot trump then they've got rubio in or uh you've been there at the center of this
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.560]  you know helping stop some of it what do we do uh to make sure this doesn't happen just educate
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.360]  people that a vote for anybody else is a vote for hillary you either vote for trump or you vote for
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:19.240]  hillary and so you better vote for trump in these primaries and give him a super majority or we're
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:25.880]  going to get jeb bush in there as a ringer uh basically uh or a rubio yeah i would hope at
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:31.000]  the end of the day once those supporting dr carcen you learn that carcen cannot be nominated but
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.200]  that you might make a great surgeon general in a trump administration will realize that the
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.680]  political bosses of the republican party in the establishment candidates are going to try to steal
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:46.680]  it so he needs to fold uh and then we have to convince his delegates most of whom i think are
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:52.040]  fine christians and good people uh that dylan trump is the reform candidate in this race against
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.720]  the same establishment that they opposed uh i i would hope in the end if i think ted cruz is
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.840]  going to win iowa his problem here is that it's very early but you and i both know this therefore
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:10.280]  the headline in the mainstream media will be as expected cred ted cruz won iowa but donald trump
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:18.120]  was a surprisingly strong second uh that's absent some uh some upset in which rubio slips in second
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:24.280]  and trump goes to third which is not likely because but it is recognized important to recognize
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:31.000]  that this is a very narrow contest in iowa it's not a primary it's an organizational exercise
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.480]  it's less television driven uh and it has rarely picked the winner trump has to finish first or
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.280]  second in my view even if he finished third it's hardly would be the end of his candidacy on the
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:48.280]  other hand new hampshire is where trump uh he should be stronger somewhat fewer evangelical
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:53.160]  well he's dominating in new hampshire right now correct big big numbers i think stay there sir i
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.320]  want to come back and talk strategy straight ahead i mean it's basically trump or hillary folks

[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.880]  friends with donald trump donald trump thanked mr stone uh for asking him to come on the show when
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:59.160]  he was here a month ago with us speaking of mr trump himself strategy to have him win these
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:05.400]  primaries what the republic of establishes is going to do to try to stop him and then talking
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:10.280]  to mr trump how he's doing right now i mean he's got to be pretty excited that he's weathered
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:17.240]  every made up storm yeah i know he had a very strong week last week uh look i think uh he wiped
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.800]  the the war on women issue away for hillary and the democrats if they thought they were going to
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:28.120]  play that old saw again it's not going to work and trump served them notice that's a big big page
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:33.400]  that has to now be ripped out of their game plan to try to win this election look i think trump is
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:39.480]  the only candidate who can win and i must tell you he's in he's uh feeling good uh he is in a fine
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:47.240]  mood uh you know i uh i think that um that it is uh you can see that he's having fun he's drawing
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:53.880]  enormous crowds 10 000 people in south carolina everywhere he goes he is pulling extraordinary
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:01.400]  large crowds uh there's an enthusiasm alex this is an insurrection this is an uprising this is the
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:07.880]  underclass is saying we're fed up with the two-party duopoly we're fed up with government that that uh
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:12.600]  that costs us a fortune and delivers nothing we're fed up with a foreign policy that seems
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:19.240]  confused at best and treasonous at worst we're sick of not being the trope told the truth about
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:25.720]  most issues we're sick about marching off to war without understanding where our national interest
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:32.280]  is uh we're we're sick of having our emails and phone calls monitored by an oppressive big brother
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:37.800]  government the people are angry the key to trump's election is many people who have stopped voting
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.680]  because like you and i they become disgusted with the two-party system because the democrats and
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.400]  republicans are in it together the bushes and clintons are in it together or people who are
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.120]  new to the process and just have a general disregard for voting because they don't think it
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:56.520]  will make any difference sure how big is it though record numbers won't identify as democrats now in
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:03.160]  gallup yeah no i think that the the tea leaves of the polls are very good i caution you to say
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:09.480]  they're gonna change dramatically pull out today shows that more women think that hillary clinton uh
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.920]  it treats women better than dylan trump uh and that doesn't surprise me because the truth about
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:19.960]  the clintons has been suppressed by the mainstream and that's why it's key to get your book and all
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:26.360]  this proven documentation out yeah no i think that's absolutely true look uh we know that when nbc
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:32.040]  had their chilling interview with wanita broadrick a woman who was raped and bitten by bill clinton
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:40.360]  in 1978 when he was attorney general they sat that out set on that at nbc for weeks and they
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.160]  they weren't even sure they were going to run it it was a very fine piece of television journalism
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:51.080]  by lisa meyers i invite anybody to go to youtube and watch it this woman is compelling and we should
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:56.840]  all write articles about that report about wanita broadrick we should all bring that back up because
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:04.040]  they use a hobbit analogy uh this could be the black arrow that brings down smog is the information
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:10.840]  in your book that's so well documented well i i'm hoping that is that is the case i do think
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:17.080]  that only trump has the courage to continue to drive this home uh plus only trump would rebuild
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.760]  our military only trump would destroy isis and stop this pinprick nonsense if we're going to engage
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:29.400]  then let's engage with a strategy that can succeed i'm not an isolation i'm a non-intervention
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:34.360]  i don't want to go out looking for you don't want an empire 60 second break i want to come back and

[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:48.920]  know very goldwater was and that's the kind of republicans we need in this country and then democrats

[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:09.320]  fair con and 20 of democrats already saying they're going to vote trump that has got to scare the
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:14.600]  establishment sir one of the things that's interesting here is i think that the elite don't
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:21.320]  understand is that those americans who came here legally from other countries and became americans
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:31.000]  including some obvious subset of muslims who are indeed peace loving they too want to freeze muslim
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:41.800]  you know immigration until such time that we can determine whether or not uh there are terrorists
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:47.400]  coming into the country we know that terrorists came in uh to the country through our broken
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.520]  illegal system immigration system in the san bernadino shooting we know that it happened in
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:59.960]  paris uh and therefore um they don't understand that even constituencies of theirs see that trump
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:06.360]  on some key issues makes just common sense by the way jimmy carter froze iranian immigration
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:12.600]  during the iranian hostage crisis no one called him a racist nobody called him a bigot the mainstream
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.400]  media is trying to tell us that trump was trying to freeze muslim immigration for all time for all
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:20.520]  people and that was unconscious he said for a little bit of times when we find out what's going
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.840]  on it's like if you're there's no constitutional issue here the president has his authority it's
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.800]  called common sense that's what exactly it's like if your sinks broken which has happened before you
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:34.280]  know at my house you go run and turn the water off at the street not because you hate water but
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.800]  because it's broken it's not just that donald trump i think would run a common sense foreign
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:46.680]  policy alex the man's job creator this country is in the economic toilet trump means jobs trump
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:52.600]  means getting america moving again trump would streamline government regulations to make business
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.760]  work and because he doesn't own isn't owned by any special interest he could actually cut federal
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:05.560]  spending i worked in the u.s. senate i worked in the house i can tell you every penny of the billions
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:12.120]  of waste in the federal budget was put there by some politician who's being paid off special interest
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.760]  we've got a minute and a half left i know there's other key points you haven't gotten to uh what
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.600]  else you want to impart to this audience with their marching orders to get out there and take
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:25.880]  action if they don't want hillary in power well i think the most important thing people can do
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:33.160]  do uh is uh is to retweet and refacebook and spread the word about the clinton's trail of crime the
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:38.680]  more people we educate you see the problem for the establishment here is you could control
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:44.120]  communications when there was only three national network televisions and a handful of national
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:52.200]  newspapers today with the development of talk radio cable television the internet and organizations
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:59.560]  news organizations like info wars the the truth can no longer be suppressed and we have to reach
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:04.520]  out to those people who are not as political as we are but want the right thing for our country
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:11.800]  and explain to younger women explain to younger female voters the horrifying stunning truth about
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.200]  bill and hillary yeah do they want to be suckered just vote for a woman and be conned or they really
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:23.400]  want to save the country and their future right uh and uh and uh you know rapes these women physically
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:29.080]  hillary rapes them psychologically she has no right to call herself an advocate for women or
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:34.840]  children or girls and so the the epic criminality of the clinton's has to be exposed you're absolutely
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:41.400]  right about neighbor to neighbor patriot to patriot now is the time the people have the power uh in

[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:33.080]  there's two new articles up on info wars dot com here's proof is the headline from kit daniels
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:38.680]  here's proof trump can win election against hillary well that's a great headline but here's proof he
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:43.960]  is currently winning in the major polls but they're going to claim he's a rapist with no evidence
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.200]  and then bill clinton can be raping women and chopping their heads off and the feminists would
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:54.040]  love it i'm not kidding you see guns being fired burning women being raped he'll be beaten people
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:02.680]  being killed shot blown up in europe nightclubs attacked in canada police shot killed wounded
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:08.040]  and they won't even say it's jihadist as they run up in muslim guard garb screaming
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:17.000]  a la akbar a la akbar a la akbar boom shoot the cop boom i mean i'm watching fox news this morning
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.400]  and twice coming up extremist they're shooting police in america and it's a guy in a muslim
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:28.280]  outfit shooting the cop they won't even say it when he said he did it for isis
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:37.320]  you got to read way back in the paper he did it for isis and again i'm not even against muslims in
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:44.360]  general they're bringing in radicals that are wahhabist that are told by their clerics engage
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:48.200]  in jihad they're not bringing in shiites they're not bringing in christians out of syria
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:56.920]  and i mean singing in admits he's an islamist and pledges allegiance to isis fox maybe they've
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:03.320]  been doing it but i saw fox twice and i heard local radio which is fox saying extremist it's
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:08.840]  like the southern poverty loss center or obama runs them or something was crazy and i got really upset
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.680]  but that's why louis fair con is coming out
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.800]  and saying no it's true you you go to these areas where the muslims are all angry
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.440]  you bring them in they're going to attack and then it's going to be blamed on everybody's
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:31.320]  going to lose their freedoms i don't care whether you're a muslim or not so that story is up on
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:37.800]  info wars dot com it's with the new kit daniels article you can see the fair con video and then
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:46.360]  there is a another report that is a steve watson report that's on drudge report dot com right now
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:52.520]  another mark dice video americans mindlessly follow orders hand over personal details to a
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:11:00.280]  complete stranger if you say it's for obama the key is you've got to say we want to put gun owners
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:06.600]  in slave camps we want to kill them for obama that's the past videos we want to ban water for obama
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:12.200]  we want to put jews and ovens for obama these were real questions that were asked
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.880]  and these people are so blacked out they speak good english i mean they'll be like a
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:20.040]  old white professor type going and we want to put the gun owners in the fema camp and
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.760]  take their guns and you know he's like you don't tell me buddy i'm ready and the guys want a power
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:31.160]  trap yeah let's let's put some people in fema camps let's let's put them in in enforced labor camps
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.880]  they're a cult they're a cult of fruit cakes
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:44.040]  but the good news is we've got governors like abbot and others moving forward
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:47.080]  i've never even supported a constitutional convention ladies and gentlemen
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.160]  i've never supported it because back then things weren't as bad i mean they're already butchering
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:57.800]  the bill of rights the constitution outside of law from opening the borders at launching wars
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:05.640]  backing isis shipping any legals above the law coming after our guns outside of law and if you get
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:14.200]  a bunch of patriot governors saying we're going to come in and absolutely nicks with new amendments
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:20.040]  everything you're doing to make it totally clear and shut down federal agencies i mean you i mean
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.520]  that's what we need it's a new declaration of independence and i said have the states convene
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:29.320]  an emergency declaration of independence a few years ago drudge ran my analysis my story a
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.920]  lot of constitutional lawyers looked at it and said that's the answer have the states basically
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:38.120]  pull out of the federal government admitting it's been hijacked and what greg abbott's saying the
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.720]  governor is basically that the states pull out and basically say these agencies are rogue and
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:51.400]  basically dissolve their powers i mean we've got to get on the offense to the devastating
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:57.480]  takeovers that are just as radical on the other end as what greg abbott's doing first abbott says
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:01.720]  come take our guns we're not complying with these federal laws then he says now we're moving with
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:08.120]  the states to block you that's leadership oklahoma did that with 20-something states in 1994 and you
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.000]  know what clinton did at oklahoma city to blend the patriots but we've got alternative new media
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.840]  now bigger than the establishment media in many cases you had the bright bars the world net dailies
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.640]  the drudges the info wars the others together it's much bigger and then all the real leftist
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.840]  organizations that know what's going on to and know that hillary's bad news i mean people aren't as
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:37.320]  disconnected as they used to be they know something's wrong so let's go to an excerpt of the big
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.920]  lewis ferrican interview coming out next week next wednesday throughout the week i'm going to release
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:48.520]  more clips him on the federal reserve a second amendment i mean it's just but i'm not going
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.200]  to release all the really powerful stuff till next week when we hear the interview here over
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:14:01.160]  about an hour and a half uh so that'll be next wednesday so let's go ahead and go to this groundbreaking
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:08.200]  piece as we try to make friends with the leader of one of the most militant organizations in modern
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:14.680]  history militant speech uh lewis ferrican getting him from going all white people are devils and you
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.960]  can't reform a devil so we should work together all god's tribes and and and stick up for our own
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:24.840]  group but you know not be played off against each other and you know i have changed it's like kind
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.920]  of like malcolm x changed i guess to be the transformation i'm not trying to say that's
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:36.120]  what's happening but it's exactly what i wanted was is detente uh is diplomacy because i mean i
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.040]  don't want black people dying from fluoride in the water and being killed in the womb or anybody
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:46.440]  else i mean i really do care about people i really don't want to play the race game but it doesn't
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.360]  mean a big group of racist hispanics blacks whatever attacking because i'm white doesn't
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.680]  mean i have to stand up against their racism but i don't hate them because of what group they're in
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:02.120]  just like when i've been working in east texas and you know actually had people walk over
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:05.800]  in a dairy queen this hadn't happened in a public pool when i was younger as well
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:09.800]  and say where would the cook looks clean you're a Yankee you need to get out of here
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:18.840]  and they were really mad both times because when i was 13 i had had already asked out
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:23.320]  the local beauty queen even though i was just down there for the summer i went over to her ranch
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:28.040]  and asked her out and her parents drove us over to the you know teague pool and i'm at the teague
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.960]  texas pool 20 miles away to go to a city pool and you know some of the buck tooth and white trash
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.800]  came over and were like get out of here Yankee because i was there with the pretty you know the
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:40.760]  beauty queen another time a few years later i was down there working on a ranch and took a good
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.400]  looking girl to dairy queen and had the same type of guys come in and go who are you eat senior
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:48.920]  i said listen there's three of y'all take you out the street stomp your asses on the ground
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:54.280]  and i got up and i said my family found this county i said i bet you come from carpet baggers
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:59.080]  now you go get your truck before i knock your teeth in excuse me i don't mean to flash back
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:12.840]  to that but let's go ahead and go to the Lewis fair con piece here it is
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:22.280]  i've interviewed a lot of people and i've stuck in places like bohemian grove
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:28.280]  i've been attacked at political demonstrations been arrested many times but i gotta say this
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:34.760]  is probably the most surreal drive i've ever made to go meet someone that i'm gonna be interviewing
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:50.680]  Lewis fair con
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:17:01.240]  our government has gone into nations with money from our congress
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:10.680]  to stimulate the dissatisfied and then arm them against a government that is their government
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:21.240]  that's what america did in libya that's what they're doing in syria and the blowback now is they
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:33.640]  have created a refugee crisis that is destabilizing the countries in europe so when mr trump said
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:45.720]  we can't allow these muslims refugees into america now a lot of people were upset with him
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:57.000]  but i know sir that the hatred for america in the muslim world is building as we told
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:08.440]  mr bush no muslim leader could call for jihad and have it stick no muslim leader had the power
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:18.440]  to unite the whole muslim world i said but america's policies will unite those people against the west
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:31.960]  and it is happening so in this way mr trump i think is wise to vet anyone coming from that area
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:42.040]  into america because the hatred for america is in the streets now so if those people are refugees
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:51.160]  and america feels i gotta let 10 000 of them in because america created the problem now if you
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:59.160]  let them in and you don't vet them carefully you might be letting in your own destruction
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:11.480]  when we dialogue with correct misperceptions that is what makes trump acceptable to so many
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:21.480]  white people who feel damn i can't be myself now i can't say what i really feel i'll pay
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:31.000]  a political price so mr trump says to heck with that i'll tell you what's on my mind and that is
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:41.320]  freeing a lot of people that like what he is doing so the politicians today i i looked at the
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:49.720]  many republicans and democrats that are trying to win the nomination of their party
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:20:00.520]  and it says to me you know it's like i don't want to be vulgar but it's like you in any major city
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:15.320]  you see women undressed showing their wares for a john to buy them and it's like politicians
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:27.000]  who don't have money but have ideas and they parade themselves before rich and powerful people
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:39.080]  to get money apparently for their ideas that the rich agree with but the moment that they become
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:47.080]  what they're looking to become they find that the rich have an agenda for them that the rich
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:55.720]  have something to ask of them like the john asks of the prostitute and that's one of the things that
[02:20:55.720 --> 02:21:07.240]  i admire about mr trump because he told them all i don't want your money and when a politician
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:18.520]  does not want money from the rich he's freer than the others to really do good for the masses
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:29.000]  of the people and i think that today we are in the midst of the darkest hour in american history
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:37.640]  and so if we don't make the right move with the right people at the right time the america that
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:53.720]  we know we're not going to see it become great again next wednesday we will air the full interview
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:58.600]  that's really over an hour and a half long we estimate the end up being you can see that first
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:05.000]  excerpts at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i talked to mr stone off air i meant to get
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.960]  to it on air but we ran out of time one of the top trump advisors pretty much is the top advisor
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:14.600]  i'm gonna leave it at that the shadow advisor he's no longer in the campaign has more freedom that way
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:21.800]  and he said no i think it's good that ferrican has come out he goes this is exactly what we're
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:28.520]  seeing with internal polling and external polling that blacks in droves other people just want jobs
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:33.880]  want a future want prosperity for themselves and their children people are just people and
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.720]  you know i told the story about many times about running into racist black people growing up in
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:45.480]  dallas texas who would attack you because you were white if you were walking down the side of the
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:51.400]  road they might just but you know what i grew up in a gang mentality not myself but it it happened
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:55.720]  in that area of of dallas in the east texas i haven't really found that in central texas those
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:00.040]  would become really big some of it's coming back where have you looked at somebody wrong they jump
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:06.120]  out of red light want to fight you i don't care if they were spanning black white what the case was
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:10.120]  although it was something in the water in the 80s and 90s i know leaded gas was being taken out
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:13.480]  there and they estimate murder rates gone down a lot just because they've taken the lead out it
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:21.320]  makes you very violent i mean i was i was aggressive i got a lot in start fights but i mean it was
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:25.880]  it was knocked down drag out i mean you'd have huge fights in the high school and if nobody got
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:31.880]  sent to the hospital they wouldn't call the cops we have fights in the locker room where noses got
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:37.560]  broken and then the coaches would say all right break it up you wimps you know go run around the
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:44.520]  who started it you know go run five miles around the stadium till you throw up nowadays they call
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:50.920]  the police and arrest you so i kind of glad that i did grow up in a rough culture but then at the
[02:23:50.920 --> 02:24:03.000]  same time i see my children they're so sheltered that that's a problem on its own but i i could imagine
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.200]  being black and then everywhere you go a certain percentage of people treat you bad you can't go
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:14.360]  in certain stores you can't go in certain restaurants you can't go in certain bathrooms i
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:19.320]  would be really aggressive and angry and and mean i mean i guarantee you i would act like
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:24.440]  Malcolm X i mean it's just a guarantee it'd be i got guns you're not pushing me around and
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:31.320]  then of course folks would come for you but the truth is people like to arrange themselves
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.120]  into groups they love to peck at each other you know people go join fancy country clubs
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:42.360]  so they can be in pecking orders and you know act like uh thirst and howl the third from gilligan's
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:51.240]  island that's just what they do that's why i told the story of repeatedly that there's even another
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:56.920]  clan story there's a lot of clan in east texas it's a minority of people and it's usually trashy
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:00.840]  folks that want to just go around threatening people there's not a lot of black folks around
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.880]  or if there are you know they uh keep their head down and they just really mess with white people
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:11.640]  all day and in business and life and you know the masons aren't bad but they can become clicks too
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:17.400]  you know the point i'm getting at is anything can become a click and i've had mexican gangs
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:24.200]  black gangs white gangs mess with me um i i definitely had more fights with black gangs
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:30.280]  and racist black people than the other groups combined uh because dallas black folks uh the ones
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:37.400]  that were racist had a real big chip on their shoulder and all i can say is i'm not like these
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:41.320]  yuppies and people that just lay down on the ground when somebody starts attacking them
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:46.840]  and that's why a lot of the racist groups that go out and pray on white people they go out and
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.880]  pick hippies and trendies because they know they're gonna lay down and they're not fight back
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:53.880]  the folks don't mess with you know white guy with a cowboy hat and a ford truck or a Chevy truck
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.560]  because they know there's a gun in there and i think that's just the answer to society is people
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:03.800]  be armed so nobody can be picked on by gangs and and different criminal groups i've had a lot of
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:07.960]  folks that are friends that are love motorcycles i've ridden motorcycles but you can get around
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:12.120]  a rally or something to run to some cd folks that will start a fight with you when there's 15 of them
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:16.040]  on their motorcycles you're staying there with your wife and kids and you can't believe they're
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:20.280]  talking smack to you thinking you're gonna back down and then you don't back down because there's
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.840]  15 of them you back down because your kids are there it's actually very exciting to have 15 people
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.600]  start to fight with you that just makes me feel like king kong man i don't even wake up till
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:36.200]  something like that happens and then it's you know flip the switch i mean it is just like cave man
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.240]  time higher than a kite and then it overwhelming groups threaten me i just like turned into an
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:47.560]  animal but we're losing that and i'm so glad that i'm primal i'm gonna talk about alex jones here
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:53.240]  but it's my personal experience so many of our problems in culture now are because we're domesticated
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:57.880]  we're stupid we don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line we don't know how to grow a garden
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:01.560]  we don't know how to roof a house we don't know how to unplug a toilet we don't know how to clean
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:05.720]  a stove we don't know how to cook good food we don't know how to brew our own beer we don't
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.360]  know how to grow our own tobacco we don't know how to fix our car we just know how to play on
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.360]  smartphones and act tough all day i don't care what color you are we're losing our humanity
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:21.160]  and i realize in business and life and all my success
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:28.520]  is because i'm primal and i'm an animal it doesn't make me dumb it makes me stronger
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:32.680]  that i'll actually be driving home and think about something or somebody attacking me
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:37.080]  and actually bear my teeth driving on the road not showing off anybody i'll actually go oh i'm
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:43.320]  bearing my teeth i need to thank god i'm i'm still primitive primitive is when we were better
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.920]  all this great advances are great to a certain extent but i like it
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:54.440]  so you go on a mars mission takes a year and a half two years spending on which
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:59.160]  your type of system they use when they launch because it's a different aspect proximity to the
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:05.320]  earth i digress even an olympic athlete when they get there is going to have trouble walking even
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:12.120]  the limited gravity what is it like two-thirds or whatever and your heart rots and i mean you age
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:20.440]  20 years spending a couple you know years in space even if you work out hours a day if you
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:25.640]  don't have gravity and that's what it is not having to fight big bears other tribes and people
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.640]  not having to actually go out and get the food ourselves not having to haul water not having
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:34.440]  to figure out what plants can save your children when they're sick or your kids are going to die
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:43.800]  not having that apothecary that ancient knowledge not being in those positions has made us incredibly
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:50.280]  weak and it's a fate worse than hell to see all these empty unhappy people but they're driving
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:56.280]  a junker car a brand new Mercedes and living in a mansion living in a shack they are so unhappy
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:02.600]  you give wealthy kids piles of toys for christmas they don't even open them you go to africa or
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:06.840]  latin america or some poor place each in europe and you give a kid a balsa wood airplane they'll
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.440]  play with that for a week till it breaks into a hundred pieces they'll glue it back together
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:17.000]  and their eyes will glow with enjoyment i've been there i've seen it i've watched the videos
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:24.200]  they still are human and it's because they didn't grow up in this dead culture it's not just that
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.720]  media and and and civilization is soft it's that there's an evil message being transmitted
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:33.800]  through the softness that really brings us down speaking of that we're gonna look at these brain

[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:31.400]  social security number and a whole bunch of people do this without even saying for obama you
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:35.400]  just say we're gonna put all the gun owners and force labor camps take their guns and they agree
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:39.720]  if it's for obama because you want to be politically correct and this is what the tsa is all about
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:45.160]  not about keeping you safe it is about training you to submit while the borders are wide open
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:51.240]  while they ship people in on airplanes and don't even look at their passports or visas
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:55.720]  when they come in i mean that's new york daily news that happens every day they don't even hardly
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:00.840]  report on it now we're totally wide open which is fine be wide open don't grow up my genitals
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:06.760]  don't put me in a naked body scanner don't put me in a hamburger heater i mean it's it's just it's
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:13.400]  the point is it's a fraud it's a joke don't spy on me saying they're terrorist everywhere when
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:18.280]  you're bringing them in and then you talk to these californians or these austinites who aren't
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:23.320]  really austinites you got to go to a liberal area i mean i was here msnbc how say how educated the
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:31.640]  smart liberals are you mean two three degrees that are worthless and they say they're so intellectual
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.000]  and then they're the dumbest people i've ever seen oh i've got a chemical engineering degree
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.440]  they said the man could do you bet i want to bend i hydrogen monoxide and she goes it's water oh i've
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:50.840]  forgot we have that on video i went to cornell with a chemistry degree you don't want to bend
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.280]  hydrogen monoxide she goes are you joking no i agree it's for the earth they will do anything
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:04.920]  as long as they think it's trendy so let's go ahead and go to this report the videos on info wars.com
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:11.160]  just to demonstrate how most people will mindlessly follow orders i'm going to approach random people
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:15.640]  and tell them to give me personal information and start writing it down on this clipboard
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:22.680]  without telling them why who i am or even what it's for to see if they will mindlessly follow a
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:27.480]  direct order what's your name bro what's happening what's your name what's your name
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:33.240]  last name what's your birthday
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:38.760]  who do you bank with
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.160]  with what city do you live in
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:47.640]  what street do you live on
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:57.720]  this is all deep down even spells it for you what's the street address
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:03.160]  and then you didn't know
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.600]  what's your social security number now let me explain what this is all about i know most
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:13.560]  of you know it's the file but really crystallize this boy i'm just getting some data to just to
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.600]  help out with the some programs it pause for a minute so he's telling him it's basically a program
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:25.640]  not that it's government not that it isn't and under the pavlovian german psychological warfare
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:31.080]  system of the prussians adopted by the british in the us they adopted most of our tyranny eugenics wise
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:39.800]  we adopted the prussian and also some of the other counties in germania and the austrian and
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:46.200]  hungarian empire some of their systems of mind control you wonder why germans are so subservient
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:51.160]  will will follow orders so much will work so hard won't cheat all the rest of it but then
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:55.560]  will follow orders to line up little kids and blow their heads off you know that was back in world war
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:02.840]  two germany at very low crime rates what you call very moral people like the japanese the japanese
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:08.280]  too though will follow orders because it's cultural programming under imperial systems of slavery
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:17.000]  keshen war slaves were big nice black boots uh big blue uniforms uh they were proud of themselves
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.920]  and they would go and train from age five until about age 20 to be shop trips some of the best
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:29.720]  trips in the world and then they were sent around as property you had to buy them and of course the
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:35.560]  british king brought in a whole bunch of uh you know large divisions of hessian troops but when
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:40.520]  they saw america and the freedom and how many germans were already here saying don't be an idiot
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:47.800]  come over here they had the huge defections something that never happened before that
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:58.520]  and so the british by the end pulled the german mercs out now most germans were freeborn and and
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:07.240]  and uh weren't part of that but but certain areas of germany their main export was war slaves
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:11.320]  property of the state now you don't hear germans today that you know come from a
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:16.680]  keshen background going oh poor me you know my ancestors were a slave because they don't
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.640]  even really know it or care but you can argue well black folks stand out so that's why there's
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:26.040]  that stigma in that background you know at least in their mind so i get it i mean it's it's obviously
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:31.560]  a lot worse it's just that a lot of germans didn't get their freedom until the 1880s i just thought
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:35.720]  i'd digress and go to that so the germans had the first psychology was basically invented over
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:42.760]  there and it was funded by the king of prussia and others to create brainwashing uh mind war
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.480]  is what the germans call it mind war in german i forget what it translates to uh
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:51.400]  krieg is war what is mind in deutsch
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:57.800]  let's look it up what is mind in deutsch but but but but it's it's mind krieg
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:04.360]  and so they deployed that in the last hundred years where before they taught classical education
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.480]  falling in love with literature mathematics invention why it was cool the easiest way to learn
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:15.480]  something uh get a base of knowledge and accelerate from there where the united states had the most
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:28.280]  educated people in the world by about 1850 verse stand krieg verse stand krieg so they launched
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:35.720]  verse stand krieg really more than 200 years ago psychology was developed to create brainwash
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:42.760]  killer soldiers who would follow orders and do whatever they were told and they would do task
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:49.000]  well but would do whatever they were told by an authority figure which is great because it's funny
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:56.280]  the romans over 800 years could never keep germany conquered they were the most rebellious
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:02.200]  beat the germans the most times i mean beat the uh romans the most times sacked roam repeatedly
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:07.480]  took it over finally ended it then the muslims ended uh what was left of the roman empire
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:12.520]  at constantanople with the sacking and armada takeover but but again i'm digressing here
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:16.440]  the reason i got to this when you see these young men
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:28.040]  if someone younger than them or goofy looking with a hat on sideways told them give me your social
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:33.080]  security number give me your info they would say i'm gonna beat you up and get all outraged but
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:40.280]  because dice is six four looks like a cop and is talking to him like a cop with authority
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.240]  he does whatever he's told now we're not in a war with the police themselves but we're in a war
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.240]  with the globalists that have hijacked the government and through those conduits through
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:57.000]  the driveshaft down to the ground want to turn the police into their enforcers and want us to have
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:02.360]  a fight with the police but that to then turn them against us even more and vice versa but that
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:08.120]  doesn't mean then we submit to unlawful orders they've got a bill and they're readying it in
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:13.480]  arizona to ban filming police even in your own property that is the essence of hardcore tyranny
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:18.920]  and the destruction of the first amendment it's like this whole shan stone thing i've got clips
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:24.920]  of this they're saying arrest him he's a traitor he's the worst person on earth i've met shan pin
[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:30.520]  repeatedly i've talked to shan pin repeatedly i have been at dinner with shan pin there's probably
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:35.560]  20 people there but i talked to him and i i the first time i thought maybe he stoned or drunk
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:41.320]  no he wasn't he didn't even drink he's like a health guy now the next time i met him i thought okay
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:46.120]  he is stupid then i heard oh no he's real dumb i'm not being mean it's just true then i ran into him
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:53.960]  again arrogant and dumb but very self important now let me say he's self important he's anti gun
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:43:00.440]  he's an idiot used by the clinton's and others to raise money down there you know in um haydie but
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:06.520]  he really does mean well and he really does care about black people and is a huge bleeding heart
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:12.680]  and really does believe in communism and is the real deal he's a real moron but he is also a
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:19.000]  bleeding heart good guy shan pin is a nice guy but people think that's a cool look on his face
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.480]  when he looks like he doesn't care he's stupid okay i don't know how much what he's done to his
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:32.440]  brain but he's dumbered in a box of rocks he's dumbered in a democrat convention floor and
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:37.560]  then he meets with this arch criminal el chapo the journalists are allowed to meet with criminals
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:43.240]  as long as they don't aid nebetem as long as you don't tell el chapo any intel on how they're
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:48.200]  planning to capture him he was told you the journalists are allowed to fly into germany if
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:54.360]  you can get into germany and interview hitler you should be allowed to you know charlie manson
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.320]  if you can interview him before he got caught that's your issue
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:04.440]  but i think they told pin and i'm gonna say what i think happened here as soon as i heard this i said
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:10.840]  pin led them to el chapo in the little coastal city where then two days they admit oh the marines
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:19.960]  the uh tracked him the mexican marines the marinos because pin didn't hide his tracks properly
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.760]  i can't prove this but i i bet money because this wasn't supposed to come out a little bit later
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:33.240]  that they explained to pin hey you know where he is you have to tell us now or you're aiding in a
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:39.320]  betting that's why you'd want to meet el chapo another building and then have him leave right
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:42.760]  after el chapo would know that that hey i'm not to tell him where you're at after you leave
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.560]  but i don't think pin knew what he was getting into with this mexican actress i'm sure i know
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:50.680]  why he's hanging out with her who wouldn't and you know why he's running around down there playing
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:53.560]  the part of superhero because that's what he wants to do it's like when he went to katrina
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:57.400]  in the rowboat was trying to deliver food and people come up and talk to him he was so dumb he
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:03.640]  couldn't talk he was just like i mean he's kind of maybe quasi-autistic or something i don't know
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:08.600]  i mean he acts like he's got about an ad iq i'm not i'm not harping on that he means well though
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:16.760]  the the the brain of a child the the brain of a seven-year-old and so he shouldn't be charged but
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.720]  i don't think they just tracked him down del chapo i think sean pin probably pooped his pants
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:28.520]  when he heard he was facing 20 years in prison for aiding and a betting and uh told him or his
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:33.960]  girlfriend did or something like that i i can't prove it all i'm saying is don't charge sean pin
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:37.640]  because not only is he a journalist and has a lot of cover for that
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.720]  el chapo and his cartel has been directly connected to the cia i showed the articles yesterday
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:48.280]  el paso times you name it chicago tribune and his number two deputies and others have been
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.560]  busted and bring out that they're actually cia officers not just assets and are allowed to deal
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:46:01.400]  drugs that's a known fact so should you go after el chapo for murders absolutely but you can't really
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.600]  go after him for drug dealing because our government are the ones doing this but i've now gone 360 here
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:13.560]  the point is you want to see the social experiment of how submissive people are how domesticated
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:20.680]  they are i mean when they want to grope me at the tsa i can't help but go you know the borders open
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:24.280]  you know new york daily news reported two weeks ago they fly people in and don't even check their
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.480]  passports or ids under orders you know the border patrol completes the smuggling process and they
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:33.160]  go sir we're trying to do our job please please are you gonna comply i'm not gonna let you fly and
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:39.400]  i go listen listen if you had an apb out for a certain person and they had 10 cops lined up
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:43.640]  steering everybody coming in this airport because you thought some bad guy was coming through i
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:48.040]  wouldn't care about bags got searched every couple years or something in an emergency or there's a
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:51.800]  bank robber on the run and the cops think he's on a certain highway then that's when you have a
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:57.160]  checkpoint you don't set up standard checkpoints all the time when the country's wide open and do
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:02.840]  this it is to domesticate us i mean that happens all the time that's what happens when i fly
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:11.320]  if they get in my face and i go i do not disrespect you i am not against you as a person but this
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:15.640]  is unconstitutional and bull they go well they don't fly and i go oh it's going to be on the
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:22.680]  trains and the highways and now it is that's not true you know they admit it's already in trains
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:27.720]  and the highways they go oh well i just i mean they lectured me for 30 minutes a few months ago
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:33.720]  about grape jelly i just forgot and put my bag you know that a bottle of farmers market they
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.720]  kept saying you know we can put you in jail for this i said just go ahead and do it then i'm sick of
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:43.400]  this why were you trying to sneak it in trying to incriminate me i just said i still thought i was
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:48.760]  in a free country i didn't think about it when i put the other vegetables in my bag
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:57.080]  did these vegetables come from another country i'm flying out of oma hot austin texas you have my
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:03.080]  ticket i just told you it's from the farmers market you can see it on the jelly label i don't
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:07.560]  know why you're giving me a problem i don't know why you're causing sir put your camera down sir
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:14.200]  put your phone down sir shooting video how they're taking photos it's all dog training it's all slave
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:22.040]  training and this is the response to it idiots to a random person who doesn't even say who they are

[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.200]  they'll bully them and they give them the money we've been trained to be bullied we've been trained
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:49.080]  to comply we've been trained to regurgitate we're not taught how to think they call it critical
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:54.120]  thinking in public schools the program is to end critical thinking make learning boring make it
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:59.320]  horrible make you give up two plus two equals five five plus five plus five doesn't equal 15
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.760]  that's all officially in common court tell you how bad your country is tell you how bad you are
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:09.320]  demoralize you all day teach you how to be a basket case take all your jobs
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:17.560]  not let you exercise during physical education bad mouth your parents it's a giant reeducation camp
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:25.640]  and teach you how to bend over and cops and tsa when you get people to bend over to their rights
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:29.960]  you're screwing your own future you're like i know but we're following orders well we better

[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:30.120]  yeah
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:34.120]  jevity
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:39.240]  in the next segment we're going to be joined by a guest who has been on the show before a few
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:46.840]  months ago to talk about the migrant crisis as it relates to the epicenter of that crisis which
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:53.480]  of course is germany he's in germany he's a german commentator and blogger alexander bernesh so we've
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:01:00.360]  got that coming up in the next segment but first of all what's equally as shocking as the mass
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:07.000]  molestation of german women not only in cologne but also hamburg stuttgart and other cities in
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:14.440]  europe now they're coming out zürich um helsinki was another all these different major cities in
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:20.280]  europe on the night of new year's eve mass molestations by these muslim migrants but what's
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:28.040]  almost as shocking as the incidents themselves is the massive cover-up in the aftermath now of
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:34.280]  course we were well versed in this because we've been talking about the migrant rape epidemic which
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:41.640]  again primarily targets muslim women and muslim children in migrant camps so don't you dare
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:48.520]  utter the word racist simply because we're talking about this even as we have angela merkel and mark
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:56.040]  zuckerberg scheming to ban people on facebook even as we have twitter being bought out basically by
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:03.000]  saudi arabia and now we see people on twitter who criticize radical islam being suspended
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:10.280]  being banned being unverified we have posts being censored and the cover-up continues but we've
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:15.960]  been reporting on it for at least four or five months this is an article back in september on
[03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:22.920]  info wars dot com german police covering up rape so as not to legitimize critics of mass migration
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:28.600]  fears public knowledge of children being molested by muslim migrants could lead to quote right-wing
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:35.160]  demonstrations now this was the case in demald the city in west central germany and of course it
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:42.120]  emerged after numerous cases of muslim migrants raping women and children in and around migrant
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:49.800]  camps not only in germany but also in other cities in norway and sweden particularly of course top
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:55.160]  german social services organizations warned that around the same time that this was happening
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:03:01.320]  we had schools in germany ordering girls not to wear shorts or not to wear short skirts because
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:08.040]  they might trigger the migrants with their fantastic culture that we're importing to attack
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:15.080]  unrape young girls again we have to adapt to their culture even though it is a genuine real
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:21.400]  rape culture they don't have to adapt to ours so we would be reporting on it for at least
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:28.440]  four or five months on day one after the new year's eve attacks in cologne in these other major
[03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:35.480]  cities the cologne police put out a press release saying new year's eve celebrations were completely
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:41.000]  peaceful and there were no major incidents to report they actually said that the day after
[03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:48.360]  over a hundred women in fact if you total up all the different reports over 600 women in the other
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:56.440]  cities now complaining about being attacked sexually molested robbed by these migrants but
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:04:03.640]  according to the cologne police it was all hunky dory nothing happened so swing from day one now we
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:10.520]  learn that in sweden which of course is the epicenter of everything libtard this had been
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:18.520]  happening over a year ago this is out of politico.eu sweden investigates sex assault cover up in the
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:23.560]  wake of the german new year's eve sexual assault scandal swedish law enforcement authorities are
[03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:30.680]  looking into claims that the gang of mostly afghan men harassed girls at 2014 music festival
[03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:37.960]  an incident that initially went unreported by police we're gonna get into it after the break
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:43.080]  we're gonna talk about why they covered it up straight ahead then we'll have our guests on

[03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:27.640]  guest here in a moment but before the break i was talking about this article out of politico.eu
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:33.640]  now we know that there was a massive cover-up in the aftermath of the mass molestation in cologne
[03:08:33.640 --> 03:08:40.200]  on new year's eve the very first day the police came out and said nothing happened well this cover-up
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:47.800]  stretches back even further this is sweden of course which has a rape rate that has risen 1400
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:53.880]  percent since they opened its their doors to mass immigration back in the 70s no correlation
[03:08:53.880 --> 03:09:00.280]  whatsoever i'm sure and this was a pop concert back in the summer of 2014 sweden investigated
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:07.320]  sex assault cover-up about 50 years predominantly from afghanistan according to sources quoted by
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:13.240]  the swedish daily dagans niheter were involved in sexual assaults involving girls as young as 11
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:20.920]  years old after the incident stock home police reported that their quote had been relatively
[03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:28.520]  few crimes now what does that remind you of the cologne police the day after the mass molestations
[03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:33.880]  in that city coming out and saying there were no incidents whatsoever but listen to this
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:40.120]  this is what happened in sweden a year and a half ago and we're only just finding out about it now
[03:09:40.680 --> 03:09:46.840]  this is how long this cover-up's been going on according to peter agren head of the festival's
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:53.560]  police operation the background of the men could be a reason why police did not initially report
[03:09:53.560 --> 03:10:00.760]  the case quote sometimes we do not really say how things are because we believe it may play into
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:09.960]  the hands of the right wing party sweden democrats agren told the newspaper so he's brazenly admitting
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:16.200]  that they refused to report these rapes that targeted dozens of women swedish women at this
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:24.360]  music concert because it might give votes to the opposition political party so they're covering up
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:31.800]  rapes they're covering up crimes so as not to legitimize critics of mass immigration so as
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:39.720]  not to boost the poll numbers of their political operation opposition so again using rape or the
[03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:46.360]  cover-up as of rape as a political tool it's happening in germany we reported on it back in
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:53.160]  september the police covering up crimes so as not to quote legitimize critics of mass migration
[03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:59.880]  now we learn it's been going on in sweden for at least 18 months in this one case alone
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:08.120]  of course we had the ikea attack in sweden last year which was again covered up watered down
[03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:15.240]  diluted the swedish left actually responded by marching against not the people who beheaded
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:21.400]  someone in an ikea store but against the people who criticized this kind of culture that were
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:28.040]  importing into europe similar to how the german interior minister said that posts by right-wing
[03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:34.920]  commentators on the internet were quote at least as awful as the mass molestations that took place
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:40.760]  in cologne absolutely astounding comments he's not been forced to resign yet the chief of
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:47.800]  policing in cologne was so again this this cover-up and this censure this targeting of critics of
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:55.240]  this migrant wave continues even as the left plays down or ignores actual violent sexual
[03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:01.400]  attacks being committed in many major european cities so now here to talk about it and he was on
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:08.120]  the show again last year to talk about the migrant crisis is german commentator alexander
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:15.400]  menesh from the website recent r.com alex welcome to the show thanks for having me on part
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:22.840]  well now we're about a week in after the german media actually started covering this story they
[03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:28.920]  ignored it for days after it first broke on social media again we had the police cover up from day
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:36.120]  one what's the mood like in germany is the outrage continuing to build or have leftists
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:43.240]  and politicians been successful in smearing criticism of this crisis as right-wing xenophobia
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:52.280]  well the cover-up is dead they tried it it failed social media alternative media they were talking
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:13:02.360]  a lot about it and so the debate was over about what actually happened so this was not going to
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:09.000]  be covered up any longer so then mainstream media did a complete flip so they started to make this
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:16.840]  the the headline story it's been the top news item for about a week it's the mainstream media leaking
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:22.280]  the preliminary police report leaking this new more detailed report with all the all the horrible
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:29.560]  details so why is mainstream media doing this now they try to regain credibility uh in order to at
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:37.480]  least control the debate of what's going what's supposed to happen uh so they can't they can
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:44.120]  manipulate the debate what actually happened in cologne and other cities in europe that debate is
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:51.080]  done but if they create this this flurry of news articles and in more details and more
[03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:58.280]  and more and more details they can at least dominate and and control the debate of what
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:06.920]  should happen next i have this uh a recent story it's about the german minister for development
[03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:14.200]  a man called geert müller he's billed as a conservative and he says there there's eight to
[03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:23.160]  ten million more migrants on the way eight to ten million more migrants on the way from syria
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:30.840]  and iraq and so he says and this is just the beginning um there's going to be a lot more people
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:39.160]  coming potentially coming from africa so his suggestion is not to close the borders uh his
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:46.440]  suggestion is to um have germany and german citizens take on a whole new level of global
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:53.960]  responsibility now of course that means he wants money and this this sounds threatening to me so
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:15:03.320]  he's saying give us more money so we can reorganize africa and other parts of the world uh give us
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:12.040]  that money or else we're going to be uh flooded with more and more migrants so um this is a pretty
[03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:22.600]  recent story and it's even crazier he says in the same in the same statement this man said uh europe
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:31.160]  has a debt uh europe has a guilt our wealth was built on the back of the third world now this is
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:37.640]  something you expect from a communist but not from a conservative so i'm supposed to pay off my
[03:15:37.640 --> 03:15:46.200]  debts to pay off my guilt uh and if i don't do that tens tens of millions and more millions of
[03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:55.240]  migrants are going to come so this is the state of um of the debate so it's people know what happened
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:16:00.680]  people know what actually happened so the remaining debate is what's going to happen now
[03:16:01.880 --> 03:16:07.880]  intelligence there's no indication intelligence agencies had any pre-warning uh german intelligence
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:14.760]  is supposed to have informants and actual trained agents among these fresh waves of migrants that this
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:21.480]  is what every country does and uh and also you need to check everybody coming in you need to
[03:16:21.480 --> 03:16:27.000]  fingerprint them you need to identify them and you need to do a background check and a lot of these
[03:16:27.720 --> 03:16:34.840]  a lot of these guys that did the sexual assaults they had temporary papers so all the background
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:42.920]  checking hasn't even been done yet all there hasn't been a decision made about their rights to asylum
[03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:51.240]  and so intelligence apparently had no pre-warning and even government federal agencies said um this
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:58.760]  is a huge problem there have been hundreds of thousands of migrants in 2015 coming in without
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:05.720]  any background checks no background checks um no bearing in mind i like this was organized this
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:11.160]  had to be organized on the internet for thousands of people to show up in all these different cities
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:17.000]  and carry this out which brings brings us to the security angle because you had the bizarre incident
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:22.040]  in Germany during the soccer game or before the soccer game right after the paris attacks where
[03:17:22.040 --> 03:17:27.000]  the police blew the whistle and said they saw an ambulance full of explosives that got shut down
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:32.760]  that story disappeared you had people involved in this mass molestation in cologne as he said
[03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:38.040]  who were unregistered refugees the decision hadn't even been made on whether to officially
[03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:44.280]  allow them to stay in the country you've got the terrorist who was shot dead in paris last week
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:51.800]  staying at a german refugee camp and having been charged with sexual sexual assault in cologne
[03:17:51.800 --> 03:17:57.880]  they're speculating possibly he was involved in the events on new year's eve given this total
[03:17:57.880 --> 03:18:03.640]  security standout this complete lack of intelligence how long do you think before
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:11.480]  germany suffers a paris style attack as a result of this mass migrant wave well media
[03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:20.120]  various types of media organs they have already commented it only takes one attack one serious
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:28.680]  attack carried out by a migrant one single attack is all it takes to end the chance
[03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:36.040]  ownership of angela mackle to create shockwaves in the country so the right wing uh the conservatives
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:41.320]  and the extreme right wing they're going to be absolutely furious and if they get furious
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:47.560]  a few of them are going to do stupid things and then the left becomes uh the left is going to
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:52.440]  explode that's already happening by the way that's not reported internationally there's
[03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:59.000]  stabbings politically motivated stabbings you know left uh leftist leftist groups they're
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:04.360]  stabbing conservatives they're torching their cars they're threatening their wives and and all
[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:10.680]  this stuff is going on of course there's a few ultra right wing uh ultra right wing guys who burn
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:18.680]  on uh refugee places um but it's it's it's a spiral of provocation see the government
[03:19:18.680 --> 03:19:24.200]  and is responsible for for this mass and subsequently all these different groups
[03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:30.360]  are getting more and more agitated i mean clearly even federal agencies say what happened on
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:39.080]  december 31st um was a new level of problems a new level of escalation now even if these events
[03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:44.200]  were spontaneous that would still be a security nightmare because what is going to happen next
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:49.720]  what if next time it's spontaneous rioting spontaneous looting and dead people okay we're
[03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:54.920]  gonna get more into it after the break with alexander panache the security angle is civil unrest

[03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:33.960]  in a little while but first let's concentrate on the molestations themselves that happen in
[03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:39.160]  cologne and all these other major cities because we got the video up on info wars.com of this
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:45.400]  dutch journalist basically being attacked by a huge muslim mob during protests against the
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:52.440]  egyptian president mohammed morsy back in june 2013 they dragged her away in a huge mob as she's
[03:24:52.440 --> 03:24:58.440]  screaming her head off completely harrowing video but this is the concept of muslim gang rape and
[03:24:58.440 --> 03:25:06.280]  how it's being institutionalized into muslim male culture it's known as taharosh this has been seen
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:13.160]  in numerous different north african countries again it's part of this using rape as a tool we've
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:21.480]  seen rape being used as a political tool in syria in other places by isis jihadis alex talk to us
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:26.280]  about taharosh where i mean what is this where have we seen it before explain this to people
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:35.240]  well according to german federal agencies the agencies are aware that this phenomenon called
[03:25:35.240 --> 03:25:40.840]  taharosh gamia this phenomenon is known in certain arab countries and of course this is
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:49.160]  one this is one angle it's gatherings and people ganging up on women and trying to rape them
[03:25:50.520 --> 03:25:58.520]  but this is only part of the problem this the syrian conflict has the syrian conflict has
[03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:06.600]  led to a a rape epidemic i think this was kind of the title the story from the magazine the atlantic
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:14.760]  but of course in western media they tend to focus on systematic rape or allegations of systematic
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:19.480]  rape conducted by the Assad government now if you look a little bit deeper you find
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:30.920]  equal allegations of systematic rape done by the opposition groups and you can find the story and
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:37.480]  there's a lot of details in this kind of the tactic is to completely break the enemy completely
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:44.920]  break the family because if you terrorize one person in front of the others that's going to
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:53.880]  lead to massive traumatization and the lack of will to fight it's kind of an economic cheap way
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:27:05.560]  of intimidation a cheap way of of warfare there have been reports about about islamic scholars
[03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:16.280]  producing these legal opinions so is islamic scholarly legal opinions that it's supposedly
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:27.080]  okay to rape alawait women this is kind this is the uh this is the group in syria uh that's
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:32.360]  leading right now if you look back in the history of course the power has always shifted from one
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.360]  group to the other and then back and forth and back and forth and this is kind of how they
[03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:44.920]  want to win uh want to fight dirty so of course media is now i have this report on my second
[03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:50.840]  monitor behind me uh we have the detailed report we have reports about german federal agencies
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:58.120]  knowing that this is a known phenomenon uh but they're not talking yet about systematic rape as a
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:04.600]  tool especially in syria so that's that's not really debated right now because that would lead to
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:14.280]  a lot more outrage and a lot more fear so if you have um if you have kind of this
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:20.520]  this this fear in germany this is going to lead to serious uh serious provocations in all kind of
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:26.840]  directions i think i think even the international audience has read the reports people are buying
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:35.560]  this here uh law enforcement strength pepper spray we're selling pepper spray and people are buying
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:43.320]  this stuff every day and then everybody else is buying pepper spray and this is this is something
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:50.600]  that people take very seriously and of course there's this idea of uh the idea from the right wing
[03:28:50.600 --> 03:28:56.120]  we know we're going to create uh civil defense groups and that that has an important place in a
[03:28:56.120 --> 03:29:06.600]  society now but then we enter the murky sphere of government trickery so the government let
[03:29:06.600 --> 03:29:13.560]  this threat happen they they were responsible for this migration uh and and of course uh the european
[03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:18.600]  governments are also responsible for what happened in syria and also iraq i mean they they they
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:26.200]  claimed responsibility uh when it came to uh the future of iraq and syria so western governments
[03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:32.680]  thought we know better we're gonna take charge we're gonna decide for these people and now we
[03:29:32.680 --> 03:29:37.880]  have the consequences okay alexander bernesh stay right there we got a break coming up

[03:30:06.120 --> 03:30:11.160]  exemptions to unions that supported the passage of obama care that's right obama gave some of his
[03:30:11.160 --> 03:30:15.880]  favorite organizations exemption from some of obama care's requirements because many of them
[03:30:15.880 --> 03:30:20.680]  were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program once these
[03:30:20.680 --> 03:30:25.960]  groups realized just how bad obama care really was they wanted exemptions from the very same law
[03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:31.640]  they forced on everyone else which obama gave them president obama also had the irs grant special

[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:20.840]  it's the fourth hour live on the alex jones show with me paul joseph watson talking to our guest
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:27.960]  alexander benesh of course last night we had an incident in calgary canada where two muslims named
[03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:33.000]  muhammad burst into a nightclub and tried to shoot the place up luckily they were stopped
[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:40.760]  by a couple of alert bounces two days ago over in vancouver canada syrian refugees pepper sprayed
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:47.640]  after welcoming event at muslim center guess which story the media the international media
[03:33:47.640 --> 03:33:53.800]  is more interested in two guys called muhammad trying to commit a terror attack in a nightclub
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:34:00.440]  or some syrian refugees being pepper sprayed of course it's the refugees being pepper sprayed
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:07.080]  and even daring to ask whether that attack in calgary was terrorism is completely off the table
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:14.600]  because it's racist to even suggest that now we've got swedish authorities covering up cologne style
[03:34:14.600 --> 03:34:21.880]  mass molestations for over a year and a half we've got the syrian isis supporter who was shot dead
[03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:27.960]  outside of paris police station last week trying to stab police while chanting ala akbar he stayed
[03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:32.520]  at the german refugee camp he may have been involved in the mass molestations themselves
[03:34:32.520 --> 03:34:40.200]  and of course feminists allow to even mention it we've got germans buying pepper spray in their
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:46.680]  droves we've got them trying to arm themselves to defend themselves against this very real security
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:53.640]  threat now we were talking alex just previously about the civil unrest aspect to all this we've
[03:34:53.640 --> 03:34:58.760]  got neo-nazis extremists being emboldened by the fact that moderate voices are being strangled
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:05.160]  because they're afraid or just completely unwilling to criticize this so that vacuum is being filled
[03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:11.240]  by extremists on both sides that's going to ramp up we're going to get more attacks on migrants
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:17.960]  more attacked by migrants we've got top experts in france and germany as well as the head of the
[03:35:17.960 --> 03:35:25.000]  swiss army recently warning that civil unrest is coming to europe as a result of this mass
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:31.640]  immigration crisis do you think that's likely for one or will europeans continue to stick their
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:39.080]  heads in the sand even though basically their culture is being thrown before the walls well
[03:35:39.080 --> 03:35:47.640]  there's a certain chance that a that part of part of certain migrants they want to destabilize
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:55.400]  germany and europe through systematic rape because it's cheap because it's a systematic rape is
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:02.040]  cheap it's easy to do it doesn't involve complex plots it doesn't involve a whole lot of a whole
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:09.080]  lot of complicated conspiring and that sort of thing so that's one way to destabilize europe and
[03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:15.000]  of course others are trying to infiltrate government others trying to play nice or
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:22.280]  act nice others are trying to do classic terrorist plots and the line of thinking is
[03:36:22.280 --> 03:36:28.600]  you destabilize a country you destabilize a region a lot of muslims think europeans are pretty weak
[03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:36.280]  and pampered i think they underestimate they underestimate europe and that's that's very
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:44.600]  dangerous so yeah that that's kind of the way of the extremist line of thinking you destabilize
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:51.160]  a region and then you have all this this provocation going back and forth you end up with civil war
[03:36:51.160 --> 03:36:57.880]  and of course you hope your side is going to win but you have to ask yourself this why did
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:37:05.320]  why did the political establishment allow all this to happen i mean it's it's there it's it's
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:13.320]  the plan of politicians to have a european union super state to expand it to a mediterranean union
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:20.440]  and all of this so wouldn't it have been smart in order to get the super state wouldn't it have been
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:31.240]  smart to have a harsh justice system against these type of these type of migrant crimes i mean wouldn't
[03:37:31.240 --> 03:37:38.520]  that have made sense for the political establishment to keep the european population happy so people
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:44.680]  would say yes this migration thing seems to work yeah fine let's have the super state and you know
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:53.240]  lure people into this trap so why didn't why didn't the establishment play it like this why didn't
[03:37:53.240 --> 03:38:02.600]  they made sure from the beginning decades ago that migrants cannot be criminal they they there's
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:10.680]  going to be swift and harsh justice why didn't they to use an extreme example form a communist
[03:38:10.680 --> 03:38:18.120]  eastern germany during the cold war they barely had any migration in a classic sense and they had
[03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:26.600]  almost zero muslim migration and so this is an extreme example so governments if they want to
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:33.880]  socialist governments they can do this they can create any kind of justice system they like and
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:40.920]  have the media uh have the media portray this as a working system and everything's fine so why
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:46.920]  doesn't the european union what why hasn't the european union uh done that what why is this
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:53.800]  why do we see a massive radicalization of migrants and the ultra right wing and and the ultra left
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:39:00.920]  why is that well this is the kind of the extreme scenario i'm not saying that this is definitely
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:08.920]  going to happen but uh this is one of the main scenarios as i see it so you have the migrants
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:14.920]  trying or as part of the migrants trying to destabilize then the right wing goes crazy then
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:23.480]  the left wing goes crazy and if i was if i was an evil government if i was a psychopathic government
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:31.960]  i would create this muslim threat create this this radicalization or help this muslim radicalization
[03:39:31.960 --> 03:39:37.960]  then i would secretly help the right wing or the extreme right wing i would also secretly help the
[03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:46.920]  extreme left and then when civil war breaks out i would watch as all these groups basically wipe
[03:39:46.920 --> 03:39:53.800]  each other out so i the government would be the last player standing now of course same
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:59.160]  same type of strategy would work in the united states of course in the united states uh a
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:06.360]  psychopathic government would also have to uh secretly or not so secretly push radical black
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:13.480]  groups and radical latino groups so of course this is this is not a complicated this is not a
[03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:23.400]  complicated strategy uh it gets it gets artificially well they make it look complicated by obfuscating
[03:40:23.400 --> 03:40:29.640]  by changing the words and and obfuscating through the debate but the core strategy
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:36.440]  in this scenario would be this and of course we've seen governments are here in europe
[03:40:36.440 --> 03:40:41.160]  building up the extreme right wing and also helping the extreme left you got conservatives
[03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:47.080]  complaining why does the government give support to the extreme left why uh why does the extreme
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:56.200]  left get money uh why can they use rooms paid for by taxpayer money and all that sort of things so
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:04.200]  this is this is one very scary scenario it's kind of this this this idea of a government
[03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:13.400]  not wanting to fight the conservatives directly but rather have this civil war with different
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:20.280]  factions different uh uh extremist factions so the government can stand down for a while the
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:27.240]  government can can you know lean back and watch these events unfold so the government doesn't
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:33.400]  have to fight the right wingers and of course we know from you know 12 13 years ago reports came out
[03:41:33.400 --> 03:41:40.200]  that the neo-nazi movement in germany was completely infiltrated by the state by intelligence agencies
[03:41:40.200 --> 03:41:45.640]  so they had control of it at the top way back then of course we've got the birth of this pagida
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:50.920]  movement now which is probably something separate the police in cologne were far quicker to respond
[03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:55.960]  to their demonstration you know with water cannons than they were to respond to the actual mass
[03:41:55.960 --> 03:42:02.600]  molestations but you talked about the the wider agenda behind this of course merkel came out several
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:07.320]  times another germans came out and said you know we need this cheap labor we need this flood of
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:14.440]  immigrants to replace the german population to supplement and you know keep going our demographics
[03:42:14.440 --> 03:42:19.480]  because basically we're dying out and we're going to have no workers that is disproven if you look
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:25.320]  at other countries like the Czech republic which has had a stable population for a hundred years
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:32.440]  very little immigration and it's the most thriving economy in europe so this argument that you
[03:42:32.440 --> 03:42:39.080]  need constant supply of mass immigration simply to keep the economy afloat um eventually doesn't
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:44.120]  doesn't make any sense only if you you know set up your economy to be dependent on that in the
[03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:50.120]  first place which gets to what you were talking about and the EU itself talking about exploiting
[03:42:50.120 --> 03:42:57.000]  the crisis now the EU has come out and said if there's a border crisis related to this migrant
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:02.600]  issue which they determine national governments are incapable of handling they will come in with
[03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:10.360]  and basically in occupying EU army and take over border security of sovereign nations without their
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:17.880]  consent so they're already exploiting the crisis that they created to increase and centralize their
[03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:22.360]  own power which is what it comes down to when you were talking about playing the sides off against
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:28.520]  each other but i wanted to ask you about something else which was in my video the rape of europe i
[03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:34.680]  feature the clips of german politicians for example a green party politician who gets up in front
[03:43:34.680 --> 03:43:41.000]  of the parliament there and celebrates the fact that germans will be a minority within major
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:47.080]  german cities in 20 years you had other politicians implying that the people who oppose this mass
[03:43:47.080 --> 03:43:53.000]  immigration are nazis who are going to be demographically cold because they didn't have
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:59.880]  enough children i mean what is driving this searing self-hatred by the left is it merely the
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:08.680]  guilt complex from world war two from hitler or does it go deeper than that um it's it's it's
[03:44:08.680 --> 03:44:19.320]  the problem is this um left the leftist ideology socialism uh socialism has a completely faulty
[03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:29.080]  concept of the nature of evil in in socialist ideology uh evil comes from the family uh comes
[03:44:29.080 --> 03:44:35.960]  from uh private ownership comes from the right to the right to run your own business this is
[03:44:35.960 --> 03:44:43.400]  to a communist this is kind of the um the root of evil this is where evil comes from and because
[03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:50.840]  socialists have this faulty concept uh socialists have these this faulty concept of evil that's why
[03:44:50.840 --> 03:44:59.560]  their their methods to fix evil are are horrible so if you think the family and uh the the family
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:04.360]  and if you think private ownership if you think that's that's the cause of all evil
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:10.280]  then the strategy is destroy the family destroy private ownership and destroy
[03:45:11.240 --> 03:45:17.880]  basically the the uh independent citizen now in all these different extremist groups
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:24.440]  you have the more moderates and then you have the extremists but the extremists they permeate
[03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:29.720]  through these other groups through these these moderate groups they try to make it
[03:45:29.720 --> 03:45:37.400]  so that you can't distinguish anymore so uh if if your concept of evil is completely faulty you
[03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:47.640]  can't fix evil and so the left has this this additional idea that somehow uh germans um
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:56.600]  somehow germans are are inherently inherently evil but of course you know germans are just
[03:45:56.600 --> 03:46:02.760]  you know we're middle europeans you know germans have spread all over the world i think the largest
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:08.840]  ethnic group in the united states is uh is uh people americans with german heritage either
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:15.880]  partially or or fully i mean there were huge migrant waves of germans to the united states you
[03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:24.680]  know long you know long before uh world war two and world war one so uh it's germans are not
[03:46:24.680 --> 03:46:32.840]  inherently evil right but somehow the left has cultivated this idea let's just erase germany
[03:46:32.840 --> 03:46:38.760]  let's just get rid of the germans you know then the world will be safer and of course this is not
[03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:50.120]  rational this is not rational at all uh and um in we've seen these these arguments uh after the
[03:46:50.120 --> 03:47:01.000]  events of december 31st uh i have my my my notes here uh so i got my notes here you had paul you
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:08.200]  had the whole left from politicians prominent politicians to the left media even vice vice
[03:47:08.200 --> 03:47:13.960]  magazine and in germany they were all saying the same things they all had the same talking points
[03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:17.800]  it's like you you could you could look at any website they were all saying the same things
[03:47:17.800 --> 03:47:28.120]  for example it it's supposed to be racist to describe the events that happened as unusual
[03:47:28.120 --> 03:47:33.560]  and noteworthy so you're not even supposed to make it make any kind of big deal out of it
[03:47:34.120 --> 03:47:42.520]  and it's also evil and bad to notice the background of the perpetrators and um they
[03:47:42.520 --> 03:47:51.880]  the left made this argument that during every october fest during every single october fest
[03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:58.760]  there's supposedly a a large large number of unreported rapes so some of them some of these
[03:47:58.760 --> 03:48:07.160]  leftists even tossed around the number 200 like 200 rapes during every single october fest and
[03:48:07.160 --> 03:48:12.520]  even mainstream publications they looked that up and said this is not true police statistics say
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:22.120]  uh during every october fest you have between one and six rapes uh and uh and not 200 and so um
[03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:29.320]  of course it's not just migrants or it's not just migrants from syria uh that that
[03:48:30.200 --> 03:48:35.480]  rape women or or attempt to sexually assault women or that's that's nobody even claimed that you
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:41.320]  know they're the left is countering arguments that nobody made that nobody made in the first place
[03:48:41.320 --> 03:48:46.280]  they create the strawman then they beat up the strawman and say look how cool we are look how
[03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:58.120]  how how true we are and then they uh yeah they had this whole this whole set of talking points
[03:48:58.120 --> 03:49:06.200]  uh about about the rapes and and and what that means so essentially it comes down to what is
[03:49:06.200 --> 03:49:12.680]  your concept of evil you know where does it come from and how does it spread and um of course if
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:20.680]  if your ideas about that are completely faulty and for example uh you derive your ideas from
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:27.640]  socialist uh socialist books then of course it's there's going to be problems you know you you can
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:35.160]  fix evil if you don't understand it you can't cure something which you don't understand amazing

[03:54:06.680 --> 03:54:16.040]  radio network i fell into a burning ring of fire i went down down down the final segment of the alex
[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:21.800]  jones show fourth hour overdrive basically twitter has responded to the clone sex attacks by
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:30.280]  accelerating its purge of criticism or humor directed towards the religion not the race the
[03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:37.640]  religion of islam and it's basically now sending a message to conservatives and real classical
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:44.440]  liberals who dare to criticize the belief system of islam as completely intolerant as we saw with
[03:54:44.440 --> 03:54:51.240]  the migrant attacks on new year's eve they're sending the message self sensor or risk being banned
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:58.200]  it's that simple i'm seeing content censored i'm seeing people being banned unverified people on
[03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:04.040]  facebook having their accounts suspended simply for saying that german women should have the right
[03:55:04.920 --> 03:55:11.480]  how dare they the right to defend themselves against rapists account suspended for 30 days
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:17.400]  why does that matter people say oh just get off of facebook get off of twitter you know go and use
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:24.280]  this other social network which has like 50 people on it great as drudge won these are the internet
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:30.600]  ghettos this is where all the content is heading so we need to be present on that battlefield while
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:37.160]  retaining our own platforms but again first it's twitter then it's facebook then as we saw with top
[03:55:37.160 --> 03:55:44.760]  feminist going in front of the un its isps cutting off internet access all together for people who
[03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:51.080]  make for example well in their case it was saying you suck to a feminist that was the the required
[03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:57.080]  offensive term for getting your internet access card so this really goes right up to the top
[03:55:57.080 --> 03:56:02.920]  and now we're beginning to see it with facebook and twitter it's a direct threat to free speech on
[03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:08.920]  the internet and we really need to rally behind it people say well twitter's a a private company
[03:56:08.920 --> 03:56:13.720]  it can host what it wants well yeah but it's completely hypocritical because the only people
[03:56:13.720 --> 03:56:21.160]  of being banned are conservatives and critics of islam and critics of feminist and in many cases
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:28.360]  that's as a result of mass mobs of feminists and islamists reporting them not for hate speech
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:34.280]  not for violent comments but for merely disagreeing with their political viewpoint so that's why it's
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:40.440]  important we got this headline out of the independent austrian police chief warns women not to leave
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:45.240]  home alone in wake of cologne sex attacks vienna's chief of police has warned women against venturing
[03:56:45.240 --> 03:56:51.320]  into the streets alone in the wake of highly publicized sexual assaults in germany and austria
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:56:58.360]  so again it's about blaming the victims we have to adapt our culture the migrants don't have to adapt
[03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:04.520]  theirs maybe we should just put everyone in a full burqa and have done with it oh but they actually
[03:57:04.520 --> 03:57:10.200]  sexually molest people in burqas in countries like egypt afghanistan and syria as well so
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:16.520]  even that wouldn't work we've got this article out of bribar muslim men shoot up nightclub
[03:57:16.520 --> 03:57:23.000]  government and media refuse to use the m word so basically two muslims named muhammad went and
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:29.800]  shot up a nightclub in calgary last night and the entirety of the canadian media den even
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:35.320]  mentioned the word muslim den even speculate whether it's a terror attack so for the past two weeks
[03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:41.720]  you've had leftist whining about oh the media doesn't call it terrorism when white al qaeda
[03:57:41.720 --> 03:57:47.080]  takes over an empty building in the middle of nowhere they only blame terrorism on muslims well
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:53.960]  in this case then they den even mentioned the m word yeah international media has been all over
[03:57:53.960 --> 03:57:59.800]  this story syrian refugees pepper sprayed after a welcoming event at vancouver muslim center so
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:07.800]  again you see the bias attacks on migrants although lamentable they get reported two guys called muhammad
[03:58:07.800 --> 03:58:12.520]  go to a nightclub in calgary try to shoot the place up and it's you know well this might be
[03:58:12.520 --> 03:58:18.680]  gang related let's not talk about islamic terrorism even though we've had numerous similar instances
[03:58:18.680 --> 03:58:23.160]  in recent weeks paris last week being one of them but that's going to wrap it up for the
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:29.160]  fourth hour of the alex joneshow i've been your host paul joseph watson alex jones will be back 11
