[00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:06.353]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:08.134]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:09.896]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:11.478]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.020]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.224]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:21.269]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:38.704]  Roger Stone, some of the brains behind the Trump victory march.
[00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:52.698]  He's going to be joining us for a full hour, ladies and gentlemen, coming up today on this Monday, worldwide broadcast, the 11th day of January 2016.
[00:00:52.698 --> 00:01:07.141]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us, dealing with the latest InfoWars.com article about the public development
[00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:14.044]  Of what radical Muslim culture calls conquest by rape.
[00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.943]  Or the terrorism of rape that is being directed at Europe and the United States and other areas by design.
[00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:29.966]  Shocking footage of the radical jihadist in the Middle East raping and torturing women.
[00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:39.111]  And of course famously they've grabbed female reporters off the streets while they're reporting how great they are and how wonderful it is they overthrew the Egyptian government.
[00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:39.431]  Remember that?
[00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:42.833]  And then they take a woman and a hundred plus people gang raper.
[00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.643]  And then the feminists all make excuses about it because it doesn't fit into the proper narrative.
[00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:51.625]  That's all coming up today.
[00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:53.926]  And now Merkel says, you know what?
[00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.368]  It's 10 million more migrants.
[00:01:56.368 --> 00:02:04.134]  See, first it's 100,000, then 300,000, then a million, then 3 million, then, oh, I'm afraid it's total invasion.
[00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:06.136]  And after 10 million, it'll be 50 million.
[00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:07.196]  And after 50 million, it'll be 100 million.
[00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:10.674]  And after 100 million, it'll be 300 million.
[00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:18.198]  Because there are a billion, 200-plus million Muslims, and about half of them are total sympathizers with jihadists.
[00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:29.243]  You know that woman that, quote, silently protested, wearing her hajib, standing up at the Trump rally, who was escorted out for standing up behind Trump, obviously trying to disrupt things?
[00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:30.984]  Turns out she's hosted parties
[00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:40.611]  For the convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:50.977]  Muslim woman 56 kicked out of Donald Trump event and booed by audience after standing silent protests when he suggests Syrian refugees are affiliated with ISIS.
[00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:52.078]  Affiliated?
[00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:54.079]  Most of them are invaders that got kicked out.
[00:02:54.997 --> 00:03:04.106]  Well, now there's a new article detailing exactly what she's been connected to, supporting Sharia Law and Jihad.
[00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:09.190]  She supports wearing a full beekeeper suit.
[00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.793]  A full burqa.
[00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:16.537]  But to get in the event, obviously she's had her head and stuff covered up.
[00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:17.919]  And I'm just sorry!
[00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.141]  My daughters aren't gonna put the hood on their head.
[00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:26.109]  And I'm not going to throw them into public schools so they can get intimidated by some kind of jihad gang into doing it.
[00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.110]  That's happening more and more.
[00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.654]  It's impressionable kids get scared under gang mentality, no matter what the gang is.
[00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:37.298]  White supremacists, black supremacists, Crips, Bloods, Mexican Mafia.
[00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:41.040]  But more and more there's Muslim pressure groups in schools, in Europe especially,
[00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:55.237]  And the children, especially girls, go under Stockholm Syndrome and convert to Islam at age 14, 15, and then get on a plane and fly in to be sex dolls for the jihadis.
[00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:19.654]  Remember all the young women in England and France and Australia getting on airplanes, running away from mommy and daddy with their little spoiled rotten cards because it was such a radical thing and then getting to the hellish pits and being, you know, used and passed around by the jihadis and then crying and making phone calls back, mommy, mommy, get me out, mommy, mommy.
[00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:27.316]  So, this is the wages of tyranny, is complete enslavement and humiliation.
[00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:30.537]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:32.957]  Oh my gosh, there is just so much to cover today.
[00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.198]  It is all incredibly important.
[00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:37.478]  Strap yourselves in, get ready.
[00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:42.900]  We have multiple jihad attacks in the U.S., Canada, and France.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.001]  And the media, including Fox News, I was on the elliptical this morning.
[00:04:46.914 --> 00:04:52.347]  And they said, radical, you know, shoots police officer in America.
[00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:54.070]  No, he was a jihadi.
[00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.857]  But they won't say it even on Fox.
[00:04:58.817 --> 00:05:04.061]  President Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about, until now.
[00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:09.784]  For one thing, he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare.
[00:05:09.784 --> 00:05:20.531]  That's right, Obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's requirements, because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program.
[00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:28.737]  Once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was, they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else, which Obama gave them.
[00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:34.718]  President Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity.
[00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:43.340]  The Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a non-profit application within just one month from the Barack H. Obama Foundation.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.921]  Additionally, the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's tax-exempt status.
[00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:55.823]  You can find out more from the article on InfoWars.com entitled, 75 Times Obama Broke Law During Presidency.
[00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:57.223]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:03.839]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:26.595]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:32.380]  David Bowie, 69, died of cancer yesterday.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.324]  An unnamed cancer.
[00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:40.067]  I personally really like David Bowie's music.
[00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:41.788]  The full spectrum of it is it's all good.
[00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:42.709]  A lot of it is excellent.
[00:08:48.268 --> 00:08:53.250]  And what's even more interesting is his movies like The Hunger, The Man Who Fell From Space.
[00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.592]  Those are excellent 1970s and 1980s movies.
[00:08:55.592 --> 00:08:56.572]  Listen to this lyrics right here.
[00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:32.184]  So there goes David Bowie making the jump into hyperspace.
[00:09:32.184 --> 00:09:36.467]  Didn't agree with a lot of his politics, but definitely a very, very talented artist.
[00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:45.432]  And I tell you, you can't get a more English or Welsh name than his real name.
[00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:54.878]  Some good lyrics.
[00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:57.320]  His real name was David Jones.
[00:09:58.755 --> 00:10:04.024]  That's why the old British Navy called the bottom of the ocean Davy Jones' Locker.
[00:10:05.017 --> 00:10:08.740]  Because so many David Joneses went to the bottom of the sea.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.025]  That's the most common name, at least in olden times in jolly old England, is David Jones.
[00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.506]  That's my dad's name.
[00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:22.332]  I wonder why my grandparents gave him the most common name there is, at least in jolly old England.
[00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:26.595]  But David Jones at age 69 is dead and it's not my father.
[00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:28.717]  But I tell you, I got up this morning at about 6.30.
[00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:34.076]  Went in, turned on the computer, David Bowie's dad, real name David Jones.
[00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.818]  I knew his name was David Jones.
[00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:45.326]  But when you look at it, and basically the same age as my dad, it gives you a jolt that, man, I want my dad to be around as long as he can be.
[00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:50.851]  That's my personal angle on the whole David Bowie situation.
[00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.133]  And my parents are obviously David Bowie fans.
[00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:55.935]  And so I grew up listening to it.
[00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:57.757]  And my mom, you know, showing me David Bowie movies.
[00:11:00.523 --> 00:11:05.187]  And we've got so much huge news here to cover.
[00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:15.774]  But it is in understanding that we're all just flesh and blood.
[00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:25.422]  We are not immortal on this plane of existence.
[00:11:28.072 --> 00:11:34.218]  And so many people don't even think about the fact that you are here today, forever gone.
[00:11:34.218 --> 00:11:38.762]  But that what you write, and what you speak, and what you build, and what you say goes on.
[00:11:38.762 --> 00:11:52.475]  And even more importantly, if you have children, and they have children, then the genetics, not just of you, but of all your ancestors and their instincts and their ideas, crystallized
[00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.875]  are passed on into the future.
[00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:58.897]  What an incredible alchemy of God the Creator.
[00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:01.039]  And then of course there is a soul.
[00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:04.242]  Science, mathematics, interdimensional research has only proven it.
[00:12:04.242 --> 00:12:21.476]  So many atheists that are quantum mechanics experts, physicists, genetic engineers actually become very religious, very spiritual I should say, once they begin to really look into how the universe works.
[00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:21.876]  It was
[00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:37.877]  The great mathematician and physicist Albert Einstein that said, God does not play with dice when it comes to creation.
[00:12:41.169 --> 00:13:02.947]  But I certainly get atheists that want to reject the whole religious system as a sophistic, sycophantic fraud of men and women setting themselves up as the priesthood to tell you that they are the way to God, that they are the way to eternity, that they are the way to the mysteries of the universe when they are not.
[00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:03.628]  Most of them not.
[00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:21.447]  Christ over and over again said you do not need to go to these Pharisees and Sadducees that pray up during the Sabbath on the hilltop in front of everybody and tell everybody how good they are and how they follow all of these Levitical rules that they're always expanding and twisting!
[00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:27.474]  Know that the Kingdom of God is in your heart.
[00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:47.506]  That does not mean you are God, or that you are the Kingdom of God, like the New Agers would say, but you are little g, made in the image of God, and are able to envision and create like God, but on a much smaller scale, and that is in Genesis.
[00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:52.876]  And you look at what we built, so far, it's nothing.
[00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:59.881]  The eye has not seen, ear has not heard, the mind has never even imagined what we can do.
[00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:05.164]  And the technocrats know this, and they want to hoard all the developments humanity comes out with.
[00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:11.348]  They want to centralize it all, and keep it for themselves, and truly play God.
[00:14:11.348 --> 00:14:16.432]  Now I'm going to get into all the huge news here in a moment, but here's MIT Technology Review.
[00:14:19.133 --> 00:14:21.875]  This is propaganda.
[00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:39.907]  I have seen similar articles from MIT and from BBC and from other prestigious publications for 20 years since I became a newshound and began reading up to 10 newspapers a day.
[00:14:39.907 --> 00:14:40.568]  Back at that time.
[00:14:40.568 --> 00:14:41.568]  Now it's even more.
[00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:42.409]  But I scan.
[00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:45.531]  The instant I saw this headline, I knew what it was.
[00:14:45.531 --> 00:14:47.032]  But I didn't just believe myself.
[00:14:47.032 --> 00:14:48.153]  I read the article this morning.
[00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:54.411]  You would have heard this on the show if you've just been listening a year, probably 50 times.
[00:14:54.411 --> 00:15:00.113]  If you've been listening 10 years, you've probably heard it thousands of times.
[00:15:00.113 --> 00:15:03.675]  So they should talk about it even more.
[00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:09.377]  All the rest of what we look at is window dressing.
[00:15:09.377 --> 00:15:15.680]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.500]  research farms.
[00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:20.563]  And then I knew what the next line would be.
[00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:26.527]  They're growing human tissue in cows and pigs.
[00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:34.312]  Just like they call babies tissue or embryonic stem cells when they're seven months old being butchered live on a table and dissected.
[00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:40.235]  They take them out live and then hook them up to apparatus to keep them alive and then harvest them.
[00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:41.336]  Told you that 20 years ago.
[00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:45.033]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:51.500]  I've told you this thousands of times and I've seen this article, let's not exaggerate, a hundred plus times.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.244]  Similar, it's always the same playbook.
[00:15:55.244 --> 00:16:02.091]  Oh, did you know some firms are starting to implant tissue inside cows, inside pigs.
[00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're not implanting tissue.
[00:16:05.325 --> 00:16:12.532]  They're growing humanoids up to 50 and 60 pounds inside cows and inside pigs.
[00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:14.293]  And I'm going to say something else right now.
[00:16:14.293 --> 00:16:25.964]  That's what we know was going on 30 years ago, because when I learned about it 20 years ago, it was in research papers declassified 10 years before that.
[00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:27.645]  So I was 12 years old.
[00:16:30.874 --> 00:16:40.819]  And they were creating humanoids for organ harvesting inside cows and pigs publicly.
[00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:47.722]  And I come on air and tell people this without showing an article, and we always get emails or comments going, there's that crazy nut.
[00:16:47.722 --> 00:16:52.084]  I've seen national news stories saying, he thinks they're growing humans and cows.
[00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:55.785]  Or, he thinks they're trying to make the fish gay.
[00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:56.986]  What, do you like fish sticks?
[00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:03.276]  In my fish tank, Kanye West, South Park.
[00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:05.619]  This isn't South Park, folks.
[00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.301]  They've had thousands of articles.
[00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:09.923]  Thousands.
[00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:11.484]  Thousands.
[00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:13.707]  Sometimes thousands a year.
[00:17:13.707 --> 00:17:17.670]  For a decade, making fun of me about the chemicals in the water.
[00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.734]  Causing males to become female and females to become hyper female.
[00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:24.137]  By the way, making women get cancer at accelerated rates.
[00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:37.475]  Lowering male fertility and how it's making the fish and amphibians bisexual, and they make a big joke because they don't want people to be serious and look into this.
[00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:45.103]  They want to go, ha ha, he says they're messing with your sexuality, ha ha, then I show Pentagon documents.
[00:17:45.103 --> 00:17:45.764]  They don't want that.
[00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:49.993]  So we've got all this other huge news and all these important things happening.
[00:17:49.993 --> 00:17:51.273]  It's a big show today.
[00:17:51.273 --> 00:17:53.594]  Donald Trump leading in three big national polls.
[00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.074]  Trouncing Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.935]  20% of Democrats coming over to him.
[00:17:56.935 --> 00:17:58.615]  Devastating victory.
[00:17:58.615 --> 00:17:59.476]  I think he's for real.
[00:17:59.476 --> 00:18:01.356]  I think they may try to kill him.
[00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:05.237]  We have his shadow campaign head.
[00:18:05.237 --> 00:18:10.379]  I mean, Stone left the campaign so he can run things on his own, obviously, that the campaign can't do.
[00:18:12.202 --> 00:18:15.744]  Like super PACs and all the rest of it, but it's all completely kosher.
[00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:21.108]  And so he can fire torpedoes about the Clinton raping and then the Bushes and their drug dealing.
[00:18:21.108 --> 00:18:31.934]  By the way, Stone, of course, was one of Nixon's top people, one of George Bush Senior's top people, super high level connected, one of the top Republican strategists in the country.
[00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:39.879]  That's why he works for Trump and he's gone full Alex Jones coming here on air just saying the government runs the drugs, world government, we've got to stop them.
[00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:40.940]  That's who's advising Trump.
[00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:43.550]  A guy that used to run U.S.
[00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:48.932]  operations to get people elected in other countries, not just here.
[00:18:48.932 --> 00:18:50.733]  You can probably guess what kind of guy he is.
[00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:52.414]  Real serious.
[00:18:52.414 --> 00:18:54.115]  And he's coming on.
[00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:57.576]  That's all important.
[00:18:57.576 --> 00:19:01.218]  But human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:04.500]  research farms a radical new approach.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.200]  Oh, it's radical!
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.720]  It's new!
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.961]  That's how they sell like it's cool.
[00:19:07.944 --> 00:19:10.545]  We're only having army gun confiscation drills in your town.
[00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:11.366]  You're very special.
[00:19:11.366 --> 00:19:13.026]  That's a tactic they use.
[00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:23.351]  A radical new approach to generate human organs is to grow inside pigs or sheep and then it goes through all of it.
[00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:24.691]  But don't worry, it's tissue.
[00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:27.252]  No, it's not.
[00:19:27.252 --> 00:19:30.134]  They've been unsuccessful just growing them in their
[00:19:31.635 --> 00:19:35.296]  And basically, they're humans without heads.
[00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:39.257]  Because that even freaks the researchers out too much, so they can kind of grow them like they want.
[00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:42.737]  And they can argue, well, it's just a person, I want those organs.
[00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:48.698]  But they've had to make the humans, the humanoids, part cow, part sheep, part pig, to implant them.
[00:19:48.698 --> 00:19:52.699]  So, again, MIT, here it is, we're not making it up.
[00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:56.740]  I know we can make gay fish jokes and stuff, but if you like dying of cancer, just keep laughing.
[00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:06.246]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:10.250]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.653]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:20:13.653 --> 00:20:18.738]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:20:19.338 --> 00:20:23.683]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.

[00:24:10.728 --> 00:24:14.190]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.

[00:24:17.893 --> 00:24:18.333]  Central.
[00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:19.394]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:37.670]  We'll be joining us from London, England to break down the explosive revelations that the police all over Germany, France and other countries have been ordered to cover up massive Islamicist rape operations as rape is used as a terror weapon.
[00:24:39.207 --> 00:24:45.270]  Europe faces 10 million more refugees from the Middle East as crisis spirals.
[00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.530]  That's the UK Express.
[00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:52.853]  They're now announcing 10,000 unknown men stage attacks on immigrants in downtown Cologne.
[00:24:52.853 --> 00:24:55.394]  All they did was go protest it and the police attacked them.
[00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:58.115]  But they let the Muslims attack the women.
[00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:02.877]  The police are only there to protect the radical jihadists because this is part of a takeover.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.084]  Paris police station attacker lived in German refugee shelter.
[00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:18.971]  A man who tried to attack a Paris police station last week had lived at the center, tried to bomb it for asylum seekers in Germany.
[00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:22.794]  And, of course, was a Muslim.
[00:25:22.794 --> 00:25:23.455]  Let's continue.
[00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.996]  You have to read deeply to find that though.
[00:25:26.385 --> 00:25:32.430]  Two men named Muhammad try to shoot up nightclub in Canada, CBC, but that's not their headline.
[00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:40.516]  You have to read into it that their names are both Muhammad, but, oh, it wasn't a Muslim group that came in and tried to shoot up the bar, but they got tackled instantly, thank God.
[00:25:40.516 --> 00:25:44.099]  Shooter of Philadelphia policeman described as quiet, devout Muslim.
[00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:50.224]  Yeah, he runs up in Muslim guards screaming, Allah Akbar, and shoots the cop.
[00:25:50.224 --> 00:25:51.525]  And then starts bleeding everywhere.
[00:25:52.475 --> 00:26:00.021]  This happened last week, they cover it up, and I'm watching Fox News this morning on the elliptical.
[00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:06.747]  And my phone was dead, or I would have tried to videotape it, but it wasn't charged.
[00:26:06.747 --> 00:26:14.334]  And then, the elliptical that I have in the bedroom, it doesn't have a DVR on it, the TV doesn't have one, and so I couldn't rewind it, but everybody saw it, I'm sure.
[00:26:14.334 --> 00:26:17.637]  It was like 8 o'clock this morning, and they go, coming up later today,
[00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:21.750]  Radicals in America attacking the police.
[00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.530]  Extremist.
[00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.651]  No, it was a Muslim attacker.
[00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:32.573]  So then, I'm driving in, listening to National News Radio, and they're saying the same thing about the cop.
[00:26:32.573 --> 00:26:37.655]  I mean, it's like, A, it's five, six days after it happened, and they won't even say it's a Muslim.
[00:26:37.655 --> 00:26:41.816]  I mean, you better believe if it was an NRA guy with an NRA sticker on his car, they'd have said that.
[00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:43.914]  Look at that headline.
[00:26:43.914 --> 00:26:46.936]  Gunman shoots Philadelphia police officer in the name of Islam.
[00:26:46.936 --> 00:26:48.997]  CNBC got it right.
[00:26:48.997 --> 00:26:51.659]  Reuters got it right.
[00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:52.780]  Why didn't Fox News?
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:27:07.689]  Because Fox News is there to control conservatives, ladies and gentlemen, just like the rhino neocon Republicans are, who are trying to destroy and are in the news today saying Donald Trump is going to destroy the Republican Party.
[00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:07.869]  Why?
[00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:12.312]  Because he's a populist like Reagan and about to sweep 47 states, many analysts say.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:18.964]  They're there to make sure Jeb Bush or Hillary gets in to continue the giant screw job.
[00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:23.408]  If a Donald Trump gets in, they might repeal Obamacare that's so unpopular and criminal.
[00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:25.309]  The socialists don't even support it now.
[00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:28.311]  That's why they got waivers to actually get free health care.
[00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:29.753]  Oh, you're an Obama group?
[00:27:29.753 --> 00:27:30.713]  An Obama Union?
[00:27:30.713 --> 00:27:32.515]  You do get free!
[00:27:32.515 --> 00:27:34.356]  Everybody else gets triple prices!
[00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:36.157]  Ah, it's so liberal!
[00:27:36.157 --> 00:27:40.140]  Everything they do is discriminatory and sickening on working Americans.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.882]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:58.507]  So, I've got three articles here where the Paris police are attacked, the bar is attacked by two men named Mohammed attacking, shooter of Philadelphia policeman described as a quiet, devout Muslim, Reuters.
[00:27:58.507 --> 00:28:02.671]  But you watch Fox News, and they're calling it extremist.
[00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:03.011]  And again,
[00:28:04.202 --> 00:28:06.543]  I didn't want the wars with Muslim countries.
[00:28:06.543 --> 00:28:08.224]  I don't think they're all bad people.
[00:28:08.224 --> 00:28:12.386]  But the folks they're bringing in that invaded Syria are the worst of the worst!
[00:28:12.386 --> 00:28:25.352]  And by the way, coming up, Paul Watson joins us and then I'm going to air three minutes from the exclusive hour-plus long interview we're going to premiere here on air next Wednesday with my sit-down interview with Louis Farrakhan.
[00:28:25.352 --> 00:28:27.513]  And I had a feeling, first time I ever asked to interview him,
[00:28:30.137 --> 00:28:38.142]  From some of his speeches and things about, you know, Muhammad was a beautiful white man and some white people can be good and we need to work together.
[00:28:38.142 --> 00:28:39.583]  Really changing a lot of what he said.
[00:28:39.583 --> 00:28:42.765]  And I went and interviewed him and he basically said, I've changed.
[00:28:42.765 --> 00:28:46.828]  I do get mad and say some things I probably shouldn't, but I don't want a civil war.
[00:28:46.828 --> 00:28:48.309]  I don't want a race war.
[00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:53.412]  And so that's a big deal to have Louis Farrakhan.
[00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:56.434]  I don't want to say we're influencing him, but I just got to tell you the facts.
[00:28:57.352 --> 00:29:00.073]  Folks, Vladimir Putin does listen.
[00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:01.993]  Louis Farrakhan does listen.
[00:29:01.993 --> 00:29:03.893]  Matt Drudge listens.
[00:29:03.893 --> 00:29:07.074]  Everybody from Jeff Bridges to Kurt Russell to, I mean, you name it.
[00:29:07.074 --> 00:29:08.654]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[00:29:08.654 --> 00:29:12.335]  I want you to know the InfoWar is mega successful.
[00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:17.396]  I shot three Facebook mentions yesterday, just nonchalant.
[00:29:17.396 --> 00:29:20.456]  Took me 15 minutes to shoot three of them live.
[00:29:20.456 --> 00:29:22.937]  You know how many views that had?
[00:29:22.937 --> 00:29:24.157]  A million and a half.
[00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.173]  Yesterday, on top of my radio show, the Sunday show reaches 2 million people terrestrially.
[00:29:30.173 --> 00:29:32.474]  This one about 4 million a day now.
[00:29:32.474 --> 00:29:34.756]  But not mentioning all the YouTube videos and podcasts.
[00:29:34.756 --> 00:29:37.317]  We're reaching, I keep saying 20 million a week.
[00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:38.598]  We've been doing some of the numbers.
[00:29:38.598 --> 00:29:42.380]  It looks like about 28 million people actually tune in every week.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.301]  That's conservative.
[00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:46.383]  I mean, it's just supernova-ing right now.
[00:29:46.383 --> 00:29:48.224]  That's why Obama is attacking us.
[00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:49.605]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.605 --> 00:29:52.126]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:54.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.221 --> 00:30:03.545]  It's Monday, January 11th, and here's a breakdown of the news that broke over the weekend.
[00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:10.050]  Supply-side economist Arthur Laffer is predicting Republicans will win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee.
[00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:16.435]  He said, quote, I will be surprised if the Republicans don't take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50.
[00:30:16.435 --> 00:30:23.240]  Also, Sean Penn is now under investigation for secretly meeting Mexican cartel leader El Chapo deep in the jungle back in October.
[00:30:24.261 --> 00:30:24.882]  We're good to go.
[00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.034]  Visit InfoWars.com for the latest news.
[00:30:56.034 --> 00:30:57.462]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:02.312]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.312 --> 00:31:10.557]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:15.981]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:18.503]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:18.503 --> 00:31:20.604]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:31:28.709 --> 00:31:29.830]  BrainForce is here.
[00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.032]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:32.032 --> 00:31:37.035]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:40.318]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:40.318 --> 00:31:43.801]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.542]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:45.762 --> 00:31:46.703]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:46.703 --> 00:31:47.883]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:47.883 --> 00:31:49.884]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:31:49.884 --> 00:31:54.968]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:54.968 --> 00:31:56.228]  Secret 12 InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:32:02.592 --> 00:32:08.897]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:32:08.897 --> 00:32:16.183]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:32:16.183 --> 00:32:25.310]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.911]  Secret 12 is a Bionair.
[00:32:26.971 --> 00:32:27.571]  We're good.
[00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:15.259]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:18.460]  Please allow me to introduce myself.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.442]  I'm a man of wealth and taste.
[00:33:27.034 --> 00:33:31.796]  Pleased to meet you.
[00:33:31.796 --> 00:33:35.818]  Won't you guess my name?
[00:33:56.403 --> 00:33:56.683]  V.I.
[00:33:56.683 --> 00:33:59.985]  Lennon?
[00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:01.326]  Yeah, he showed up in St.
[00:34:01.326 --> 00:34:05.548]  Petersburg when he thought it was time for a change.
[00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:10.211]  Yeah, a lot of hope and change going on here.
[00:34:10.211 --> 00:34:13.993]  We don't want your Jacobin French Revolution, fake revolution.
[00:34:13.993 --> 00:34:19.837]  We want the real revolution against devils that control the New World Order.
[00:34:19.837 --> 00:34:20.397]  That's Lemmy.
[00:34:20.397 --> 00:34:21.257]  He died at 70 last week.
[00:34:23.513 --> 00:34:25.174]  The icon of Super Heavy.
[00:34:25.174 --> 00:34:27.516]  A lot of great music there, obviously.
[00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:29.738]  And David Bowie dead at 69.
[00:34:29.738 --> 00:34:34.381]  Didn't make it as long as Lemmy.
[00:34:34.381 --> 00:34:40.526]  You know, I've talked to several big rock stars and they say that no one they've ever seen partied more than Lemmy.
[00:34:40.526 --> 00:34:44.349]  Except maybe Al Jorgensen of Ministry.
[00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:50.334]  And they say that if there's ever a nuclear war, the only thing living will be Al Jorgensen of Ministry and cockroaches.
[00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.310]  I've been told that by two big rock stars.
[00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.632]  They're total machines.
[00:34:56.632 --> 00:35:02.075]  Ladies and gentlemen, we do celebrate the dead, the good, the bad, and the ugly, because we're pro-human here.
[00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:08.579]  We see the negative in humans, but we also see the positive.
[00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:11.041]  All right.
[00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:15.583]  Coming up, Trump is turbocharging in every major poll against Hillary.
[00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:16.104]  It's huge.
[00:35:16.104 --> 00:35:18.165]  It's a landslide, unless they steal the election.
[00:35:18.165 --> 00:35:21.267]  We're going to talk to his top strategist, Roger Stone.
[00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:24.326]  Coming up, for a full hour.
[00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:42.331]  We're also going to get into, obviously, what's happening with the rape culture, and the Clintons, and how that ties into the whole Muslim culture of raping, and why the left loves to actually abuse women so much, and how they get away with it.
[00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:45.652]  Because it all ties together with these brutalizers.
[00:35:45.652 --> 00:35:47.532]  I mean, I would never think of raping a woman.
[00:35:47.532 --> 00:35:48.272]  Zero.
[00:35:48.272 --> 00:35:49.633]  Zero desire.
[00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:52.673]  No matter how beautiful they were, it just turns my stomach.
[00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:53.673]  It's the antithesis.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:57.874]  But a lot of people want it because it's the power they want over someone.
[00:36:00.114 --> 00:36:04.956]  And I guess that's people that don't have power, want power over the innocents.
[00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:08.417]  But when you've got real power, you want to build other people up.
[00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:09.378]  And that's the problem.
[00:36:09.378 --> 00:36:15.000]  We're not led by real leaders that want to build civilizations and are fans of humanity.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.121]  We're also going to get into
[00:36:19.807 --> 00:36:32.254]  The latest with what's happening with the economy, what's happening with science, what's happening with Russia, what's Zbigniew Brzezinski calling for all these wars.
[00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:44.662]  And of course, coming up in about 12 minutes or so, after Paul Watson leaves us, I'm going to air a small first clip of the Lewis Faircon interview that will air next Wednesday.
[00:36:44.662 --> 00:36:48.024]  Now, the video is up on Infowars.com with the headline,
[00:36:50.536 --> 00:36:58.184]  Louis Farrakhan agrees with Donald Trump on Syrian refugees.
[00:36:58.184 --> 00:37:03.930]  Louis Farrakhan agrees with Trump's plan to limit migrants.
[00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.995]  It's red-linked and the entire, I got two hours with it, two hours with it.
[00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:17.049]  There's a few, you know, bathroom break whatever in there, change tape breaks or whatever, card breaks, but we've got almost two hours of footage.
[00:37:17.049 --> 00:37:19.471]  It's all incredible Louis Farrakhan stuff.
[00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:26.637]  And again, I went there to try to get him to push to not have a race war, to not go along with the Soros plan.
[00:37:26.637 --> 00:37:28.678]  He agreed that's a plan.
[00:37:28.678 --> 00:37:31.420]  He agreed it's happening and he agreed it needs to be stopped.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.862]  You can say what you want about Louis Farrakhan a year ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:37:35.489 --> 00:37:37.230]  They take a lot of what he says out of context.
[00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.731]  Some of it I disagree with, even in the context of the full clip.
[00:37:42.731 --> 00:37:44.032]  That isn't what's happening here.
[00:37:44.032 --> 00:37:45.492]  I'm trying to be diplomatic.
[00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:50.653]  He's trying to be diplomatic.
[00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:55.035]  And we're actually trying to build a better world.
[00:37:55.035 --> 00:37:56.835]  Does that mean I endorse everything Louis Farrakhan says?
[00:37:56.835 --> 00:37:57.476]  Absolutely not.
[00:37:57.476 --> 00:37:58.976]  Same thing back at me.
[00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:02.117]  But it's a big deal because he's one of the biggest black leaders in the world.
[00:38:02.932 --> 00:38:04.312]  He's a big deal.
[00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:07.433]  In fact, they say a prophet's not known in their own country to have that quote.
[00:38:07.433 --> 00:38:15.855]  And that applies to people that aren't prophets, but the point is that he's even bigger in Europe and Africa and places in the Middle East than he is here.
[00:38:15.855 --> 00:38:23.876]  So him coming out saying the things he says is powerful about world government, new world order, that he's been watching me for a long time.
[00:38:23.876 --> 00:38:27.677]  They would do stuff like turn a computer on and then I'd already be on.
[00:38:27.677 --> 00:38:28.597]  They'd be, oh, excuse us.
[00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:30.218]  And they're like, we listen every day.
[00:38:30.218 --> 00:38:31.178]  We watch every day.
[00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:31.998]  I was up there in the big
[00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:39.775]  Boardroom with these guys, an entire leadership of the Nation of Islam basically, and I recognized these faces.
[00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:44.418]  A lot of them were very successful black business leaders, you know, people that were well-known.
[00:38:44.418 --> 00:38:46.899]  And I was like, I recognize these people's faces.
[00:38:46.899 --> 00:38:50.642]  These people that like own businesses, big companies, you name it.
[00:38:50.642 --> 00:38:54.844]  And they were all super serious, super focused.
[00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:55.605]  I was shocked by it.
[00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:02.465]  I mean, they were as serious as like being in a room with a bunch of military commanders or something.
[00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:05.308]  And so that was very refreshing compared to the brain-dead public.
[00:39:05.308 --> 00:39:10.552]  Again, I'm not endorsing what they're saying or doing, but the globalists are the ones putting the cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:39:10.552 --> 00:39:13.835]  So that Louis Farrakhan is coming up.
[00:39:13.835 --> 00:39:20.360]  The first look at it, the video right now is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.483]  And imagine with Louis Farrakhan basically coming out in support of Trump,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.581]  I mean, that could get him 30-40% of the black vote right there.
[00:39:28.581 --> 00:39:31.402]  I mean, that's a big deal, folks.
[00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.903]  We have new specials out.
[00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:33.863]  These are great specials.

[00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:10.493]  I mean, our growth rate is frightening.
[00:41:10.493 --> 00:41:16.836]  Because I know when Obama's shooting his mouth off about the conspiracy websites that say we want to confiscate, don't listen to them, they're talking about us.
[00:41:17.076 --> 00:41:20.738]  His surrogates name us daily in thousands of papers some weeks.
[00:41:20.738 --> 00:41:22.359]  Usually I'm in 20, 30 articles a day.
[00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:24.160]  I mean, it's thousands a week.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.301]  I mean, it is.
[00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:26.702]  And they've gone weaponized, folks.
[00:41:26.702 --> 00:41:28.863]  It's just, I can win lawsuits on every front.
[00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:29.843]  But they want to tie me up.
[00:41:29.843 --> 00:41:31.244]  That's the plan, I've been told.
[00:41:31.244 --> 00:41:32.185]  Hoping I'll go sue them.
[00:41:32.845 --> 00:41:33.826]  I'm with the terrorists.
[00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:34.807]  I hate black people.
[00:41:34.807 --> 00:41:35.968]  I'm a racist.
[00:41:35.968 --> 00:41:36.628]  I hate women.
[00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:38.009]  I'm a predator.
[00:41:38.009 --> 00:41:41.652]  I mean, from Bill O'Reilly to CNN, I mean, they're doing it, folks.
[00:41:41.652 --> 00:41:42.673]  Just out of the blue.
[00:41:42.673 --> 00:41:44.475]  We've got to stop online sex predators.
[00:41:44.475 --> 00:41:47.497]  Cuts to a clip of me not even talking about sex.
[00:41:47.497 --> 00:41:51.400]  Never have been charged, convicted, eluded to.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.342]  That's how desperate they are, folks.
[00:41:53.342 --> 00:41:55.324]  My lawyer said, you will win a lawsuit.
[00:41:55.324 --> 00:41:57.605]  It'll cost you a million bucks, take three years.
[00:41:57.605 --> 00:41:59.567]  You want to do it.
[00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:00.428]  I mean, I've got them.
[00:42:01.425 --> 00:42:02.046]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:42:02.046 --> 00:42:02.786]  They're weaponized.
[00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.588]  They don't care who they slander now.
[00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:07.390]  So joining us till the break in about 10 minutes is Paul Watson.
[00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.092]  We'll come back with Lewis Farrakhan.
[00:42:09.092 --> 00:42:13.496]  He's giving us a preview of what's coming up in a big breakdown and more news in the fourth hour.
[00:42:13.496 --> 00:42:14.617]  He's going to be hosting today.
[00:42:14.617 --> 00:42:19.041]  He is the editor-at-large of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:21.884]  One of the most prolific, successful writers in the world today.
[00:42:21.884 --> 00:42:23.966]  I should just tell you about the success of Paul Watson.
[00:42:24.426 --> 00:42:33.571]  His articles alone on Infowars and Prison Planet, now get ready for this, are read by more than 20 million people on our platforms.
[00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:35.732]  Can you imagine everywhere else they're copied to?
[00:42:35.732 --> 00:42:40.335]  Just an example of how the New York Times, it's bankrupt, it's a joke.
[00:42:40.335 --> 00:42:42.876]  The Patriot Movement is the new New York Times.
[00:42:42.876 --> 00:42:45.518]  Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom.
[00:42:46.278 --> 00:42:48.399]  It is great to have you with us.
[00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:54.623]  I tell you, this situation in Europe, where they bring in millions of refugees, they rape en masse, they're allowed to rape.
[00:42:54.623 --> 00:42:58.466]  The new footage of them shooting guns, we're going to roll some of that in the background.
[00:42:58.466 --> 00:43:02.409]  In Cologne, women with children running in fear, the police doing nothing.
[00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:08.552]  Now if you come out and demonstrate against them, the police literally attacked with tear gas in Cologne yesterday.
[00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:12.015]  Paul Watson, they've announced 10 million more to stream into Europe.
[00:43:12.015 --> 00:43:13.736]  What's the master plan, Paul Watson?
[00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:20.613]  The master plan, Alex, is to import a bunch of people that will vote for bigger government.
[00:43:20.613 --> 00:43:26.916]  They become dependent on government, their children become dependent on government, and it creates a bigger state.
[00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:29.437]  That's the political motive, of course.
[00:43:29.437 --> 00:43:35.060]  Corporations get to hire them as cheap labour and drive everyone else's wages down.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.261]  So there are a number of motives.
[00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:41.583]  But in fact, you have German politicians, and this was in my article, The Rape of Europe,
[00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:48.914]  Going before Parliament and saying Muslim migrants will be the majority in major German cities.
[00:43:48.914 --> 00:43:52.037]  Actual German citizens will be the minority.
[00:43:52.037 --> 00:43:53.178]  And this is a good thing.
[00:43:53.178 --> 00:43:57.582]  And anyone who disagrees with that is a right-wing extremist and a racist.
[00:43:57.582 --> 00:44:00.145]  Well, first of all, Islam isn't a race.
[00:44:00.145 --> 00:44:01.646]  I have to say that over and over again.
[00:44:02.461 --> 00:44:12.168]  Second of all, this rape culture that's now being imported into the West primarily affects Muslim women in those migrant camps.
[00:44:12.168 --> 00:44:24.236]  For months and months and months we've been reporting on people in and around the migrant camps being raped, both Muslim women and German citizens, Swedish citizens, Norwegian citizens.
[00:44:24.236 --> 00:44:31.881]  So then when this mass molestation happened in Cologne, Helsinki, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Zurich, all these are the European cities,
[00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:36.282]  The authorities were all, oh this is so shocking that this happened.
[00:44:36.282 --> 00:44:38.482]  Who could have possibly foreseen this?
[00:44:38.482 --> 00:44:47.584]  When for months and months you had top social services organisations in Germany saying this is an epidemic of rape in these migrant camps.
[00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:52.445]  Muslim women and young girls, children are being raped over and over again.
[00:44:52.445 --> 00:44:54.105]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:44:54.105 --> 00:44:57.846]  And of course German, European citizens are now being raped as well.
[00:44:57.846 --> 00:45:01.367]  And it all goes back to what's in the article up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:45:02.162 --> 00:45:07.746]  Which is this phenomenon that's been noted over the past several years called Taharush.
[00:45:07.746 --> 00:45:21.017]  Which is this custom, if you want to call it that, of mobs of Muslim men leaping on, viciously attacking women, sexually assaulting them, stealing from them, exactly what we saw in Cologne.
[00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:32.966]  And you remember back in 2011, CBS reporter Laura Logan, she was attacked by 200 Egyptian men in Tahrir Square during the uprising.
[00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:35.227]  Again, this is part of their culture.
[00:45:35.227 --> 00:45:43.950]  There was another Dutch journalist who was attacked, and that's actually the video in this article, completely harrowing, attacked in the same way.
[00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:50.473]  So it goes back to this argument of, oh that's just their culture, we have to respect it, if you criticise it, you're racist.
[00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:59.064]  Well, I'm sorry, but an actual rape culture, the molestation of women, that's not a culture that should be respected.
[00:45:59.064 --> 00:46:00.207]  We hear this over and over again.
[00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:02.861]  It's like in India.
[00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:12.844]  You know, in India, UNICEF, year after year after year, has to run a program where they train Indians not to defecate on the streets.
[00:46:12.844 --> 00:46:18.485]  Like 600 million Indians, almost half of the population, don't know how to use toilets.
[00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:22.986]  And it's caused a huge health problem, and UNICEF has to train them to use toilets.
[00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.147]  I'm sorry, but that is a bad culture.
[00:46:25.627 --> 00:46:29.212]  It needs to be resolved and it doesn't need to be imported into the West.
[00:46:29.212 --> 00:46:30.955]  And it's not racist.
[00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.338]  Now you're being racist against people defecating on the street.
[00:46:33.338 --> 00:46:37.924]  Now, I think people should go to the White House and defecate on the front fence.
[00:46:37.924 --> 00:46:42.530]  I'm not literally saying that, but if they're so into this, I think Hillary should have all the defecation.
[00:46:43.131 --> 00:46:44.712]  But that's bad enough.
[00:46:44.712 --> 00:46:47.393]  But at least it's not a big thing to rape women as much over there.
[00:46:47.393 --> 00:46:48.554]  Some of it happens.
[00:46:48.554 --> 00:46:50.034]  But what about mass raping?
[00:46:50.034 --> 00:46:55.297]  Because the feminists are all saying the West mass rapes, when the West is what has always fought against that.
[00:46:55.297 --> 00:47:00.800]  But I mean, now I saw feminist groups in mainstream news articles actually blaming German men even after it came out.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.321]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:05.382]  What is the master plan?
[00:47:05.382 --> 00:47:06.763]  Why do they hate the West so much?
[00:47:06.763 --> 00:47:12.746]  I'm not talking about the mass rapers, the folks running around with guns in Cologne, even though they have massive gun restrictions in Germany.
[00:47:13.146 --> 00:47:29.820]  The illegal aliens, or I guess legal aliens in Germany are just running around with semi-auto handguns, firing them into the sky, firing mortar shells that will burn down houses into people's buildings, foaming at the mouth, and also doing Mac Daddy Homie G stuff.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.525]  I've noticed that they've merged with the whole gangster rap thing, creating a special mutated culture.
[00:47:37.028 --> 00:47:39.270]  No, that also comes out of ISIS.
[00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.991]  It's called jihadi cool.
[00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:45.594]  They've merged with that gang culture because it feeds into each other.
[00:47:45.594 --> 00:47:50.857]  One of the other objectives when you talk about the wider agenda is clamping down on our rights.
[00:47:50.857 --> 00:47:59.743]  So they're going to use criticism of Muslim rape gangs to restrict the free speech of people who are critical of government in general.
[00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.685]  And we're now seeing that on Twitter.
[00:48:02.245 --> 00:48:25.056]  You know, back in October, Twitter released a new policy where they said that sensitive material, I'll read it out, this is their policy, hate speech or advocacy, advocacy against an individual, organization or protected group based on religion, age, sex, sexual orientation and so on, now is being monitored for deletion and censorship by Twitter.
[00:48:25.056 --> 00:48:29.898]  And in Cologne, the Germans went out to protest and the police attacked them with tear gas.
[00:48:30.558 --> 00:48:32.939]  But they let the radical Muslims run around and rape.
[00:48:32.939 --> 00:48:39.102]  I mean, again, socialism turns the local government into pure evil.
[00:48:39.102 --> 00:48:50.968]  Yeah, and now they're using it to institute censorship on the back of the biggest shareholder, the second biggest shareholder of Twitter being Prince Alawi bin Talal of Saudi Arabia.
[00:48:50.968 --> 00:48:53.910]  So now you're seeing people get censored on Twitter.
[00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.711]  And you know, people say, well, who cares?
[00:48:55.711 --> 00:48:56.751]  I don't use Twitter.
[00:48:56.751 --> 00:48:58.332]  Well, first of all, as Drudge said,
[00:48:58.812 --> 00:49:03.173]  We're creating these internet ghettos where all the content goes into social media.
[00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:12.336]  Second of all, first it's Twitter, then it's Facebook, then it's feminists going to the UN and saying ISPs should cut off people's internet access if they criticize them.
[00:49:12.336 --> 00:49:19.798]  Yeah, it's already happening in Europe and these people that say don't use Google, don't use YouTube, don't use Facebook, don't use Yahoo, they're idiots.
[00:49:19.798 --> 00:49:23.459]  It's like, I don't care about Rush Limbaugh, let them arrest him or kick him off air.
[00:49:24.039 --> 00:49:28.421]  They admit that once they get him, they're going to get all the talk radio, you morons!
[00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:35.404]  And I'm talking not to our listeners, but people that have this attitude, even in the Liberty Movement, that if somebody falls, you get bigger.
[00:49:35.404 --> 00:49:39.686]  No, we're in an all-out war with globalists enslaving us!
[00:49:39.686 --> 00:49:43.327]  Stop competing with each other in the Patriot Movement!
[00:49:43.327 --> 00:49:49.730]  We're up against people that want to end our platforms and our ability to get on the field, period!
[00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:53.391]  We're in a fight for our lives, people.
[00:49:53.391 --> 00:49:55.052]  A total fight for everything.
[00:49:55.052 --> 00:49:58.334]  First Amendment, Second Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Fourth Amendment.
[00:49:58.334 --> 00:50:02.055]  The fighting must end in the Liberty Movement.
[00:50:02.055 --> 00:50:02.556]  Period.
[00:50:02.556 --> 00:50:03.056]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:50:04.258 --> 00:50:06.380]  Yeah, and then they say, oh, forget Twitter.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:10.383]  Come and join my new social network, which has got like 20 users and nobody looks at.
[00:50:10.383 --> 00:50:12.124]  No, that's not a solution.
[00:50:12.124 --> 00:50:13.885]  So then you've got to- We must invade Twitter.
[00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:15.166]  We must invade Facebook.
[00:50:15.166 --> 00:50:17.988]  We must invade YouTube, as we've done.
[00:50:17.988 --> 00:50:18.769]  Paul, stay there.
[00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:20.310]  I'm going to dip the Farrakhan next hour.
[00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.230]  People want to see it.
[00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:22.391]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:50:22.391 --> 00:50:25.293]  It's incredibly powerful, where he basically endorses Donald Trump.
[00:50:25.293 --> 00:50:29.376]  He told me in a private meeting, he said it wasn't off record, but we met for 45 minutes before the interview.
[00:50:30.197 --> 00:50:35.500]  He said, I think Donald Trump may be the answer to save America.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.522]  But I don't know how to say it because he says things that are bad.
[00:50:38.522 --> 00:50:41.723]  But so do I sometimes when I'm angry.
[00:50:41.723 --> 00:50:46.686]  But I think he really is outside the system and he could break it.
[00:50:46.686 --> 00:50:48.547]  But I'm not making fun of him.
[00:50:48.547 --> 00:50:49.688]  That's how he talks.
[00:50:49.688 --> 00:50:51.048]  I mean, I'm sitting here in Louis Faircon.
[00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:54.070]  I've been talking to him 10 minutes and he's endorsing Donald Trump.
[00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.171]  I mean, stay there, Paul.
[00:50:55.171 --> 00:50:55.571]  We'll be back.
[00:50:59.335 --> 00:51:02.957]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:51:02.957 --> 00:51:04.758]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:02.632]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:02.632 --> 00:53:03.272]  It's true.
[00:53:03.272 --> 00:53:07.436]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:07.436 --> 00:53:09.818]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:09.818 --> 00:53:14.302]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:48.942]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:53:48.942 --> 00:53:50.003]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:02.586 --> 00:54:19.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I'm ranching, it's because my heart's beating fast.
[00:54:19.278 --> 00:54:20.039]  My blood pressure's up.
[00:54:21.482 --> 00:54:26.508]  In fact, I've been taking my blood pressure lately before I work out and after, and my blood pressure is up.
[00:54:26.508 --> 00:54:32.975]  I've lost weight, I'm healthier, but just physically my blood pressure is up at a physical level because we're watching
[00:54:34.068 --> 00:54:37.669]  MIT announced they're growing cloned humans inside cows and pigs.
[00:54:37.669 --> 00:54:39.030]  That's in the news today.
[00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.071]  I knew that 20 years ago, but now it's just being thrown in our face.
[00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:46.833]  They're just announcing robots to take over the combat in the military.
[00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:51.795]  They're announcing that they admit women are put in the military to destroy it, so they can be forced to go to robots.
[00:54:51.795 --> 00:54:57.177]  They're actually in the news saying, doesn't matter, humans are done soon anyways, put women in, make it like a social club.
[00:54:58.988 --> 00:55:08.191]  I mean, it's crazy when everything we've talked about is now becoming mainstream, but then they just get away with it.
[00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:17.313]  And then meanwhile, Trump is surging in all these polls, beating Hillary by three to five points in national polls.
[00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:18.973]  It's just incredible.
[00:55:18.973 --> 00:55:20.854]  Sylvester Stallone comes out and says he loves Trump.
[00:55:22.128 --> 00:55:26.010]  Paul, getting into the whole radical Muslim Jihad, what's the big picture here?
[00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:33.334]  Because I know it's about clash of civilizations and take our rights once the Muslims, you know, attack and rape and say that we can't have speech to conform with them.
[00:55:33.334 --> 00:55:40.078]  We know that's the model, but do they really think their own leftist followers are going to put up with being treated like this?
[00:55:40.078 --> 00:55:46.902]  Because it's causing liberal Germans to basically exodus en masse.
[00:55:46.902 --> 00:55:47.663]  It's causing
[00:55:50.728 --> 00:55:56.809]  Politico's reporting today that the smallest number, basically ever, identify themselves as Democrats in America.
[00:55:56.809 --> 00:56:04.150]  Top statisticians are saying they think 47 percent... I don't know.
[00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:11.492]  It just makes my head spin to know that 47, actually, so that would be like 97 percent of the states are going to go Republican.
[00:56:11.492 --> 00:56:14.852]  And I'm not saying that's going to save us, but it shows the discontent.
[00:56:14.852 --> 00:56:18.033]  I mean, why are they jumping the shark so crazily, Paul?
[00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:26.189]  Well, I just lost the feed there, but... I mean, it's a threat to our rights in general.
[00:56:26.189 --> 00:56:28.473]  I was in Paris, like, a week ago.
[00:56:28.473 --> 00:56:30.757]  They've got bag searchers to go into restaurants.
[00:56:31.363 --> 00:56:38.429]  What are two bouncers who are completely unarmed going to do when they're overwhelmed with jihadists searching women's handbags?
[00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:39.790]  I mean, what is the point in that?
[00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.452]  It's all about general martial law.
[00:56:41.452 --> 00:56:42.973]  It's all about general martial law.
[00:56:42.973 --> 00:56:50.079]  Which is the impact of turning Western society into Israel, into Jerusalem, where it's a complete police state.
[00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:55.583]  And to go about our daily business, we have to go through this because of this threat that they've imported.
[00:56:55.583 --> 00:56:59.527]  Now in Canada today, last night, you had two guys called Mohammed.
[00:57:00.087 --> 00:57:01.809]  Shoot up a nightclub.
[00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:03.891]  Barely anyone's even reporting on it.
[00:57:03.891 --> 00:57:09.496]  They daren't even mention the word Muslim, because of course this has nothing to do with the religion of peace.
[00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:12.218]  So you've got leftists saying, oh, what's happening in Oregon?
[00:57:12.218 --> 00:57:16.202]  You know, people occupying an empty building in the middle of nowhere is terrorism.
[00:57:16.562 --> 00:57:19.725]  And the media won't say it's terrorism because white people did it.
[00:57:19.725 --> 00:57:28.712]  Meanwhile, two guys called Mohammed are shooting up a nightclub in Canada and it's in Canadian media and they don't even mention the word Mohammed.
[00:57:28.712 --> 00:57:35.398]  Fox News, Paul, won't even call the guy that shot the cop and blew his brains everywhere.
[00:57:35.398 --> 00:57:35.858]  Won't.
[00:57:35.858 --> 00:57:41.003]  Last week in Philadelphia, they won't even call that jihad.
[00:57:41.003 --> 00:57:44.786]  When the guy said Allah Akbar in a Muslim outfit and did it for Allah.
[00:57:46.397 --> 00:57:55.338]  And now we've got the German Interior Minister saying that the mass sexual molestations, which are up to 600 plus, just the reported ones, in Cologne and other cities...
[00:57:56.081 --> 00:58:05.270]  What's at least as awful, in his own words, are right-wing people on internet message boards posting criticism of migrants.
[00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:07.832]  That's what the German interior minister said.
[00:58:07.832 --> 00:58:17.902]  You had a libertarian blogger today called Christopher Cantwell who said that Germans should have the right to arm themselves to defend themselves against rapists banned from Facebook.
[00:58:18.682 --> 00:58:21.404]  Okay, you've got similar things happening on Twitter.
[00:58:21.404 --> 00:58:25.748]  I post images, which aren't even offensive at all, about this rape situation.
[00:58:25.748 --> 00:58:27.610]  They get censored from Twitter.
[00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.973]  It says you have to agree to see potentially sensitive... Paul, stay there.
[00:58:31.973 --> 00:58:32.914]  Do five more.
[00:58:32.914 --> 00:58:35.796]  Then, the big Trump insider on air.
[00:58:35.796 --> 00:58:39.239]  On the plan to take down Hillary and Jeb, and the plan's working.
[00:58:39.239 --> 00:58:40.340]  We're on the march.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.561]  The empire's on the run.

[00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:00.506]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:00.506 --> 00:59:05.930]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:59:51.317 --> 01:00:01.139]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:06.320]  We lost Lemmy, we lost David Bowie.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.521]  Henry Kessinger is a 50% key hang-on like demonic cicadas to the neck of the American people.
[01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:16.302]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:20.203]  Riding on the highway, going to a show.
[01:00:24.179 --> 01:00:25.460]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.363]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.363 --> 01:00:33.704]  And David Jones died yesterday, and I'm glad it wasn't my dad.
[01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:37.746]  It was David Bowie.
[01:00:37.746 --> 01:00:38.807]  People say, what are you talking about?
[01:00:38.807 --> 01:00:39.888]  That was his real name.
[01:00:39.888 --> 01:00:41.889]  Like Eric Blair was the real name of George Orwell.
[01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:45.696]  What would George Orwell think about what was happening today?
[01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:51.538]  This political correctness, where I'm not a big critic of the Austin Police Department.
[01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:54.540]  I mean, compared to a lot of departments, they're a good department.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.020]  A lot of them are listeners.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:02.243]  But I know for a fact, over on South areas of East Austin, over off of
[01:01:04.053 --> 01:01:08.757]  Sixth Street and other areas, there's muggings, racial attacks constantly, and I've talked to some of the police.
[01:01:08.757 --> 01:01:11.079]  They're told, basically, cover it up.
[01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:17.343]  When there's attacks over off Second Street and nicer areas, they're told to say it happened up on 35th.
[01:01:17.343 --> 01:01:33.076]  But now the police chief of Cologne has been fired over this, saying there were no incidents that night, and then being caught that there were just massive incidents, and guns being fired, and basically martial law, and his deputy said, no, it was like a war zone, but we didn't want to panic the public.
[01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:38.273]  Well, the local police better say something, because they're going to get the blame when all this happens.
[01:01:38.273 --> 01:01:39.694]  Paul, we've got four minutes left.
[01:01:39.694 --> 01:01:41.035]  Where does all this go?
[01:01:41.035 --> 01:01:42.355]  How does it all unfold?
[01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:43.056]  How do we stop it?
[01:01:44.755 --> 01:01:45.676]  Well, you're right.
[01:01:45.676 --> 01:01:52.320]  The very first day, day one, they came out with a press release to the Cologne police and said, New Year's Eve was completely peaceful.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.281]  There were no incidents whatsoever.
[01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:57.543]  So the cover-up went into effect from day one.
[01:01:57.543 --> 01:02:04.387]  But I guess that's better than Sweden, where they had a similar situation at a pop concert back last summer.
[01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:07.269]  Again, mass Muslim molestations of women.
[01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:08.190]  They covered that up.
[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.972]  For some six months or more.
[01:02:10.972 --> 01:02:21.118]  Because Sweden, the place where their top expert on Islamophobia goes on to join ISIS, where they demand people give up their garages to house these migrants.
[01:02:21.118 --> 01:02:25.220]  So it's got to the level where our own leaders are complicit in this.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.162]  Directly complicit in it.
[01:02:27.162 --> 01:02:28.743]  And now you've got, for example, this.
[01:02:29.443 --> 01:02:39.268]  You've got conservatives in Britain being banned from major universities from giving speeches or participating in debates simply because they might offend trigger feminists.
[01:02:39.268 --> 01:02:44.131]  Meanwhile, this Islamic cleric has been touring all these universities
[01:02:44.831 --> 01:02:47.873]  Saying that it's okay to beat women.
[01:02:47.873 --> 01:02:51.635]  He's been advocating wife beating in all these major British universities.
[01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:59.840]  There's top US Muslim professors that say killing and robbing non-Muslims is your duty and this is a liberal and the liberals love it.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.661]  Why do they hate themselves so much?
[01:03:01.661 --> 01:03:02.662]  What is wrong with liberals?
[01:03:02.662 --> 01:03:03.362]  They're not liberals.
[01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:04.603]  They're sick mental patients.
[01:03:05.885 --> 01:03:10.848]  It's because they've got this collective white guilt, which in Germany is a hangover from World War II.
[01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:13.590]  It's also because they're flagrantly racist.
[01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:18.713]  And it's also because feminism, third wave feminism, is basically a cult.
[01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:25.197]  So you have to adhere to the cult beliefs to stay in the cult and not be ostracized from it.
[01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:30.320]  Which is why only white Western males can be responsible for rape culture.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:39.829]  Even though women in colleges in the US, for example, are less likely to be raped than women in the general population, it's actually the safest place for them to be.
[01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:54.163]  But because leftists, regressive leftists, are racist, they can't mention the massive Muslim molestation problem, which has been named and has been carried out in Muslim nations, especially Egypt, for years and years and years.
[01:03:54.343 --> 01:03:59.290]  Well, I want to know why gun control didn't work and why the Muslims have guns in Europe if the guns are banned, Paul.
[01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.495]  You know, the Germans can't get guns, but I guess the foreigners can.
[01:04:02.495 --> 01:04:03.917]  I guess the outsiders can.
[01:04:05.285 --> 01:04:11.908]  Well, yeah, and the Austrian police chief has now come out and said that women shouldn't go out at night alone, so as to avoid attack.
[01:04:11.908 --> 01:04:14.929]  So again, the feminists whine all day about blaming the victim.
[01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:18.171]  That's what the authorities have been doing for over a week.
[01:04:18.171 --> 01:04:19.971]  And again, the feminists don't give a damn.
[01:04:19.971 --> 01:04:22.953]  They're too busy complaining about sexist air conditioning.
[01:04:22.953 --> 01:04:25.554]  So their hypocrisy has been exposed once again.
[01:04:25.554 --> 01:04:26.074]  And manspreading.
[01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:27.474]  They don't care about women.
[01:04:27.474 --> 01:04:28.255]  And manspreading.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.681]  Manspreading, you know, beach body ads.
[01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:32.722]  These are the major issues.
[01:04:32.722 --> 01:04:34.443]  Meanwhile, thousands of women get raped.
[01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:35.824]  They don't have a word.
[01:04:35.824 --> 01:04:36.485]  And in U.S.
[01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:41.388]  schools, they're making boys sit, because it's not fair that they can stand.
[01:04:41.388 --> 01:04:44.930]  They're obsessed with how our young boys use the bathroom.
[01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:48.312]  These are truly cult, brainwashing, sick freaks.
[01:04:48.312 --> 01:04:50.673]  Total enemies of the human species itself.
[01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:53.075]  And I'm not talking about the radical Muslims.
[01:04:53.075 --> 01:04:55.156]  I'm talking about the liberal scumbag filth.
[01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:56.137]  They're the real threat.
[01:04:56.137 --> 01:04:56.657]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:04:56.657 --> 01:04:57.658]  You'll be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:04:58.749 --> 01:05:03.993]  President Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about, until now.
[01:05:03.993 --> 01:05:09.716]  For one thing, he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare.
[01:05:09.716 --> 01:05:20.443]  That's right, Obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's requirements, because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program.
[01:05:20.443 --> 01:05:28.629]  Once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was, they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else, which Obama gave them.
[01:05:28.969 --> 01:05:34.651]  President Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity.
[01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:43.255]  The Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a non-profit application within just one month from the Barack H. Obama Foundation.
[01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:48.857]  Additionally, the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's tax exempt status.
[01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:55.760]  You can find out more from the article on InfoWars.com entitled, 75 Times Obama Broke Law During Presidency.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.161]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:05:58.652 --> 01:05:59.232]  I want more candy!
[01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:00.633]  I want more Ricky O'Carroll!
[01:06:00.633 --> 01:06:01.874]  Mine!
[01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:02.014]  Mine!
[01:06:02.014 --> 01:06:02.094]  Mine!
[01:06:28.672 --> 01:06:29.433]  I think so.
[01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:05.777]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:07:51.565 --> 01:07:55.269]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:57.151]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:18.214 --> 01:08:22.096]  We are now into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:26.759]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:31.301]  He just joined us for about 15 minutes in the last hour.
[01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:36.924]  Getting into the massive rapes all over Europe.
[01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:49.752]  I mean, we're talking hundreds per major city with radical jihadis firing guns, pulling people out of cars, raping women, attacking women with baby strollers, running around thumbing at the mouth.
[01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:53.455]  I mean, we've got a bunch of videos on Infowars.com.
[01:08:53.455 --> 01:08:55.336]  It is the craziest stuff I've ever seen.
[01:08:55.336 --> 01:09:05.304]  It's like when they have that CNN reporter and others in Egypt and they just drag the woman off and a hundred plus people rape her and she's still having to have medical stuff done to her today.
[01:09:06.084 --> 01:09:07.845]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[01:09:07.845 --> 01:09:13.209]  The West doesn't do this, but feminists are saying that it's Western men.
[01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:17.792]  The police chief came out in Cologne and said nothing happened.
[01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:22.976]  And then when they got caught lying about all that, when all that information started to come out,
[01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:31.559]  The feminist groups came out and said it's worse to criticize the poor little migrants, the military-age men, 80-something percent of them with fake passports.
[01:09:31.559 --> 01:09:36.803]  These are the people that invaded Syria to rape, murder, and kill there.
[01:09:36.803 --> 01:09:39.485]  And again, that was Hillary Clinton and the State Department.
[01:09:39.485 --> 01:09:44.448]  Two weeks ago, Hillary said that Syria is going well.
[01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:47.371]  Look up the quote, Syria is going well.
[01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:51.494]  A few days later, the State Department came out and said, we've brought peace to Syria.
[01:09:53.078 --> 01:09:55.999]  Thanks to the policy of the last five years, which Hillary started.
[01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:57.460]  I mean, this is the craziest thing.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:14.708]  It's like giving the captain of the Titanic a posthumous award for helping run into an iceberg on its first mission, on its first voyage, its maiden trip there from the UK over to New York City.
[01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:16.069]  And it's the same thing with the Clintons.
[01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:18.150]  For me, it's like Groundhog Day.
[01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:18.930]  I've been on air since 1995.
[01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:32.534]  And I was interviewing Larry Nichols and Jennifer Flowers and all the, before you ever heard of Paula Jones, before you ever heard of Kathleen Willey, before you ever heard of these women, and we've had them all on.
[01:10:32.534 --> 01:10:37.018]  And it's crazy, all these years later I'm having them back on.
[01:10:37.018 --> 01:10:40.382]  And many of these are women that Clinton's settled cases with.
[01:10:40.382 --> 01:10:41.583]  These are professional women.
[01:10:42.688 --> 01:10:52.653]  I mean, I'm sure Cosby probably did a lot of what he's being accused of, but, you know, it's like cocktail waitresses, playboy playmates, they go to a party at a hotel, they go in a room with him, they claim they don't know what happened.
[01:10:52.653 --> 01:10:54.514]  Okay, maybe he did date rape.
[01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:55.875]  I'm sure with her smoke, there's fire.
[01:10:55.875 --> 01:11:04.240]  But with Clinton, they're at the governor's mansion, or they're in a cloakroom, or they're in the White House, and he says, can I talk to you in my office, please?
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.382]  And then rams their head in the wall, starts choking them, bites their lip.
[01:11:07.382 --> 01:11:09.723]  The women are all saying the same thing, and then rapes them.
[01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:14.014]  These are professional women, folks.
[01:11:14.014 --> 01:11:16.718]  These aren't bimbos who you can question.
[01:11:16.718 --> 01:11:18.280]  And I'm not attacking those women.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.121]  I mean, just come on, though.
[01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:20.002]  You listen to a stripper?
[01:11:20.002 --> 01:11:26.570]  Or do you listen to a professional woman making $300,000 a year who's a big Democrat insider and never made stuff up before?
[01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:28.773]  They have no reason to say Bill Clinton's doing this to them.
[01:11:30.111 --> 01:11:32.893]  And the amount of evidence, he's mind-blowing.
[01:11:32.893 --> 01:11:41.158]  He's got a new book coming out on the Bushes, and I'm an expert on them and all of Jeb Bush's activity with African dictators and drug running and...
[01:11:42.014 --> 01:11:42.715]  It's all coming out.
[01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:50.522]  He's got another book on that subject, but he is a big insider in the Nixon and Bush administration and others.
[01:11:50.522 --> 01:11:56.928]  Been a strategist, I guess, for six administrations and running big pro-Western campaigns in other nations successfully.
[01:11:56.928 --> 01:12:02.573]  He's a big fish if you look up the New York Times best-selling author, The Clintons' War on Women.
[01:12:03.294 --> 01:12:03.634]  I think?
[01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:31.267]  InfoWars calendar that has more than $2,000 of coupons and promo codes from infowarsstore.com on it.
[01:12:31.267 --> 01:12:34.108]  I'm talking free shipping, 20% off, stuff like that.
[01:12:34.108 --> 01:12:40.989]  So you get the calendar for free that's normally $7 with the big hardcover book.
[01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:46.811]  I know most of my listeners are constitutionalists, libertarians, classical liberals, conservatives, people of conscience.
[01:12:46.811 --> 01:12:47.391]  You're informed.
[01:12:48.556 --> 01:12:52.542]  You know about the Clintons and her attacking women that went forward about his rape.
[01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.946]  You know he got caught lying about the sex and the women.
[01:12:54.946 --> 01:12:56.488]  You know he's a super predator.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.181]  You know he's a co-kid.
[01:12:59.181 --> 01:13:00.702]  You know all of it.
[01:13:00.702 --> 01:13:02.604]  But the public doesn't.
[01:13:02.604 --> 01:13:03.725]  You need to buy the book.
[01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:06.767]  You need to give it to local talk show hosts and other opinion makers.
[01:13:06.767 --> 01:13:08.749]  You need to give it to the women in your life.
[01:13:08.749 --> 01:13:10.110]  You need to give it to Democrats.
[01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:21.579]  You need to read the book, become an expert on it, refresh your memory on it, and then call into other shows saying, I read in the book, or here's the news article in the book, and talk about it.
[01:13:21.579 --> 01:13:23.560]  Tell talk show hosts you want to discuss it.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.681]  And here's the deal.
[01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:25.602]  We're going to go into our guest.
[01:13:26.789 --> 01:13:41.160]  Roger Stone was here months ago telling me, hey listen, I've left the Trump campaign as a chief advisor because I want to be able to do whatever I want, and I'm putting out a book on the rape, that's going to take down the Clintons, and I'm putting one out in the bushes that are going to take them out of the way for Trump.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.221]  But he goes, I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do.
[01:13:44.082 --> 01:13:49.266]  So, you can debate all day whether Kerry was really a coward in the whole Swift Boat deal that Dr. Corsi put out.
[01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:53.690]  This is the real Swift Boat, folks, of the Clintons and the Bushes.
[01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:56.792]  You need to get the book, InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:58.773]  Get the word out and support the broadcast.
[01:13:58.773 --> 01:14:01.095]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:14:01.095 --> 01:14:04.778]  You can also go to the Stone Zone, his website, and find it there as well.
[01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:05.499]  Now, I'm ranting.
[01:14:05.499 --> 01:14:07.380]  I don't want to burn the time I've got with him.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.181]  He's a hard guy.
[01:14:08.681 --> 01:14:09.362]  I don't think so.
[01:14:24.714 --> 01:14:27.176]  But there's so many fronts to cover here.
[01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:31.380]  Mr. Stone, first off, congratulations on all the success you're having.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.902]  You're all over TV, Bill Maher, you name it.
[01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.463]  Your books are selling out.
[01:14:35.463 --> 01:14:40.007]  It took us a month to even get any from your publisher, Sky Horse.
[01:14:40.507 --> 01:14:44.029]  Congratulations, Trump, following your battle plan to a great extent.
[01:14:44.029 --> 01:14:47.091]  Leading in three national polls, three to five points.
[01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:49.413]  20% of Democrats saying they're coming over to Trump.
[01:14:49.413 --> 01:14:51.715]  This looks like a bigger landslide than Reagan.
[01:14:51.715 --> 01:14:54.737]  Top analysts saying 47 states to go Republican.
[01:14:54.737 --> 01:15:00.941]  I want to give you the floor to talk about the grand strategy, where we really sit, but also how the empire is going to strike back.
[01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:06.164]  I don't see this crime syndicate, we know they're joined at the hip, the Clinton-Bush crime syndicate.
[01:15:06.164 --> 01:15:08.566]  I don't see them giving up the crown lightly.
[01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:10.247]  Roger Stone, how do we stop these people?
[01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:13.669]  Well, Alex, first of all, I'm delighted to be back with you.
[01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:23.993]  And I appreciate your kind words about the oppo package needed to take down Hillary, which is entitled The Clinton's War on Women.
[01:15:23.993 --> 01:15:39.441]  I was very happy to say that this book has done very well, despite the mainstream media efforts to make the current debate about adultery or marital infidelity or pain in your marriage when it's about something far darker.
[01:15:40.174 --> 01:15:47.080]  Serial rape, sexual assault, intimidation, strong arm tactics.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.863]  With Hillary, an accessory after the fact.
[01:15:49.863 --> 01:15:52.325]  With Hillary, the woman running for president.
[01:15:53.850 --> 01:16:03.900]  Being the point person in the terror campaign to intimidate, let's use a word of the left, and bully these women into silence.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:14.029]  Whether it's silence in regard to a subpoena or whether it is silence in terms of speaking out and blowing their cover as a racket, Hillary's the enforcer.
[01:16:14.029 --> 01:16:16.392]  She's the one who intimidates and bullies these people.
[01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:29.529]  She's the one who hired the heavy-handed private detectives, Palladino, Pellicano, Ivan Duda, even Jerry Parks, to keep an eye on the West.
[01:16:29.529 --> 01:16:33.895]  As you know, some witnesses in Arkansas to him with women had their arms and legs broken.
[01:16:34.804 --> 01:16:37.265]  Well, not only that, but Jerry Parks may have been killed.
[01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:44.370]  Jerry Parks was a private detective brought in to do special work by Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster.
[01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:46.451]  That's who he hired, who hired him.
[01:16:46.451 --> 01:17:01.100]  And he was given a list of women and said, these are women who either Bill has had incidents with, that means assaulted, bit perhaps, exposed himself, tried to rape, and these others are just women that he had consensual sex with but then dumped.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:07.905]  And they're threatening to come forward and say what they know they also need to be handled.
[01:17:07.905 --> 01:17:23.097]  Now, when Jerry Parks tried to collect his $83,000 bill after Bill Clinton's election and after Jerry had suppressed the bimbo eruption in Arkansas, he gave Bill his bill for $83,000 and Bill looked at him and laughed.
[01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.639]  He said, the election's over, Jerry, you're not getting paid.
[01:17:27.646 --> 01:17:34.030]  And he said, all right, well, I have to go forward with what I know about women and about drugs through MENA.
[01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:39.853]  And a week later, somebody drove Jerry Parks off the road and shot him in the head.
[01:17:39.853 --> 01:17:43.616]  So motive means opportunity.
[01:17:43.616 --> 01:17:46.217]  Yeah, there's a lot of dirty business here.
[01:17:46.217 --> 01:17:49.859]  But Hillary and the mainstream media are trying desperately to duck this.
[01:17:49.859 --> 01:17:55.723]  The New York Times editorial board says that Bill Clinton's actions, while repugnant,
[01:17:56.443 --> 01:17:58.024]  Uh, are irrelevant to Hillary.
[01:17:58.024 --> 01:18:01.846]  No, they aren't because Hillary is an accessory after the fact.
[01:18:01.846 --> 01:18:05.128]  She's a full co-conspirator in the cover-up.
[01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:09.130]  It's not just that she enables this by looking the other way and remains silent.
[01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:16.715]  She actually threatens violence and terrorizes the women and families of the women unlucky enough
[01:18:17.645 --> 01:18:19.186]  To be assaulted by Bill Clinton.
[01:18:41.504 --> 01:18:58.548]  For those that don't know Hillary, I know most of our listeners do, but the real background from insiders, and you've been inside multiple White Houses, not Democrat, but they admit Hillary wasn't just co-president, Clinton was having sex, partying, cocaine, doing some diplomatic stuff, but Hillary was, is the power maven.
[01:18:58.548 --> 01:18:59.568]  She was in there.
[01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.968]  I mean, is that correct from your research?
[01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:04.309]  Well, not only that, but as I prove in my book, it's Hillary
[01:19:05.009 --> 01:19:09.617]  Who gives the go-ahead on the assault on the Branch Davidian Combined in Waco.
[01:19:09.617 --> 01:19:10.599]  That's right.
[01:19:10.599 --> 01:19:12.542]  Killed 18 children under the age of 8.
[01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:15.988]  This is Hillary, the advocate for children, who did this.
[01:19:15.988 --> 01:19:16.709]  Janet Reno.
[01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:19.520]  Uh, lesbian.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.843]  Her hand-picked Attorney General.
[01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:22.984]  Webster Hubble.
[01:19:22.984 --> 01:19:25.827]  The Deputy Attorney General who gives the order.
[01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.449]  Hillary's lover.
[01:19:27.449 --> 01:19:28.631]  Chelsea's father.
[01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:31.875]  And we have her callous statement about just kill him, take him out.
[01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:34.498]  And then meanwhile, she does the same thing about Gaddafi.
[01:19:34.498 --> 01:19:35.839]  She really is like a villain.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:57.429]  Well, in the case of Gaddafi, though, you have to recognize that the nation of Qatar, a very wealthy oil Arab empire, paid Bill a million and a half for a speech, paid Hillary a million for a speech, put $2.5 million into the Clinton Foundation, put $2.5 million into the Clinton Presidential Library.
[01:19:57.429 --> 01:20:02.691]  At the same time, they're similarly bribing Sarkozy and Blair.
[01:20:03.848 --> 01:20:06.709]  Who are now fixers in their nations.
[01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:11.270]  And lo and behold, the State Department decides to reverse our policy.
[01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:25.894]  Qaddafi, who has renounced his nuclear aspirations, who is feeding us intelligence on al-Qaeda, whose children are being educated in the West, the guy who figured out in the greater struggle of time, he'd rather be on our side than their side.
[01:20:25.894 --> 01:20:32.056]  We take him out by going to the National Credit Card and borrowing the money for a massive bombing, which we can't even pay for.
[01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:35.998]  Because the rebels would have repelled, would have not been able to overrun.
[01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.080]  And then we try to take out our allies in Egypt.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.381]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:40.682]  No, it's not crazy.
[01:20:40.682 --> 01:20:43.203]  This is the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.
[01:20:43.203 --> 01:20:44.824]  This has to be willful.
[01:20:44.824 --> 01:20:53.651]  We are systematically taking, getting rid of every ally we have in the region, those feeding us intelligence, and we're inserting the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:54.871]  Willful sabotage.
[01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:59.635]  What's the endgame there and then back into the raping and then that incredible turbo surge of Trump?
[01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:01.216]  It's just unbelievable to watch history.
[01:21:01.476 --> 01:21:06.820]  I love how he tells her how dare you claim I don't like women when I love women and have no history and you protect your rapist husband.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.701]  That scares the hell out of her.
[01:21:28.795 --> 01:21:29.996]  Well, and I'll tell you something else.
[01:21:29.996 --> 01:21:36.681]  When Ivanka Trump, who is the greatest asset Donald has, and she's got a business to run and a family to rear.
[01:21:36.681 --> 01:21:42.385]  She's got two, I believe, small kids, but she is one of the best dressed women in the world.
[01:21:42.385 --> 01:21:43.586]  She is poised.
[01:21:43.586 --> 01:21:44.387]  She's a great actress.
[01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:46.368]  She'd make a great first lady.
[01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:50.471]  And she has seen how her father has nurtured women in the business world.
[01:21:51.352 --> 01:21:59.956]  So I think in the end, women will look quite differently at the real Donald Trump, not the caricature that the left is trying to paint of him.
[01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:06.760]  But even today, Alex, Jeb Bush says Bill's activities are off-limits.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.061]  Chris Christie says they're off-limits.
[01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:12.602]  Kasich, Governor John Kasich, they're off-limits, all in political.
[01:22:12.602 --> 01:22:14.623]  Is Bill Cosby off-limits?
[01:22:14.623 --> 01:22:15.604]  Where's the white flag?
[01:22:17.835 --> 01:22:21.656]  Bill Clinton is a Cosby-type sexual predator.
[01:22:21.656 --> 01:22:38.301]  But Hillary is the one running for president, and she's not irrelevant, because again, as I said, she is running the Nuts and Sluts campaign to discredit Monica Lewinsky, to make it her fault that she was seduced by a man three times her age.
[01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:44.462]  The Republicans are waving the right flag if they don't use this issue.
[01:22:44.462 --> 01:22:50.323]  Trump has the gumption to do this, which is why I remain a strong Trump supporter.
[01:22:50.323 --> 01:23:07.666]  I must tell you, Alex, the lobbyists, the insiders, the banking interests, the insurance lobbyists, the billionaires, the pokes, the singers, the Bermans, the Schwarzman, the Braemans, all these guys who are funding Marco Rubio,
[01:23:09.686 --> 01:23:23.649]  All of the insiders who will take anybody but Trump, ABT, not too fond of Ted Cruz either, says that Clinton is off-limits, which is an absurdity.
[01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:30.350]  I was about to say that you've been a big insider, but always very principled, standing up for real conservative and libertarian ideals.
[01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:36.311]  But you look at most of these people, they're just Democrats who want to control the Republican Party, and that's why I finally, about three months ago,
[01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:51.599]  You know, sort of coming over to Trump because there wasn't any other strong leadership, there wasn't anybody telling it like it was, there wasn't anybody going up against political correctness, there wasn't anybody pointing out we have all these bad tariff deals and all these deals that ensure our jobs will go, but the coup de grace was money doesn't lie.
[01:23:52.139 --> 01:23:54.500]  He's not getting any big hedge fund money.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.461]  He's not getting any big money.
[01:23:56.461 --> 01:23:59.823]  All the big money is going to Hillary or Jeb Bush or Rubio.
[01:23:59.823 --> 01:24:01.544]  That's all you need to know.
[01:24:01.544 --> 01:24:02.624]  Trump or die.
[01:24:02.624 --> 01:24:03.505]  I mean, that's it.
[01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:03.985]  I'm sorry.
[01:24:03.985 --> 01:24:05.606]  I mean, I like Rand Paul.
[01:24:05.606 --> 01:24:06.606]  I like Cruz.
[01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:07.727]  Cruz might have a shot.
[01:24:07.727 --> 01:24:09.207]  I hope he becomes Trump's VP.
[01:24:09.207 --> 01:24:10.468]  We've got to get behind Trump.
[01:24:10.468 --> 01:24:11.429]  It's just true.
[01:24:11.429 --> 01:24:11.969]  It's a fact.
[01:24:12.429 --> 01:24:21.615]  And I'm not going to sit here like a coward on the sidelines and then, you know, just join the whole chorus attacking him because it's the right thing to do to stand with Trump.
[01:24:21.615 --> 01:24:27.439]  Plus, it's even getting Democrats to see it's a shut up now and they're swinging over to Trump.
[01:24:27.439 --> 01:24:29.080]  Can we talk about those numbers some?
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.401]  Because it's so huge.
[01:24:30.401 --> 01:24:34.464]  All these big polls, these numbers show he would win right now in a general election.
[01:24:34.464 --> 01:24:35.625]  Am I wrong?
[01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:39.387]  No, I actually think he's the only Republican with any prospect of beating Hillary.
[01:24:39.387 --> 01:24:40.368]  Here's what's ironic.
[01:24:40.368 --> 01:24:41.849]  As much as the left beats on him,
[01:24:42.569 --> 01:24:49.558]  He will get a larger percentage of black and Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney or John McCain was ever able to achieve.
[01:24:49.558 --> 01:24:51.320]  It's aspirational.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.643]  Donald Trump will put the country back to work.
[01:24:53.643 --> 01:24:58.428]  This morning I got a call from the NAACP chairman in Leesburg, Virginia.
[01:24:58.428 --> 01:25:01.512]  He wants to organize the state for Trump.
[01:25:02.412 --> 01:25:04.874]  I asked him, I said, I was a little surprised by his call.
[01:25:04.874 --> 01:25:06.215]  And he said, what are you talking about?
[01:25:06.215 --> 01:25:08.878]  He said, Trump means jobs.
[01:25:08.878 --> 01:25:10.699]  Trump means opportunity.
[01:25:10.699 --> 01:25:12.601]  Trump means prosperity.
[01:25:12.601 --> 01:25:18.066]  Trump means that there's a possibility for my kids to have a better life than I had.
[01:25:18.066 --> 01:25:21.289]  And I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of support in the community for that.
[01:25:21.289 --> 01:25:22.710]  So right there.
[01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:26.674]  And then blue collar Democrats that we used to call Reagan Democrats.
[01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:32.520]  Now, more precisely, and before that, they were Nixon Democrats.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.882]  They will go to Trump in record numbers.
[01:25:35.882 --> 01:25:39.023]  So, this will be a very close election.
[01:25:39.023 --> 01:25:42.545]  The Clintons, I think, have made an enormous mistake.
[01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:45.846]  Let's remember, Hillary called Donald out.
[01:25:45.846 --> 01:25:47.787]  She's the one who played the gender card.
[01:25:47.787 --> 01:25:50.828]  Oh, you're bullying women.
[01:25:50.828 --> 01:25:54.810]  And when that happened, Trump was right back in her face.
[01:25:56.016 --> 01:25:58.457]  How politically incorrect?
[01:25:58.457 --> 01:26:00.378]  Except for he's right on the money.
[01:26:00.378 --> 01:26:01.739]  She's in it with him.
[01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:06.501]  She's an enabler and that is a fair issue.
[01:26:06.501 --> 01:26:07.782]  I want to get back into the women.
[01:26:07.782 --> 01:26:13.525]  I want to get back into the book because this is one of the few things obviously that is really going to get past this whole
[01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:15.416]  We're good to go.
[01:26:36.786 --> 01:26:55.690]  Well, it's even worse than that, Alex, because she has taken millions of dollars from regimes through the Clinton Foundation that suppress women, oppress women, don't let women drive, don't let them vote, don't let them be educated, don't let them choose their own husband, don't let them go out in public with a veil.
[01:26:57.078 --> 01:27:01.020]  She, on the issue of pay inequality, she's a total fraud.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:08.203]  No place where Hillary has been the boss has she ever paid men or women as much or more than men.
[01:27:08.203 --> 01:27:12.404]  Not the State Department, not the Clinton Foundation, and not the U.S.
[01:27:12.404 --> 01:27:14.905]  Senate, where she certainly had that authority.
[01:27:14.905 --> 01:27:18.487]  So she's a fraud on women's issues broadly.
[01:27:18.487 --> 01:27:21.508]  She obviously has manifest criminal activities.
[01:27:22.429 --> 01:27:27.297]  What I'm hopeful here, Alex, is that the younger people in the electorate, particularly women,
[01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:35.575]  Who have a generally favorable opinion of Hillary, based only on what they know on a cursory basis, that they be educated.
[01:27:35.575 --> 01:27:37.556]  Everything is back on the table.
[01:27:37.556 --> 01:27:42.439]  Once the Clintons decided she was going to reach for power, and they probably had a deal with Jeb.
[01:27:42.439 --> 01:27:46.141]  Jeb was the designated loser in this race.
[01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:49.183]  He would never raise these issues, as he told us today.
[01:27:49.183 --> 01:27:56.007]  He would take his beating and then going back to making money with the Clintons, because the Bushes and the Clintons profiteer together.
[01:27:56.627 --> 01:27:59.708]  They're in charity scams together.
[01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:03.010]  They are skimming charitable funds together.
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:06.871]  They're lob rolling for their presidential libraries together.
[01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:09.092]  They rehabilitate each other.
[01:28:09.092 --> 01:28:11.173]  They praise each other.
[01:28:11.173 --> 01:28:15.575]  You know, this is very much, Trump has kind of upset the game plan here.
[01:28:15.575 --> 01:28:19.617]  We were going to get a heads I win, tails you lose.
[01:28:19.617 --> 01:28:21.418]  Barbara calls Clinton her son.
[01:28:21.418 --> 01:28:23.539]  I mean, Bush calls him his brother.
[01:28:23.539 --> 01:28:24.319]  This is sickening.
[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:35.055]  Yes, no, look, you know, Barbara Bush, on those rare occasions where she's sober, says that Bubba is like her fifth son.
[01:28:35.055 --> 01:28:44.140]  I know you work for the Bushes and others and help them, you know, get elected and everything, but you've taken the gloves off and are really writing books exposing the CIA, everything.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:46.941]  I mean, I think you're risking your life, Roger Stone.
[01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:48.802]  I mean, why are you so all in?
[01:28:48.802 --> 01:28:52.524]  You've been involved in six big campaigns I know of as a key guy.
[01:28:52.524 --> 01:28:53.565]  Why are you gloves off?
[01:28:54.616 --> 01:29:00.377]  Well look, Alex, I had great sentimental attachment to the Republican Party.
[01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:03.218]  I learned politics literally at the knee of Richard Nixon.
[01:29:03.218 --> 01:29:07.119]  I was motivated to get into politics by Barry Goldwater.
[01:29:07.119 --> 01:29:08.919]  The Goldwater Party was my party.
[01:29:08.919 --> 01:29:21.622]  It was a small government, small spending, small regulations, strong national defense, but no neocon looking for wars to get into that have no rationale.
[01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:22.722]  Stay there, I want to hear about your
[01:29:23.562 --> 01:29:25.525]  So what I get is, you haven't changed.
[01:29:25.525 --> 01:29:26.306]  You've always been there.
[01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:27.227]  They've just gotten so bad.
[01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:28.889]  But I want you to say it in your own words.
[01:29:28.889 --> 01:29:32.534]  Then I want to look at all these national numbers from Gallup poll, you name it.
[01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:35.478]  Democrats, people identifying as Democrats are the lowest ever.
[01:29:35.478 --> 01:29:36.800]  They're leaving in droves.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.642]  And the media keeps saying Hillary's invincible.
[01:29:39.743 --> 01:29:47.051]  I think we're already seeing the fall of Hillary Clinton, and I think Roger Stone and his book, and all the interviews he's done, made me the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[01:29:47.051 --> 01:29:48.133]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:49.534]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.534 --> 01:29:51.156]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.156 --> 01:29:54.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.065 --> 01:30:03.386]  It's Monday, January 11th, and here's a breakdown of the news that broke over the weekend.
[01:30:03.386 --> 01:30:09.888]  Supply-side economist Arthur Laffer is predicting Republicans will win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee.
[01:30:09.888 --> 01:30:16.269]  He said, quote, I won't be surprised if the Republicans don't take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50.
[01:30:16.269 --> 01:30:23.071]  Also, Sean Penn is now under investigation for secretly meeting Mexican cartel leader El Chapo deep in the jungle back in October.
[01:30:24.111 --> 01:30:24.712]  We're good to go.

[01:33:08.539 --> 01:33:26.788]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:26.788 --> 01:33:28.949]  You can look it up for yourself, don't believe me.
[01:33:30.115 --> 01:33:37.381]  Just type in, iodine deficiency causes lower IQs.
[01:33:37.381 --> 01:33:46.749]  You'll get the Associated Press, you'll get Reuters, you'll get, you can type in, government ordered iodine to be added in salt, IQs raised by 15 points in Midwest.
[01:33:46.749 --> 01:33:49.591]  And you'll get Associated Press, Business Insider.
[01:33:49.591 --> 01:33:52.894]  And then, by the 70s, they've sort of taken it out of the salt.
[01:33:52.894 --> 01:33:56.156]  Iodine deficiency is at record levels all over the Western world.
[01:33:57.557 --> 01:34:02.041]  Scurvy, the BBC reported, in the US and Europe is exploding.
[01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:05.703]  People don't even eat fresh fruits and vegetables.
[01:34:05.703 --> 01:34:10.386]  But you can get good vitamin C pretty much anywhere.
[01:34:10.386 --> 01:34:16.570]  Oranges, you know, cabbage, I mean, any green leaf spinach.
[01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:21.254]  Strawberries, I mean, just obviously citrus has more of it, but it's in green leaf vegetables as well.
[01:34:21.254 --> 01:34:22.675]  Just a little bit of it, you won't get scurvy.
[01:34:22.675 --> 01:34:24.396]  That just shows how deficient people are.
[01:34:26.001 --> 01:34:29.585]  Well, with X2, it is the purest deep-earth iodine.
[01:34:29.585 --> 01:34:35.452]  All the other iodine, because we've been into iodine for years, is from the ocean.
[01:34:35.452 --> 01:34:38.896]  It's not as pure, it's bound to things, it doesn't get absorbed the same.
[01:34:38.896 --> 01:34:41.559]  Suppose that nascent iodine means it's not bound, it's absorbable.
[01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:46.571]  Other iodines upset my stomach.
[01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:48.011]  They don't have the same effects.
[01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:51.632]  InfoWars X2 Survival Shield does it.
[01:34:51.632 --> 01:34:57.014]  And you take it for a month or so, regardless your support in the broadcast, it has a 4.8 star review.
[01:34:57.014 --> 01:34:59.774]  Nobody else has that on Power Reviews for their products.
[01:34:59.774 --> 01:35:01.895]  It's that game changer.
[01:35:01.895 --> 01:35:06.416]  You get that, you get half off Silver Bullet nascent iodine.
[01:35:06.416 --> 01:35:07.917]  You can get half off Silver Bullet
[01:35:09.517 --> 01:35:20.685]  Colloidal silver with the nascent iodine, and a free calendar for 2016 that's got over $2,000 of coupons in it as well.
[01:35:20.685 --> 01:35:21.826]  4info or store.com.
[01:35:21.826 --> 01:35:24.288]  There is no excuse not to support the broadcast.
[01:35:24.288 --> 01:35:33.494]  The more products you buy from us, the more reporters, the more research, the more films, the more crews flying around, the more big news we're breaking, and we wear our
[01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:42.112]  Bias to tell the truth, our bias to promote free market, Americana, George Washington, John Wayne values.
[01:35:42.112 --> 01:35:51.141]  110% we're committed, we're the place to spend your money and I appreciate you doing that because then you're defending free market in our country at the same time as getting good products.
[01:35:51.141 --> 01:35:59.569]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com and the six months free to sign up for the nightly news, prisonplanet.tv and all the podcasts, the films.
[01:36:00.845 --> 01:36:04.388]  We've always offered some months free in January's New Year's Special.
[01:36:04.388 --> 01:36:09.572]  This time it is six months free and that ends next Sunday.
[01:36:09.572 --> 01:36:10.213]  This Sunday.
[01:36:10.213 --> 01:36:11.154]  Monday it's over.
[01:36:11.154 --> 01:36:14.296]  You got seven days to get a half year off.
[01:36:14.296 --> 01:36:16.238]  Twenty people can use each membership.
[01:36:16.238 --> 01:36:23.024]  We just use the membership cost so it's a private forum for folks and so that you can share your membership with people but it's our own platform.
[01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:30.709]  So six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv and don't forget the Clinton's war on women, Roger Stone.
[01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:35.612]  Just the photos alone and the history and the people involved.
[01:36:35.612 --> 01:36:38.013]  I mean look at this if you're a TV viewer, if you're a radio listener.
[01:36:38.013 --> 01:36:38.654]  It's just full.
[01:36:39.554 --> 01:36:48.318]  Of all these different players, and how they're working with the Bushes, and how it all ties together, and the Clintons with Bill Cosby, and just, I mean, two peas in a pod.
[01:36:48.318 --> 01:36:50.179]  Look at that photo of those two together.
[01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:52.060]  I mean, unbelievable.
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:53.881]  The stuff Clinton did, we know.
[01:36:53.881 --> 01:36:56.042]  I mean, Cosby, no one's said ever brutalized people.
[01:36:56.974 --> 01:37:00.015]  He reportedly just drugged him or whatever, and he hasn't been convicted yet.
[01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:03.576]  But with the Clintons, I mean, he settled the cases, boys and girls.
[01:37:03.576 --> 01:37:10.719]  So, again, you need to get the book, InfoWarsTore.com, and you can get a free calendar with it as well.
[01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:11.679]  All supplies last.
[01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:13.540]  The calendars probably will sell out by next week.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.000]  I think we may have some more printed up.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.741]  They're so popular.
[01:37:18.871 --> 01:37:35.593]  Roger Stone, a very successful political strategist, worked in many White Houses directly, is just getting so hardcore right now, coming out about the Bushes and drug dealing and the Clintons and rape and putting out hardcore books, exposing it like the Clintons were on women.
[01:37:35.593 --> 01:37:36.594]  And I was asking you, sir,
[01:37:37.495 --> 01:37:45.897]  Obviously you weren't, I mean you've always promoted libertarian patriot ideas from Barry Goldwater is when you got involved and you worked at the Nixon White House, saw all that.
[01:37:45.897 --> 01:37:47.677]  But I mean it does seem like you've taken the gloves off.
[01:37:47.677 --> 01:38:03.200]  Please talk about the process, what you see in America, where you think this country is going and what's going to happen if we don't elect a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul because it looks like all over the world the left is going full totalitarian.
[01:38:04.631 --> 01:38:08.294]  It looks, I mean, they are, and they're trying to stamp out opposition.
[01:38:08.294 --> 01:38:12.258]  I mean, they really are getting up on their hind legs and going for broke.
[01:38:12.258 --> 01:38:15.280]  Is that because they can see the world's turning against them?
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.484]  I mean, I talk about these demographics here, and I want your take on that as well.
[01:38:19.484 --> 01:38:22.927]  Gallup, share of Democrats reaches record low in history.
[01:38:22.927 --> 01:38:29.813]  That's Politico, Economist, The Hill, GOP, within 47 state wins, maybe more out of 50.
[01:38:31.775 --> 01:38:33.057]  They're panicked right now.
[01:38:33.057 --> 01:38:33.918]  What might they pull?
[01:38:33.918 --> 01:38:35.420]  So that's the second question.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.467]  But first off, your evolution.
[01:38:39.467 --> 01:38:40.348]  Sure.
[01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:42.191]  As I said, I'm a sentimental Republican.
[01:38:42.191 --> 01:38:44.094]  Young Republican National Chairman from 1977 to 1979.
[01:38:46.536 --> 01:38:48.637]  Learned politics at the knee of Nixon.
[01:38:48.637 --> 01:38:51.999]  Worked in three presidential campaigns for Ronald Reagan.
[01:38:51.999 --> 01:38:53.821]  Never a Bush Republican.
[01:38:53.821 --> 01:38:57.443]  Supported him for vice president only after he got on the ticket.
[01:38:57.443 --> 01:39:01.765]  Actively opposed his getting on the ticket inside the Reagan operation.
[01:39:01.765 --> 01:39:05.208]  Promoting Jack Kemp of Buffalo, a real conservative.
[01:39:05.208 --> 01:39:08.510]  Recognizing the danger of Bush and the whole Bush family, even then.
[01:39:11.374 --> 01:39:18.136]  Unfortunately, Alex, I came to the conclusion that with the nomination of Mitt Romney, both parties had become one party.
[01:39:18.136 --> 01:39:19.476]  It was the Wall Street party.
[01:39:19.476 --> 01:39:20.916]  It was the party of endless war.
[01:39:20.916 --> 01:39:23.917]  It was the party of erosion of our civil liberties.
[01:39:23.917 --> 01:39:26.837]  It was the party of more and more spending.
[01:39:26.837 --> 01:39:32.318]  It was the party of the Federal Reserve and their paper money, making our dollars worthless.
[01:39:32.318 --> 01:39:36.459]  It was the party of banking and insurance and special interests.
[01:39:36.459 --> 01:39:37.839]  The party of the lobbyists.
[01:39:38.419 --> 01:39:39.764]  And both parties are the same.
[01:39:39.764 --> 01:39:43.236]  Obama was going to close Guantanamo.
[01:39:43.236 --> 01:39:43.959]  It's still open.
[01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:49.192]  Obama was going to bring home our troops from Afghanistan.
[01:39:49.192 --> 01:39:53.433]  Now he's planning to send troops to Syria.
[01:39:53.433 --> 01:39:54.794]  It all stays the same.
[01:39:54.794 --> 01:40:00.416]  Doesn't matter whether the policies are Bush or Clinton or Obama or Bush or Clinton.
[01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:01.877]  We get the same thing.
[01:40:01.877 --> 01:40:05.339]  As I said earlier, I think Jeb is what they call a ringer.
[01:40:05.339 --> 01:40:12.422]  His job was to lose, just like his father's job was to lose in 1992 from his long lost friend from the CIA.
[01:40:13.502 --> 01:40:18.346]  Clinton worked for the CIA when he was in Europe, spying on anti-war groups.
[01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:19.267]  George H.W.
[01:40:19.267 --> 01:40:28.655]  Bush worked for the CIA as early as 1961 on the Bay of Pigs invasion, involved in right-wing fundraising as an operative for the agency.
[01:40:28.655 --> 01:40:33.999]  He perjured himself when he was in the 70s when he said under oath that he'd never work for the agency.
[01:40:33.999 --> 01:40:35.841]  When he was made director out of the clear blue.
[01:40:36.957 --> 01:40:41.481]  Well, he had worked there before and he lied about it in his confirmation hearing.
[01:40:41.481 --> 01:40:42.701]  Absolutely, that's obvious.
[01:40:42.701 --> 01:40:46.484]  The longtime Bush ties to the intelligence community are known.
[01:40:46.484 --> 01:40:50.868]  Well, they've released the documents that he was in, as you said.
[01:40:50.868 --> 01:40:56.512]  The Bush family lawyer on Wall Street, Alan Dulles, the CIA director.
[01:40:56.512 --> 01:40:58.614]  So, you see everything you need to know.
[01:41:01.152 --> 01:41:06.497]  And of course, you're about to have a book come out about the Bushes and the CIA and the drug dealing and all the rest of it.
[01:41:06.497 --> 01:41:09.199]  I tell you, you have got a lot of... They're not bookends, Alex.
[01:41:09.199 --> 01:41:10.520]  They're really bookends.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:18.827]  The Clinton book talks about their involvement in corruption with the Bushes, and the Bush book tells the other half of that story, things I didn't know at the time I wrote the first book.
[01:41:18.827 --> 01:41:22.770]  These two families, these two dynasties are in it together.
[01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:28.975]  And the Clintons, they're really not hardcore leftists, as much as they're money-making opportunists and criminals.
[01:41:29.776 --> 01:41:33.200]  The Clinton Foundation is a slush fund for drifters.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:40.247]  It's a luxury travel service to augment the five-star lifestyle of Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton.
[01:41:40.247 --> 01:41:44.551]  It is a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:41:44.551 --> 01:41:49.396]  You're a foreign nation, you want to bump off Gaddafi and replace him with the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:41:49.396 --> 01:41:52.299]  You pay the Clintons, you line their pockets, and it shall be.
[01:41:52.299 --> 01:41:53.700]  She does it at the State Department.
[01:41:54.542 --> 01:42:00.126]  General Electric has a contract on the table, a defense contract, on Hillary's desk.
[01:42:00.126 --> 01:42:01.587]  They own NBC.
[01:42:01.587 --> 01:42:06.310]  NBC pays Chelsea 600 grand for one TV appearance.
[01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:07.931]  And guess what, Alex?
[01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:12.014]  General Electric got their contract, their multi-billion dollar contract.
[01:42:12.014 --> 01:42:13.174]  So you get it for peanuts?
[01:42:13.174 --> 01:42:16.436]  I mean, you like put in a quarter and you get a million bucks back.
[01:42:16.436 --> 01:42:17.617]  It's extraordinary.
[01:42:17.617 --> 01:42:20.039]  Look, the Clintons would steal a hot stove.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:27.901]  People need to know the true story of the Clinton crime syndicate.
[01:42:27.901 --> 01:42:41.625]  The most egregious thing to me here is the fact that the mainstream media lets Hillary run around saying Black Lives Matter, but they don't address the question of Bill's abandoned, rejected, mixed-race son, Danny Williams.
[01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:43.525]  Danny Williams is a fine young man, Alex.
[01:42:43.525 --> 01:42:44.905]  He's 30 years old.
[01:42:44.905 --> 01:42:45.926]  He's a churchgoer.
[01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:51.387]  He's built a small business, put himself through college, but he is the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:42:52.216 --> 01:43:01.586]  His mother was Bobby Ann Williams, a cocaine-addicted prostitute that Bill hired on several occasions to pleasure him.
[01:43:01.586 --> 01:43:10.455]  We know for a fact that Danny is Bill's son because Bobby Ann tells us she had not been with any other Caucasian gentleman.
[01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:30.615]  And in 1999, The Star, owned by Robert Altman, a Bush crony, friend of Bill, college classmate of Bill in Georgetown, Undersecretary of the Treasury, a guy who's given over a half million to the various Clinton political and financial escapades, he owns The Star.
[01:43:30.615 --> 01:43:33.596]  They write that they have a DNA test that absolves Bill.
[01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:39.771]  Alex, I went to the current owners of The Star.
[01:43:39.771 --> 01:43:42.573]  They were gracious in opening their files.
[01:43:42.573 --> 01:43:44.854]  There is no DNA test.
[01:43:44.854 --> 01:43:50.376]  Danny Williams is Bill's son, banished by Hillary.
[01:43:50.376 --> 01:43:55.199]  It's Hillary who told his mother and his aunt that they'd be arrested if they came around.
[01:43:55.199 --> 01:43:59.241]  It's Hillary who puts a private detective on silencing the rumors.
[01:44:00.101 --> 01:44:02.343]  About Bill's illegitimate son.
[01:44:02.343 --> 01:44:04.804]  It's time for the Clintons to do the right thing.
[01:44:04.804 --> 01:44:10.047]  Acknowledge, love, cherish, nurture your son.
[01:44:10.047 --> 01:44:13.990]  Don't lecture us about it takes a village to raise a child.
[01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:16.431]  Hillary, don't tell us about our babies.
[01:44:16.431 --> 01:44:18.973]  Do the right thing by this upstanding young man.
[01:44:18.973 --> 01:44:20.854]  Danny Williams doesn't do drugs.
[01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:21.935]  He doesn't drink.
[01:44:21.935 --> 01:44:23.616]  He's got to put food on the table.
[01:44:24.156 --> 01:44:28.482]  Bill Clinton is worth Alex 100 million plus dollars.
[01:44:28.482 --> 01:44:39.458]  So I think African American voters are going to go to Trump in droves when they learn about the Clinton's abuse of their black son and the abuse of women.
[01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:45.572]  And we're showing a picture of Danny Williams from your book on screen right now.
[01:44:45.572 --> 01:44:47.254]  I want to continue to expose the Clintons.
[01:44:47.254 --> 01:44:49.035]  Our listeners know they're criminals.
[01:44:49.035 --> 01:44:56.040]  We've had a lot of top experts, former CIA people and others on, to expose it, including one of their hitmen and others.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:02.826]  But shifting gears into big strategy, my listeners, I'd say 95% now, support Donald Trump.
[01:45:04.817 --> 01:45:11.245]  I think it's safe to say, in reality, there's been a collapse, Mr. Stone, in support for the two parties.
[01:45:11.245 --> 01:45:14.409]  The 9% approval rating for Congress, I think it's manifest now.
[01:45:14.409 --> 01:45:16.311]  I don't think I know.
[01:45:16.311 --> 01:45:18.954]  They realize everyone's hemorrhaging over to Trump.
[01:45:18.954 --> 01:45:19.755]  Nothing works.
[01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:25.143]  What type of dirty tricks are you advising him to look out for, obviously?
[01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:30.146]  That's where I think it's going to happen, Alex, and I think this is where this race is going.
[01:45:30.146 --> 01:45:46.975]  Because all of the primaries up to March 14th are proportional, and because many of these candidates who have no shot at being nominated still retain super PAC funds, and because of a really obscure rule pushed by the Romney people, Rule 40B of the convention,
[01:45:49.795 --> 01:45:55.664]  The nominee must have a majority, not just win, but a majority in at least eight states.
[01:45:56.604 --> 01:46:01.265]  By all these minor candidates hanging around, they're angling for a brokered convention.
[01:46:01.265 --> 01:46:08.287]  Trump could win primaries, overwhelmingly, in big states, but they don't count unless he gets a majority.
[01:46:08.287 --> 01:46:10.508]  Now, you also have another problem.
[01:46:10.508 --> 01:46:15.769]  There are 278 superdelegates to this convention.
[01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:20.650]  That comprises somewhere around 5% of the convention vote.
[01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:21.231]  Let's call it 5%.
[01:46:23.032 --> 01:46:31.881]  Those are going to be people who are not elected by the Republican primary voters, are in the caucuses, they're supernumeraries, 100% establishment.
[01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:34.865]  Alex, there's not a single Donald Trump vote in there.
[01:46:34.865 --> 01:46:40.110]  And by the way, let me just stop you because I want to like ring a bell here for the audience who's paying attention, but this is key.
[01:46:40.871 --> 01:46:42.732]  A lot of Republican insiders have said this.
[01:46:42.732 --> 01:46:43.613]  It's leaked.
[01:46:43.613 --> 01:46:48.236]  The donors are giving their money to other people like Rubio and Bush, saying it doesn't matter.
[01:46:48.236 --> 01:46:51.619]  Jeb has said in newspaper articles, you're never going to be president.
[01:46:51.619 --> 01:46:52.399]  Trump will never be.
[01:46:52.399 --> 01:46:53.220]  You watch.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.281]  We have the delegates.
[01:46:54.281 --> 01:46:56.142]  So criminals love to brag.
[01:46:56.142 --> 01:46:58.844]  They admit that they don't care how the citizens vote.
[01:46:58.844 --> 01:47:00.065]  They're going to steal it there.
[01:47:00.065 --> 01:47:01.826]  Forget the electronic voting machines.
[01:47:01.826 --> 01:47:03.107]  Forget Diebold.
[01:47:03.107 --> 01:47:04.408]  The real fix is the delegates.
[01:47:04.408 --> 01:47:06.930]  So break down how they do this and then how we stop them.
[01:47:07.998 --> 01:47:09.699]  Yes, I absolutely agree.
[01:47:09.699 --> 01:47:15.243]  Look, I got involved with a group called the Committee to Restore America's Greatness.
[01:47:15.243 --> 01:47:25.990]  I'm trying to put together a team of veteran convention activists, parliamentarians, lawyers, people who know this process, who can fight back.
[01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:32.054]  We may have to, by majority vote, by plurality vote, we may have to repeal
[01:47:33.196 --> 01:47:40.843]  The question of 840B, just repeal the rule, which the convention would have the authority to do.
[01:47:40.843 --> 01:47:47.930]  These superdelegates mean, mathematically, Trump needs more than 50% of the delegates up for grabs in the conventions and caucuses.
[01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:52.653]  Because it's Trump, he needs 55% and that's a tall order.
[01:47:52.653 --> 01:48:04.103]  The establishment, the Rubios, the Bushes, the K6 particularly, they all see themselves as leading some kind of establishment coalition.
[01:48:04.103 --> 01:48:05.584]  The designated ticket here
[01:48:06.414 --> 01:48:12.960]  Is Rubio the neocon matched with Kasich the neocon?
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.085]  Two guys who are, you know, Kasich was a banker and a lobbyist and a congressman.
[01:48:19.085 --> 01:48:20.786]  Consummate insider.
[01:48:20.786 --> 01:48:22.307]  Marco Rubio.
[01:48:22.307 --> 01:48:24.109]  Two terms in the legislature.
[01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:25.090]  Extremely green.
[01:48:25.655 --> 01:48:29.257]  And if anything worse, more of a neocon than Jeb.
[01:48:29.257 --> 01:48:40.025]  And of course, Jeb, the prince in waiting, who is looking for some late maneuver that lets him win a backroom, shady, stolen Republican National Convention.
[01:48:40.025 --> 01:48:42.907]  And I love the headlines about Trump's destroying the Republican Party.
[01:48:42.907 --> 01:48:44.508]  No, they've destroyed it.
[01:48:44.508 --> 01:48:46.269]  They've destroyed the country.
[01:48:46.269 --> 01:48:47.470]  No one wants them.
[01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:52.153]  And of course, you were there when they tried to steal the election, the nomination from Reagan.
[01:48:52.153 --> 01:48:55.075]  They made them broker it to bring in George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:48:55.955 --> 01:49:03.080]  I mean, that'd be bad enough if they said, you know, take Rubio or some other person and they shoot Trump and they've got Rubio in.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.462]  You've been there at the center of this, you know, helping stop some of it.
[01:49:06.462 --> 01:49:09.064]  What do we do to make sure this doesn't happen?
[01:49:09.064 --> 01:49:13.066]  Just educate people that a vote for anybody else is a vote for Hillary.
[01:49:13.066 --> 01:49:15.048]  You either vote for Trump or you vote for Hillary.
[01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:24.053]  And so you better vote for Trump in these primaries and give him a super majority or we're going to get Jeb Bush in there as a ringer, basically, or a Rubio.
[01:49:25.214 --> 01:49:41.405]  Yeah, I would hope at the end of the day, once those supporting Dr. Carson learn that Carson cannot be nominated, but that he might make a great Surgeon General in a Trump administration, will realize that the political bosses of the Republican Party and the establishment candidates are going to try to steal it.
[01:49:41.405 --> 01:49:42.446]  So he needs to fold.
[01:49:43.466 --> 01:49:54.995]  And then we have to convince his delegates, most of whom I think are fine Christians and good people, that Donald Trump is the reform candidate in this race against the same establishment that they opposed.
[01:49:54.995 --> 01:49:59.298]  I would hope in the end if I think Ted Cruz is going to win Iowa.
[01:49:59.298 --> 01:50:02.581]  His problem here is it's very early, but you and I both know this.
[01:50:02.581 --> 01:50:05.003]  Therefore, the headline in the mainstream media will be
[01:50:05.783 --> 01:50:13.551]  As expected, Ted Cruz won Iowa, but Donald Trump was a surprisingly strong second.
[01:50:13.551 --> 01:50:26.925]  That's absent some upset in which Rubio slips in second and Trump goes to third, which is not likely, but it is important to recognize that this is a very narrow contest in Iowa.
[01:50:27.566 --> 01:50:29.267]  It's not a primary.
[01:50:29.267 --> 01:50:31.107]  It's an organizational exercise.
[01:50:31.107 --> 01:50:33.768]  It's less television-driven.
[01:50:33.768 --> 01:50:36.269]  And it has rarely picked the winner.
[01:50:36.269 --> 01:50:38.550]  Trump has to finish first or second in my view.
[01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:42.211]  Even if he finished third, it hardly would be the end of his candidacy.
[01:50:42.211 --> 01:50:46.732]  On the other hand, New Hampshire is where Trump should be stronger.
[01:50:46.732 --> 01:50:48.173]  Somewhat fewer evangelicals.
[01:50:48.533 --> 01:50:51.157]  Well, he's dominating in New Hampshire right now, correct?
[01:50:51.157 --> 01:50:52.579]  Big, big numbers.
[01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.180]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:55.504]  I want to come back and talk strategy straight ahead.
[01:50:55.504 --> 01:50:57.386]  I mean, it's basically Trump or Hillary, folks.
[01:50:58.274 --> 01:50:59.474]  Trump or Hillary?
[01:50:59.474 --> 01:51:00.275]  This is Dan Pillard.
[01:51:00.275 --> 01:51:02.076]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:02.076 --> 01:51:03.716]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:51:58.197 --> 01:52:02.422]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:02.422 --> 01:52:03.043]  It's true.
[01:52:03.043 --> 01:52:07.207]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:07.207 --> 01:52:09.590]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:53:27.682 --> 01:53:30.723]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:30.723 --> 01:53:33.345]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:33.345 --> 01:53:34.105]  Croix River.
[01:53:34.105 --> 01:53:36.326]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.326 --> 01:53:39.287]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:39.287 --> 01:53:40.167]  His excuse?
[01:53:40.167 --> 01:53:41.508]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.508 --> 01:53:43.129]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:48.871]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:48.871 --> 01:53:49.912]  Don't wait.

[01:54:23.514 --> 01:54:28.499]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and Mr. Stone is sitting back down in his chair.
[01:54:28.499 --> 01:54:33.203]  So I'll ask him now if he can stay five more minutes into the next hour or if he has to leave us.
[01:54:33.203 --> 01:54:35.365]  I understand there's so much to get to.
[01:54:35.365 --> 01:54:41.631]  The Clinton's War on Women available at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:41.851]  Again,
[01:54:46.411 --> 01:54:49.633]  Former campaign advisor to Donald Trump, friends with Donald Trump.
[01:54:49.633 --> 01:54:55.738]  Donald Trump thanked Mr. Stone for asking him to come on the show when he was here a month ago with us.
[01:54:55.738 --> 01:55:07.406]  Speaking of Mr. Trump himself, strategy to have him win these primaries, what the Republican establishment is going to do to try to stop him, and then talking to Mr. Trump, how he's doing right now.
[01:55:07.406 --> 01:55:11.369]  I mean, he's got to be pretty excited that he's weathered every made-up storm.
[01:55:13.223 --> 01:55:15.824]  Yeah, no, he had a very strong week last week.
[01:55:15.824 --> 01:55:21.086]  Look, I think he wiped the war on women issue away for Hillary and the Democrats.
[01:55:21.086 --> 01:55:25.947]  If they thought they were going to play that old saw again, it's not going to work, and Trump served them notice.
[01:55:25.947 --> 01:55:32.609]  That's a big, big page that has to now be ripped out of their game plan to try to win this election.
[01:55:32.609 --> 01:55:36.530]  Look, I think Trump is the only candidate who can win, and I must tell you, he's feeling good.
[01:55:38.391 --> 01:55:40.614]  Uh, he is in a fine mood.
[01:55:40.614 --> 01:55:46.580]  Uh, you know, I, uh, I think that, uh, that it is, uh, you can see that he's having fun.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.665]  He's drawing enormous crowds, 10,000 people in South Carolina.
[01:55:50.665 --> 01:55:55.210]  Everywhere he goes, he is, uh, pulling extraordinary large crowds.
[01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:56.732]  Uh, there's an enthusiasm.
[01:55:56.732 --> 01:55:58.293]  Alex, this is an insurrection.
[01:55:59.073 --> 01:56:00.954]  This is an uprising.
[01:56:00.954 --> 01:56:05.355]  This is the underclasses saying we're fed up with the two-party duopoly.
[01:56:05.355 --> 01:56:10.617]  We're fed up with government that costs us a fortune and delivers nothing.
[01:56:10.617 --> 01:56:16.019]  We're fed up with a foreign policy that seems confused at best and treasonous at worst.
[01:56:16.019 --> 01:56:20.040]  We're sick of not being told the truth about most issues.
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:27.083]  We're sick about marching off to war without understanding where our national interest is.
[01:56:27.083 --> 01:56:32.886]  We're sick of having our emails and phone calls monitored by an oppressive Big Brother government.
[01:56:32.886 --> 01:56:34.247]  The people are angry.
[01:56:34.247 --> 01:56:41.791]  The key to Trump's election is many people who have stopped voting because, like you and I, they've become disgusted with the two-party system.
[01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:44.392]  Because the Democrats and Republicans are in it together.
[01:56:44.392 --> 01:56:46.733]  The Bushes and Clintons are in it together.
[01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.394]  Or people who are new to the process.
[01:56:49.341 --> 01:56:52.988]  And just have a general disregard for voting because they don't think it'll make any difference.
[01:56:52.988 --> 01:56:54.430]  Sure, how big is it though?
[01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:56.934]  Record numbers won't identify as Democrats now in Gallup.
[01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:02.374]  Yeah, no, I think the tea leaves of the polls are very good.
[01:57:02.374 --> 01:57:05.117]  I caution you to say they're going to change dramatically.
[01:57:05.117 --> 01:57:12.843]  Poll out today shows that more women think that Hillary Clinton treats women better than Donald Trump.
[01:57:12.843 --> 01:57:18.248]  And that doesn't surprise me because the truth about the Clintons has been suppressed by the mainstream media.
[01:57:18.248 --> 01:57:22.112]  And that's why it's key to get your book and all this proven documentation out.
[01:57:22.827 --> 01:57:24.308]  Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely true.
[01:57:24.308 --> 01:57:40.561]  Look, we know that when NBC had their chilling interview with Juanita Broderick, a woman who was raped and bitten by Bill Clinton in 1978 when he was Attorney General, they sat on that at NBC for weeks.
[01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:42.823]  They weren't even sure they were going to run it.
[01:57:42.823 --> 01:57:46.686]  It was a very fine piece of television journalism by Lisa Myers.
[01:57:46.686 --> 01:57:49.328]  I invite anybody to go to YouTube and watch it.
[01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:50.489]  This woman is compelling.
[01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:54.634]  And we should all write articles about that report, about Juanita Broderick.
[01:57:54.634 --> 01:58:05.647]  We should all bring that back up, because to use a Hobbit analogy, this could be the black arrow that brings down smog, is the information in your book that's so well documented.
[01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:09.867]  Well, I'm hoping that is the case.
[01:58:09.867 --> 01:58:15.289]  I do think that only Trump has the courage to continue to drive this home.
[01:58:15.289 --> 01:58:18.070]  Plus, only Trump would rebuild our military.
[01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:21.792]  Only Trump would destroy ISIS and stop this pinprick nonsense.
[01:58:21.792 --> 01:58:26.254]  If we're going to engage, then let's engage with a strategy that can succeed.
[01:58:26.254 --> 01:58:28.214]  I'm not an isolationist.
[01:58:28.214 --> 01:58:29.555]  I'm a non-interventionist.
[01:58:30.515 --> 01:58:31.936]  I don't want to go out looking for Jones.
[01:58:31.936 --> 01:58:32.116]  I get it.
[01:58:32.116 --> 01:58:33.177]  You don't want an empire.
[01:58:33.177 --> 01:58:33.637]  60-second break.
[01:58:33.637 --> 01:58:36.178]  I want to come back and put a cherry on top.
[01:58:36.178 --> 01:58:37.639]  Just for five minutes, Mr. Stone.
[01:58:37.639 --> 01:58:39.620]  The book, The Clintons War on Women.

[01:58:48.732 --> 01:58:50.354]  Clean, pure drinking water.

[01:58:51.856 --> 01:58:53.057]  But where do you get it?
[01:58:53.057 --> 01:58:59.045]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[01:59:24.698 --> 01:59:26.160]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.121]  Low maintenance.
[01:59:28.121 --> 01:59:30.223]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:59:51.193 --> 01:59:53.801]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.366 --> 02:00:16.029]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:16.029 --> 02:00:21.574]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:21.574 --> 02:00:30.202]  Well, I tell you, he's a very busy guy, Roger Stone, and he has amazing courage.
[02:00:30.202 --> 02:00:31.984]  I mean, I really do admire him.
[02:00:31.984 --> 02:00:36.889]  I knew who he was years ago, and then I met him at a JFK deal, because he exposes that.
[02:00:38.234 --> 02:00:45.738]  And he's just a good conservative constitutionalist, the kind of folks that Barry Goldwater was.
[02:00:45.738 --> 02:00:48.260]  And that's the kind of Republicans we need in this country.
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:52.142]  And then Democrats that are Democrats that aren't this weird cult of crazies.
[02:00:52.142 --> 02:00:56.865]  And even Louis Farrakhan, that's been critical of Donald Trump now, says he thinks he's wise, thinks he's good.
[02:00:56.865 --> 02:00:59.567]  We're going to play that interview after Mr. Stone leaves us.
[02:00:59.567 --> 02:01:01.728]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[02:01:04.110 --> 02:01:11.234]  When you got Louis Farrakhan and 20% of Democrats already saying they're going to vote Trump, that has got to scare the establishment, sir.
[02:01:11.234 --> 02:01:27.264]  One of the things that's interesting here is I think that the elite don't understand is that those Americans who came here legally from other countries and became Americans, including some obvious subset of Muslims who are indeed peace-loving,
[02:01:28.024 --> 02:01:42.956]  They too want to freeze Muslim immigration until such time that we can determine whether or not there are terrorists coming into the country.
[02:01:42.956 --> 02:01:51.523]  We know that terrorists came into the country through our broken immigration system in the San Bernardino shooting.
[02:01:51.523 --> 02:01:52.944]  We know that it happened in Paris.
[02:01:55.566 --> 02:02:02.629]  They don't understand that even constituencies of theirs see that Trump on some key issues makes just common sense.
[02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:08.532]  By the way, Jimmy Carter froze Iranian immigration during the Iranian hostage crisis.
[02:02:08.532 --> 02:02:10.132]  No one called him a racist.
[02:02:10.132 --> 02:02:12.073]  Nobody called him a bigot.
[02:02:12.073 --> 02:02:18.456]  The mainstream media is trying to tell us that Trump was trying to freeze Muslim immigration for all time, for all people, and that was unconstitutional.
[02:02:18.536 --> 02:02:20.818]  He said for a little bit of time until we find out what's going on.
[02:02:20.818 --> 02:02:23.420]  It's like if you're... There's no constitutional issue here.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:24.781]  The president has his authority.
[02:02:24.781 --> 02:02:26.623]  It's called common sense.
[02:02:26.623 --> 02:02:27.664]  That's what Donald Trump... Exactly.
[02:02:27.664 --> 02:02:35.090]  It's like if your sink's broken, which has happened before, you know, at my house, you go run and turn the water off at the street not because you hate water, but because it's broken.
[02:02:36.246 --> 02:02:40.450]  It's not just that Donald Trump, I think, would run a common sense foreign policy.
[02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:42.872]  Alex, the man's a job creator.
[02:02:42.872 --> 02:02:45.074]  This country is in the economic toilet.
[02:02:45.074 --> 02:02:46.395]  Trump means jobs.
[02:02:46.395 --> 02:02:49.118]  Trump means getting America moving again.
[02:02:49.118 --> 02:02:53.342]  Trump would streamline government regulations to make business work.
[02:02:53.342 --> 02:02:59.407]  And because he doesn't own, isn't owned by any special interest, he could actually cut federal spending.
[02:02:59.407 --> 02:03:00.308]  I worked in the U.S.
[02:03:00.308 --> 02:03:00.508]  Senate.
[02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:02.349]  I worked in the House.
[02:03:02.349 --> 02:03:11.212]  I can tell you, every penny of the billions of waste in the federal budget was put there by some politician who's being paid off by the stock lobby.
[02:03:11.212 --> 02:03:12.232]  Special interest.
[02:03:12.232 --> 02:03:13.793]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[02:03:13.793 --> 02:03:16.713]  I know there's other key points you haven't gotten to.
[02:03:16.713 --> 02:03:22.515]  What else do you want to impart to this audience with their marching orders to get out there and take action if they don't want Hillary in power?
[02:03:23.424 --> 02:03:33.148]  Well, I think the most important thing people can do is to retweet and re-Facebook and spread the word about the Clinton's trail of crime.
[02:03:33.148 --> 02:03:34.709]  The more people we educate.
[02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:44.693]  You see, the problem for the establishment here is you could control communications when there was only three national network televisions and a handful of national newspapers.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:58.490]  Today, with the development of talk radio, cable television, the internet, and organizations, news organizations like InfoWars, the truth can no longer be suppressed.
[02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:08.678]  And we have to reach out to those people who are not as political as we are, but want the right thing for our country, and explain to younger women, explain to younger female voters,
[02:04:09.258 --> 02:04:12.840]  The horrifying, stunning truth about Bill and Hillary.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:14.020]  Yeah, do they want to be suckered?
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:15.601]  Just vote for a woman and be conned?
[02:04:15.601 --> 02:04:18.602]  Or do they really want to save the country and their future?
[02:04:18.602 --> 02:04:19.443]  Right.
[02:04:19.443 --> 02:04:23.544]  And, you know, Bill rapes these women physically.
[02:04:23.544 --> 02:04:25.986]  Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:04:25.986 --> 02:04:30.868]  She has no right to call herself an advocate for women or children or girls.
[02:04:30.868 --> 02:04:34.509]  And so the epic criminality of the Clintons has to be exposed.
[02:04:34.509 --> 02:04:35.950]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:38.091]  Neighbor to neighbor, patriot to patriot.
[02:04:38.651 --> 02:04:39.611]  Now is the time.
[02:04:39.611 --> 02:04:41.412]  The people have the power.
[02:04:41.412 --> 02:04:43.832]  In one month, your new book, On the Bushes, comes out.
[02:04:43.832 --> 02:04:45.413]  I hope to have you in studio.
[02:04:45.413 --> 02:04:46.053]  Roger Stone.
[02:04:46.053 --> 02:04:51.494]  Folks, get the book, The Clinton's War on Women, at infowarestore.com or thestonezone.com.
[02:04:51.494 --> 02:04:53.535]  Thank you so much, Mr. Stone.
[02:04:53.535 --> 02:04:55.975]  Alex, God bless you and fight the good fight.
[02:04:55.975 --> 02:04:56.315]  All right.
[02:04:56.315 --> 02:04:57.976]  We'll be back, folks, with Louis Farrakhan.
[02:05:00.071 --> 02:05:05.055]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th.
[02:05:05.055 --> 02:05:11.479]  And join the InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[02:05:11.479 --> 02:05:14.762]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut.
[02:05:14.762 --> 02:05:18.064]  Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[02:05:18.064 --> 02:05:19.245]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:22.668]  Central on the InfoWars Nightly News and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m.
[02:05:22.668 --> 02:05:22.948]  Central.
[02:05:23.308 --> 02:05:26.852]  Join us for analysis that cuts through the lies in real time.
[02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:28.573]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[02:05:28.573 --> 02:05:32.297]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch it.
[02:05:32.297 --> 02:05:37.743]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate, but John Kasich is?
[02:05:37.743 --> 02:05:38.884]  What is this world coming to?
[02:05:39.224 --> 02:05:46.393]  Just a little side note here, the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[02:05:46.393 --> 02:05:48.055]  Join us this Thursday, 7 p.m.
[02:05:48.055 --> 02:05:51.419]  Central, for Political Science Theater 3K.
[02:05:51.419 --> 02:05:53.802]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:58.467 --> 02:06:01.970]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:10.216]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:10.216 --> 02:06:15.640]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:18.162]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:06:18.162 --> 02:06:20.283]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:28.334 --> 02:06:29.435]  Brain Force is here.
[02:06:29.435 --> 02:06:31.656]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:31.656 --> 02:06:36.639]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:06:36.639 --> 02:06:39.921]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:39.921 --> 02:06:43.423]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:43.423 --> 02:06:45.164]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:45.384 --> 02:06:46.325]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:06:46.325 --> 02:06:47.507]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:06:47.507 --> 02:06:49.489]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:06:49.489 --> 02:06:58.099]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.099 --> 02:07:04.026]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.
[02:07:04.026 --> 02:07:04.467]  It works.

[02:07:16.294 --> 02:07:28.241]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[02:07:28.241 --> 02:07:33.304]  Super Mel Vitality from Infowarslife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[02:07:33.444 --> 02:07:41.031]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest and most concentrated high-quality batch of Super Mel Vitality in the product's history.
[02:07:41.031 --> 02:07:43.793]  Our new ultra-strength formula is even stronger.

[02:07:51.279 --> 02:07:57.305]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[02:07:59.212 --> 02:07:59.813]  We've got it.
[02:07:59.813 --> 02:08:06.318]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:08:06.318 --> 02:08:10.722]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:10.722 --> 02:08:16.347]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:25.445 --> 02:08:28.849]  There's two new articles up on Infowars.com.
[02:08:28.849 --> 02:08:33.275]  Here's proof, is the headline from Kit Daniels.
[02:08:33.275 --> 02:08:36.299]  Here's proof Trump can win election against Hillary.
[02:08:36.299 --> 02:08:40.945]  Well, that's a great headline, but here's proof he is currently winning in the major polls.
[02:08:42.042 --> 02:08:48.665]  Well, they're going to claim he's a rapist with no evidence, and then Bill Clinton can be raping women and chopping their heads off, and the feminists would love it.
[02:08:48.665 --> 02:08:50.066]  I'm not kidding!
[02:08:50.066 --> 02:08:57.990]  You see guns being fired, burning, women being raped, people being beaten, people being killed, shot, blown up in Europe.
[02:08:57.990 --> 02:09:08.135]  Nightclubs attacked in Canada, police shot, killed, wounded, and they won't even say it's jihadists as they run up in Muslim garb screaming,
[02:09:09.784 --> 02:09:10.725]  Allah Akbar!
[02:09:10.725 --> 02:09:11.385]  Allah Akbar!
[02:09:11.385 --> 02:09:11.926]  Allah Akbar!
[02:09:11.926 --> 02:09:12.526]  Allah Akbar!
[02:09:12.526 --> 02:09:12.906]  Boom!
[02:09:12.906 --> 02:09:13.727]  Shoot the cop!
[02:09:13.727 --> 02:09:14.087]  Boom!
[02:09:14.087 --> 02:09:24.575]  I mean, I'm watching Fox News this morning and twice coming up, extremists are shooting police in America and it's a guy in a Muslim outfit shooting the cop.
[02:09:24.575 --> 02:09:32.120]  They won't even say it when he said he did it for ISIS!
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:35.663]  You gotta read way back in the paper, he did it for ISIS.
[02:09:35.663 --> 02:09:37.725]  And again, I'm not even against Muslims in general.
[02:09:38.646 --> 02:09:45.390]  They're bringing in radicals that are Wahhabists, that are told by their clerics to engage in jihad.
[02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:50.853]  They're not bringing in Shiites, they're not bringing in Christians out of Syria.
[02:09:50.853 --> 02:09:55.875]  And, I mean, CNN admits he's an Islamist and pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[02:09:55.875 --> 02:09:59.698]  Fox, maybe they've been doing it, but I saw Fox twice.
[02:09:59.698 --> 02:10:03.340]  And I heard local radio, which is Fox, saying extremist.
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:06.541]  It's like the Southern Poverty Law Center, where Obama runs them or something.
[02:10:06.541 --> 02:10:07.142]  It was crazy!
[02:10:07.992 --> 02:10:12.517]  I got really upset.
[02:10:12.517 --> 02:10:19.645]  But that's why Louis Farrakhan is coming out and saying, no, it's true.
[02:10:19.645 --> 02:10:23.029]  You go to these areas where the Muslims are all angry.
[02:10:23.029 --> 02:10:23.730]  You bring them in.
[02:10:23.730 --> 02:10:24.691]  They're going to attack.
[02:10:24.691 --> 02:10:27.414]  And then it's going to be blamed on everybody's going to lose their freedoms.
[02:10:27.414 --> 02:10:28.716]  I don't care whether you're a Muslim or not.
[02:10:30.421 --> 02:10:32.702]  So that story's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:32.702 --> 02:10:35.583]  It's with the new Kit Daniels article.
[02:10:35.583 --> 02:10:37.644]  You can see the Farrakhan video.
[02:10:37.644 --> 02:10:47.307]  And then there is another report that is a Steve Watson report that's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[02:10:47.307 --> 02:10:48.787]  Another Mark Dice video.
[02:10:48.787 --> 02:10:54.109]  Americans mindlessly follow orders, hand over personal details to a complete stranger.
[02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:55.630]  If you say it's for Obama,
[02:10:56.727 --> 02:11:01.149]  The key is you've got to say we want to put gun owners in slave camps.
[02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:03.049]  We want to kill them for Obama.
[02:11:03.049 --> 02:11:04.850]  That's the past videos.
[02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:07.711]  We want to ban water for Obama.
[02:11:07.711 --> 02:11:10.652]  We want to put Jews in ovens for Obama.
[02:11:10.652 --> 02:11:14.394]  These were real questions that were asked and these people are so whacked out.
[02:11:14.394 --> 02:11:15.234]  They speak good English.
[02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:21.836]  I mean they'll be like an old white professor type going, and we want to put the gun owners in the FEMA camp and take their guns and you know.
[02:11:21.836 --> 02:11:23.297]  He's like, you don't tell me buddy, I'm ready.
[02:11:24.161 --> 02:11:25.042]  The guy's on a power trip.
[02:11:25.042 --> 02:11:28.644]  Yeah, let's put some people in FEMA camps.
[02:11:28.644 --> 02:11:32.486]  Let's put them in forced labor camps.
[02:11:32.486 --> 02:11:34.687]  They're a cult.
[02:11:34.687 --> 02:11:40.431]  They're a cult of fruitcakes.
[02:11:40.431 --> 02:11:44.273]  But the good news is we've got governors like Abbott and others moving forward.
[02:11:44.273 --> 02:11:47.155]  I've never even supported a constitutional convention, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:48.979 --> 02:11:52.381]  I've never supported it because back then things weren't as bad.
[02:11:52.381 --> 02:12:01.688]  I mean, they're already butchering the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, outside of law, from opening the borders, launching wars, backing ISIS, shipping in illegals above the law.
[02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:18.432]  Coming after our guns outside of law and if you get a bunch of patriot governors saying we're going to come in and absolutely nix with new amendments everything you're doing to make it totally clear and shut down federal agencies.
[02:12:19.353 --> 02:12:20.975]  I mean, that's what we need.
[02:12:20.975 --> 02:12:22.796]  It's a new Declaration of Independence.
[02:12:22.796 --> 02:12:27.580]  And I said, have the states convene an emergency Declaration of Independence a few years ago.
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:29.282]  Drudge ran my analysis, my story.
[02:12:29.282 --> 02:12:32.044]  A lot of constitutional lawyers looked at it and said, that's the answer.
[02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:36.548]  Have the states basically pull out of the federal government, admitting it's been hijacked.
[02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:40.511]  And what Greg Abbott's saying, the governor, is basically that.
[02:12:40.511 --> 02:12:45.295]  The states pull out and basically say these agencies are rogue and basically dissolve their powers.
[02:12:47.762 --> 02:12:56.948]  I mean, we've got to get on the offense to the devastating takeovers that are just as radical on the other end as what Greg Abbott's doing.
[02:12:56.948 --> 02:13:00.710]  First Abbott says, come take our guns, we're not complying with these federal laws.
[02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:03.051]  Then he says, now we're moving with the states to block you.
[02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:04.672]  That's leadership.
[02:13:04.672 --> 02:13:11.496]  Oklahoma did that with 20-something states in 1994, and you know what Clinton did at Oklahoma City to blend the Patriots.
[02:13:11.496 --> 02:13:15.399]  But we've got alternative new media now, bigger than the establishment media in many cases.
[02:13:16.889 --> 02:13:22.193]  You add the Breitbarts, the World Net Dailies, the Drudges, the Infowars, the others together, it's much bigger.
[02:13:22.193 --> 02:13:27.697]  And then all the real leftist organizations that know what's going on, too, and know that Hillary's bad news.
[02:13:27.697 --> 02:13:32.120]  I mean, people aren't as disconnected as they used to be.
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:35.242]  They know something's wrong.
[02:13:35.242 --> 02:13:39.726]  So let's go to an excerpt of the big Louis Farrakhan interview coming out next week.
[02:13:41.072 --> 02:13:43.514]  Next Wednesday, throughout the week, I'm going to release more clips.
[02:14:00.544 --> 02:14:24.552]  groundbreaking piece as we try to make friends with the leader of one of the most militant organizations in modern history, militant speech, Louis Farrakhan, getting him from going, all white people are devils, and you can't reform a devil, so we should work together, all God's tribes, and stick up for our own group, but not be played off against each other, and I have changed.
[02:14:24.552 --> 02:14:26.473]  It's kind of like Malcolm X changed, I guess.
[02:14:27.173 --> 02:14:28.354]  Could be the transformation.
[02:14:28.354 --> 02:14:35.718]  I'm not trying to say that's what's happening, but it's exactly what I wanted, is detente, is diplomacy.
[02:14:35.718 --> 02:14:40.901]  Because, I mean, I don't want black people dying from fluoride in the water and being killed in the womb or anybody else.
[02:14:40.901 --> 02:14:43.903]  I mean, I really do care about people.
[02:14:43.903 --> 02:14:46.224]  I really don't want to play the race game.
[02:14:46.224 --> 02:14:52.628]  But it doesn't mean a big group of racist Hispanics, blacks, whatever, attacking because I'm white doesn't mean I have to stand up against their racism.
[02:14:52.628 --> 02:14:54.709]  But I don't hate them because of what group they're in.
[02:14:55.882 --> 02:15:09.831]  Just like when I've been working in East Texas and actually had people walk over in a Dairy Queen, this happened at a public pool when I was younger as well, and say, we're with the Ku Klux Klan, you're a Yankee, you need to get out of here.
[02:15:09.831 --> 02:15:13.493]  And they were really mad both times because
[02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:22.403]  When I was 13, I had already asked out the local beauty queen, even though I was just down there for the summer.
[02:15:22.403 --> 02:15:27.664]  I went over to her ranch and asked her out, and her parents drove us over to the Teague pool.
[02:15:27.664 --> 02:15:37.187]  I'm at the Teague, Texas pool, 20 miles away to go to a city pool, and some of the buck-toothed white trash came over, and we're like, get out of here, Yankee, because I was there with the beauty queen.
[02:15:37.187 --> 02:15:39.428]  Another time, a few years later, I was down there working on a ranch.
[02:15:40.399 --> 02:15:45.083]  And took a good-looking girl to Dairy Queen and had the same type of guys come in and go, who are you?
[02:15:45.083 --> 02:15:49.087]  I said, listen, there's three of you, I'll take you out in the street and stomp your asses on the ground.
[02:15:49.087 --> 02:15:52.309]  And I got up and I said, my family founded this county.
[02:15:52.309 --> 02:15:54.451]  I said, I bet you come from carpetbaggers.
[02:15:54.451 --> 02:15:56.573]  Now, you go get your truck before I knock your teeth in.
[02:15:56.573 --> 02:16:01.597]  Excuse me, I don't mean to flashback to that, but let's go ahead and go to the Louis Farrakhan piece.
[02:16:01.597 --> 02:16:01.918]  Here it is.
[02:16:18.177 --> 02:16:23.341]  I've interviewed a lot of people, and I've snuck in places like Bohemian Grove.
[02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:27.123]  I've been attacked at political demonstrations, been arrested many times.
[02:16:27.123 --> 02:16:35.829]  But I gotta say, this is probably the most surreal drive I've ever made to go meet someone that I'm gonna be interviewing.
[02:16:35.829 --> 02:16:36.810]  Louis Farrakhan.
[02:16:54.325 --> 02:17:01.264]  Our government has gone into nations with money from our Congress.
[02:17:02.250 --> 02:17:11.480]  to stimulate the dissatisfied and then arm them against a government that is their government.
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:14.663]  That's what America did in Libya.
[02:17:14.663 --> 02:17:17.907]  That's what they're doing in Syria.
[02:17:17.907 --> 02:17:24.113]  And the blowback now is they have created a refugee
[02:17:25.094 --> 02:17:31.439]  Crisis that is destabilizing the countries in Europe.
[02:17:31.439 --> 02:17:42.948]  So when Mr. Trump said, we can't allow these Muslims refugees into America.
[02:17:42.948 --> 02:17:46.631]  Now, a lot of people were upset with him.
[02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:54.237]  But I know, sir, that the hatred for America in the Muslim world
[02:17:55.251 --> 02:18:04.977]  Is building, as we told Mr. Bush, no Muslim leader could call for Jihad and have it stick.
[02:18:04.977 --> 02:18:11.501]  No Muslim leader had the power to unite the whole Muslim world.
[02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:20.026]  I said, but America's policies will unite those people against the West, and it is happening.
[02:18:20.026 --> 02:18:23.268]  So in this way, Mr. Trump, I think,
[02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:39.456]  Is wise to vet anyone coming from that area into America because the hatred for America is in the streets now.
[02:18:39.456 --> 02:18:49.180]  So if those people are refugees and America feels I gotta let 10,000 of them in because America created the problem.
[02:18:50.103 --> 02:19:00.003]  Now, if you let them in and you don't vet them carefully, you might be letting in your own destruction.
[02:19:00.003 --> 02:19:01.566]  When we dialogue...
[02:19:02.264 --> 02:19:02.884]  We're good to go.
[02:19:25.433 --> 02:19:26.994]  The heck with that.
[02:19:26.994 --> 02:19:29.695]  I'll tell you what's on my mind.
[02:19:29.695 --> 02:19:36.959]  And that is freeing a lot of people that like what he is doing.
[02:19:36.959 --> 02:19:51.488]  So the politicians today, I looked at the many Republicans and Democrats that are trying to win the nomination of their party.
[02:19:51.488 --> 02:19:53.889]  And it says to me, you know, it's like a
[02:19:55.226 --> 02:20:13.344]  I don't want to be vulgar, but it's like you, in any major city, you see women undressed, showing their wares for a john to buy them.
[02:20:13.344 --> 02:20:19.450]  And it's like politicians who don't have money, but have ideas.
[02:20:20.939 --> 02:20:36.134]  And they parade themselves before rich and powerful people to get money apparently for their ideas that the rich agree with.
[02:20:36.134 --> 02:20:45.503]  But the moment that they become what they're looking to become, they find that the rich have an agenda for them.
[02:20:46.496 --> 02:20:54.147]  That the rich have something to ask of them like the John asks of the prostitute.
[02:20:54.147 --> 02:21:03.600]  And that's one of the things that I admire about Mr. Trump because he told them all, I don't want your money.
[02:21:05.327 --> 02:21:20.507]  And when a politician does not want money from the rich, he's freer than the others to really do good for the masses of the people.
[02:21:20.507 --> 02:21:22.129]  And I think that today
[02:21:23.209 --> 02:21:29.914]  We're in the midst of the darkest hour in American history.
[02:21:29.914 --> 02:21:44.925]  And so if we don't make the right move with the right people at the right time, the America that we know, we're not going to see it become great again.
[02:21:49.890 --> 02:21:57.037]  Next Wednesday we will air the full interview that's really over an hour and a half long, we estimate it will end up being.
[02:21:57.037 --> 02:22:02.662]  You can see that first excerpt at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:22:02.662 --> 02:22:06.706]  I talked to Mr. Stone off air, I meant to get to it on air, but we ran out of time.
[02:22:06.706 --> 02:22:11.471]  One of the top Trump advisors, pretty much is the top advisor, I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:22:11.471 --> 02:22:14.654]  The shadow advisor, he's no longer in the campaign, has more freedom that way.
[02:22:17.449 --> 02:22:20.930]  And he said, no, I think it's good that Farrakhan has come out.
[02:22:20.930 --> 02:22:31.612]  He goes, this is exactly what we're seeing with internal polling and external polling that blacks in droves, other people just want jobs, want a future, want prosperity for themselves and their children.
[02:22:31.612 --> 02:22:33.852]  People are just people.
[02:22:33.852 --> 02:22:44.494]  And, you know, I told the story about many times about running into racist black people growing up in Dallas, Texas, who would attack you because you were white.
[02:22:44.494 --> 02:22:47.015]  If you were walking down the side of the road, they might just, but you know what?
[02:22:48.737 --> 02:22:53.722]  I grew up in a gang mentality, not myself, but it happened in that area of Dallas and then East Texas.
[02:22:53.722 --> 02:22:55.603]  I haven't really found that in Central Texas.
[02:22:55.603 --> 02:22:56.905]  Those would become really big.
[02:22:56.905 --> 02:22:58.166]  Some of it's coming back.
[02:22:58.166 --> 02:23:03.651]  Where if you looked at somebody wrong, they'd jump out a red light and want to fight you.
[02:23:03.651 --> 02:23:06.193]  I don't care if they were Hispanic, black, white, what the case was.
[02:23:06.193 --> 02:23:08.695]  I don't know if it was something in the water in the 80s and 90s.
[02:23:08.695 --> 02:23:12.459]  I know leaded gas was being taken out there and they estimate murder rates going down a lot.
[02:23:12.459 --> 02:23:14.481]  Just because they've taken lead out, it makes you very violent.
[02:23:17.765 --> 02:23:22.826]  I mean, I was aggressive, I got in a lot of star fights, but I mean, it was knock-down drag-out.
[02:23:22.826 --> 02:23:27.627]  I mean, you'd have huge fights in the high school, and if nobody got sent to the hospital, they wouldn't call the cops.
[02:23:27.627 --> 02:23:33.528]  But you'd have fights in the locker room where noses got broken.
[02:23:33.528 --> 02:23:36.868]  And then the coaches would say, alright, break it up, you wimps, you know.
[02:23:36.868 --> 02:23:39.109]  Go run around the... Who started it?
[02:23:39.109 --> 02:23:44.090]  You know, go run five miles around the stadium until you throw up.
[02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:45.750]  Nowadays, they call the police and arrest you, so...
[02:23:46.792 --> 02:24:01.249]  I kind of glad that I did grow up in a rough culture, but then at the same time I see my children, they're so sheltered that that's a problem on its own.
[02:24:01.249 --> 02:24:03.412]  But I could imagine being
[02:24:05.148 --> 02:24:09.851]  Being black, and then everywhere you go, a certain percentage of people treat you bad.
[02:24:09.851 --> 02:24:14.395]  You can't go in certain stores, you can't go in certain restaurants, you can't go in certain bathrooms.
[02:24:14.395 --> 02:24:17.056]  I would be really aggressive and angry and mean.
[02:24:17.056 --> 02:24:22.340]  I mean, I guarantee you, I would act like Malcolm X. I mean, it's just a guarantee.
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:26.003]  It'd be, I got guns, you're not pushing me around, and then of course folks would come for you.
[02:24:28.882 --> 02:24:32.343]  But the truth is people like to arrange themselves into groups.
[02:24:32.343 --> 02:24:34.384]  They love to peck at each other.
[02:24:34.384 --> 02:24:46.048]  People go join fancy country clubs so they can be in pecking orders and act like Thurston Howell III from Gilligan's Island.
[02:24:46.048 --> 02:24:46.908]  That's just what they do.
[02:24:46.908 --> 02:24:50.609]  That's why I've told the story repeatedly.
[02:24:50.609 --> 02:24:51.970]  There's even another Klan story.
[02:24:53.186 --> 02:24:54.726]  There's a lot of Klan in East Texas.
[02:24:54.726 --> 02:24:59.207]  It's a minority of people and it's usually trashy folks that want to just go around threatening people.
[02:24:59.207 --> 02:25:06.809]  There's not a lot of black folks around, or if there are, you know, they keep their head down and they just really mess with white people all day.
[02:25:06.809 --> 02:25:11.711]  And in business, in life, you know, the Masons aren't bad, but they can become cliques too.
[02:25:11.711 --> 02:25:15.271]  You know, the point I'm getting at is anything can become a clique.
[02:25:15.271 --> 02:25:19.893]  And I've had Mexican gangs, black gangs, white gangs mess with me.
[02:25:22.544 --> 02:25:28.408]  I definitely had more fights with black gangs and racist black people than the other groups combined.
[02:25:28.408 --> 02:25:33.672]  Because Dallas black folks, the ones that were racist, had a real big chip on their shoulder.
[02:25:33.672 --> 02:25:41.338]  And all I can say is I'm not like these yuppies and people that just lay down on the ground when somebody starts attacking them.
[02:25:43.797 --> 02:25:50.100]  And that's why a lot of the racist groups that go out and prey on white people, they go out and pick hippies and trendies because they know they're going to lay down and not fight back.
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:55.623]  Folks don't mess with, you know, a white guy with a cowboy hat and a Ford truck or a Chevy truck because they know there's a gun in there.
[02:25:55.623 --> 02:26:01.806]  And I think that's just the answer to society, is people be armed so nobody can be picked on by gangs and different criminal groups.
[02:26:02.907 --> 02:26:05.769]  I've had a lot of folks that are friends that love motorcycles.
[02:26:05.769 --> 02:26:07.190]  I've ridden motorcycles.
[02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:13.353]  But you can get around a rally or something and run into some seedy folks that will start a fight with you when there's 15 of them on their motorcycles.
[02:26:13.353 --> 02:26:19.037]  You're standing there with your wife and kids, and you can't believe they're talking smack to you, thinking you're going to back down.
[02:26:19.037 --> 02:26:21.278]  And then you don't back down because there's 15 of them.
[02:26:21.278 --> 02:26:23.239]  You back down because your kids are there.
[02:26:23.239 --> 02:26:26.421]  It's actually very exciting to have 15 people start a fight with you.
[02:26:26.421 --> 02:26:28.883]  That just makes me feel like King Kong, man.
[02:26:29.761 --> 02:26:33.805]  I don't even wake up until something like that happens, and then it's, you know, flip the switch.
[02:26:33.805 --> 02:26:37.008]  I mean, it is just like caveman time.
[02:26:37.008 --> 02:26:38.469]  Higher than a kite.
[02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:42.633]  The minute overwhelming groups threaten me, I just like turn into an animal.
[02:26:42.633 --> 02:26:46.557]  But we're losing that, and I'm so glad that I'm primal.
[02:26:46.557 --> 02:26:48.879]  I'm not talking about Alex Jones here, but it's my personal experience.
[02:26:49.918 --> 02:27:11.904]  So many of our problems in culture now are because we're domesticated, we're stupid, we don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line, we don't know how to grow a garden, we don't know how to roof a house, we don't know how to unplug a toilet, we don't know how to clean a stove, we don't know how to cook good food, we don't know how to brew our own beer, we don't know how to grow our own tobacco, we don't know how to fix our car, we just know how to play on smartphones and act tough all day.
[02:27:11.904 --> 02:27:14.345]  I don't care what color you are, we're losing our humanity.
[02:27:17.554 --> 02:27:25.961]  And I realize in business and life and all my success is because I'm primal and I'm an animal.
[02:27:25.961 --> 02:27:27.402]  It doesn't make me dumb.
[02:27:27.402 --> 02:27:29.684]  It makes me stronger.
[02:27:29.684 --> 02:27:36.169]  That I'll actually be driving home and think about something or somebody attacking me and actually bare my teeth driving down the road, not showing off anybody.
[02:27:36.169 --> 02:27:37.790]  I'll actually go, Oh, I'm burying my teeth.
[02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:40.733]  I need to thank God.
[02:27:40.733 --> 02:27:41.994]  I'm still primitive.
[02:27:41.994 --> 02:27:43.335]  Primitive is when we were better.
[02:27:45.325 --> 02:27:52.627]  All these great advances are great to a certain extent, but I liken it to you going on a Mars mission.
[02:27:52.627 --> 02:27:59.949]  Takes a year and a half, two years, depending on which type of system they use when they launch, because it's a different aspect, proximity to the Earth.
[02:27:59.949 --> 02:28:02.210]  I digress.
[02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:06.171]  Even an Olympic athlete, when they get there, is going to have trouble walking, even in the limited gravity.
[02:28:06.171 --> 02:28:10.232]  What is it, like two-thirds or whatever?
[02:28:10.232 --> 02:28:11.172]  And your heart rots.
[02:28:11.172 --> 02:28:13.533]  I mean, you age 20 years, spending a couple
[02:28:14.721 --> 02:28:17.223]  You know, years in space.
[02:28:17.223 --> 02:28:20.405]  Even if you work out hours a day.
[02:28:20.405 --> 02:28:21.426]  If you don't have gravity.
[02:28:21.426 --> 02:28:22.366]  And that's what it is.
[02:28:22.366 --> 02:28:25.849]  Not having to fight big bears, other tribes and people.
[02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:28.231]  Not having to actually go out and get the food ourselves.
[02:28:28.231 --> 02:28:29.511]  Not having to haul water.
[02:28:29.511 --> 02:28:36.296]  Not having to figure out what plants can save your children when they're sick or your kids are going to die.
[02:28:36.296 --> 02:28:41.180]  Not having that apothecary, that ancient knowledge.
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:44.122]  Not being in those positions has made us incredibly weak.
[02:28:45.208 --> 02:28:54.336]  And it's a fate worse than hell to see all these empty, unhappy people, whether they're driving a junker car or a brand new Mercedes and living in a mansion or living in a shack.
[02:28:54.336 --> 02:28:57.938]  They are so unhappy.
[02:28:57.938 --> 02:29:01.862]  You give wealthy kids piles of toys for Christmas, they don't even open them.
[02:29:01.862 --> 02:29:09.508]  You go to Africa or Latin America or some poor place in Eastern Europe and you give a kid a balsa wood airplane, they'll play with that for a week till it breaks into a hundred pieces.
[02:29:09.508 --> 02:29:12.951]  They'll glue it back together and their eyes will glow with enjoyment.
[02:29:14.969 --> 02:29:18.970]  I've been there, I've seen it, I've watched the videos, they still are human.
[02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:23.491]  And it's because they didn't grow up in this dead culture.
[02:29:23.491 --> 02:29:32.633]  It's not just that media and civilization is soft, it's that there's an evil message being transmitted through the softness that really brings us down.
[02:29:32.633 --> 02:29:35.713]  Speaking of that, we're going to look at these brainwashed victims signing away their rights.
[02:29:35.713 --> 02:29:38.374]  DrudgeReport.com is the link to the video.
[02:29:38.374 --> 02:29:39.914]  It's another Mark Dice video.
[02:29:39.914 --> 02:29:42.415]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:42.415 --> 02:29:44.435]  Please spread the word, the enemy hates this show.
[02:29:47.873 --> 02:29:49.274]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.274 --> 02:29:50.536]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.536 --> 02:29:51.897]  And they hate it when you spread the word.
[02:29:51.897 --> 02:29:54.481]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.065 --> 02:30:03.389]  It's Monday, January 11th, and here's a breakdown of the news that broke over the weekend.
[02:30:03.389 --> 02:30:09.894]  Supply-side economist Arthur Laffer is predicting Republicans will win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee.
[02:30:09.894 --> 02:30:16.299]  He said, quote, I won't be surprised if the Republicans don't take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50.
[02:30:16.299 --> 02:30:23.105]  Also, Sean Penn is now under investigation for secretly meeting Mexican cartel leader El Chapo deep in the jungle back in October.
[02:30:23.285 --> 02:30:30.967]  The Hollywood actor known for his anti-gun rhetoric unwittingly led Mexican Marines to the drug kingpin after meeting him to discuss a potential movie.
[02:30:30.967 --> 02:30:38.669]  Thousands of people on Twitter have since blasted Penn for meeting El Chapo while Mexican authorities were conducting an exhaustive search for the cartel leader.
[02:30:38.669 --> 02:30:44.490]  And across the world, Catalan separatists are putting pressure on Madrid to allow Catalonia to break off from Spain.
[02:30:44.490 --> 02:30:48.091]  Catalonia's pro-independence parties agreed on Saturday on a new leader.
[02:30:48.271 --> 02:30:53.435]  Clearing the way for the creation of a regional government for the historic region located in eastern Spain.
[02:30:53.435 --> 02:30:55.876]  Visit InfoWars.com for the latest news.

[02:33:13.364 --> 02:33:20.387]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.387 --> 02:33:25.569]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and I want to just tell all the viewers, all the listeners,
[02:33:26.821 --> 02:33:29.224]  You've got one week left.
[02:33:29.224 --> 02:33:32.168]  This special will end next Monday.
[02:33:32.168 --> 02:33:36.673]  So this special starts on the 11th and runs through to next Monday.
[02:33:36.673 --> 02:33:37.695]  It's over then.
[02:33:38.868 --> 02:33:50.434]  Well, to be specifically clear, what I'm getting at is it actually started back in December, but it's running through and that is next Monday, six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:50.434 --> 02:33:51.555]  There you go.
[02:33:51.555 --> 02:33:54.476]  Nightly News and all the rest of it.
[02:33:54.476 --> 02:33:59.859]  Now, I want to go ahead and go to this next video that I have been mentioning.
[02:34:01.806 --> 02:34:04.669]  And we can actually show folks right over my shoulder here, thank you.
[02:34:04.669 --> 02:34:13.537]  The article, video, Americans mindlessly follow orders, hand over personal details to a complete stranger.
[02:34:13.537 --> 02:34:24.486]  Nervously handling a football, one guy immediately and without question gave Mark Dice all his personal information, even spelled out his address for him.
[02:34:24.486 --> 02:34:27.689]  The guy only questioned Dice when he asked for his social security number.
[02:34:28.618 --> 02:34:31.361]  And a whole bunch of people do this without even saying for Obama.
[02:34:31.361 --> 02:34:35.644]  You just say we're going to put all the gun owners in forced labor camps, take their guns, and they agree.
[02:34:35.644 --> 02:34:37.987]  If it's for Obama, because you want to be politically correct.
[02:34:37.987 --> 02:34:39.908]  And this is what the TSA is all about.
[02:34:39.908 --> 02:34:41.670]  Not about keeping you safe.
[02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:48.796]  It is about training you to submit while the borders are wide open, while they ship people in on airplanes, and don't even look at their
[02:34:49.437 --> 02:34:52.040]  Passports or visas when they come in.
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:53.721]  I mean, that's New York Daily News.
[02:34:53.721 --> 02:34:55.243]  That happens every day.
[02:34:55.243 --> 02:34:56.964]  They don't even hardly report on it now.
[02:34:56.964 --> 02:34:58.826]  We're totally wide open, which is fine.
[02:34:58.826 --> 02:34:59.627]  Be wide open.
[02:34:59.627 --> 02:35:00.988]  Don't grope my genitals.
[02:35:00.988 --> 02:35:03.310]  Don't put me in a naked body scanner.
[02:35:03.310 --> 02:35:05.712]  Don't put me in a hamburger heater.
[02:35:05.712 --> 02:35:10.257]  I mean, it's just, it's the point is, it's a fraud.
[02:35:10.257 --> 02:35:10.917]  It's a joke.
[02:35:10.917 --> 02:35:14.301]  Don't spy on me saying there are terrorists everywhere when you're bringing them in.
[02:35:15.199 --> 02:35:20.820]  And then you talk to these Californians or these Austinites, who aren't really Austinites, you gotta go to a liberal area.
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:24.381]  I mean, I was here at MSNBC how educated and smart liberals are.
[02:35:24.381 --> 02:35:29.662]  You mean two, three degrees that are worthless?
[02:35:29.662 --> 02:35:35.543]  And they say they're so intellectual, and then they're the dumbest people I've ever seen.
[02:35:35.543 --> 02:35:38.324]  Oh, I've got a chemical engineering degree, they said to McAdoo.
[02:35:38.324 --> 02:35:40.484]  You bet I want a Bandai hydrogen monoxide.
[02:35:40.484 --> 02:35:42.305]  And she goes, it's water.
[02:35:42.305 --> 02:35:42.985]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:35:45.162 --> 02:35:47.925]  We have that on video.
[02:35:47.925 --> 02:35:50.348]  I went to Cornell with a chemist degree.
[02:35:50.348 --> 02:35:51.770]  You know, I want to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:52.510]  She goes, are you joking?
[02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:53.271]  No, I agree.
[02:35:53.271 --> 02:35:54.793]  It's for the earth.
[02:35:54.793 --> 02:36:01.621]  They will do anything as long as they think it's trendy.
[02:36:01.621 --> 02:36:03.103]  So let's go ahead and go to this report.
[02:36:03.103 --> 02:36:04.945]  The video is on Infowars.com.
[02:36:06.584 --> 02:36:24.248]  Just to demonstrate how most people will mindlessly follow orders, I'm going to approach random people and tell them to give me personal information and start writing it down on this clipboard without telling them why, who I am, or even what it's for, to see if they will mindlessly follow a direct order.
[02:36:24.248 --> 02:36:25.288]  What's your name, bro?
[02:36:25.288 --> 02:36:25.828]  What's happening?
[02:36:25.828 --> 02:36:26.188]  What's your name?
[02:36:26.188 --> 02:36:27.229]  What's up?
[02:36:27.229 --> 02:36:29.989]  What's your name?
[02:36:29.989 --> 02:36:32.790]  Last name.
[02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:33.330]  What's your birthdate?
[02:36:38.268 --> 02:36:41.809]  Who do you bank with?
[02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:45.270]  What city do you live in?
[02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:47.710]  What street do you live on?
[02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:55.292]  This is all beeped out.
[02:36:55.292 --> 02:36:56.752]  He even spells it for me.
[02:36:56.752 --> 02:37:00.213]  What's the street address?
[02:37:00.213 --> 02:37:02.654]  And then unit number...
[02:37:05.453 --> 02:37:07.174]  What's your social security number?
[02:37:07.174 --> 02:37:08.394]  Now let me explain what this is all about.
[02:37:08.394 --> 02:37:12.055]  I know most of you know this, but really crystallize this for me.
[02:37:12.055 --> 02:37:15.996]  I'm just getting some data just to help out with some programs.
[02:37:15.996 --> 02:37:16.797]  Hit pause for a minute.
[02:37:16.797 --> 02:37:21.078]  So he's telling them it's basically a program, not that it's government, not that it isn't.
[02:37:21.078 --> 02:37:33.622]  And under the Pavlovian German psychological warfare system of the Prussians, adopted by the British and the US, they adopted most of our tyranny, eugenics-wise, we adopted the Prussian
[02:37:35.902 --> 02:37:44.485]  And also some of the other counties in Germania and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, some of their systems of mind control.
[02:37:44.485 --> 02:37:54.748]  You wonder why Germans are so subservient, will follow orders so much, will work so hard, won't cheat, all the rest of it, but then will follow orders to line up little kids and blow their heads off.
[02:37:54.748 --> 02:37:57.909]  That was back in World War II.
[02:37:57.909 --> 02:38:01.470]  Germany had very low crime rates, what you'd call very moral people like the Japanese.
[02:38:02.418 --> 02:38:09.442]  The Japanese, too, though, will follow orders because it's cultural programming under imperial systems of slavery.
[02:38:09.442 --> 02:38:15.685]  Keshen war slaves wore big, nice black boots, big blue uniforms.
[02:38:15.685 --> 02:38:24.150]  They were proud of themselves, and they would go and train from age 5 until about age 20 to be shop trips, some of the best trips in the world.
[02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:26.591]  And then they were sent around as property.
[02:38:26.591 --> 02:38:27.632]  You had to buy them.
[02:38:29.397 --> 02:38:35.480]  And of course the British King brought in a whole bunch of large divisions of Hessian troops.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:44.785]  But when they saw America and the freedom, and how many Germans were already here saying, don't be an idiot, come over here, they had the huge defections.
[02:38:44.785 --> 02:38:50.067]  Something that never happened before that.
[02:38:50.067 --> 02:38:54.910]  And so the British by the end pulled the German mercs out.
[02:38:56.431 --> 02:39:07.238]  Now, most Germans were free-born and weren't part of that, but certain areas of Germany, their main export was war slaves.
[02:39:08.311 --> 02:39:09.291]  Property of the state.
[02:39:09.291 --> 02:39:18.913]  Now, you don't hear Germans today that, you know, come from a Keshen background going, oh, poor me, you know, my ancestors were a slave, because they don't even really know it or care.
[02:39:18.913 --> 02:39:24.734]  But you can argue, well, black folks stand out, so that's why there's that stigma and that background, you know, at least in their minds.
[02:39:24.734 --> 02:39:25.334]  So I get it.
[02:39:25.334 --> 02:39:27.234]  I mean, it's obviously a lot worse.
[02:39:27.234 --> 02:39:30.375]  It's just that a lot of Germans didn't get their freedom until the 1880s.
[02:39:30.375 --> 02:39:32.895]  I just thought I'd digress and go to that.
[02:39:32.895 --> 02:39:34.796]  So the Germans had the first psychology.
[02:39:34.796 --> 02:39:35.976]  It was basically invented over there.
[02:39:36.636 --> 02:39:41.797]  And it was funded by the King of Prussia and others to create brainwashing.
[02:39:41.797 --> 02:39:44.218]  Mind war is what the Germans call it.
[02:39:44.218 --> 02:39:45.919]  Mind war in German.
[02:39:45.919 --> 02:39:49.340]  I forget what it translates to.
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.240]  Krieg is war.
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.261]  What is mind in Deutsch?
[02:39:54.261 --> 02:39:54.741]  Let's look it up.
[02:39:54.741 --> 02:39:55.921]  What is mind in Deutsch?
[02:39:55.921 --> 02:39:56.381]  But it's mind Krieg.
[02:39:59.011 --> 02:40:17.457]  And so they deployed that in the last hundred years, where before they taught classical education, falling in love with literature, mathematics, invention, why it was cool, the easiest way to learn something, get a base of knowledge and accelerate from there, where the United States had the most educated people in the world by about 1850.
[02:40:17.457 --> 02:40:17.898]  Verstand Krieg.
[02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:27.817]  Verstand Krieg.
[02:40:27.817 --> 02:40:31.781]  So they launched Verstand Krieg really more than 200 years ago.
[02:40:31.781 --> 02:40:41.849]  Psychology was developed to create brainwashed killer soldiers who would follow orders and do whatever they were told.
[02:40:41.849 --> 02:40:47.034]  And they would do tasks well, but would do whatever they were told by an authority figure.
[02:40:47.034 --> 02:40:53.900]  Which is great because it's funny, the Romans over 800 years could never keep Germany conquered.
[02:40:54.656 --> 02:41:04.966]  They were the most rebellious, beat the Romans the most times, sacked Rome repeatedly, took it over, finally ended it.
[02:41:04.966 --> 02:41:11.333]  Then the Muslims ended what was left of the Roman Empire at Constantinople with the sacking and Armada takeover.
[02:41:11.333 --> 02:41:13.955]  But again, I'm digressing here.
[02:41:13.955 --> 02:41:16.438]  The reason I got to this, when you see these young men,
[02:41:21.118 --> 02:41:33.045]  If someone younger than them or goofy looking with a hat on sideways told them, give me your social security number, give me your info, they would say, I'm going to beat you up and get all outraged.
[02:41:33.045 --> 02:41:40.309]  But because Dice is 6'4", looks like a cop and is talking to him like a cop with authority,
[02:41:42.031 --> 02:41:44.033]  He does whatever he's told.
[02:41:44.033 --> 02:41:58.146]  Now, we're not in a war with the police themselves, but we're in a war with the globalists that have hijacked the government, and through those conduits, through the driveshaft, down to the ground, want to turn the police into their enforcers, and want us to have a fight with the police.
[02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:02.190]  But that could then turn them against us even more and vice versa.
[02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:05.391]  But that doesn't mean then we submit to unlawful orders.
[02:42:05.391 --> 02:42:11.753]  They've got a bill and they're readying it in Arizona to ban filming police even in your own property.
[02:42:11.753 --> 02:42:15.715]  That is the essence of hardcore tyranny and the destruction of the First Amendment.
[02:42:15.715 --> 02:42:18.456]  It's like this whole Sean Stone thing.
[02:42:18.456 --> 02:42:19.336]  I've got clips of this.
[02:42:19.336 --> 02:42:20.817]  They're saying arrest him.
[02:42:20.817 --> 02:42:21.517]  He's a traitor.
[02:42:21.517 --> 02:42:23.978]  He's the worst person on earth.
[02:42:23.978 --> 02:42:25.638]  I've met Sean Penn repeatedly.
[02:42:25.638 --> 02:42:27.259]  I've talked to Sean Penn repeatedly.
[02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:36.398]  I have been at dinner with Sean Penn, there's probably 20 people there, but I talked to him and the first time I thought maybe he's stoned or drunk.
[02:42:36.398 --> 02:42:36.958]  No, he wasn't.
[02:42:36.958 --> 02:42:37.699]  He didn't even drink.
[02:42:37.699 --> 02:42:39.581]  He's like a health guy now.
[02:42:39.581 --> 02:42:42.183]  The next time I met him, I thought, okay, he is stupid.
[02:42:42.183 --> 02:42:44.024]  Then I heard, oh no, he's real dumb.
[02:42:44.024 --> 02:42:45.566]  I'm not being mean, it's just true.
[02:42:45.566 --> 02:42:47.948]  Then I ran into him again, arrogant and dumb.
[02:42:49.944 --> 02:42:51.485]  But very self-important.
[02:42:51.485 --> 02:43:10.158]  Now, let me say, he's self-important, he's anti-gun, he's an idiot, used by the Clintons and others to raise money down there, you know, in Haiti, but he really does mean well, and he really does care about black people, and is a huge bleeding heart, and really does believe in communism, and is the real deal.
[02:43:10.158 --> 02:43:14.541]  He's a real moron, but he is also a bleeding heart good guy.
[02:43:14.541 --> 02:43:15.502]  Sean Penn is a nice guy.
[02:43:17.256 --> 02:43:20.337]  But people think that's a cool look on his face when he looks like he doesn't care?
[02:43:20.337 --> 02:43:22.057]  He's stupid, okay?
[02:43:22.057 --> 02:43:29.519]  I don't know what he's done to his brain, but he's dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:43:29.519 --> 02:43:32.520]  He's dumber than a Democrat convention floor.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:35.321]  And then he meets with this arch-criminal El Chapo.
[02:43:35.321 --> 02:43:39.002]  The journalists are allowed to meet with criminals as long as they don't aid and abet them.
[02:43:39.867 --> 02:43:45.994]  As long as you don't tell El Chapo any intel on how they're planning to capture him, he was told.
[02:43:45.994 --> 02:43:48.217]  Journalists are allowed to fly into Germany.
[02:43:48.217 --> 02:43:53.763]  If you can get into Germany and interview Hitler, you should be allowed to.
[02:43:53.763 --> 02:43:57.388]  Charlie Manson, if you can interview him before he got caught, that's your issue.
[02:43:59.622 --> 02:44:02.863]  But I think they told Penn, and I'm going to say what I think happened here.
[02:44:02.863 --> 02:44:08.745]  As soon as I heard this, I said, Penn led them to El Chapo in the little coastal city.
[02:44:08.745 --> 02:44:19.988]  Within two days, they admit, oh, the Marines tracked him, the Mexican Marines, the Marinos, because Penn didn't hide his tracks properly.
[02:44:22.262 --> 02:44:36.433]  I can't prove this, but I bet money, because this wasn't supposed to come out until a little bit later, that they explained to Penn, hey, you know where he is, you have to tell us now, or you're aiding and abetting.
[02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:42.819]  That's why you'd want to meet El Chapo in another building and have him leave right after, and El Chapo would know that, that hey, I'm going to have to tell him where you're at after you leave.
[02:44:43.683 --> 02:44:47.065]  But I don't think Penn knew what he was getting into with this Mexican actress.
[02:44:47.065 --> 02:44:48.405]  I'm sure I know why he's hanging out with her.
[02:44:48.405 --> 02:44:49.226]  Who wouldn't?
[02:44:49.226 --> 02:44:51.487]  And, you know, why he's running around down there playing the part of superhero.
[02:44:51.487 --> 02:44:52.448]  Because that's what he wants to do.
[02:44:52.448 --> 02:44:56.830]  It's like when he went to Katrina in the rowboat, was trying to deliver food, and people came up and talked to him.
[02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:58.110]  He was so dumb, he couldn't talk.
[02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.971]  He was just like, ooh.
[02:44:58.971 --> 02:45:03.373]  I mean, he's kind of maybe quasi-autistic or something.
[02:45:03.373 --> 02:45:03.753]  I don't know.
[02:45:03.753 --> 02:45:06.275]  I mean, he acts like he's got about an ADHQ.
[02:45:06.275 --> 02:45:07.815]  I'm not harping on that.
[02:45:07.815 --> 02:45:09.336]  He means well, though.
[02:45:09.336 --> 02:45:10.457]  The brain of a child.
[02:45:10.457 --> 02:45:11.457]  The brain of a seven-year-old.
[02:45:14.673 --> 02:45:21.078]  So he shouldn't be charged, but I don't think they just tracked him down, Del Chapo.
[02:45:21.078 --> 02:45:30.985]  I think Sean Penn probably pooped his pants when he heard he was facing 20 years in prison for hitting in a bedding and told him, or his girlfriend did, or something like that.
[02:45:30.985 --> 02:45:31.765]  I can't prove it.
[02:45:31.765 --> 02:45:37.730]  All I'm saying is don't charge Sean Penn because not only is he a journalist and has a lot of cover for that,
[02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:42.413]  El Chapo and his cartel has been directly connected to the CIA.
[02:45:42.413 --> 02:45:54.062]  I showed the articles yesterday, El Paso Times, you name it, Chicago Tribune, and his number two deputy and others have been busted and bring out that they're actually CIA officers, not just assets, and are allowed to deal drugs.
[02:45:54.062 --> 02:45:57.344]  That's a known fact.
[02:45:57.344 --> 02:46:00.087]  So, should you go after El Chapo for murders?
[02:46:00.087 --> 02:46:00.887]  Absolutely.
[02:46:00.887 --> 02:46:04.870]  But you can't really go after him for drug dealing, because our government are the ones doing this.
[02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:06.051]  But, I've now gone 360 here.
[02:46:07.679 --> 02:46:16.243]  The point is, you want to see the social experiment of how submissive people are, how domesticated they are.
[02:46:16.243 --> 02:46:33.190]  I mean, when they want to grope me at the TSA, I can't help but go, you know the border's open, you know New York Daily News reported two weeks ago they fly people in and don't even check their passports or IDs under orders, you know the Border Patrol completes the smuggling process, and they go, sir, we're trying to do our job, please, please, are you going to comply or I'm not going to let you fly?
[02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:34.771]  And I go, listen, listen!
[02:46:35.973 --> 02:46:47.779]  If you had an APB out for a certain person and they had 10 cops lined up staring at everybody coming in this airport, because you thought some bad guy was coming through, I wouldn't care if my bags got searched every couple of years or something in an emergency.
[02:46:47.779 --> 02:46:52.661]  Or if there's a bank robber on the run and the cop sees he's on a certain highway, then that's when you have a checkpoint.
[02:46:52.661 --> 02:46:57.703]  You don't set up standard checkpoints all the time when the country's wide open and do this.
[02:46:57.703 --> 02:46:59.664]  It is to domesticate us.
[02:46:59.664 --> 02:47:01.625]  I mean, that happens all the time.
[02:47:01.625 --> 02:47:02.846]  That's what happens when I fly.
[02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:13.186]  If they get in my face, and I go, I do not disrespect you, I am not against you as a person, but this is unconstitutional and bull.
[02:47:13.186 --> 02:47:14.507]  They go, well, they don't fly.
[02:47:14.507 --> 02:47:17.689]  And I go, oh, it's going to be on the trains and the highways, and now it is.
[02:47:17.689 --> 02:47:20.951]  That's not true.
[02:47:20.951 --> 02:47:23.873]  You know they admit it's already in trains and the highways.
[02:47:23.873 --> 02:47:29.657]  They go, oh, well, I just, I, they lectured me for 30 minutes a few months ago about grape jelly.
[02:47:29.657 --> 02:47:30.778]  I just forgot and put it in my bag.
[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:33.720]  You know, that I bought at a farmer's market.
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:35.201]  They kept saying, you know, we could put you in jail for this.
[02:47:35.201 --> 02:47:37.241]  I said, just go ahead and do it then.
[02:47:37.241 --> 02:47:39.461]  I'm sick of this.
[02:47:39.461 --> 02:47:41.382]  Why were you trying to sneak it in, trying to incriminate me?
[02:47:41.382 --> 02:47:44.182]  I just said, I still thought I was in a free country.
[02:47:44.182 --> 02:47:50.584]  I didn't think about it when I put the other vegetables in my bag.
[02:47:50.584 --> 02:47:53.744]  Did these vegetables come from another country?
[02:47:53.744 --> 02:47:56.585]  I'm flying out of Omaha to Austin, Texas.
[02:47:56.585 --> 02:47:57.945]  You have my ticket.
[02:47:57.945 --> 02:47:59.906]  I just told you it's from the farmer's market.
[02:47:59.906 --> 02:48:01.626]  You can see it on the jelly label.
[02:48:03.001 --> 02:48:04.962]  I don't know why you're giving me a problem.
[02:48:04.962 --> 02:48:07.502]  I don't know why you're causing a... Sir, put your camera down.
[02:48:07.502 --> 02:48:08.423]  Sir, put your phone down.
[02:48:08.423 --> 02:48:11.263]  I start shooting video while they're taking photos.
[02:48:11.263 --> 02:48:13.224]  It's all dog training.
[02:48:13.224 --> 02:48:14.984]  It's all slave training.
[02:48:14.984 --> 02:48:18.685]  And this is the response to it.
[02:48:18.685 --> 02:48:19.606]  Idiots.
[02:48:19.606 --> 02:48:23.227]  To a random person who doesn't even say who they are or what they're with.
[02:48:23.227 --> 02:48:26.208]  Give me your... where you live, your name.
[02:48:26.208 --> 02:48:27.208]  Give me all your info.
[02:48:30.162 --> 02:48:34.488]  They've got all these scammers on phones that mainly call old people.
[02:48:34.488 --> 02:48:36.330]  They get lists of old people.
[02:48:36.330 --> 02:48:37.993]  And they call and they go, I need a donation.
[02:48:37.993 --> 02:48:38.373]  Give it to me.
[02:48:38.373 --> 02:48:39.054]  Give it to me, old lady.
[02:48:39.054 --> 02:48:39.435]  Give it to me.
[02:48:39.435 --> 02:48:42.479]  And they'll bully them and give them the money.
[02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:43.760]  We've been trained to be bullied.
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.182]  We've been trained to comply.
[02:48:45.182 --> 02:48:46.584]  We've been trained to regurgitate.
[02:48:47.369 --> 02:48:48.429]  We're not taught how to think.
[02:48:48.429 --> 02:48:50.650]  They call it critical thinking in public schools.
[02:48:50.650 --> 02:48:52.590]  The program is to end critical thinking.
[02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:53.871]  Make learning boring.
[02:48:53.871 --> 02:48:54.711]  Make it horrible.
[02:48:54.711 --> 02:48:55.491]  Make you give up.
[02:48:55.491 --> 02:48:57.032]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:48:57.032 --> 02:48:59.512]  5 plus 5 plus 5 doesn't equal 15.
[02:48:59.512 --> 02:49:02.373]  That's all officially in common core.
[02:49:02.373 --> 02:49:03.653]  Tell you how bad your country is.
[02:49:03.653 --> 02:49:04.934]  Tell you how bad you are.
[02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.514]  Demoralize you all day.
[02:49:06.514 --> 02:49:08.455]  Teach you how to be a basket case.
[02:49:08.455 --> 02:49:09.415]  Take all your jobs.
[02:49:11.277 --> 02:49:16.118]  Not let you exercise during physical education, bad mouth your parents.
[02:49:16.118 --> 02:49:19.659]  It's a giant re-education camp.
[02:49:19.659 --> 02:49:22.360]  And teach you how to bend over.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:27.301]  And cops and TSA, when you get people to bend over to their rights, you're screwing your own future.
[02:49:27.301 --> 02:49:29.261]  You're like, I know, but we're following orders.
[02:49:29.261 --> 02:49:32.902]  Well, we better all as a society, and you as a private citizen,
[02:49:33.749 --> 02:49:35.710]  Police will always say, well you should change that law.
[02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:37.131]  You know what, you're right.
[02:49:37.131 --> 02:49:43.875]  I am the person who's most responsible for letting this happen, and so are you as a private citizen!
[02:49:43.875 --> 02:49:48.277]  I can't believe they're trying to say you can't videotape police in Arizona, they're gonna arrest you.
[02:49:48.277 --> 02:49:53.380]  I mean, that is just, the police themselves should have more honor than that and should come out against it.
[02:49:53.380 --> 02:49:58.403]  But no, they're pushing for it, which is a mark on you and your family!
[02:49:58.403 --> 02:49:59.984]  As if it's gonna stop it anyways!
[02:50:01.633 --> 02:50:03.694]  The answer isn't don't cover it up.
[02:50:03.694 --> 02:50:05.835]  The answer is fix the problems.
[02:50:05.835 --> 02:50:11.917]  And then when you do have crises, people are going to forgive you.
[02:50:11.917 --> 02:50:13.198]  Let's go out to break with more of this.
[02:50:13.198 --> 02:50:16.279]  Mark Dice, here it is.
[02:50:16.279 --> 02:50:18.320]  We're good for you.
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:18.940]  I wouldn't either.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:19.160]  Thanks.
[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:19.620]  Thank you.
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:22.981]  He didn't even ask me who I was, what this was for, or anything.
[02:50:22.981 --> 02:50:24.522]  He just walked away.
[02:50:24.522 --> 02:50:25.803]  What's your name?
[02:50:25.803 --> 02:50:26.643]  Hold on one second.
[02:50:28.271 --> 02:50:29.973]  Last name.
[02:50:29.973 --> 02:50:30.813]  Last name.
[02:50:30.813 --> 02:50:32.014]  What is this for?
[02:50:32.014 --> 02:50:33.595]  It's a new program we're working on.
[02:50:33.595 --> 02:50:38.139]  What's your last name?
[02:50:38.139 --> 02:50:42.363]  What's your birthdate?
[02:50:42.363 --> 02:50:48.288]  Who do you bank with?
[02:50:48.288 --> 02:50:50.529]  What street do you live on?
[02:50:50.529 --> 02:50:52.931]  I live in... What's the street name?
[02:50:55.672 --> 02:50:57.700]  He's a salesman, that's why he's good at this.
[02:50:57.700 --> 02:50:58.262]  We'll be back.
[02:50:58.789 --> 02:51:04.010]  Do you have relatives and friends that are convinced there's no need ever to prepare for any kind of emergency?
[02:51:04.010 --> 02:51:06.970]  Are these also folks you buy Christmas presents for?

[02:53:01.506 --> 02:53:03.167]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[02:54:25.463 --> 02:54:29.086]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[02:54:29.086 --> 02:54:39.514]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and to be able to watch the nightly news, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films.
[02:54:40.805 --> 02:54:43.326]  E-books and so much more.
[02:54:43.326 --> 02:54:50.290]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[02:54:50.290 --> 02:55:08.841]  The username works for 20 people to be able to simultaneously log in with your PrisonPlanet.tv membership and you are funding the absolute very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[02:55:09.721 --> 02:55:15.685]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[02:55:15.685 --> 02:55:20.968]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:55:20.968 --> 02:55:27.372]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:55:27.372 --> 02:55:29.654]  And we ask folks to spread that link out to everybody.
[02:55:30.407 --> 02:55:54.268]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook and we put the videos on YouTube
[02:55:55.129 --> 02:56:02.111]  Just on Facebook and YouTube now, on our channels themselves, we can't count all the other stuff, it's too numerous.
[02:56:02.111 --> 02:56:04.371]  It's like stars in the sky.
[02:56:04.371 --> 02:56:15.293]  We're talking about 15 million views a week just on videos.
[02:56:15.293 --> 02:56:21.215]  So when I say we're up to 28 million viewers on listeners a week, that's even discounting some of those as being repeat viewers.
[02:56:21.215 --> 02:56:22.055]  We have an algorithm.
[02:56:23.456 --> 02:56:26.618]  You know, I could say, oh, we got 40 million people tuning in every week.
[02:56:26.618 --> 02:56:27.819]  It's more like 28 million.
[02:56:27.819 --> 02:56:29.820]  So a lot of them come back in over and over again.
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:32.983]  But most have only come through once or twice a week.
[02:56:32.983 --> 02:56:35.785]  It is you, the members,
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:53.045]  That are paying it forward politically for all those people that have never come by the truth, have never heard about the New World Order, never heard about globalism, never heard about cows and sheep and pigs growing humanoids in them for organ harvesting or baby organ harvesting.
[02:56:53.045 --> 02:56:57.826]  Stuff that sounds like science fiction, it's in the MIT newspaper today.
[02:56:57.826 --> 02:57:00.827]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[02:57:00.827 --> 02:57:01.828]  research farms.
[02:57:01.828 --> 02:57:02.908]  That means in the womb.
[02:57:04.687 --> 02:57:16.232]  We're not in Kansas anymore, and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters, and the bandwidth.
[02:57:17.469 --> 02:57:23.113]  You know how much it costs us every month to put out the podcast and to put out the video feed and all the rest of it?
[02:57:23.113 --> 02:57:26.876]  It is upwards of $50,000 in bandwidth.
[02:57:26.876 --> 02:57:33.181]  And that is you coming to PrisonPlanet.tv, paying for what you see to give it to everybody else.
[02:57:33.181 --> 02:57:35.282]  A lot of folks say, well, that's not a good pitch.
[02:57:35.282 --> 02:57:37.344]  Who wants to pay when nobody else has?
[02:57:37.344 --> 02:57:38.605]  That's a wondrous thing.
[02:57:40.603 --> 02:57:44.406]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.tv member.

[02:58:00.717 --> 02:58:06.401]  I always have corporate guys over the years call me and they go, so your model's just to reach people.
[02:58:06.401 --> 02:58:07.822]  Your model's not to make money.
[02:58:08.686 --> 02:58:23.546]  And I look at them and I say, absolutely, our model is to be successful, make more money, to expand our operation and what we are doing.
[02:58:23.546 --> 02:58:24.708]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:58:27.416 --> 02:58:28.616]  If you're not a member, you should be.
[02:58:28.616 --> 02:58:37.779]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson is coming up with the fourth hour on the radical Islamic invasion and exactly what's happening with that.

[02:59:50.655 --> 02:59:53.259]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.106 --> 03:00:12.788]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:12.788 --> 03:00:17.672]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:17.672 --> 03:00:23.536]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head.
[03:00:23.536 --> 03:00:26.679]  Wrapped up in silence, our circuits are dead.
[03:00:27.319 --> 03:00:28.419]  We are back.
[03:00:28.419 --> 03:00:30.800]  It's the fourth hour home drive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:32.681]  I'll be your host for the next hour.
[03:00:32.681 --> 03:00:34.182]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:34.182 --> 03:00:48.707]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by a guest who has been on the show before a few months ago to talk about the migrant crisis as it relates to the epicenter of that crisis, which of course is Germany.
[03:00:48.707 --> 03:00:49.807]  He's in Germany.
[03:00:49.807 --> 03:00:53.308]  He's a German commentator and blogger, Alexander Benesch.
[03:00:53.308 --> 03:00:54.329]  So we've got that coming up.
[03:00:55.189 --> 03:00:56.852]  In the next segment.
[03:00:56.852 --> 03:01:09.953]  But first of all, what's equally as shocking as the mass molestation of German women, not only in Cologne, but also Hamburg, Stuttgart, and other cities in Europe, now they're coming out, Zurich,
[03:01:10.974 --> 03:01:12.917]  Helsinki was another.
[03:01:12.917 --> 03:01:19.726]  All these different major cities in Europe on the night of New Year's Eve, mass molestations by these Muslim migrants.
[03:01:19.726 --> 03:01:27.396]  But what's almost as shocking as the incidents themselves is the massive cover-up in the aftermath.
[03:01:27.967 --> 03:01:40.610]  Now of course, we were well-versed in this because we'd been talking about the migrant rape epidemic, which again, primarily targets Muslim women and Muslim children in migrant camps.
[03:01:40.610 --> 03:01:57.093]  So don't you dare utter the word racist simply because we're talking about this, even as we have Angela Merkel and Mark Zuckerberg scheming to ban people on Facebook, even as we have Twitter being bought out basically by Saudi Arabia
[03:01:57.893 --> 03:02:05.492]  And now we see people on Twitter who criticize radical Islam being suspended, being banned, being unverified.
[03:02:05.492 --> 03:02:07.216]  We have posts being censored.
[03:02:08.553 --> 03:02:13.696]  And the cover-up continues, but we've been reporting on it for at least four or five months.
[03:02:13.696 --> 03:02:17.558]  This was an article back in September on Infowars.com.
[03:02:17.558 --> 03:02:29.565]  German police covering up rape so as not to legitimize critics of mass migration fears public knowledge of children being molested by Muslim migrants could lead to quote right-wing demonstrations.
[03:02:30.373 --> 03:02:47.979]  Now this was a case in Detmold, a city in West Central Germany, and of course it emerged after numerous cases of Muslim migrants raping women and children in and around migrant camps, not only in Germany, but also in other cities in Norway and Sweden particularly.
[03:02:48.699 --> 03:03:10.066]  Of course, top German social services organisations warned that around the same time that this was happening, we had schools in Germany ordering girls not to wear shorts or not to wear short skirts because they might trigger the migrants with their fantastic culture that we're importing to attack and rape young girls again.
[03:03:10.066 --> 03:03:17.889]  We have to adapt to their culture, even though it is a genuine, real rape culture, they don't have to adapt to ours.
[03:03:19.124 --> 03:03:23.148]  So we would be reporting on it for at least four or five months.
[03:03:23.148 --> 03:03:38.845]  On day one, after the New Year's Eve attacks in Cologne, in these other major cities, the Cologne police put out a press release saying New Year's Eve celebrations were completely peaceful and there were no major incidents to report.
[03:03:38.845 --> 03:03:41.048]  They actually said that the day after.
[03:03:42.125 --> 03:03:59.721]  Over a hundred women, and in fact if you total up all the different reports, over 600 women in the other cities now complaining about being attacked, sexually molested, robbed by these migrants, but according to the Cologne police it was all hunky-dory, nothing happened.
[03:04:01.491 --> 03:04:03.332]  Swing from day one.
[03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:11.757]  Now we learn that in Sweden, which of course is the epicenter of everything LibTard, this had been happening over a year ago.
[03:04:12.674 --> 03:04:15.296]  This is out of politico.eu.
[03:04:15.296 --> 03:04:18.479]  Sweden investigates sex assault cover-up.
[03:04:18.479 --> 03:04:35.414]  In the wake of the German New Year's Eve sexual assault scandal, Swedish law enforcement authorities are looking into claims that a gang of mostly Afghan men harassed girls at 2014 music festival, an incident that initially went unreported by police.
[03:04:36.315 --> 03:04:38.098]  We're going to get into it after the break.
[03:04:38.098 --> 03:04:42.125]  We're going to talk about why they covered it up straight ahead.
[03:04:42.125 --> 03:04:45.050]  Then we'll have our guests on the Alex Jones Show live fourth hour.
[03:04:45.050 --> 03:04:46.572]  Stay with us in 4Wars.com.
[03:05:00.029 --> 03:05:05.012]  The first Republican debate of 2016 is this Thursday, January 14th.
[03:05:05.012 --> 03:05:11.456]  And join the InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV once again for Political Science Theater 3K.
[03:05:11.456 --> 03:05:14.718]  The stage will be getting smaller with only six candidates making the cut.
[03:05:14.718 --> 03:05:18.020]  Maybe seven if they let John Kasich slip in through the back door.
[03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:19.201]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[03:05:19.201 --> 03:05:22.623]  Central on the InfoWars Nightly News and then the debate kicks off at 8 p.m.

[03:05:26.806 --> 03:05:28.508]  When's the next Democratic debate, you ask?
[03:05:28.508 --> 03:05:32.252]  Well, it's on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs, because that's when most people want to watch it.
[03:05:32.252 --> 03:05:37.697]  It does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this primetime debate, but John Kasich is?
[03:05:37.697 --> 03:05:38.838]  What is this world coming to?
[03:05:39.198 --> 03:05:46.368]  Just a little side note here, the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run if she is indicted under this new email scandal.
[03:05:46.368 --> 03:05:48.010]  Join us this Thursday, 7 p.m.
[03:05:48.010 --> 03:05:51.375]  Central, for Political Science Theater 3K.

[03:08:11.300 --> 03:08:13.502]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:13.502 --> 03:08:16.964]  We are back.
[03:08:16.964 --> 03:08:21.829]  It's the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:21.829 --> 03:08:27.714]  We're going to go to our guest here in a moment, but before the break I was talking about this article out of politico.eu.
[03:08:28.795 --> 03:08:34.764]  Now, we know that there was a massive cover-up in the aftermath of the mass molestation in Cologne on New Year's Eve.
[03:08:34.764 --> 03:08:38.890]  The very first day, the police came out and said, nothing happened.
[03:08:38.890 --> 03:08:42.435]  Well, this cover-up stretches back even further.
[03:08:42.435 --> 03:08:44.498]  This is Sweden, of course, which
[03:08:44.958 --> 03:08:53.225]  Has a rape rate that has risen 1400% since they opened their doors to mass immigration back in the 70s.
[03:08:53.225 --> 03:08:55.467]  No correlation whatsoever, I'm sure.
[03:08:55.467 --> 03:08:57.928]  And this was a pop concert back in the summer of 2014.
[03:08:57.928 --> 03:09:01.611]  Sweden investigated a sex assault cover-up.
[03:09:02.472 --> 03:09:14.606]  About 50 youths, predominantly from Afghanistan, according to sources quoted by the Swedish daily Daggans Nyheter, were involved in sexual assaults involving girls as young as 11 years old.
[03:09:14.606 --> 03:09:22.194]  After the incident, Stockholm police reported that there, quote, had been relatively few crimes.
[03:09:22.975 --> 03:09:24.697]  Now what does that remind you of?
[03:09:24.697 --> 03:09:33.044]  The Cologne police, the day after the mass molestations in that city, coming out and saying there were no incidents whatsoever.
[03:09:33.044 --> 03:09:34.625]  But listen to this.
[03:09:34.625 --> 03:09:40.891]  This is what happened in Sweden a year and a half ago, and we're only just finding out about it now.
[03:09:40.891 --> 03:09:42.772]  This is how long this cover-up's been going on.
[03:09:43.513 --> 03:09:54.282]  According to Peter Agrant, head of the festival's police operation, the background of the men could be a reason why police did not initially report the case.
[03:09:55.168 --> 03:10:08.177]  Quote, sometimes we do not really say how things are because we believe it may play into the hands of the right-wing party, Sweden Democrats, Agren told the newspaper.
[03:10:08.177 --> 03:10:17.144]  So he's brazenly admitting that they refused to report these rapes that targeted dozens of women, Swedish women, at this music concert.
[03:10:17.964 --> 03:10:23.045]  Because it might give votes to the opposition political party.
[03:10:23.045 --> 03:10:37.529]  So they're covering up rapes, they're covering up crimes, so as not to legitimize critics of mass immigration, so as not to boost the poll numbers of their political operation, opposition.
[03:10:37.529 --> 03:10:42.971]  So again, using rape or the cover-up of rape as a political tool.
[03:10:43.571 --> 03:10:45.232]  It's happening in Germany.
[03:10:45.232 --> 03:10:47.074]  We reported on it back in September.
[03:10:47.074 --> 03:10:53.338]  The police covering up crime so as not to quote legitimize critics of mass migration.
[03:10:53.338 --> 03:10:59.923]  Now we learn it's been going on in Sweden for at least 18 months in this one case alone.
[03:11:00.848 --> 03:11:09.415]  Of course we had the IKEA attack in Sweden last year, which was again covered up, watered down, diluted.
[03:11:09.415 --> 03:11:23.347]  The Swedish left actually responded by marching against, not the people who beheaded someone in an IKEA store, but against the people who criticised this kind of culture that we're importing into Europe, similar to how the
[03:11:23.987 --> 03:11:36.297]  German Interior Minister said that posts by right-wing commentators on the internet were, quote, at least as awful as the mass molestations that took place in Cologne.
[03:11:36.297 --> 03:11:38.779]  Absolutely astounding comments.
[03:11:38.779 --> 03:11:40.320]  He's not been forced to resign yet.
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:42.142]  The chief of police in Cologne was.
[03:11:43.226 --> 03:11:59.474]  So again, this cover-up and this censure, this targeting of critics of this migrant wave continues even as the left plays down or ignores actual violent sexual attacks being committed in many major European cities.
[03:11:59.474 --> 03:12:11.739]  So now here to talk about it, and he was on the show again last year to talk about the migrant crisis, is German commentator Alexander Minesh from the website recentr.com.
[03:12:11.739 --> 03:12:12.800]  Alex, welcome to the show.
[03:12:14.494 --> 03:12:17.015]  Thanks for having me on, Paul.
[03:12:17.015 --> 03:12:22.796]  Now, we're about a week in after the German media actually started covering this story.
[03:12:22.796 --> 03:12:27.137]  They ignored it for days after it first broke on social media.
[03:12:27.137 --> 03:12:30.138]  Again, we had the police cover up from day one.
[03:12:30.138 --> 03:12:31.818]  What's the mood like in Germany?
[03:12:31.818 --> 03:12:34.659]  Is the outrage continuing to build?
[03:12:34.659 --> 03:12:43.161]  Or have leftists and politicians been successful in smearing criticism of this crisis as right-wing xenophobia?
[03:12:44.369 --> 03:12:46.711]  Well, the cover-up is dead.
[03:12:46.711 --> 03:12:49.253]  They tried it, it failed.
[03:12:49.253 --> 03:12:59.843]  Social media, alternative media, they were talking a lot about it and so the debate was over about what actually happened.
[03:12:59.843 --> 03:13:01.364]  So this was not
[03:13:02.006 --> 03:13:03.968]  going to be covered up any longer.
[03:13:03.968 --> 03:13:07.391]  So then mainstream media did a complete flip.
[03:13:07.391 --> 03:13:11.215]  So they started to make this the headline story.
[03:13:11.215 --> 03:13:14.858]  It's been the top news item for about a week.
[03:13:14.858 --> 03:13:23.526]  It's the mainstream media leaking the preliminary police report, leaking this new more detailed report with all the horrible details.
[03:13:23.526 --> 03:13:25.708]  So why is mainstream media doing this now?
[03:13:25.708 --> 03:13:27.570]  They try to regain credibility
[03:13:28.708 --> 03:13:35.754]  In order to at least control the debate of what's going, what's supposed to happen.
[03:13:35.754 --> 03:13:42.739]  So they can't manipulate the debate, what actually happened in Cologne and other cities.
[03:13:42.739 --> 03:13:45.181]  In Europe, that debate is done.
[03:13:45.181 --> 03:13:51.266]  But if they create this flurry of news articles and more details and more...
[03:13:52.845 --> 03:14:00.252]  In more and more details, they can at least dominate and control the debate of what should happen next.
[03:14:00.252 --> 03:14:03.795]  I have this recent story.
[03:14:03.795 --> 03:14:09.079]  It's about the German Minister for Development, a man called Gerd Müller.
[03:14:09.079 --> 03:14:11.421]  He's billed as a conservative.
[03:14:11.421 --> 03:14:17.507]  And he says there's 8 to 10 million more migrants on the way.
[03:14:18.827 --> 03:14:24.152]  8 to 10 million more migrants on the way from Syria and Iraq.
[03:14:24.152 --> 03:14:32.979]  And so he says, and this is just the beginning, there's going to be a lot more people coming, potentially coming from Africa.
[03:14:33.969 --> 03:14:39.115]  So, his suggestion is not to close the borders.
[03:14:39.115 --> 03:14:47.645]  His suggestion is to have Germany and German citizens take on a whole new level of global responsibility.
[03:14:47.645 --> 03:14:50.508]  Now, of course that means he wants money.
[03:14:51.605 --> 03:14:53.907]  And this sounds threatening to me.
[03:14:53.907 --> 03:15:03.053]  So he's saying, give us more money so we can reorganize Africa and other parts of the world.
[03:15:03.053 --> 03:15:09.897]  Give us that money or else we're going to be flooded with more and more migrants.
[03:15:09.897 --> 03:15:15.221]  So this is a pretty recent story and it's even crazier.
[03:15:16.181 --> 03:15:24.877]  He says, in the same statement, this man said, Europe has a debt.
[03:15:24.877 --> 03:15:26.460]  Europe has a guilt.
[03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:27.061]  Our wealth
[03:15:28.055 --> 03:15:30.797]  was built on the back of the third world.
[03:15:30.797 --> 03:15:35.021]  Now, this is something you expect from a communist, but not from a conservative.
[03:15:35.021 --> 03:15:48.091]  So, I'm supposed to pay off my debts, to pay off my guilt, and if I don't do that, tens of millions and more millions of migrants are going to come.
[03:15:49.153 --> 03:15:53.656]  So this is the state of the debate.
[03:15:53.656 --> 03:15:55.317]  People know what happened.
[03:15:55.317 --> 03:15:57.279]  People know what actually happened.
[03:15:57.279 --> 03:16:02.002]  So the remaining debate is what's going to happen now.
[03:16:02.002 --> 03:16:03.884]  Intelligence, there's no indication.
[03:16:03.884 --> 03:16:07.066]  Intelligence agencies had any pre-warning.
[03:16:07.066 --> 03:16:14.671]  German intelligence is supposed to have informants and actual trained agents among these fresh waves of migrants.
[03:16:14.671 --> 03:16:16.673]  This is what every country does.
[03:16:17.678 --> 03:16:21.223]  And also, you need to check everybody coming in.
[03:16:21.223 --> 03:16:22.384]  You need to fingerprint them.
[03:16:22.384 --> 03:16:23.446]  You need to identify them.
[03:16:24.312 --> 03:16:26.212]  And you need to do a background check.
[03:16:26.212 --> 03:16:33.394]  And a lot of these guys that did these sexual assaults, they had temporary papers.
[03:16:33.394 --> 03:16:37.695]  So, all the background checking hasn't even been done yet.
[03:16:37.695 --> 03:16:43.916]  There hasn't been a decision made about their rights to asylum.
[03:16:43.916 --> 03:16:47.877]  And so, intelligence apparently had no pre-warning.
[03:16:48.889 --> 03:16:53.293]  And even government, federal agencies said this is a huge problem.
[03:16:53.293 --> 03:17:00.660]  There have been hundreds of thousands of migrants in 2015 coming in without any background checks.
[03:17:00.660 --> 03:17:03.043]  No background checks.
[03:17:03.043 --> 03:17:06.166]  Bearing in mind, Alex, this was organized.
[03:17:06.166 --> 03:17:12.592]  This had to be organized on the internet for thousands of people to show up in all these different cities and carry this out.
[03:17:12.892 --> 03:17:26.123]  Which brings us to the security angle, because you had the bizarre incident in Germany during the soccer game, or before the soccer game, right after the Paris attacks, where the police blew the whistle and said they saw an ambulance full of explosives.
[03:17:26.123 --> 03:17:28.785]  That got shut down, that story disappeared.
[03:17:28.785 --> 03:17:35.231]  You had people involved in this mass molestation in Cologne, as you said, who were unregistered refugees.
[03:17:35.231 --> 03:17:40.095]  The decision hadn't even been made on whether to officially allow them to stay in the country.
[03:17:40.095 --> 03:17:41.236]  You've got the terrorist,
[03:17:41.696 --> 03:17:52.018]  Who was shot dead in Paris last week, staying at a German refugee camp and having been charged with sexual assault in Cologne.
[03:17:52.018 --> 03:17:56.539]  They're speculating possibly he was involved in the events on New Year's Eve.
[03:17:56.539 --> 03:18:08.801]  Given this total security standout, this complete lack of intelligence, how long do you think before Germany suffers a Paris-style attack as a result of this mass migrant wave?
[03:18:10.154 --> 03:18:31.193]  Well, media, various types of media organs, they have already commented, it only takes one attack, one serious attack carried out by a migrant, one single attack is all it takes to end the chancellorship of Angela Merkel, to create
[03:18:32.113 --> 03:18:32.734]  We're good to go.
[03:18:52.083 --> 03:19:05.829]  There's stabbings, politically motivated stabbings, you know, leftist groups, they're stabbing conservatives, they're torching their cars, they're threatening their wives, and all this stuff is going on.
[03:19:05.829 --> 03:19:07.970]  Of course there's a few ultra right-wing
[03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:14.111]  Ultra right wing guys who burn down refugee places.
[03:19:14.111 --> 03:19:17.412]  But it's a spiral of provocation.
[03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:26.636]  See, the government is responsible for this mess and subsequently all these different groups are getting more and more agitated.
[03:19:26.636 --> 03:19:31.217]  I mean, clearly even federal agencies say what happened on December 31st.
[03:19:32.918 --> 03:19:37.682]  This was a new level of problems, a new level of escalation.
[03:19:37.682 --> 03:19:42.286]  Now, even if these events were spontaneous, that would still be a security nightmare.
[03:19:42.286 --> 03:19:44.348]  Because what is going to happen next?
[03:19:44.348 --> 03:19:48.512]  What if next time it's spontaneous rioting, spontaneous looting and dead people?
[03:19:48.512 --> 03:19:53.876]  Okay, we're going to get more into it after the break with Alexander Banesh, the Security Angle.
[03:19:53.876 --> 03:19:56.278]  Is civil unrest coming to Europe?

[03:20:58.823 --> 03:21:05.504]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[03:21:05.504 --> 03:21:10.685]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[03:21:10.685 --> 03:21:15.827]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[03:21:15.827 --> 03:21:20.368]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.048]  Hi, my name is Jason.

[03:21:29.095 --> 03:21:36.424]  After 3 weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[03:21:36.424 --> 03:21:37.465]  I ran out of One World Way

[03:24:20.371 --> 03:24:24.195]  We are back with our guest Alexander Badesh of RecentR.com.
[03:24:24.195 --> 03:24:37.768]  Now I want to get back into the civil unrest angle of all this in a little while, but first let's concentrate on the molestations themselves that happened in Cologne and all these other major cities because we got the video up on Infowars.com.
[03:24:38.849 --> 03:24:48.577]  ...of this Dutch journalist basically being attacked by a huge Muslim mob during protests against the Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi back in June 2013.
[03:24:48.577 --> 03:24:53.601]  They drag her away in a huge mob as she's screaming her head off.
[03:24:53.601 --> 03:24:54.922]  Completely harrowing video.
[03:24:55.763 --> 03:25:03.471]  But this is the concept of Muslim gang rape and how it's being institutionalized into Muslim male culture.
[03:25:03.471 --> 03:25:05.533]  It's known as Taharash.
[03:25:05.533 --> 03:25:09.116]  This has been seen in numerous different North African countries.
[03:25:09.116 --> 03:25:13.100]  Again, it's part of this using rape as a tool.
[03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:19.746]  We've seen rape being used as a political tool in Syria, in other places, by ISIS jihadists.
[03:25:20.587 --> 03:25:22.649]  Alex, talk to us about Taharush.
[03:25:22.649 --> 03:25:24.110]  Where, I mean, what is this?
[03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:25.411]  Where have we seen it before?
[03:25:25.411 --> 03:25:27.093]  Explain this to people.
[03:25:27.093 --> 03:25:41.085]  Well, according to German federal agencies, the agencies are aware that this phenomenon called Taharush Gamia, this phenomenon is known in certain Arab countries and of course this is a
[03:25:42.656 --> 03:25:44.197]  One, this is one angle.
[03:25:44.197 --> 03:25:50.721]  It's gatherings and people ganging up on women and trying to rape them.
[03:25:50.721 --> 03:25:55.504]  But this is only part of the problem.
[03:25:55.504 --> 03:26:01.948]  The Syrian conflict has led to a rape epidemic.
[03:26:01.948 --> 03:26:07.492]  I think this was kind of the title, the story from the magazine The Atlantic.
[03:26:07.492 --> 03:26:11.074]  But of course, in Western media, they tend to focus on
[03:26:12.083 --> 03:26:19.513]  Systematic rape or allegations of systematic rape conducted by the Assad government now if you look a little bit deeper you find
[03:26:20.471 --> 03:26:28.036]  Uh, equal allegations of systematic rape done by the opposition groups.
[03:26:28.036 --> 03:26:33.440]  And, um, uh, you can find the story and there's a lot of details in this.
[03:26:33.440 --> 03:26:39.985]  Kind of the tactic is to completely break the enemy, completely, uh, break the family.
[03:26:39.985 --> 03:26:43.107]  Because if you terrorize one person in front of the others,
[03:26:44.207 --> 03:26:51.209]  That's going to lead to massive traumatization and the lack of will to fight.
[03:26:51.209 --> 03:26:59.911]  It's kind of an economic cheap way of intimidation, cheap way of warfare.
[03:26:59.911 --> 03:27:12.434]  There have been reports about Islamic scholars producing these legal opinions, so Islamic scholarly
[03:27:13.494 --> 03:27:23.902]  Legal opinions that it's supposedly okay to rape Alawite women.
[03:27:23.902 --> 03:27:28.246]  This is the group in Syria that's leading right now.
[03:27:28.246 --> 03:27:35.211]  If you look back in the history, of course, the power has always shifted from one group to the other and then back and forth and back and forth.
[03:27:35.211 --> 03:27:40.075]  And this is kind of how they want to win, want to fight dirty.
[03:27:41.138 --> 03:27:46.363]  So, of course, media is now... I have this report on my second monitor behind me.
[03:27:46.363 --> 03:27:48.124]  We have the detailed report.
[03:27:48.124 --> 03:27:54.109]  We have reports about German federal agencies knowing that this is a known phenomenon.
[03:27:54.109 --> 03:28:00.315]  But they're not talking yet about systematic rape as a tool, especially in Syria.
[03:28:00.315 --> 03:28:04.718]  So that's not really debated right now because that would lead to
[03:28:06.380 --> 03:28:09.943]  A lot more outrage and a lot more fear.
[03:28:09.943 --> 03:28:21.373]  So if you have kind of this fear in Germany, this is going to lead to serious provocations in all kinds of directions.
[03:28:21.373 --> 03:28:25.596]  I think even the international audience has read the reports.
[03:28:25.596 --> 03:28:27.498]  People are buying this here.
[03:28:29.119 --> 03:28:33.042]  Law enforcement strength pepper spray.
[03:28:33.042 --> 03:28:56.779]  We're selling pepper spray and people are buying this stuff every day and everybody else is buying pepper spray and this is something that people take very seriously and of course there's this idea of, the idea from the right wing, you know, we're going to create civil defense groups and that has a very important place in a society.
[03:28:58.815 --> 03:29:03.997]  But then we enter the murky sphere of government trickery.
[03:29:03.997 --> 03:29:08.479]  So the government let this threat happen.
[03:29:08.479 --> 03:29:12.061]  They were responsible for this migration.
[03:29:12.061 --> 03:29:17.263]  And of course, European governments are also responsible for what happened in Syria and also Iraq.
[03:29:17.263 --> 03:29:20.024]  I mean, they claimed responsibility.
[03:29:21.980 --> 03:29:33.720]  When it came to the future of Iraq and Syria, so Western governments thought, we know better, we're gonna take charge, we're gonna decide for these people and now we have the consequences.
[03:29:34.776 --> 03:29:38.059]  Okay, Alexander Banesh, stay right there, we've got a break coming up.
[03:29:38.059 --> 03:29:42.782]  But a long segment ahead to talk about the wider agenda behind this migrant crisis.
[03:29:42.782 --> 03:29:45.884]  This is the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:45.884 --> 03:29:48.066]  Infowars.com, stay right there.
[03:29:48.066 --> 03:29:51.989]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.989 --> 03:29:54.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.629 --> 03:30:03.873]  President Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about, until now.
[03:30:03.873 --> 03:30:09.596]  For one thing, he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare.
[03:30:09.596 --> 03:30:20.343]  That's right, Obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's requirements, because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program.
[03:30:20.343 --> 03:30:28.549]  Once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was, they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else, which Obama gave them.
[03:30:28.869 --> 03:30:34.534]  President Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity.
[03:30:34.534 --> 03:30:43.161]  The Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a non-profit application within just one month from the Barack H. Obama Foundation.
[03:30:43.161 --> 03:30:48.745]  Additionally, the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's tax-exempt status.
[03:30:48.745 --> 03:30:55.651]  You can find out more from the article on InfoWars.com entitled, 75 Times Obama Broke Law During Presidency.
[03:30:55.651 --> 03:30:57.072]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:30:58.675 --> 03:31:02.177]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[03:31:02.177 --> 03:31:07.759]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[03:31:16.122 --> 03:31:21.785]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[03:31:22.265 --> 03:31:31.347]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[03:31:31.347 --> 03:31:37.568]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[03:31:37.568 --> 03:31:44.310]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[03:31:44.310 --> 03:31:49.371]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[03:31:58.345 --> 03:31:59.266]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[03:31:59.266 --> 03:31:59.846]  Good, brother.
[03:31:59.846 --> 03:32:01.807]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:32:01.807 --> 03:32:03.509]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:03.509 --> 03:32:07.551]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:07.551 --> 03:32:10.173]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:10.173 --> 03:32:12.595]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:12.595 --> 03:32:20.560]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:32:23.904 --> 03:32:25.546]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:25.546 --> 03:32:28.449]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:32:28.449 --> 03:32:30.231]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:32:30.231 --> 03:32:35.657]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:32:35.697 --> 03:32:36.297]  We're good to go.
[03:33:08.231 --> 03:33:14.796]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.796 --> 03:33:16.378]  Welcome!
[03:33:16.378 --> 03:33:22.503]  It's the fourth hour live of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson, talking to our guest, Alexander Badesh.
[03:33:22.503 --> 03:33:31.930]  Of course, last night we had an incident in Calgary, Canada, where two Muslims named Mohammed burst into a nightclub and tried to shoot the place up.
[03:33:31.930 --> 03:33:35.533]  Luckily, they were stopped by a couple of alert bouncers.
[03:33:36.374 --> 03:33:43.638]  Two days ago, over in Vancouver, Canada, Syrian refugees pepper-sprayed after welcoming event at Muslim Centre.
[03:33:43.638 --> 03:33:49.482]  Guess which story the media, the international media, is more interested in?
[03:33:49.482 --> 03:33:57.366]  Two guys called Mohammed trying to commit a terror attack in a nightclub or some Syrian refugees being pepper-sprayed.
[03:33:57.366 --> 03:34:04.551]  Of course, it's the refugees being pepper-sprayed and even daring to ask whether that attack in Calgary was terrorism.
[03:34:05.788 --> 03:34:10.010]  It's completely off the table, because it's racist to even suggest that.
[03:34:10.010 --> 03:34:18.353]  Now we've got Swedish authorities covering up Cologne-style mass molestations for over a year and a half.
[03:34:18.353 --> 03:34:27.636]  We've got the Syrian ISIS supporter who was shot dead outside a Paris police station last week, trying to stab police while chanting Allah Akbar.
[03:34:27.636 --> 03:34:29.397]  He stayed at a German refugee camp.
[03:34:29.397 --> 03:34:32.538]  He may have been involved in the mass molestations themselves.
[03:34:33.561 --> 03:34:36.923]  And of course, feminists are loathe to even mention it.
[03:34:36.923 --> 03:34:40.945]  We've got Germans buying pepper spray in their droves.
[03:34:40.945 --> 03:34:47.649]  We've got them trying to arm themselves to defend themselves against this very real security threat.
[03:34:47.649 --> 03:34:52.953]  Now, we were talking, Alex, just previously about the civil unrest aspect to all this.
[03:34:53.553 --> 03:35:03.283]  We've got Neo-Nazis extremists being emboldened by the fact that moderate voices are being strangled because they're afraid or just completely unwilling to criticize this.
[03:35:03.283 --> 03:35:07.827]  So that vacuum is being filled by extremists on both sides.
[03:35:07.827 --> 03:35:08.909]  That's going to ramp up.
[03:35:08.909 --> 03:35:10.090]  We're going to get more attacks.
[03:35:10.570 --> 03:35:13.493]  ...on migrants, more attacked by migrants.
[03:35:13.493 --> 03:35:26.865]  We've got top experts in France and Germany, as well as the head of the Swiss Army recently, warning that civil unrest is coming to Europe as a result of this mass immigration crisis.
[03:35:26.865 --> 03:35:37.354]  Do you think that's likely, for one, or will Europeans continue to stick their heads in the sand, even though basically their culture is being thrown before the wolves?
[03:35:39.011 --> 03:35:52.369]  Well, there's a certain chance that part of certain migrants, they want to destabilize Germany and Europe through systematic rape because it's cheap, because it's...
[03:35:53.951 --> 03:35:54.431]  I think so.
[03:36:16.420 --> 03:36:21.202]  Others are trying to do classic terrorist plots.
[03:36:21.202 --> 03:36:25.964]  And the line of thinking is you destabilize a country, you destabilize a region.
[03:36:25.964 --> 03:36:30.846]  A lot of Muslims think Europeans are pretty weak and pampered.
[03:36:30.846 --> 03:36:38.210]  I think they underestimate Europe and that's very dangerous.
[03:36:38.210 --> 03:36:40.891]  So yeah, that's kind of the way.
[03:36:41.835 --> 03:36:54.339]  The extremist line of thinking, you destabilize a region and then you have all this provocation going back and forth, you end up with civil war and of course you hope your side is going to win.
[03:36:54.339 --> 03:36:58.000]  But you have to ask yourself this, why did
[03:36:58.860 --> 03:37:02.985]  Why did the political establishment allow all this to happen?
[03:37:02.985 --> 03:37:14.599]  I mean, it's the plan of politicians to have a European Union super state, to expand it to a Mediterranean Union and all of this.
[03:37:14.599 --> 03:37:18.884]  So wouldn't it have been smart, in order to get the super state,
[03:37:19.907 --> 03:37:30.613]  Would it have been smart to have a harsh justice system against these type of migrant crimes?
[03:37:30.613 --> 03:37:38.177]  I mean, wouldn't that have made sense for the political establishment to keep the European population happy?
[03:37:38.177 --> 03:37:39.218]  So people would say, yes,
[03:37:40.245 --> 03:37:42.188]  This migration thing seems to work.
[03:37:42.188 --> 03:37:46.273]  Yeah, fine, let's have the super state and lure people into this trap.
[03:37:46.273 --> 03:37:52.842]  So why didn't the establishment play it like this?
[03:37:52.842 --> 03:37:53.563]  Why didn't they?
[03:37:54.475 --> 03:38:01.199]  They made sure from the beginning, decades ago, that migrants cannot be criminal.
[03:38:01.199 --> 03:38:05.982]  There's going to be swift and harsh justice.
[03:38:05.982 --> 03:38:06.882]  Why didn't they?
[03:38:06.882 --> 03:38:17.748]  To use an extreme example, former communist Eastern Germany during the Cold War, they barely had any migration in the classic sense.
[03:38:17.748 --> 03:38:20.490]  And they had almost zero Muslim migration.
[03:38:21.656 --> 03:38:24.959]  And so this is an extreme example.
[03:38:24.959 --> 03:38:28.523]  So governments, if they want to, socialist governments, they can do this.
[03:38:28.523 --> 03:38:40.635]  They can create any kind of justice system they like and have the media portray this as a working system and everything's fine.
[03:38:40.635 --> 03:38:42.377]  So why doesn't the European Union
[03:38:43.654 --> 03:38:47.835]  Why hasn't the European Union done that?
[03:38:47.835 --> 03:38:54.776]  Why do we see a massive radicalization of migrants and the ultra-right wing and the ultra-left?
[03:38:54.776 --> 03:38:55.777]  Why is that?
[03:38:55.777 --> 03:38:59.497]  Well, this is kind of the extreme scenario.
[03:38:59.497 --> 03:39:05.899]  I'm not saying that this is definitely going to happen, but this is one of the main scenarios as I see it.
[03:39:07.523 --> 03:39:07.603]  You
[03:39:24.881 --> 03:39:32.109]  Create this Muslim threat, create this radicalization or help this Muslim radicalization.
[03:39:32.109 --> 03:39:35.812]  Then I would secretly help the right-wing or the extreme right-wing.
[03:39:35.812 --> 03:39:39.937]  I would also secretly help the extreme left.
[03:39:39.937 --> 03:39:47.704]  And then when civil war breaks out, I would watch as all these groups basically wipe each other out.
[03:39:48.619 --> 03:39:52.121]  So, I, the government, would be the last player standing.
[03:39:52.121 --> 03:39:56.844]  Now, of course, same type of strategy would work in the United States.
[03:39:56.844 --> 03:40:09.831]  Of course, in the United States, a psychopathic government would also have to secretly or not so secretly push radical black groups and radical Latino groups.
[03:40:09.831 --> 03:40:13.273]  So, of course, this is not a complicated strategy.
[03:40:17.005 --> 03:40:29.817]  It gets artificially – well, they make it look complicated by obfuscating, by changing the words and obfuscating through the debate, but the core strategy –
[03:40:31.499 --> 03:40:40.348]  In this scenario would be this, and of course we've seen governments here in Europe building up the extreme right wing and also helping the extreme left.
[03:40:40.348 --> 03:40:45.133]  You've got conservatives complaining, why does the government give support to the extreme left?
[03:40:45.133 --> 03:40:50.258]  Why does the extreme left get money?
[03:40:50.258 --> 03:40:53.602]  Why can they use rooms paid for by taxpayer money?
[03:40:54.600 --> 03:40:56.101]  And all that sort of thing.
[03:40:56.101 --> 03:41:00.925]  So this is one very scary scenario.
[03:41:00.925 --> 03:41:07.891]  It's kind of this idea of a government not wanting to fight the conservatives directly.
[03:41:09.207 --> 03:41:29.720]  But rather have this civil war with different factions, different extremist factions, so the government can stand down for a while, the government can, you know, lean back and watch these events unfold, so the government doesn't have to fight the right ways.
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:30.721]  And of course we know from
[03:41:31.311 --> 03:41:40.296]  You know, 12, 13 years ago, reports came out that the neo-Nazi movement in Germany was completely infiltrated by the state, by intelligence agencies.
[03:41:40.296 --> 03:41:43.877]  So they had control of it at the top, way back then.
[03:41:43.877 --> 03:41:48.440]  Of course, we've got the birth of this Pegida movement now, which is probably something separate.
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:57.364]  The police in Cologne were far quicker to respond to their demonstration, you know, with water cannons than they were to respond to the actual mass molestations.
[03:41:57.364 --> 03:42:00.626]  But you talked about the wider agenda behind this, of course.
[03:42:01.366 --> 03:42:17.754]  Merkel came out several times and other Germans came out and said, you know, we need this cheap labor, we need this flood of immigrants to replace the German population, to supplement and, you know, keep going our demographics because basically we're dying out and we're going to have no workers.
[03:42:17.754 --> 03:42:27.459]  That is disproven if you look at other countries like the Czech Republic, which has had a stable population for a hundred years, very little immigration,
[03:42:27.938 --> 03:42:31.380]  And it's the most thriving economy in Europe.
[03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:40.304]  So this argument that you need constant supply of mass immigration simply to keep the economy afloat, eventually doesn't make any sense.
[03:42:40.304 --> 03:42:47.247]  Only if you set up your economy to be dependent on that in the first place, which gets to what you were talking about.
[03:42:47.247 --> 03:42:53.070]  And the EU itself, talking about exploiting the crisis, now the EU has come out and said,
[03:42:53.790 --> 03:43:11.461]  If there's a border crisis related to this migrant issue which they determine national governments are incapable of handling, they will come in with basically an occupying EU army and take over border security of sovereign nations without their consent.
[03:43:11.461 --> 03:43:14.083]  So they're already exploiting the crisis that they created.
[03:43:15.618 --> 03:43:22.960]  To increase and centralize their own power, which is what it comes down to when you were talking about playing the sides off against each other.
[03:43:22.960 --> 03:43:31.763]  But I wanted to ask you about something else, which was in my video, The Rape of Europe, I feature the clips of German politicians.
[03:43:31.763 --> 03:43:35.644]  For example, a Green Party politician who gets up in front of the Parliament there.
[03:43:36.224 --> 03:43:43.406]  And celebrates the fact that Germans will be a minority within major German cities in 20 years.
[03:43:43.406 --> 03:43:54.308]  You had other politicians implying that the people who oppose this mass immigration are Nazis who are going to be demographically cold because they didn't have enough children.
[03:43:54.308 --> 03:43:59.029]  I mean, what is driving this searing self-hatred by the left?
[03:43:59.029 --> 03:44:04.970]  Is it merely the guilt complex from World War II, from Hitler, or does it go deeper than that?
[03:44:08.822 --> 03:44:11.266]  The problem is this.
[03:44:11.266 --> 03:44:14.851]  Leftist ideology, socialism.
[03:44:14.851 --> 03:44:21.680]  Socialism has a completely faulty concept of the nature of evil.
[03:44:22.951 --> 03:44:35.421]  In socialist ideology, evil comes from the family, comes from private ownership, comes from the right to run your own business.
[03:44:35.421 --> 03:44:40.805]  This is, to a communist, this is kind of the root of evil.
[03:44:40.805 --> 03:44:42.907]  This is where evil comes from.
[03:44:42.907 --> 03:44:45.589]  And because socialists have this faulty concept
[03:44:46.591 --> 03:44:49.873]  Socialists have this faulty concept of evil.
[03:44:49.873 --> 03:44:55.797]  That's why their methods to fix evil are horrible.
[03:44:55.797 --> 03:45:10.366]  So if you think the family and if you think private ownership, if you think that's the cause of all evil, then the strategy is destroy the family, destroy private ownership and destroy
[03:45:11.314 --> 03:45:14.816]  I'm basically the independent citizen.
[03:45:14.816 --> 03:45:21.458]  Now, in all these different extremist groups, you have the more moderate and then you have the extremists.
[03:45:21.458 --> 03:45:28.301]  But the extremists, they permeate through these other groups, through these moderate groups.
[03:45:28.301 --> 03:45:31.783]  They try to make it so that you can't distinguish anymore.
[03:45:32.704 --> 03:45:40.041]  So if your concept of evil is completely faulty, you can't fix evil.
[03:45:40.041 --> 03:45:42.186]  And so the left has this
[03:45:43.407 --> 03:45:54.293]  This additional idea that somehow Germans are inherently evil.
[03:45:54.293 --> 03:45:59.276]  But of course, you know, Germans are just, you know, we're middle Europeans.
[03:45:59.276 --> 03:46:01.738]  You know, Germans have spread all over the world.
[03:46:01.738 --> 03:46:10.183]  I think the largest ethnic group in the United States is Americans with German heritage, either partially or fully.
[03:46:10.823 --> 03:46:26.832]  I mean, there were huge migrant waves of Germans to the United States, you know, long before World War II and World War I. So, Germans are not inherently evil, right?
[03:46:26.832 --> 03:46:30.274]  But somehow the left has cultivated this idea.
[03:46:31.224 --> 03:46:32.904]  Let's just erase Germany.
[03:46:32.904 --> 03:46:35.765]  Let's just get rid of the Germans.
[03:46:35.765 --> 03:46:37.705]  Then the world will be safer.
[03:46:37.705 --> 03:46:40.386]  And of course this is not rational.
[03:46:40.386 --> 03:46:46.047]  This is not rational at all.
[03:46:46.047 --> 03:46:51.869]  We've seen these arguments after the events of December 31st.
[03:46:51.869 --> 03:46:53.029]  I have my notes here.
[03:46:59.235 --> 03:47:00.275]  So I got my notes here.
[03:47:00.275 --> 03:47:10.580]  You had the whole left, from politicians, prominent politicians, to the left media, even Vice Magazine in Germany.
[03:47:10.580 --> 03:47:12.281]  They were all saying the same things.
[03:47:12.281 --> 03:47:15.022]  They all had the same talking points.
[03:47:15.022 --> 03:47:18.523]  You could look at any website, they were all saying the same things.
[03:47:18.523 --> 03:47:21.785]  For example, it's supposed to be racist
[03:47:23.137 --> 03:47:30.219]  to describe the events that happened as unusual and noteworthy.
[03:47:30.219 --> 03:47:34.521]  So you're not even supposed to make any kind of big deal out of it.
[03:47:34.521 --> 03:47:41.724]  And it's also evil and bad to notice the background of the perpetrators.
[03:47:41.724 --> 03:47:48.426]  And the left made this argument that during every Oktoberfest,
[03:47:49.702 --> 03:47:57.086]  During every single Oktoberfest, there's supposedly a large, large number of unreported rapes.
[03:47:57.086 --> 03:48:06.591]  So, some of them, some of these leftists even tossed around the number 200, like 200 rapes during every single Oktoberfest.
[03:48:06.591 --> 03:48:10.694]  And even mainstream publications, they looked that up and said, this is not true.
[03:48:10.694 --> 03:48:16.337]  Police statistics say during every Oktoberfest, you have between one and six rapes.
[03:48:18.891 --> 03:48:19.172]  And not 200.
[03:48:30.333 --> 03:48:34.276]  rape women or attempt to sexually assault women.
[03:48:34.276 --> 03:48:35.717]  Nobody even claimed that, you know.
[03:48:35.717 --> 03:48:41.462]  The left is countering arguments that nobody made, that nobody made in the first place.
[03:48:41.462 --> 03:48:49.729]  They create the strawman and then they beat up the strawman and say, look how cool we are, look how true we are.
[03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:58.136]  And then they, yeah, they had this whole set of talking points.
[03:48:59.630 --> 03:49:03.693]  about the rapes and what that means.
[03:49:03.693 --> 03:49:08.297]  So essentially it comes down to what is your concept of evil?
[03:49:08.297 --> 03:49:11.219]  Where does it come from and how does it spread?
[03:49:11.219 --> 03:49:16.343]  And of course, if your ideas about that are completely faulty and
[03:49:17.794 --> 03:49:26.867]  For example, you derive your ideas from socialist books, then of course there's going to be problems.
[03:49:26.867 --> 03:49:30.131]  You know, you can't fix evil if you don't understand it.
[03:49:30.131 --> 03:49:33.176]  You can't cure something which you don't understand.
[03:49:34.904 --> 03:49:36.846]  Amazing analysis there, Alexander Banesh.
[03:49:36.846 --> 03:49:38.308]  We've run out of time, unfortunately.
[03:49:38.308 --> 03:49:40.291]  We're going to have to leave it there.
[03:49:40.291 --> 03:49:42.974]  Your website is recentr.com.
[03:49:42.974 --> 03:49:49.742]  That's where people can go to find some of your excellent reports, and we'll be sure to have you back on the show shortly.
[03:49:49.742 --> 03:49:52.345]  Alex, thanks for joining us.
[03:49:52.345 --> 03:49:52.766]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:49:53.612 --> 03:49:54.533]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:49:54.533 --> 03:49:55.814]  There goes Alexander Banesh.
[03:49:55.814 --> 03:49:59.899]  RecentR.com for more of his amazing reports.
[03:49:59.899 --> 03:50:03.943]  Final few minutes here for the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:50:03.943 --> 03:50:05.164]  Again, I mentioned this story.
[03:50:05.164 --> 03:50:07.206]  Look at this story out of the Daily Mail.
[03:50:07.206 --> 03:50:10.910]  Syrian ISIS supports are shot dead outside Paris police station.
[03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:14.934]  And this is the guy who was shunning al-Akbar while he was trying to stab police.
[03:50:15.555 --> 03:50:22.517]  ...had been arrested for sexually assaulting women in Cologne and may have taken part in New Year's Eve attacks.
[03:50:22.517 --> 03:50:28.738]  A Syrian man shot dead by French police last week may have taken part in the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve.
[03:50:28.738 --> 03:50:38.520]  ISIS supporter Walid Zalihi, believed to be in his late teens or early twenties, was arrested in 2014 in Cologne for sexually abusing women in a nightclub.
[03:50:38.900 --> 03:50:51.226]  Now we're getting more reports about migrants trying to rush, trying to storm into nightclubs, 500 at a time, on New Year's Eve to carry out these, again, molestations in large numbers.
[03:50:51.226 --> 03:50:53.768]  We're going to get into it more in the final segment.
[03:50:53.768 --> 03:50:56.209]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[03:50:56.209 --> 03:50:56.869]  Stay tuned.
[03:50:59.673 --> 03:51:08.377]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.377 --> 03:51:09.857]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.857 --> 03:51:17.800]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:17.800 --> 03:51:26.224]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:26.764 --> 03:51:31.926]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:31.926 --> 03:51:35.587]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.

[03:51:38.489 --> 03:51:41.510]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:58.616 --> 03:52:02.858]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[03:52:02.858 --> 03:52:03.498]  It's true.
[03:52:03.498 --> 03:52:07.640]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[03:52:07.640 --> 03:52:10.042]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:52:10.042 --> 03:52:14.504]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:52:14.804 --> 03:52:27.703]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[03:54:02.875 --> 03:54:04.916]  This show is documented.
[03:54:04.916 --> 03:54:08.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:08.097 --> 03:54:12.040]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[03:54:12.040 --> 03:54:14.241]  I went down, down, down.
[03:54:14.241 --> 03:54:17.663]  We're back for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:54:18.503 --> 03:54:32.627]  Basically, Twitter has responded to the clone sex attacks by accelerating its purge of criticism or humor directed towards the religion, not the race, the religion of Islam.
[03:54:32.627 --> 03:54:41.349]  And it's basically now sending a message to conservatives and real classical liberals who dare to criticize the belief system of Islam.
[03:54:42.117 --> 03:54:51.362]  As completely intolerant as we saw with the migrant attacks on New Year's Eve, they're sending the message self-censor or risk being banned.
[03:54:51.362 --> 03:54:52.823]  It's that simple.
[03:54:52.823 --> 03:54:54.384]  I'm seeing content censored.
[03:54:54.384 --> 03:54:57.706]  I'm seeing people being banned, unverified.
[03:54:57.706 --> 03:55:04.070]  People on Facebook having their accounts suspended simply for saying that German women should have the right
[03:55:04.997 --> 03:55:09.382]  How dare they, the right, to defend themselves against rapists?
[03:55:09.382 --> 03:55:11.585]  Account suspended for 30 days.
[03:55:11.585 --> 03:55:13.146]  Why does that matter?
[03:55:13.146 --> 03:55:16.710]  People say, oh, just get off of Facebook, get off of Twitter.
[03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:20.875]  You know, go and use this other social network which has like 50 people on it.
[03:55:20.875 --> 03:55:21.176]  Great.
[03:55:22.381 --> 03:55:24.883]  As Drudge warned, these are the internet ghettos.
[03:55:24.883 --> 03:55:27.064]  This is where all the content is heading.
[03:55:27.064 --> 03:55:33.288]  So we need to be present on that battlefield while retaining our own platforms.
[03:55:33.288 --> 03:55:49.199]  But again, first it's Twitter, then it's Facebook, then as we saw with Top Feminist going in front of the UN, it's ISPs cutting off internet access altogether for people who make, for example, well in their case it was saying, you suck to a feminist.
[03:55:49.199 --> 03:55:51.141]  That was the required
[03:55:51.801 --> 03:55:54.843]  Offensive term for getting your internet access cut off.
[03:55:54.843 --> 03:55:57.265]  So this really goes right up to the top.
[03:55:57.265 --> 03:56:00.388]  And now we're beginning to see it with Facebook and Twitter.
[03:56:00.388 --> 03:56:06.492]  It's a direct threat to free speech on the internet and we really need to rally behind it.
[03:56:06.492 --> 03:56:09.054]  People say, well, Twitter's a private company.
[03:56:09.054 --> 03:56:10.656]  It can host what it wants.
[03:56:10.656 --> 03:56:19.483]  Well, yeah, but it's completely hypocritical because the only people being banned are conservatives and critics of Islam and critics of feminists.
[03:56:20.410 --> 03:56:33.577]  And in many cases that's as a result of mass mobs of feminists and Islamists reporting them, not for hate speech, not for violent comments, but for merely disagreeing with their political viewpoint.
[03:56:33.577 --> 03:56:34.918]  So that's why it's important.
[03:56:35.711 --> 03:56:38.373]  We got this headline out of The Independent.
[03:56:38.373 --> 03:56:42.897]  Austrian police chief warns women not to leave home alone in wake of Cologne sex attacks.
[03:56:42.897 --> 03:56:51.524]  Vienna's chief of police has warned women against venturing into the streets alone in the wake of highly publicised sexual assaults in Germany and Austria.
[03:56:51.524 --> 03:56:54.386]  So again, it's about blaming the victims.
[03:56:54.386 --> 03:56:56.848]  We have to adapt our culture.
[03:56:56.848 --> 03:56:59.190]  The migrants don't have to adapt theirs.
[03:56:59.190 --> 03:57:03.053]  Maybe we should just put everyone in a full burka and have done with it.
[03:57:03.633 --> 03:57:10.207]  Oh, but they actually sexually molest people in burqas in countries like Egypt, Afghanistan and Syria as well.
[03:57:10.207 --> 03:57:11.950]  So even that wouldn't work.
[03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:13.614]  We've got this article out of Breitbart.
[03:57:14.522 --> 03:57:18.866]  Muslim men shoot up nightclub, government and media refuse to use the M-word.
[03:57:18.866 --> 03:57:33.738]  So basically, two Muslims named Mohammed went and shot up a nightclub in Calgary last night, and the entirety of the Canadian media don't even mention the word Muslim, don't even speculate whether it's a terror attack.
[03:57:33.738 --> 03:57:42.505]  So for the past two weeks, you've had leftists whining about, oh, the media doesn't call it terrorism when white Al-Qaeda takes over
[03:57:42.785 --> 03:57:45.286]  An empty building in the middle of nowhere.
[03:57:45.286 --> 03:57:47.006]  They only blame terrorism on Muslims.
[03:57:47.006 --> 03:57:52.048]  Well, in this case, they then even mention the M-word.
[03:57:52.048 --> 03:57:55.149]  Yeah, international media has been all over this story.
[03:57:55.149 --> 03:57:59.730]  Syrian refugees pepper-sprayed at the welcoming event at Vancouver Muslim Centre.
[03:57:59.730 --> 03:58:01.391]  So again, you see the bias.
[03:58:01.391 --> 03:58:06.592]  Attacks on migrants, although lamentable, they get reported.
[03:58:06.592 --> 03:58:10.934]  Two guys called Mohammed go to a nightclub in Calgary, try to shoot the place up.
[03:58:11.474 --> 03:58:16.158]  And it's, you know, well this might be gang-related, let's not talk about Islamic terrorism.
[03:58:16.158 --> 03:58:20.102]  Even though we've had numerous similar instances in recent weeks.
[03:58:20.102 --> 03:58:22.024]  Paris last week being one of them.
[03:58:22.024 --> 03:58:25.427]  But that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:25.427 --> 03:58:27.469]  I've been your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:30.392]  Alex Jones will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow.
[03:58:30.392 --> 03:58:33.655]  And we've got InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight.
[03:58:33.655 --> 03:58:34.595]  Thanks for joining us.
