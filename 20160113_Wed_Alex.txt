[02:00.440 --> 02:04.320]  that you had officials needed to do research on the matter are they
[02:04.320 --> 02:09.240]  arrogantly bragging or are they really that stupid it appears that you and

[10:06.320 --> 10:13.800]  gonna break down the over the top state of the Union address again once my
[10:13.800 --> 10:17.440]  children went to bed last night once I was done playing board games with them
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.960]  and doing their homework and things like that I then watched it taped and it was
[10:23.960 --> 10:27.600]  really hard to watch I had a transcript in front of me so I fast forwarded
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.960]  through the parts that I had already read it's really hard to analyze something
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.920]  like this when everything he said was a distortion a twisted lie or a complete
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.520]  ass backwards fraud excuse my French it's just true but we're gonna be getting
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.200]  into that obviously first today we have another big sneak peek of the big
[10:46.200 --> 10:49.240]  interview with Lewis Farrakhan next week where Lewis Farrakhan talks about race
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.520]  war in America this is exclusive and really should be in news me making
[10:53.520 --> 10:58.960]  clip scary Jackson's put out a very important really revolutionary nine
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.280]  minute video on the second amendment something that's a major game changer is
[11:03.280 --> 11:10.320]  the term with 3d printable guns the actual receiver system to print the
[11:10.320 --> 11:13.600]  receivers and things is out there and so that's me coming up in the fourth
[11:13.600 --> 11:22.400]  hour today it is a big broadcast and then we have headlines like this
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.160]  Obama's chief of staff promises is a quote audacious executive action in the
[11:29.160 --> 11:36.160]  final year I'm gonna get into the state of the Union right now but first I just
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.440]  love the trolls and and the reason I mentioned the trolls is that if you
[11:40.440 --> 11:44.640]  understand trolls on YouTube or trolls on Facebook or trolls that are on
[11:44.640 --> 11:50.960]  info wars.com or prisonplanet.com over the years we've done reports on this I'm
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.800]  gonna do one again and show how many of the trolls are actually bots and are
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.440]  real people but they will spam the site with program bots coming from the same
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.920]  IP address and it's institutional it's governmental it is PR firms and of course
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.560]  that's been in the news for a decade it's intensifying the federal government
[12:13.560 --> 12:17.760]  legalized spending billions a year in domestic propaganda last year in early
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.200]  2015 and of course the trolls will say that's not true but it's in the
[12:22.200 --> 12:25.840]  Washington Post very proudly saying the CIA will work you know to control the
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.400]  media and put lies out that's a good thing you know they went on to say how
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.320]  wonderful it was and that was in foreign affairs a section of the Washington
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.280]  Post you pull that up audit shows Hillary Clinton has the most fake Twitter
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.880]  followers of course upwards of what's 70 something percent of fakes I mean this
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.360]  is just how they operate but I loved it because we like cultural victories and
[12:49.360 --> 12:56.480]  when we have a big director on or we have a big actor on or we learn that
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.200]  Kurt Russell's a pro-second amendment 1776 or is I'm not liberal I'm not
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.400]  conservative I'm a 1776 or I'm George Washington lover you know and we of
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.920]  course confirm he's a listener and so many others and you find out that you know
[13:10.920 --> 13:16.920]  the dude's a listener yes I mean mr. Lebowski himself it just shows how
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.480]  popular the Liberty movement is not just the metrics that we're now reaching
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.920]  more than 20 million people a week I don't want to say 28 million it just
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.920]  sounds so crazy in fact we're looking at the metrics it's even more wild than
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.440]  that so we're gonna have a bunch of experts come in and look at it all but
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.480]  the graphs are like this last six months just straight up it is meteoric and so
[13:40.480 --> 13:46.520]  Chris Carter comes out in the entertainment weekly and other publications
[13:46.520 --> 13:52.000]  and says my new shows not really mainly UFOs it's mainly chemtrails police
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.160]  state world government UN and it's based on info wars and Alex Jones that's the
[13:57.160 --> 14:04.080]  main focus and Alex Jones will be a a character on the show of a different name
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.560]  and it's in entertainment weekly it's in the news it's just another side of the
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.160]  fact that our info so successful it's breaking through like that and that Chris
[14:13.160 --> 14:18.840]  Carter would do a major hat tip and say he's not right we he's libertarian and
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.840]  you know I think the UN takeovers a real threat I think global government's a
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.040]  real issue I mean he'd be basically endorsed us very exciting and I
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.160]  interviewed one of the cast of the show before who came to my house six seven
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.120]  like I say eight years ago sweating about eight years ago now Dean Haglin
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.600]  literally she wanted to tell me in person what he witnessed and that Chris
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.640]  Carter was freaked out by what he'd seen happen with the CIA so I knew that he
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.600]  told me no no Carter's where your work but you know that's eight years ago you're
[14:45.600 --> 14:51.280]  coming oh yeah whatever and then the trolls are on info wars and on Google
[14:51.280 --> 14:56.880]  everywhere and it's a bot doing it because I mean it's saying it's a lie the
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.040]  show isn't based on Alex Jones he's a liar he's been caught in a what was the
[15:02.040 --> 15:09.080]  latest meme they put out a Brian Williams moment just like we have video of
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.480]  Chris Carter I didn't even know about this yesterday I didn't even watch it you
[15:12.480 --> 15:16.280]  think I'd watch videos you know about our own show where they're saying it on
[15:16.280 --> 15:22.440]  video so I'm not gonna talk about it again but but later I'll play that clip
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.280]  we're where the producers of the show talk about your character based on
[15:26.280 --> 15:31.400]  Alex Jones it's just it's like Obama saying no one wants your guns or you can
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.840]  keep your doctor and it's gonna be free and and and raising the debt limit
[15:35.840 --> 15:39.920]  doesn't raise the debt limit and you sit here and then they look at you with a
[15:39.920 --> 15:43.760]  straight face and go you're crazy because you've got the 50 or so clips
[15:43.760 --> 15:48.400]  where he promised not to come after our guns but that's what the trolls do
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.960]  because they're PR firms and then they hope to get weak-minded parrots to
[15:52.960 --> 16:00.000]  regurgitate and repeat what they chirp in a snowball and it's just wow to
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.040]  really have criminal corporations and our government illegally using our money
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.640]  to do this and that's why they're so discredited I mean how discredited are
[16:08.640 --> 16:15.280]  the trolls whether it's Obama the chief troll the trolling chief or Hillary the
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.680]  troll saying they're losing the info war or the grass roots trolls and the FBI
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.280]  informants of the rest of them I mean what are you gonna do when Chris Carter
[16:25.280 --> 16:27.800]  does more interviews saying it's based on me you're just gonna say it's not true
[16:27.800 --> 16:31.520]  and then people know you're a liar that's why I've said we want to engage
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.360]  entertainment more because that's really where the big fight is happening
[16:36.360 --> 16:40.440]  we've won the news war drudge drudge has won the news war world that daily's won
[16:40.440 --> 16:45.080]  the news war daily callers won the news war when we're really winning as true
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.800]  liberals libertarians that means more your tax money more freedom more private
[16:49.800 --> 16:55.240]  property more family rights that's liberal means more more knowledge more
[16:55.240 --> 16:59.360]  info more freedom they call that right-wing fascist evil then they call
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.440]  total control of total tyranny language control everything else liberal and
[17:03.440 --> 17:10.480]  loving see how that works it's an inversion of reality so we're dealing
[17:10.480 --> 17:15.440]  with all this and then I'm watching it and I just said you know what about half
[17:15.440 --> 17:19.480]  way through the state of the Union I said I can't watch this I'm going to bed
[17:19.480 --> 17:23.640]  it gave me a headache and so I read the transcript now I'm gonna play some of
[17:23.640 --> 17:28.840]  the clips here so it's more tolerable for everybody but he says I've done a great
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.960]  job with the veterans it's on record it's much worse than it ever was with
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.360]  actual official death list of people not to treat I mean just totally illegal
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.640]  war crime Nazi Germany level stuff on record I'm not just saying that that's
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.600]  what this is with a computer that decides when to kill you so humans can all say
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.040]  they didn't know what was happening just like a Nazi Germany is from by the same
[17:51.040 --> 17:58.440]  company IBM cannot cannot make this up this is the real X files and then he goes
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.080]  on to say that justice will be done they will defeat the ISIS terrorists who he
[18:03.080 --> 18:08.040]  openly ran and created with Hillary and Trump's exposing that and then he goes
[18:08.040 --> 18:13.560]  on and says anyone who says the economy is declining is lying I mean the Royal
[18:13.560 --> 18:17.320]  Bank of Scotland other central banks world leaders George Soros's boss are
[18:17.320 --> 18:23.360]  all saying get ready for depression our experts are saying that and he just says
[18:23.360 --> 18:29.680]  we're the best we have we've just it's the best ever cookies and cream and it
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.880]  goes on and oh then he goes we got to fight the rich people and income
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.960]  problems and income inequity when he's telling people they can't have
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.760]  air conditioners or cars and be poor when he's worth you know $50 million that
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.440]  Clinton's worth hundreds of millions his bosses control trillions that they're
[18:46.440 --> 18:51.320]  taking over the markets to make us poor and then he engages in class warfare in a
[18:51.320 --> 18:59.880]  capital building surrounded by fascist regalia it's just the epitome of
[18:59.880 --> 19:10.680]  absurdist satire it is ridiculous squared so I'm gonna play some of those
[19:10.680 --> 19:13.600]  clips in the next segment then Larry Nichols is coming on we'll play more
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.040]  clips throughout that get into what he expects Hillary to do it are we seeing
[19:17.040 --> 19:20.960]  the beginning of the fall of Hillary or will he say this is part of the underdog
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.360]  thing I don't think so he's a smart guy I grew most what she says but I think
[19:25.360 --> 19:29.040]  she's close to falling and I think it's cuz she looks physically sick I agree
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.280]  with drugs other analysts she looks like death warmed over I think the wolves are
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.200]  moving in who knows what really going on with old Hillary who disappears for
[19:36.200 --> 19:40.440]  weeks at a time doesn't look like that old goblins doing too well but they've
[19:40.440 --> 19:44.200]  got some life extension technologies for these people so you know like Dick
[19:44.200 --> 19:47.680]  Cheney survives heart problems that nobody else does what's that tell you

[24:24.320 --> 24:28.480]  why not I mean you're gonna lie a thousand times why not lie 10 million
[24:28.480 --> 24:36.480]  times Obama says we need to call ISIS what it is but then won't call it radical
[24:36.480 --> 24:43.120]  Islamic terrorism see everything he says is a lie Obama cites care for veterans
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.840]  a success story from his presidency they admit that he started six seven years
[24:47.840 --> 24:52.440]  ago using the Thomas computers with an algorithm to decide who not to give
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.480]  treatment to even if you were operable and let you die it came out two years
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.240]  ago it was a scandal and then they said oh we're investigating it and then a few
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.800]  months ago the inspector general came out and said it's worse than ever they
[25:06.800 --> 25:11.760]  targeted veterans under Obama and said to the number one terror threat remember
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.480]  the secret document we got seven years ago people didn't believe it and then it
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.960]  came out it was all real and Janet de Poletano big sis said oh yes this is
[25:19.960 --> 25:25.120]  for veterans veterans are the enemy and now we have all the police around the
[25:25.120 --> 25:28.440]  country on video going well the feds gave us these armored vehicles to fight
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.200]  the militias and the constitutionalists is coming war with them and they're
[25:33.200 --> 25:38.080]  busy trying to provocateur that actually happening right on time as you notice so
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.120]  let's go ahead and let's go to Obama what a great job he's done with a friend of
[25:44.120 --> 25:51.560]  the veterans he is here it is it's in that spirit that we have made progress
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.920]  these past seven years that's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.520]  in generations
[26:00.520 --> 26:14.160]  that's how we reformed our health system and reinvented our energy sector
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.840]  that's enough oh yeah they reinvented the energy sector shutting off about half
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.320]  our power plants and only letting his friends operate and massively increased
[26:28.320 --> 26:33.080]  profits while gouging everyone making in Ron look tame oh you're such a nice
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.720]  person thank you for all you did LFA let's go to the next clip Obama's
[26:38.720 --> 26:43.720]  cites the care there Obama regrets partisan rancor that he helped stir up
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.280]  we're gonna play this clip Obama the terrorists justice will be done to the
[26:49.280 --> 26:53.000]  group that Donald Trump is exposed we've exposed the military is exposed
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.520]  Hillary and Obama literally created we have the former head of defense
[26:58.520 --> 27:03.200]  intelligence the top general coming out saying we were ordered to create him I
[27:03.200 --> 27:09.040]  probably played general Flynn what over and over again probably 20 times last two
[27:09.040 --> 27:14.440]  months and now he's got other interviews but you say justice will be done are
[27:14.440 --> 27:21.640]  your ears burning when you're talking about yourself to the very kingpin the
[27:21.640 --> 27:27.800]  daddy if anybody's the daddy of ices it's Obama the great-granddaddy is Saudi
[27:27.800 --> 27:34.120]  Arabia and George Soros they they came together to give us this and then you're
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.400]  the daddy and you you and Hillary at the State Department you had your sweet
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.080]  little little jihad baby and now your baby that you give all the weapons to
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.960]  that you feed and protect and try to block the Russians from attacking you're
[27:47.960 --> 27:54.320]  now saying that the justice will be done to your son your son that came out of
[27:54.320 --> 28:00.160]  mommy's tummy let's go ahead and go to that club if you doubt America's
[28:00.160 --> 28:06.640]  commitment or mine to see the justice is done just ask Osama bin Laden
[28:06.640 --> 28:19.080]  the leader of al-qaeda in Yemen last Navy SEALs all you blow up a helicopter
[28:19.080 --> 28:25.720]  of the Benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell when you come after Americans
[28:25.720 --> 28:30.880]  we go after you and it may take time you're coming after our reach has no
[28:30.880 --> 28:37.040]  limits your reach has no limits because you are totally sick okay let's go to
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.200]  the next one let's go to this super whopper I've got another terrorism clip
[28:41.200 --> 28:44.880]  here as well then at the Pentagon admitting that you know he says that
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.200]  they've defeated basically ISIS and that they've been dealt with we'll play
[28:50.200 --> 28:53.000]  that later and then at the Pentagon saying it's worse than ever but
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.600]  everybody already knows about that he just repeated that lie but here's one
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.920]  anyone who says economy is declining is lying let's try to squeeze this in let
[29:02.920 --> 29:10.000]  me start with the economy and a basic fact the United States of America right
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.920]  now has the strongest most durable economy in the world
[29:18.080 --> 29:22.200]  that's true there's a weird way it might be let's let's stop right there and he
[29:22.200 --> 29:25.800]  goes on to say how great it is overall it's petering on collapse but of all the
[29:25.800 --> 29:33.800]  Ponzi schemes you could say maybe maybe it's in third or fourth but when it
[29:33.800 --> 29:38.200]  implodes it's one of the worst and then here's CNN 2016 will be the
[29:38.200 --> 29:43.680]  cataclysmic year shell everything but Obama says the point is everything's
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.040]  wonderful is the overall lie so it's a lie in general another big fat stinking
[29:48.040 --> 29:55.200]  whopper we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[34:37.760 --> 34:41.440]  the Royal Bank of Scotland and I saw the trolls again not that I even try to
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.520]  follow them I just see it saying it's a lie that wasn't said nothing's
[34:45.520 --> 34:49.600]  happening he's lying fear porn they have really turned the heat up which is
[34:49.600 --> 34:55.160]  excellent because it's so discrediting when they just lie and say that we're
[34:55.160 --> 35:00.360]  lying please continue and accelerate and spread the word about us even more and
[35:00.360 --> 35:04.960]  I want to thank Rachel Maddow for being in over 500 plus papers over two days a
[35:04.960 --> 35:08.880]  few weeks ago lying about me and just just all of you it's just really
[35:08.880 --> 35:12.000]  fantastic how you're destroying yourselves in front of everyone and
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.160]  Obama saying two plus two equals five and saying he's done a great job with the
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.360]  veterans and how great they're doing with their treatment when he's
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.800]  killing them on record with direct orders through the Thomas computers from
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.840]  IBM and all the rest of it so we're gonna be going over that we're gonna be
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.120]  going over more of the state of the Union Trump says Germans will riot
[35:32.120 --> 35:39.280]  overthrow Merkel I have an extremely important report part two of the excerpts

[35:47.480 --> 35:52.680]  reach out to Lewis Faircon and trying to have communities come together and not

[35:57.240 --> 36:01.400]  this country and Faircon agrees that that is what people want that that's
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.360]  being pushed and it's very very dangerous so we plan that clip here in a

[40:20.080 --> 40:23.640]  station a hundred bucks you don't know how the globalists are trying to bankrupt
[40:23.640 --> 40:27.440]  talk radio big advertisers are coming in and saying get rid of all libertarian
[40:27.440 --> 40:31.680]  patriot talk this has come out in the trade publications as well and we will
[40:31.680 --> 40:35.440]  really give you massive institutional funding for stuff that doesn't even make
[40:35.440 --> 40:42.240]  them money you know you it's kind of like you see Lockheed Martin ads on CNN for
[40:42.240 --> 40:49.520]  30 years they're not selling you know stealth bombers to the public that is a
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.200]  payoff to the media to go along with it not criticize it just like Archery
[40:53.200 --> 40:58.320]  Daniels Midland Company ads about satellites that has it's all PR with the
[40:58.320 --> 41:03.240]  system it's their 20 pieces 30 pieces of silver so you have to understand that
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.440]  folks we have to finance the liberty movement doesn't matter we get the
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.280]  ratings it doesn't matter we're popular doesn't matter we shatter all the
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.320]  records and other shows like it do as well people are hungry for freedom it's
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.600]  called Americana it's called Renaissance but the system doesn't want it coming to
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.480]  market and being on the store shelves of intellectual debate and ideas because
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.280]  no one wants the globalist poison everything with these globalists is
[41:28.280 --> 41:31.520]  about controlling markets and they want to shut down markets and have
[41:31.520 --> 41:37.700]  monopoly capitalism of ideas of culture of religion one-world religion all of
[41:37.700 --> 41:44.240]  it the state is God the state is mommy the state is daddy it's bad news and I
[41:44.240 --> 41:47.240]  reached out to Lewis Faircon I think Lewis Faircon obviously has said things
[41:47.240 --> 41:54.640]  that I think are terrible you know about certain religious or racial groups in
[41:54.640 --> 41:58.560]  the past I disagree with that but I don't want to hate the person he said a
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.400]  lot of good things I agree with on vaccines the Federal Reserve and I've
[42:02.400 --> 42:05.720]  seen him moderate quite a bit over the years and I felt like he was growing and
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.760]  we all grow I said things I disagreed with 15 years ago and so we reached out
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.000]  to him and they said yeah we're big listeners please come out I went out to
[42:14.000 --> 42:21.320]  the original nation of Islam headquarters in Phoenix Arizona where Elijah
[42:21.320 --> 42:26.640]  Muhammad his teacher live it's very historical very interesting and spent
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.840]  45 minutes with him privately talking two hours and so interviewing him and
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.320]  then three hours at dinner and he was just kept talking that guy had so much
[42:35.320 --> 42:38.520]  energy I want to stay all night but my kids were calling wanted me to talk to
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.080]  him so I had to leave I wish I could have stayed the next day I wanted to
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.240]  come back talk to him more but he was busy but a very very very very very
[42:45.240 --> 42:50.040]  interesting person a lot of energy and what a coup would be for humanity if we
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.200]  got Lewis Faircon talking about more about he talked about it 30 years ago
[42:53.200 --> 42:58.200]  eugenics sterilization what's in the vaccines abortion targeting blacks he
[42:58.200 --> 43:01.920]  does that and actually find he does do that but he only gets covered in the
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.880]  media when he says something really incendiary that I disagree with you know
[43:06.880 --> 43:11.320]  like they kill us we go out we stalk and we kill them he said the full quote was
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.880]  the cops that actually do it well I get that but the point is that's just gonna
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.640]  start a giant war I get the fundamental level of some bad cop killed my son or
[43:18.640 --> 43:22.160]  daughter and got away with it I would I would have a real problem with that I
[43:22.160 --> 43:26.320]  mean I get the statement the point is Lewis Faircon for all his rhetoric
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.520]  didn't put cancer viruses in the vaccines and if we can come together on
[43:30.520 --> 43:34.880]  what we agree about it's it's a major coup for Liberty this video just went
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.280]  live at info wars dot com if you are a radio listener and want to actually see
[43:40.280 --> 43:49.480]  it it's up in the top tiles at info wars dot com with Lewis Faircon and the new
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.080]  interview and again I just saw it up at the top I don't see it there now maybe
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.760]  you guys can refresh in there and I hope it has already moved out of the tiles
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.280]  was just up there a few minutes ago we got so much news breaking though where
[44:02.280 --> 44:09.320]  he talks about stopping a race war in America and pointing out that it's
[44:09.320 --> 44:12.960]  basically suicidal for everybody involved and it's totally stupid and it
[44:12.960 --> 44:18.440]  won't fix any of our problems Lewis Faircon race war is suicide up on info
[44:18.440 --> 44:23.480]  wars dot com we're going to tweet that out right now new Farrakhan video race
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.880]  war is suicide we should probably just tweet Lewis Farrakhan on race war he
[44:28.880 --> 44:32.520]  also says a race war is coming if they have their have their way so I think of
[44:32.520 --> 44:35.480]  the best headlines probably Lewis Farrakhan a race war is coming I haven't
[44:35.480 --> 44:38.840]  even seen the clip yet I was there when I did the interview I've been so busy I
[44:38.840 --> 44:42.520]  haven't watched it yet and so we're gonna see exactly how much of the interview
[44:42.520 --> 44:48.040]  this is right now it's about five minutes long here it is so if the federal
[44:48.040 --> 44:59.560]  government will not intercede in our affairs then we must rise up and kill
[44:59.560 --> 45:29.520]  those who kill as a student of
[45:29.520 --> 45:37.520]  my teacher I think I should always be dignified in my expression although
[45:37.520 --> 45:46.120]  sometimes in passion I lose it and so I thought about you know when they said
[45:46.120 --> 45:55.200]  Farrakhan he wants to kill all white people and he's advocating ten thousand
[45:55.200 --> 46:03.600]  fearless men to go out and kill white people as though I'm insane that's
[46:03.600 --> 46:11.800]  insanity and I've been teaching for 60 years sir and no one who follows me has
[46:11.800 --> 46:20.600]  ever gone out and killed a white person harm the Jewish person bomb the
[46:20.600 --> 46:26.720]  synagogue or even put some swastika on a synagogue because that's against our
[46:26.720 --> 46:36.160]  religion to deface a house of worship I'm saying that to say this I when I said
[46:36.160 --> 46:45.960]  in Florida you know naming all the blacks that got shot down and according to
[46:45.960 --> 46:54.560]  something I just read where one black man every 28 hours is shot by policemen
[46:54.560 --> 47:00.720]  and young black men are nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed
[47:00.720 --> 47:07.040]  by police officers in 2015 according to the findings of the Guardian
[47:07.040 --> 47:17.040]  newspaper 1,134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers happened last
[47:17.040 --> 47:26.400]  year as a black man who loves my people I'm grieved not only at police killing
[47:26.400 --> 47:34.640]  us but I am grieved at our killing of each other which sometimes is 10 times
[47:34.640 --> 47:44.280]  more than what white policemen have done so in my passion against that and this
[47:44.280 --> 47:51.360]  has been gradually increasing with me over the years I said if the federal
[47:51.360 --> 47:59.280]  government does not in to see to see that justice comes to us because that's
[47:59.280 --> 48:06.640]  the government's job it's not my job to kill my killer it's the government's job
[48:06.640 --> 48:13.440]  to arrest the killer bring them before court of law and punish them for their
[48:13.440 --> 48:21.240]  misdeed but when the government fails to do it what are we to do we have to
[48:21.240 --> 48:31.560]  defend our lives and so I said stop them wherever you find them not everybody
[48:31.560 --> 48:38.960]  just the ones that kill us out of the law of justice if the government won't
[48:38.960 --> 48:45.960]  arrest them and do that somehow we're gonna ultimately do that and then it
[48:45.960 --> 48:54.360]  leads to what they'll say it's a race war no we are not in any position at all
[48:54.360 --> 49:06.240]  to engage in a race war it's ridiculous it's destructive it's suicidal however
[49:06.240 --> 49:15.560]  persecution in the Quran it says is worse than slaughter and you know you
[49:15.560 --> 49:29.360]  talk about 1776 and you are so right but in 1776 America had enough the
[49:29.360 --> 49:38.320]  colonial people under Britain had enough so when Patrick Henry said give us
[49:38.320 --> 49:45.640]  liberty or we are willing to pay the price which is death you force people
[49:45.640 --> 49:53.440]  into that when government fails to do its job to redress the grievance of the
[49:53.440 --> 50:00.760]  people who are suffering next Wednesday we premiere the full hour and a half
[50:00.760 --> 50:06.840]  interview here at info wars during the four-hour radio transmission the full
[50:06.840 --> 50:12.080]  interview will be posted up to info wars calm and prison planet calm and notice
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.120]  how what Farrakhan was just saying ties in with Donald Trump saying we have his
[50:15.120 --> 50:20.600]  video clip coming up after the break Trump Germans will riot overthrow
[50:20.600 --> 50:27.120]  Merkel and that story is a Kurt Nemo article up on info wars calm needs to go
[50:27.120 --> 50:33.720]  viral the Farrakhan interview is the top tile on info wars as well it's just not
[50:33.720 --> 50:38.200]  refreshing in here for me for some reason but up now it's up there at info

[50:42.320 --> 50:45.400]  situation that could be a Trojan horse here they want to make it black against
[50:45.400 --> 50:49.440]  white in Europe they import radical Muslims to get a big fight going and
[50:49.440 --> 50:52.840]  then bring in martial law on the back of that they already have by the way
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.520]  that's already come true they've already they call it civil emergency and

[54:33.240 --> 54:38.640]  your skin like I'll tell you going and meeting with Lewis Farrakhan and
[54:38.640 --> 54:45.280]  trying to work with one of the biggest black leaders in the world means up
[54:45.280 --> 54:51.800]  there on the top two or three he's well-known and respected in Africa many
[54:51.800 --> 54:54.680]  other places he goes and speaks to crowds of hundreds of thousands in places
[54:54.680 --> 55:01.000]  like Nigeria and he's speaking out about nationalism there and against
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.200]  tribalism to bring people together to make their country strong so the IMF and
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.320]  World Bank can't rob them I want Africa to do well I have good will does that
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.320]  mean I don't like big groups of racist black people out there that have a chip
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.600]  on their shoulder and think I hate them because the Democratic Party taught them
[55:17.600 --> 55:27.640]  that no I don't like it but I'm not an idiot and I'm not a tribalist and
[55:27.640 --> 55:32.240]  Farrakhan agree with this he said you have to defend your own group you have
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.720]  to stand up for yourselves but at the same time groups have to start talking
[55:35.720 --> 55:41.840]  to each other and not being played against one another and so that is some
[55:41.840 --> 55:49.160]  major diplomacy that's a big deal and I assure you the establishment doesn't
[55:49.160 --> 55:55.360]  want that to happen now in the case of the Muslims being brought in who are
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.920]  Sunnis radical Wahhabist they can't even get along with other Sunnis or Shiite
[56:00.920 --> 56:05.240]  or Christians they kill everybody and that's who almost every I mean for
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.320]  every couple hundred Sunni Wahhabist they bring and there might be a Shiite
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.600]  or Christian there have been countless articles on that they'll bring in two
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.720]  hundred and forty nine radical Muslims and they'll bring in one Christian I
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.440]  mean those are the numbers different reports they'll bring in a hundred and
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.440]  sixty something a thousand something only bring in a couple Christians the
[56:26.440 --> 56:33.360]  numbers are insane because they know there's no compatibility with that you
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.000]  talk about not even so much racist but tribal those Muslims come in and they
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  say I don't want to be around Germans I don't be around anybody else we need to
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.560]  kick the Jews out of this country and the Liberals are all yeah yeah yeah and I
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.240]  noticed the left really getting into anti-Semitism the last ten years which is
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.880]  just a red herring the average Jews and running around doing anything wrong
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.880]  much more than a Mexican running around or a German or whatever are there some
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.880]  big organized crime syndicates headed up by Jews absolutely Goldman Sachs is there
[57:01.880 --> 57:08.320]  a Jewish mafia that set up the ADL on record with 1913 absolutely am I against
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.120]  those mafia's absolutely but then when they get attacked they make it all about
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.640]  the Jewish community as a whole this is how they fool folks the globalist the
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.840]  same globalist that funded Hitler this is not a Jewish conspiracy but regardless
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.840]  of what's behind the conspiracy can we all agree to be against world government
[57:24.840 --> 57:30.000]  against race war against Trojan horse and to be against it you've got to stop
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.600]  them bringing the Trojan horse in and that's the radical Muslims kicked out
[57:33.600 --> 57:37.600]  of Syria let's go to the club of Donald Trump saying Germans will riot overthrow
[57:37.600 --> 57:43.560]  Merkel in Cologne Cologne never had a problem Cologne Germany okay everything's
[57:43.560 --> 57:49.200]  fine everything's nice clean beautiful no problem now they're having riots they're
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.520]  having rapes they haven't they never the New Year's Eve has have you heard about
[57:52.520 --> 57:56.520]  the New Year's Eve was like a disaster and the German people are gonna riot the
[57:56.520 --> 57:59.200]  German people are gonna end up overthrowing this woman I don't know what
[57:59.200 --> 58:02.840]  the hell she's thinking but I have millions of people pouring into Germany
[58:02.840 --> 58:05.600]  and now they're not stopping them now I guess they're gonna have to stop because
[58:05.600 --> 58:13.720]  the German people aren't gonna put up so there you go and Trump number three four
[58:13.720 --> 58:17.640]  months ago said oh Alcatraz killing these poor refugees we got to bring them in
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.520]  then he got educated real quick he said I was wrong I didn't know they were
[58:20.520 --> 58:24.560]  actually the Alcatraz people themselves we've been lied to stop them all and
[58:24.560 --> 58:28.760]  then he's the biggest racist on the planet see how that works I mean Trump
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.000]  really listens to people Trump really listens to his advisor
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.480]  Trump was told in a day that we were critical of that and that you were
[58:36.480 --> 58:41.160]  critical of it I mean he's really responsive folks I mean they call it
[58:41.160 --> 58:46.880]  radical what he said is common sense GCA stay with us second hour visit GCMI.com

[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:20.960]  Nichols who was a top Clinton insider and he was a whistle on everything from
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.640]  whitewater to you name it has got huge intel straight ahead of what Obama's
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:35.000]  master plan is oh Biden oh Biden which is the continuation of Obama the fact
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.840]  that Biden is a ghost candidate for Osama I mean Obama that was not a
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.800]  Freudian slip another attempted lame humor you got to have some gallows
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.600]  humor with this stuff going on because it is crazy and then of course we'll also
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.400]  look at the global economy I shot a video this morning when I thought I was
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:01:02.280]  going to be late to work because of a big story I was working on and I
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.080]  basically spoke about this pretty eloquently it's titled top bank the
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:17.760]  collapse has begun and in it I point out that the trolls are all over YouTube all
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.320]  over info wars saying that the Royal Bank of Scotland very important central
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.880]  bank and a bunch of others are coming out seeing a global collapse is beginning
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.120]  and that sell everything it's gonna be as bad as the Great Depression of the
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.840]  20s just what our guests bent said last week just what our other guests are
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.360]  saying now I'm not saying this is imminent this is what the experts are
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.560]  saying and all I know is what we have is untenable but they just love the fact
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.400]  that I mean they play this game like Obama saying our veterans are doing
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.320]  great I fixed the VA it's worse than ever our economy is wonderful anybody
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.720]  that says it isn't as a liar these are quotes from the state of the Union last
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.240]  night and then I realized they're targeting people that aren't awake yet
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.880]  and that there's the appeal to authority to have the president just saying that
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:16.040]  the sky isn't blue at high noon in Colorado I mean it is but there's the
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.760]  video top bank the collapse is begun and it's a good breakdown that I engage in
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:30.000]  and I'm gonna cover it more coming up but just type in cataclysmic year repeat
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.520]  of the Great Depression type this into Google News Great Depression repeat of
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.520]  Great Depression cataclysmic year sell everything and you'll see a bunch of
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.560]  top analysts and heads of central banks and people saying it but I mean here's
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:49.000]  the seeing in and again I'm not saying this to the bot trolls they're bought and
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.560]  their bots they've been paid for and their bots but but humans load the bots
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.720]  we can track it I'm like keep telling my crew I want to do in the report on this
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.880]  they've done one in years where we show the IP addresses and show they have
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.600]  fake debates with each other and say racist stuff about black people racist
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.440]  stuff about white people and then you know the standard juju juju I like you
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.960]  just do that and I think it's really informative though once we understand
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.720]  what they're doing that this is government and corporate bots that are
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.120]  doing this I mean I mean they they call them sock puppets they call them bull
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.320]  horns that's the different government handle terms they use for this but we
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.480]  need to be aware of this and those same bots are running around saying kill the
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.000]  police the police are our enemy and there is a big problem with some of the
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.800]  police in this country there's a problem with America there's a problem of
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.120]  government corruption but the police are the lowest level of this and not where
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.680]  you reform it you reform it at the top you go after who's doing the training
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.920]  you go after the problem you don't sit there and try to start a bloody civil
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.980]  war that makes the civil war be illegitimate and makes the revolution
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.680]  illegitimate and violent when we're having a cultural libertarian renaissance
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:07.480]  revolution against their whole Maoist system so I hammer look out for false
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.760]  flags don't join the system in just saying kill police admit there's a jihad
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.640]  going on that the globalists have opened the doors for to bring in martial law
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.280]  admit they're bankrupting us by design and admit who's behind it so as the
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.880]  collapse unfolds the New World Order gets the blame and doesn't get a giant
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.160]  power grab out of it of trillions more in banker bailouts and regulatory power
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.640]  to shut down their competition and to take over society here's CNN

[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.880]  Obama is removing obstacles for driverless cars pushing back against
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.720]  state regulation clearing the road for Google after Google cars were involved
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.800]  in 11 accidents in six years the California DMV proposed new state
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.200]  regulations to require a human a steering wheel throttle and brake pedals on
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.480]  California roads can't have that Obama says can't have a patchwork estate
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.960]  regulations for robot cars Google cars accident rate would work out to 83
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:31.440]  accidents over 45 years of driving how many humans do you know that have had
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.680]  83 accidents would you get in their car but don't worry Obama's just offering
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.200]  you a choice your own personal limo where you can just play on social media
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.400]  and leave the driving to them like Obama care with Obama car if you'd like your

[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.840]  around with guns and bombs right everyone's machine gunning blowing up
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.520]  the attacking police stations attacking theaters they won't even call it
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.080]  Islamic terrorism cops are getting shot in the head I walk bar I walk bar in
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.520]  Philadelphia media won't say it's Islamic because they want to cause civil
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.160]  disobedience and bring in martial law you're absurd he done it
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.600]  Merkel had the police say no demonstrations against the open borders
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.000]  and they attacked with tear gas two days ago Germans in Cologne they didn't
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.520]  attack the thousands of radical Muslims running around raping think of the
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.200]  magnitude of that you know if you listen to me ten years ago I was all
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.240]  against invading the Middle East of 15 years ago I mean I don't want to
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.680]  clash the civilizations but once it's on once they brought in the most radical
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.880]  usurpers in the Middle East Wahhabist Sunnis and then giving them Stinger
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:21.760]  missiles which they now admit they gave them Hillary and Clinton Hillary and
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.480]  Bill and Obama and Donald Trump comes out and says they created ISIS which is
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.000]  true you heard it here with Colonel Schaefer and others four years ago on the
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  whole ISIS al-Qaeda situation before they called it ISIS what are they going
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.320]  to do because Trump just keeps telling the truth and it doesn't work are they
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.520]  gonna try to assassinate him what dirty tricks are they gonna run what is
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.040]  Obama's plan financing the Muslim Brotherhood again Wahhabist Sunnis to
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.280]  overthrow Egypt to overthrow Libya to turn it over to al-Qaeda ISIS spreading
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.360]  to Afghanistan ISIS spreading to Libya ISIS taking over Libya the Defense
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.280]  Department says this week and then Obama comes out in the state of the union and
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.040]  says we're beating ISIS they've been defeated and the economy is great and
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.240]  then and then Joe Biden is circling around in the background according to
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.800]  our guest and now that's coming out he said this six months ago as the shadow
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.440]  candidate ready to slide in Larry Nichols the former top Clinton insider
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.840]  the guy that helped release the info that became the Clinton Chronicles the guy
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.440]  that Bill Clinton's told the New York Times he's the most worried about in this
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.880]  campaign is here with his expertise you should run their campaigns to tell you
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.200]  the dirty tricks they're planning to run what does it mean when Soros and move on
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.960]  says they're endorsing Sanders what does it mean when the Washington Post comes
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.760]  out last week's and reports on Clinton's bimbos that were raped not just the
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.880]  eruptions are we about to see the fall of Hillary well if one guy out there knows
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.240]  because I don't think anybody completely knows it's fluid my opinion it's Larry
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.240]  Nichols and Larry hope you're had a good Christmas and things hope you're
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.120]  feeling better I know you've been quite ill with cancer but God bless you for
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.560]  your courage you join us via video Skype today on this Wednesday edition you
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.680]  heard my little us set up there what say a few oh it's it's coming just like I
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.800]  was afraid it would you got to watch old Biden remember when I told you that
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.160]  there's a problem Obama wants to either cash in I'm sorry about that there's
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.440]  somebody out back Obama wants to either cash in the FEMA provisional government
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:30.920]  but if not that then he wants to become Secretary General of the UN now for him
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:36.680]  to be Secretary General of the UN and he's got to do a couple of moves number
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.200]  one gotta get rid of Hillary because if she gets elected Bill will be Secretary
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:51.840]  General to the UN not Obama and then he's got to get Vice President Biden he's
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.560]  got to be the candidate now he's been a ghost candidate all along Alex we used
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.920]  to do this all the time why would he get in Alex why would he get in the race
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.480]  now because every day he's in he gets whacked at all you gotta do just that
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.280]  tight he can come in fresh with high approval writings and in trample
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.200]  Hillary if he needs to or Bernie Sanders or whoever well they'll get rid of
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.680]  Hillary all they've got to do in case people want to know all they've got to
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:23.440]  do is have the FBI or the Lynch indict Hillary on a felony criminal charge and
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.200]  then she has to suspend her candidates and notice she just got caught again
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.480]  lying about the emails she said there were no more classified she's red-handed
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.560]  could easily be sent to the federal pen right now that's right and when she
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.960]  suspends her candidate you know who picks who's going to be the vice
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.080]  president the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party it'll be the dem
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:52.240]  DNC executive committee who do you think if you're sitting there with without
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.240]  Hillary you got Bernie Sanders or you got Joe Biden Joe Biden all the way
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:04.480]  they're going to put Biden in now that's the plan B plan a is to do just what
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.200]  he's been trying to do and this is why I've always said to you Alex our best
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.280]  friend right now crazy as it seems is Bill and Hillary Clinton you know we've
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:21.480]  got two choices if it's Hillary we got communism if it's Obama we got Islam and
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:28.640]  at this point the best thing to do is make sure make sure Obama doesn't get to
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.040]  stay now just six months ago you brought up these scenarios but said you wanted
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.160]  to bring Hillary down I'll be honest I think America's been poisoned by
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.840]  communism doesn't recognize it and and that's what's harder to beat I think
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.280]  radical Islam we can actually beat even if we have a jihad president power I
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.280]  don't know if I agree with you on this I think I think radical Islam is easier
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.320]  to beat if we put the clamps down on it right now well it may be it may be I
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.480]  just all I can do is read the p-leaves as I see them and I watch what Obama has
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.240]  the power to do with this country I mean he could literally take the
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.960]  Republicans spin him on did you see CNN and other Democratic groups are now
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.960]  calling for him to declare a civil emergency and just take the guns I mean
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.160]  that when singing ends doing it boy you know you're in trouble that and then you
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.520]  know what happens when he declares a civil emergency you said it every time
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.600]  you've been on for the last year of course you were on 20 years ago as well
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.320]  of 15 years ago but you said watch talk a civil emergency watch talk a civil
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.720]  emergency and they're actually starting to trial below on it right now that's
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:35.360]  exactly right you know Alex we're in more trouble now than we've ever been in
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.560]  everybody can feel it that's the good news though everybody I talked to is
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.680]  waking up the thing that the people have got to do is start spreading the word
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.840]  this this is serious this is not a Larry Nichols and Alex Jones talk and this is
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.400]  serious this is the real deal they're making moves every day every day to just
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.680]  take us down to take our country down of course you're not gonna say we're taking
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.600]  a country down because you've got people like CNN that make it look like it's the
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.880]  thing to do the right thing to do but now it's up to Hillary this game that
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.760]  we're in right now is the battle of the big boys the Clintons versus Obama it's
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.480]  not gonna be pretty it's not gonna be pretty at all but it's down to those
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.200]  two well it's it's happening basically like you said and then of course now
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.040]  they pretty much admit this in the news I mean I'm obviously I think it's a
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.280]  better candidate than Hillary she looks like something's wrong with her you you
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.760]  know Hillary well does she not look ill to you and she disappears for weeks on
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:43.280]  end she's looking bad now I don't know if it's from her being ill but remember
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.360]  Hillary's not Bill Clinton she's not smooth she's not slick and Hillary I
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:56.960]  assure you cannot take Alex getting beat up she can't it goes around having her
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.640]  thugs threatened major comedy clubs that make jokes about her yeah I mean you
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:07.600]  gotta understand with Hillary that's that's her on fire and I believe she's
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.080]  sitting there just a man she wants to tear people's heads off and if it's up to
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.960]  her she will tear people's heads off well sure I mean an aggressive confident
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.440]  man thinks it's a joke when he's being attacked in line about because he knows
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.880]  the truth a lot it is statistically I've noticed true that it's women in power
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.960]  that really flip out the criticism oh you bet you bet well she's the worst she
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:33.880]  is the worst but Alex watch what's going on watch that once last night in the
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.520]  whatever you want to call that thing home on it did watch what he said about
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.800]  Biden he said Biden's gonna cure cancer you could tell he was setting him up he
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.000]  was he was setting him up to be the answer to the problems of the world
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.760]  he's basically like God he's like Jesus he waves a wand and that's exactly
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.120]  what he was doing so you can see it coming Alex you can see it coming you
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.640]  can feel it coming but they got one problem this time you remember when we
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.640]  fought him before it was me you and a handful of other people and full of
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.680]  other programs this time the people are picking up on I agree back in it was the
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.360]  Western Journalism Center you drudge really there was a Newsmax I mean there
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.280]  was nobody there was nobody this time you got to realize the power you have
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.520]  Alex this time now with that power unfortunately but it comes to
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.480]  responsibility you you are drawing the larger audiences when all the other
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.600]  media formats are losing audience and then people are starting I hear it every
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.880]  day Alex I hear people every day say I'm turning off my television one lady said
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.200]  she threw hers out to the garbage she's watching we're having affiliates call us
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.360]  and they want me to lead a national plan to have stations dump national news and

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:18.440]  into that but we want to keep him around as long as possible and he has spent all
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.640]  his money fighting the Clintons I appreciate all you that have been
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.240]  supporting him out there if you want to go to his PayPal and give him a
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.120]  donation that would be a big help in the fight against the globalists and against
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.400]  the Clintons so we'll put that up on screen for TV viewers and I will give
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.440]  out that address to folks I guess at the end of this segment there is Larry
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:48.880]  Nichols 58 Kensington Drive K-E-N-S-I-N-G-T-O-N Drive Conway Arkansas 72034
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.640]  or Nichols live at AOL.com on PayPal Nichols live at AOL.com only got about
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.960]  five minutes left I'll have you back up next week to expand on this Larry because
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.480]  this is the season of the campaign trail obviously but you got cut off by the
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.680]  break I used I guess you know run insurrections and things down on Latin
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.120]  America and things when you're in special forces this is why the Clintons
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.680]  later hired you to run political campaigns here but Larry obviously
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.960]  America is on the war path against this tyranny I see the feds trying to stir
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.840]  up insurrections and stuff out in Oregon it's not working the bunnies are good
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.980]  folks but clearly there's there's there's a lot of operations going on there
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:33.520]  the optics aren't working but I don't think they're gonna give up I think
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.520]  they're gonna push it too far I'm really worried about a false flag Larry well
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.680]  let me tell you one of the tricks that's coming in folks Alex you and your
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:48.680]  audience have got to stop the Republican Party is setting Donald Trump up for
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.520]  example this is the oldest trick we used to use it all the time if you were a
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.080]  Democrat changing your affiliation to Republican if you were the party if you
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:05.680]  were libertarian whatever when you go to change your party affiliation to vote in
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.440]  the Republican primary here's what's in store for you they've got every state
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:16.200]  has its own little quirky rules and so for example New Jersey if you want to
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.560]  change your party affiliation sign up to be a Republican so you can vote for
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:27.560]  Donald Trump in this primary you have to do it 55 days before the election now
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.640]  how many people know that and by the way Jeb Bush and others have said they're
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.280]  going to basically take the delegates and they don't care if Jeb Bush gets 2
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.760]  percent he still thinks he's gonna be given it still and a broker convention
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.800]  as well how do we stop that you stop it by number one we have to beat him at the
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.800]  ballot box we have to start out with Trump Trump has got to survive the first
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.000]  three primary he's got to survive and then he's got a win in a landslide it's
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.120]  hard for him to steal that I know if everybody will check in your state and
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:06.560]  dear God this is so important Oklahoma just 25 days Massachusetts and people are
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.280]  gonna go up and think about this Alex if we don't get this addressed and Trump
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.800]  needs to be doing it more than talking about his plans if we don't do this 30
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:21.400]  to 50% of the votes that show up in Trump's column in the polls he's not
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.200]  gonna get they're not gonna get to count them they're not gonna get to count them
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.120]  and then if he loses those first three states you're gonna landbast him and
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:33.560]  everybody in the world's gonna say he can't possibly win that's step one and
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:39.000]  then step two is just like we said Alex we've got to find some place so that we
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.240]  can organize so that people can bond together because they're gonna hit us
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.640]  they're gonna hit us with all kinds of disinformation they're gonna try to scare
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.760]  everybody I agree and they're upping their troll operations dirty tricks right
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:58.360]  now it is a circus around here but it's very exciting and so people just need
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.720]  to be extremely vigilant active but the good news is the mainstream media is
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.240]  discredited this is not 1995 or so right when they get his federal building and
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.440]  blaming on us and do you think the establishment knows that they're out of
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:16.640]  bullets and and knows how weak they are yes I know they do and remember if you
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:22.280]  want to put it in the venue of a war remember this to win a war you gotta win
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:27.120]  battles you don't just jump right out and take the war and win it now remember
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:34.360]  the first step we've got to take is ensure Trump that he gets it this guy
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:42.480]  just broke up and then when we do that then we organize and he would be a
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.080]  hell of a thing to organize around I'm just worried that some of his consultants
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.400]  and advisors hey they haven't been saying anything about the trickery with
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.800]  the votes they've not mentioned it and that's the key to his entire well I
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.160]  know stone one of his top advisors is worried about it and Trump's involved
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.000]  and understands it I just don't think they think it's time to roll that out
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.520]  yet but behind the scenes we've been working on it but I saw when we play
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.720]  that Trump clip when you first came on you got excited when we're watching him
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.960]  you know you you really like Trump don't you you think he's for real that was my
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.520]  question to Larry and a Skype just broke up again that is such an important
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.440]  question we'll see you Larry Nichols Skype comes back up a wonderful
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:28.440]  technology obviously but we lost it right there when he comes back asking
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:31.560]  what he really thinks of Trump and until Nichols sit around for 30 minutes
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.560]  unless he's got to go and I'll have him on for that five minutes at the start of
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:39.400]  the next hour to finish up we have Norm Singleton from the head of campaign
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.960]  for Liberty joining us talk about Audit the Fed Rand Paul and more Rand Paul's

[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:32.400]  one thing I see out there just happened today in Tehran they're burning down the
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:37.400]  Saudi embassy you see that now what that is is Iran wants to take over Saudi
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.400]  Arabia they always have they want the oil okay they've always wanted that they
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:47.640]  have a bunch of dishonest people they've created ISIS Hillary Clinton created
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:56.040]  ISIS with Obama created with Obama it is so stunning to have the Republican
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.480]  presidential front-runner Donald J. Trump's you know saying that and saying
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.680]  it again over the last few weeks but it's Rand Paul and then Ted Cruz following
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:09.000]  his lead three years ago saying don't become Al Qaeda's Air Force that then
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.880]  became what was left of Al Qaeda the new ISIS that grew to hundreds of thousands
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.000]  and Rand Paul will be joining us to talk election 2016 and audit the Fed at like
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.040]  15 after next hour and I can't believe that John Kasich the governor polling
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.120]  with like two points is in the debate but Rand Paul isn't when he was the
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.120]  presidential front-runner six months ago and I don't believe these polls there's
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.720]  even articles out saying they've been skewed the polls and and they're gonna
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.560]  do it to other people too I've told folks I'd be happy with a Rand Paul a Ted
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.680]  Cruz or Donald Trump anything over Hillary I've never been a lesser two
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.840]  evils but there's no lesser of anything here with Hillary or Biden or that
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:35:00.760]  socialist Bernie Sanders it's amazing but let's cut past the puppets and get to
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.520]  who really runs things the private central banks that operate through the
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.880]  private Federal Reserve the consortium the Royal Bank of Scotland all of these
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.440]  fronts the central banks run the world now are appointing leaders they've
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.120]  taken over and it's the private Federal Reserve in this country in fact can we
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:24.600]  queue that up I only played a few times a year we should queue up the lair
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.320]  news hour footage from a few years ago when the former head of the Fed Alan
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.880]  Greenspan the architect of our current economy and the derivatives and the rest
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.080]  of it says there is no role for Congress in the Federal Reserve the proper
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.680]  role is they have no authority and we they have no oversight over us and cannot
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:44.720]  touch anything we do well I mean Congress isn't above the law the
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.600]  executives aren't above the law the judicial is not but I mean this is a
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.080]  separate group that calls itself federal and isn't you know somebody calls
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.520]  themselves royalty and isn't they get discredited or somebody calls themselves
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:01.240]  a highly decorated veteran and they're not it's disgraceful but what about when
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:06.920]  you say you're the federal government and you're not you were set up in 1913 now
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:11.520]  we had on probably the greatest actual technical champion of the Second
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.840]  Amendment I mean you could say that overall promoting it would be something
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:24.760]  like Ted Nugent or myself but when you talk about actually in there defending
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  it technically at the Capitol Hill level forcing the NRA to behave
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.320]  themselves it's somebody like Larry Pratt gun owners of America well when you
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.400]  talk about battling the Federal Reserve and going from not getting one vote 20
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.800]  something years ago to co-sponsor auditing the Fed to having it past the
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.560]  House repeatedly but killed in the Senate by the guy that claimed he was
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:57.640]  against the corrupt big banks Bernie Sanders so Ron Paul literally popularized
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.400]  along with the Liberty Movement last 30 years exposing the private Fed till now
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.600]  everybody knows it's private they don't call you conspiracy theorist anymore
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.600]  most Americans what is it 90 some percent in Gallup polls wanted audited or
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:18.040]  abolished very exciting and joining us is Norm Singleton and he's worked for
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:23.960]  Congress from Ron Paul for decades he heads up a lot of the operations over at
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.880]  campaign for Liberty and of course he's also constitutional lawyer I'm not
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.640]  going to go over now he's one of the founding members of some of the biggest
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.800]  Republican caucuses with libertarians but he is really one of the brains in
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.760]  there helping this libertarian take back of the Republican Party because it's
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.080]  been taken over by big special interest you know since the days after Eisenhower
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.800]  left office and then Barry Goldwater fought against the the
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.040]  Trilateral Commission and what he called a foreign takeover of our banking our
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:38:01.240]  culture everything so since the days of Goldwater since the mid 60s folks the
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.600]  Republican Party's been run by the Rockefeller sect has been called the
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.240]  Rockefeller Republicans that's what the bushes are and so Norm Singleton's been
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.560]  in there since how he was out of college battling it from the beginning and we're
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:15.400]  trying to get the private Federal Reserve audited you know it's so sexy to
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.320]  expose it 20 years ago when I was first on air people say you're a liar it's
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.520]  federal and then I'd say is federal express federal or federal ammunition
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.160]  federal federal plumbing and then I would show them the you know the Federal
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.240]  Reserve Act and on TV and people would wake up but now it's like yeah we know
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.160]  it's federal and far and Ron they're ripping us off tell us something we don't
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.800]  know okay we've won the war to expose it now let's audit it show the criminal
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.080]  activity we know is there most of it going to foreign banks of your tax
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.760]  money and let's reform this thing take it back put it back in Congress I mean now
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.080]  we've got the president you know saying Congress doesn't affect war or guns I
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.680]  mean you keep letting Congress become vestigial it'll become completely
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:57.880]  ceremonial so I want to play this clip and then go to him for the balance the
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.480]  hour the next 24 minutes or so Norm Singleton campaign for Liberty dot org
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.320]  they're trying to push this getting passed in the Senate Rand Paul's coming
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.240]  on to do this as well that's the one question I wanted to ask Donald Trump
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.600]  what he was on would you want to say what was you doing the Fed I dropped the
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.520]  ball on that and apologize but regardless that should be a litmus test
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.800]  folks because that's the shadow government that's the shadow corporate
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:24.000]  system look at the EU but here is the former head of the Fed the most famous
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.400]  head of the Fed ever Alan Greenspan mystery irrational exuberance whose
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.960]  baby Ben Bernack he came in and continued it all and now Janet Yellen
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:38.040]  here he is saying they're above the law outrageous open declaration of tyranny
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.040]  here it is I have the ideology because I believe that it is the best way of
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:50.680]  coming at the world and what type of policy what is the proper relationship
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.040]  what should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the Fed and a
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.720]  president of the United States well first of all the federal reserve is an
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:06.440]  independent agency and that means basically that there is no age other
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:11.160]  agency of government which can overrule actions that we take it's not
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:18.120]  government so long is that is in place and there is no evidence that the
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:23.400]  administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.400]  things other than what we think is the appropriate thing then what the
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:34.120]  relationships are don't frankly matter what we think is the appropriate thing
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.640]  to do when the shareholders since about 1915 are secret but it's mainly foreign
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.840]  banks that's been admitted in congressional hearings on it you got a
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:49.760]  foreign bank head that calls himself the Federal Reserve the other regional
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.760]  banks are all now against it saying we're all vestigial we don't even run
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:56.240]  things it's the New York Fed they've got the Fed head of Dallas Kansas City and
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.080]  other places running around saying it's a tyranny talking like Alex Jones like
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:06.640]  Ron Paul like Norm Singleton so it's a hundred and two years old now folks
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:14.520]  1913 and it is a foreign tentacle and Norm Singleton campaign for Liberty dot
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.320]  org is here this is such an important fight this is one of the most important
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.320]  key fights there is it's as important as the Second Amendment to kick out this
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.400]  foreign banking power because if you ever allow private banks to control the
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:31.200]  issuance of currency and credit your children will wake up homeless on the
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.000]  continent your forebearers conquered to quote a founding father and that's what
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.920]  we now have folks we are conquered through fraud but if we wake up to it
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:44.240]  it's over norm thank you so much for coming on with us my friend and holding
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.760]  while I did that dissertation tell us about the current fight sir thank you
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:53.800]  very much Alex thank you for having me on yesterday there was an historic vote
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.800]  in the Senate a majority of senators voted for the audit the Fed legislation
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.840]  introduced by Senator Rand Paul only one Republican Senator Bob Corker of
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.440]  Tennessee voted against it Senator Sanders actually did vote for it
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.240]  although the so-called populist champion of the progressive left Elizabeth
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.840]  Warren voted against it and she has actually been very outspoken against
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.320]  auditing the Fed ever since she got to the Senate so anyone who thinks that
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.440]  well even though she's a leftist even though she's poor big government she's
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:33.680]  us her heart is in the right place I think you should reassess that because
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:38.360]  when it comes right down to it she's just as in favor of corporate welfare and
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.880]  corporatism and the big banks and Wall Street and the big special interest as
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:50.800]  Hillary Clinton or a jeb Bush the only difference is that her rhetoric is is
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.360]  better and she likes to pretend that her her socialist proposals will help the
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.800]  average person so what we're looking at now because we didn't get the 60 votes
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:08.680]  to break the filibuster we are looking at where we go from here and we're
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.120]  probably going to go back to the House and get us if Paul Ryan will have a
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.280]  vote that will put us put it the the bill back on the Senate calendar once it
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.040]  passes the House and it will enable us to continue to put pressure on the
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:31.800]  senators who voted with the Fed with the big banks and this is really as you said
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.480]  this is an important issue because we don't know everything that's going on
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.760]  down there and with the Fed we don't know what the bills are making with foreign
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.920]  central banks with foreign government with Wall Street forums with
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.520]  corporations you know since the 08 collapse they they started I believe
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.280]  actually buying assets of corporations claiming that they're allowed to do
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:44:00.920]  that they've been making tremendous deals with overseas banks and you just
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.480]  don't know what is what is going on with them in the in situations like with
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:14.760]  Greece and as Ron Paul points out the economy is not doing well and the Fed
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.400]  is failing and what is going to happen and we need to get a full picture of
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.280]  the economy and the key to that as you point out Alex is monetary policy and
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:30.800]  that's why auditing the Fed is a really important step to take and it's really
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.400]  shameful that so many Democrats who claim to be champions of the working
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:41.760]  of the working person of working-class Americans against the so-called 1% voted
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:46.600]  with the banksters yesterday absolutely and then we see all the usual
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:53.240]  suspects Soros Gates Buffett on sponsored news articles that layer admits
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.880]  paid for by their foundations and sponsored this week with ABC I've seen it
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.440]  four or five times on purpose tuned in to see if it's sponsored by them it'll
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.960]  be anti-gun anti-family pro open border pro socialism pro welfare and Warren
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.840]  Buffett on or Bill Gates going rich people don't pay tax we need to pay tax
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.520]  pass this law that's raising taxes on people making a hundred thousand a year
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.480]  those are the people that actually are out there spending money that's not
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:22.600]  ultra-rich or wealthy it's billionaires that are basically tax exempt that are
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:28.320]  and there they are suckering the poor people into voting for them when Bernie
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.120]  Sanders in Hillary and Hillary's more Wall Street than anybody with these big
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.560]  scams you know the not general Wall Street that's a great part of our economy
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:39.440]  but the crony guys the top big five six banks and brokerage firms as you know
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.240]  that literally get all the free fellow reserve money and the interest free
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.480]  money in the bailouts I mean it's just crazy to know that Warren Buffett's the
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:54.720]  biggest single individual recipient of the bailout and he sits there calling
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.020]  for taxes to be raised and talks about how he's getting too much money from the
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:03.280]  taxpayer I mean he really is counting on the public's ignorance that's right and
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:12.560]  the the whole political class is really they really they are really scared of I
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.240]  think of the audit the Fed movement because it is popular because it was
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:23.320]  under the leadership of Dr. Paul and campaign for liberty and in the Senate
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.160]  under the leadership of Senator Paul and in the House the great Thomas
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:33.600]  city of Kentucky this has really become something that can't be ignored an
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.120]  issue that can't be ignored anymore and more and more people are waking up
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:41.760]  every day and listening to shows like yours going to sites like ours campaign
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:48.960]  for liberty org and other sites that Dr. Paul's liberty report in order to to
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.800]  learn the full truth and get active in trying to stop this and just as the more
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:47:00.280]  liberty we we lose the more that measures like audit the Fed fail the more
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:09.400]  people become wake up to to what's going on and become it determined to change
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:14.320]  things and to resist the lies of the political class and say that oh don't
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:18.240]  worry the Federal Reserve is is is there for your own good and if Alan
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:22.600]  Greenspan incredible arrogance to say that well Congress which created the
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:27.840]  Federal Reserve by statute and I don't know if Dr. Greenspan is aware of the
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.800]  legislative process maybe he never watched Schoolhouse Rock and knows so
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.920]  knows how a bill becomes law but any bill that is passed by Congress can be
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.120]  repealed by Congress there's no reason that Congress can't they have the power
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:49.360]  of the coin and the currency yeah the Federal is yeah there's that the idea
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.360]  that oh where we we deserve independence is ridiculous and yeah much of foreign
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.400]  banks have declared their own Declaration of Independence over our money
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.960]  keep it all secret taxes created the IRS the same year to go around like the
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.760]  sheriff of Nottingham robbing us and then tell us they're above the law that
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.800]  cannot be investigated for 102 years it's outrageous and the beginning of the end
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.680]  is here for these people because now their secret is out it took us 80
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.040]  something years to expose they were private now it's admitted they are
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:23.080]  uncloaked and they now just hope they can you know get us to move along and go
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.000]  to sleep but it's not gonna happen what do we do because we're so close to get
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.560]  this audit the Fed rammed through the Senate sir I should say when I said
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:35.000]  that they don't deserve independence I mean independence of congressional
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.840]  oversight no no I agree with you I was just making the point that they are
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.400]  literally usurping us I mean it's like saying a bank robber wants his
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.160]  independence over the cash inside the vault I think the most important thing
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.280]  to do right now is go to campaign for liberty org and look up look up the
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.240]  vote look up how your senator voted if your senator voted wrong call and let
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.080]  them know how disappointed you are with them if your senator voted right you
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.960]  could always call and and thank them if your senator was one of three who
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.160]  didn't vote call and express your disappointment and asked that they vote
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:16.080]  in the future for it and also get your friends and neighbors and family

[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.040]  because we have to lead the future against crony capitalism that is
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.880]  scapegoating and demonizing real capitalism the fount of so much
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.880]  freedom and wealth and success and civilization while they trash it blaming
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.920]  beautiful capitalism it's totally sick meanwhile I think they've jumped the

[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:11.840]  name in one of his anti-gun tirades you know he's talk about a crime to
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:18.560]  replicate the British Empire he is actually you know with his executive
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:22.200]  orders going after our Second Amendment taking away due process of senior

[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:05.080]  little cronies in D.C. that we're not gonna sit back silently and let you
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:08.760]  take away our Second Amendment rights we're going to assert them vigorously
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:14.360]  by by by entering this this absolutely that brings me my final point we only
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.080]  got one minute left sir let me ask you this question you heard my whole rant
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.080]  earlier a couple minute rant about the Great Awakening happening people
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.760]  finally get it they're not buying it do you think they're delusional and
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:27.320]  insulated in D.C. and don't realize what's happening because that's better
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.000]  that means we're really gonna win or are they aware of how much trouble they're
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.920]  in I think I actually think that it's split there's a lot of delusion there's
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:41.920]  a but there also is an increasing realization and that's why you see a
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.920]  lot of senators and congressmen lining up to get behind audit the Fed because
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:53.200]  they understand that people want change and politicians will respond with with
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:01.320]  with change when enough people demanded Congress and Paul brilliantly summed that
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.080]  up in his column this week which is available at campaignforliberty.org
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:11.200]  and other sites that don't educate the politicians educate the people and
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.380]  then when the people know the truth and the people demand liberty the
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:18.040]  politicians will fall that's what Thomas Jefferson said he said educate the
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.480]  people generally in the concepts of liberty and tyranny will fade away like
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.000]  phantoms that dawn in the mist to paraphrase God bless you sir appreciate

[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:24.840]  live on through those that died before us they live on through us through our
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.560]  progeny our ideas live on and what we manifest and build and what we teach in
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.680]  the culture through others that aren't even in our genetic line like
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:41.000]  electricity and then we live on spiritually not just by the quote energy
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.400]  of the soul that they've measured the wavelength the aura that dies but only
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:56.640]  because it leaves the body and that goes on forever but that energy that soul
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.760]  that spirit with all that information that predates this planet and even this
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.640]  creation coming forth out of the mind of God like flowing water the time space
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:12.600]  continuum blasting out the other end of a black hole straight into our universe
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:23.320]  can resonate with evil or good and there's a broadcast that the world is
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:32.960]  putting out to resonate and to join with evil and my soul is like a violin so is
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:45.320]  yours or a harp I think is how it's more often pointed out and the world can play
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:52.920]  my flesh and play my heart and sometimes it can even touch my soul but despite the
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.600]  fact that I have knowledge of evil and that means I'm evil I don't act on it
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:01.760]  I don't exercise it because the good is much greater and that is the secret to
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:07.400]  the universe my friends good people get guilty because we feel the evilness and
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:11.400]  we think my god this is who I am it's not your essence it's that you're able
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:19.600]  to feel the broadcast of that spiritual energy in that dimension our mind the
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.040]  mathematics shows goes the fifth sixth seventh eighth dimension and above and so
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:30.200]  we're blind physically in this third dimensional plane to it but we feel it in
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:39.840]  the sixth sense and we know it so what we have is a bunch of vandals and scum
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.640]  that look big on this plane because they decided to be evil but really their
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.520]  little jokes they're weak and they're so afraid of good men and women who are
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:53.960]  empowered and have the light of God in their eyes we'll be back stay with us
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:05:02.080]  I'm Alex Jones info wars.com remember when Congressman Joe Wilson couldn't
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:09.400]  contain himself any longer and shouted at Obama we needed that on a loop for
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.600]  Obama's last State of the Union a story on info wars.com looks at three of his
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:17.720]  biggest lies Obama continues to pretend we're focused on destroying ISIS when
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.240]  there's been a continuous stream of information showing we created funded
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.360]  and armed ISIS and continue to do so he claimed Obamacare created jobs but in
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:30.040]  fact it caused companies that can't afford it to replace full-time jobs with
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:34.480]  part-time jobs but hey you now have two different jobs to make ends meet why are
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:37.880]  you complaining and then there's the strongest economy in the world claim
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:43.280]  reality is all jobs growth has gone to immigrants with 17% of jobs now held by
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:47.880]  immigrants and the stock market this year is down 20% and there's the absurd
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:52.160]  claim about the resurgence of Detroit when General Motors has exported most
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:56.520]  of the jobs of China and Chrysler was sold to fiat for a song for more

[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:11.880]  happy with what you got because the owners of this country don't want that
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:17.160]  I'm talking about the real owners now the real owners the big wealthy business
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:20.960]  interests that control things and make all the important decisions forget the
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:24.440]  politicians the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:33.040]  freedom of choice you don't you have no choice you have owners they own you they
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.440]  own everything they own all the important land they own and control the
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:40.600]  corporations that long since bought and paid for the Senate the Congress the
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.840]  state houses and city halls they got the judges in their back pockets and they
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:47.320]  own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:53.720]  information you get to hear they got you by the balls they want obedient workers
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:58.520]  obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.920]  the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower pay
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.200]  the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:10.560]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:14.600]  your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:21.560]  Wall Street it's a big club and you ain't in you said recently quote when you
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:26.360]  give they do whatever the hell you want them to do you better believe it so
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:30.760]  what specifically did they do if I ask them if I need them you know most of the
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:35.520]  people on this stage I've given to just so you understand a lot of money you and
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:41.120]  I are not in the big club the owners of this country know the truth it's called
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:46.600]  the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it but I'll tell you
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.600]  what they don't want they don't want a population of citizens capable of
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.040]  critical thinking they don't want well-informed well-educated people
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:57.160]  capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that that doesn't help
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:02.080]  them that's against their interest that's right from the front lines of the
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:10.360]  information war it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.120]  joining us we're now well into the third hour today the David Knight will be
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.960]  hosting the fourth hour there's a key second minute report they're gonna
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:21.720]  premiere this nine minutes long with Jakari Jackson and more we are waiting
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:26.320]  for Senator Rand Paul supposed to call the next five ten minutes to get
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.480]  involved breaking down what's happening with the campaign what's happening with
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:34.360]  the audit the Fed move I aired that piece with George Carlin because he's
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.600]  talking about the country's owners are the private European banks in 1913 that
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:42.400]  came in and took over and set this up what King George couldn't do with
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:51.840]  muskets and troops and horses and cannon and ships and daggers and swords and so
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:59.360]  much great shotgun fire blasting out of primitive howitzers they have done
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:05.080]  through economic sub-refuge and fraud and now that model is used worldwide it's
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:13.720]  called globalism it's a big club and you ain't in it and neither am I and now
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:18.280]  with live extension technologies other advancements it's a big club or not
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.240]  gonna be involved in that as well that's the attempt to bring the world into
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.240]  hardcore tyranny and new forms of tyranny they've said there's nothing new
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:31.040]  under the Sun that's an ancient saying but there is now with MIT reporting
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:38.120]  farms all over the u.s. growing humans inside animals to harvest their organs
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:43.400]  that was two days ago and sure enough they had a couple newspapers write
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.400]  articles making fun of me about that knowing their idiot readers don't know
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:54.400]  that I was reading on the MIT magazine MIT review we scroll down I'll give you
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:59.040]  the headline human animal chimeras are gestating you know that means you know
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:06.160]  nine months in mommy on u.s. research farms they say it's a radical new
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:11.320]  approach to generating human organs is to grow them inside pigs or sheep inside
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:19.160]  quote tissue clusters those are people but it's okay the clones they grow in
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:30.080]  Petri dishes are part pig part sheep or part cow and so they don't have rights
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:34.640]  notice an old little bottles of shampoo or whatever it says not test on animals
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.080]  and I look for that I don't want to test them animals how about not tested on
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:42.720]  chimeras oh there's no discussion because the whole abortion thing was
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.080]  about how dare the Republicans not want us to have stem cells that means babies
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:53.280]  up to age nine months kept alive in their body parts so see how they twist
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:59.400]  with lawyer crap everything and I'm just here exposing oh I'm sorry I said the
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:05.520]  word crap I really try to not use uncouth language but I get so real
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:11.880]  these days I can't help it plus what they say in famous movie but I quote so
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:19.880]  often apocalypse now with Marlon Brando Colonel Kurtz is saying you know we
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:26.280]  court-martial our pilots for riding the F word on their airplanes but then we
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:31.760]  have them drop fire on villages of children and what's he's saying there
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:37.880]  there's that hypocrisy but I know our audience aren't hypocrites but I tell
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:42.040]  me I'm a family man and we should be dignified with these lofty subjects we're
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:46.640]  covering but at the same time once you get down in a guttural on the ground
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.760]  battle with tyranny it just strips away any pretense and I just get to the point
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:14:00.680]  where I'm a slave to the truth it's a good slavery but I just can't hold back
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:07.800]  anymore report White House is blocking investigation in over a hundred terrorists
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:12.280]  inside the US Steve Watson info wars calm it's a huge story this is from the
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.760]  federal government major bank warrants of oil prices could fall to $10 a
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.280]  barrel but other major bank ribs say war between Saudi Arabia and Iran could
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:26.000]  send oil prices to $250 a barrel and so you'd be paying five six dollars at the
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.360]  pump yeah that's the word from a big oil company insiders and others is that oh
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:34.760]  you enjoy this whole oil war where they're trying to bankrupt fracking and
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:39.560]  bankrupt the oil sands the tar sands and bankrupt Russia they want to bankrupt
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.320]  North America and Russia but when they're done when they bankrupted those
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.000]  wildcatters that became pretty big-sized companies you know billion dollar
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  companies a lot of small companies became billion dollar they started you know
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.200]  four or five guys while cat and getting the first well taking them a decade and
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:59.200]  you know two decades to build build build get hundreds of wells thousands of
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.680]  wells build their own pipelines their own refineries boom drop down prices uh-uh
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.960]  we're on drop prices for five years so everything's bankrupt and then baby we
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:17.200]  can do whatever we want pretty big deal and of course you know the oil companies
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.400]  finance bankrupting cold you know if I thought like the average yuppie weasel
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:24.760]  I run into them in Texas a lot of them a lot of them are nice people a lot of them
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:27.400]  are bad folks but you know a lot of them are worth hundreds of millions of
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:30.200]  dollars there's a bunch of people like that that own big ranches with huge oil
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:35.640]  wells and stuff all over them and they'll sit around and laugh and when I
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:39.560]  all whatever I don't care they bankrupt cold I'm gonna make more money and I
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:46.920]  sit there and I go but my family has some oil and gas that's in direct
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:52.600]  competition with coal I I don't have any coal in my family but I would want to
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:57.720]  bankrupt coal so I made more money I just it's so immoral and it destroys
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:03.160]  capitalism and that's what's wrong we need to audit the private run for
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:07.080]  private Federal Reserve and no one has championed that more than former
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:11.680]  congressman dr. Ron Paul and now the last five years no one has championed
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:17.240]  that more in the US Senate than Senator Rand Paul and that's why I've been very
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:22.440]  hopeful when he was a leader of the campaign of the Republican run to get
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:25.440]  the nomination that he would stay in the lead but he's been the lead he could go
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:29.240]  back in the lead we've seen that the media is trying to say that Rand Paul is
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:35.080]  out of the race and then they put John Kasich in the Republican debate coming
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.000]  up tomorrow night that we're gonna be covering live it's crazy so definitely
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.840]  the fix is in but can we override that fix I know he didn't come on about this
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:49.520]  we want to come on about auditing the Fed which we're very close to doing really
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:54.840]  at 1776 part two but peaceful but I do want to get into campaign 2016 with him
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:00.200]  Rand Paul calm senator thanks for coming on with us again hey Alex thanks
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:03.800]  for having us there is so much going on we've only got for about 10 minutes so
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:07.240]  you've got the floor what's the battle plan to audit the Fed what's happening
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:11.920]  in the campaign how do we get you back in the debates where's all this going the
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.080]  good news is you know we got a majority yesterday we got 53 votes for auditing
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:20.880]  the Fed and we needed 60 unfortunately we were missing Ted Cruz
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.640]  unfortunately couldn't come back to vote with us but we did get a majority and I
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.120]  think that's a step forward it took me five years to get a vote on the bill I
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:33.400]  talked to Harry Reid till I was blue in the face I reminded him that he used to
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:39.400]  be for auditing the Fed but no longer and we finally got a vote we got two
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:45.160]  Democrats Baldwin and then we got Bernie Sanders to vote for it as well so we got
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:49.040]  close but we didn't quite get there but to me that's a long fight it's long
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:53.680]  overdue the Federal Reserve really is responsible for a lot of the income
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:57.720]  inequality in our country the rich get richer because the Federal Reserve passes
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:02.080]  their money out to the rich by the time it filters down to the rest of us prices
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.320]  are going up and we never really seem to see any value in the new money that is
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.160]  put into the system I also noticed mainstream media really tries to not
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.720]  cover this this is a big deal you have the former Fed chairman Greenspan as you
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:18.240]  know on Laird News Hours saying we're above the law Congress can't even look
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:22.160]  at us since when is a private group masquerading his government above the
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:25.880]  law when Congress has the power to issue the currency center because I mean I
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:30.040]  cannot praise you and others enough especially you for leading the fight
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:34.120]  all the way to the fact that you've almost been able to overturn it but they
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.920]  want this I guess 60 votes but you've gotten 50 plus I mean this is amazing
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:44.360]  after your father's 30-plus year battle to do this the biggest lobby against
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:48.240]  auditing the Fed is actually coming from the Federal Reserve and it's this has
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.400]  made me so mad that the government created the Federal Reserve sure their
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.160]  quasi-private but they were created by the government it's a conglomeration of
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.400]  private banks but they should not be allowed to lobby against their own
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:06.340]  oversight so they come to Washington they write op-eds they called every
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:12.160]  senator in advance and lobby them to say we don't want more oversight it'll
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.680]  somehow you know affect our policymaking well we need to ask questions did
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.360]  their policymaking lead to this huge enormous recession that we got with a
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:26.040]  real estate crisis and where a lot of people caught up in it and how come
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:29.640]  when we got caught up in it the poor people suffered but the people on Wall
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:33.800]  Street just went right along merrily making a hundred million dollars a year
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:39.040]  and they bankrupted AIG you saw the other day who the former head of AIG is
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.000]  given their money to right he took ten million dollars of his bailout money to
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.600]  try to bail out the Bush campaign so it goes on and on the rich get richer but
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:53.600]  the government should not be showing this crony capitalism through the banking
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:57.400]  system and I'm gonna keep up the fight if it takes me another five years I'm
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:01.760]  gonna get a vote on on at the Fed and we're gonna win well I have said
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:06.080]  probably a thousand times the last few years that that even before the campaign
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.600]  started I appreciate you running for president just like I appreciate you
[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:12.120]  running for Senate and I appreciate the fact you've been true to your principles
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:18.080]  and not compromised even though they've demonized you but but now I have not
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:21.880]  been critical but I mean I know you're a gentleman your dad's a gentleman the
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:25.680]  fact is people are angry there's an insurrection a lot of America isn't as
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:32.400]  sophisticated as some of the libertarians I think you can beat Trump if you
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:37.280]  really get aggressive and and and you know and I'm not saying stupid that
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:42.040]  level but you know of the WWE which you know obviously he's been part of but he
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:46.200]  knows what he's doing that's what people want and all I'm saying is I know you'd
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:49.520]  make the best president of the three people and I like Ted Cruz you know I
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:53.920]  like Trump as well I know your pedigree your history no compromise you're for
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:58.440]  real Trump I don't really know but I mean I'm rather him than Hillary how do
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:02.720]  we get you elected president others a lot of time left and folks thought Trump
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:06.840]  would fade and but I think you know really getting aggressive is the way to
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:10.600]  go I don't plan to be the big political guru here sir but I mean I'd really like
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:15.200]  to see you as president you know the thing we keep trying to point out is is
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.440]  that Trump has no history as a person who believes in limited government or
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:24.120]  as really even being a conservative one of the things that I think is the bedrock
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:28.560]  principle of capitalism and a free society is ownership of property when
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.400]  you own your house the government shouldn't come in your house the
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:35.040]  government has no right to your property and you have the right to control your
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:39.440]  property but you know one of the ways Trump has made money and he said this
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.040]  repeatedly is that he believes in eminent domain he believes the government
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:46.320]  should be allowed to take private property and give it to another private
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:51.600]  property owner this was a famous Supreme Court decision the kilo decision and I
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:55.400]  think it's inconsistent with someone who believes in limited government and he's
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:22:00.320]  used it repeatedly Vera Coakling lived in her house for 30 years Donald Trump
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.600]  took it for a parking lot for one of his casinos or he tried she battled him in
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:08.880]  court and she actually beat him but I think there really is no limited
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:13.040]  government tradition with Trump and I think when he says trust me give me
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:18.240]  power I'll you know I'll be strong I'll do things better I worry about that
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:22.440]  because most of the tradition not only English tradition but American tradition
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:26.120]  has been trying to limit the power of the monarch limit the trap power of the
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.720]  presidency and it's not give me more power I'm smart now fix it it's leave
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.640]  the power with the states and the people and leave me alone and I don't think he's
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:38.880]  part of that tradition but he is angry and people have you know fallen in for
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.640]  the anger without examining whether or not he would make government bigger or
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:48.320]  smaller well I know you have so much integrity that you won't get you know
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:53.320]  professional wrestler on folks to win but at the same time I know you have
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:56.160]  integrity I mean I've watched you I've known you for 20 years when you were
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:00.200]  campaigning for your dad and I know you've never compromised I know you
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:04.520]  exposed that Al Qaeda was being Western funded before Cruz or Trump did it you
[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:08.880]  know years before I know you've led the fight on the Fed led the fight to defund
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:13.160]  you know all these different organizations like Planned Parenthood and you
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:16.600]  know defund the foreign aid of these radical Islamists I mean I know sir that
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:20.400]  you know like you said some people don't know all the geopolitical facts as
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:24.720]  well I know you're the statesman who'd make the perfect president it's just
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:28.720]  that what are people gonna do if they see Trump up there at the lead the media
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:32.160]  is all giving him the attention and then they're scared of Hillary Clinton all
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:38.040]  I'm saying is I mean you're doing a great job overall I just wonder sitting here
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:43.040]  how we can catapult you back to the lead when clearly the establishment is
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:46.920]  doing everything they can to try to sideline you I mean I mean look you
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:50.080]  clearly have more support than John Kasich clearly you should be in the
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:53.400]  debate so you're probably doing the right thing to not be in the debate so
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:56.520]  that you could at least make a big deal out of it and actually be heard what
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:01.600]  else can you do can we do to try to get you back in there to win this
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:05.440]  nomination or to inject good ideas because you know Trump could do some
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:10.560]  faux pas fall out then we get Jeb Bush God forbid you know I think one of the
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:14.520]  things about the disconnect between the grassroots and you know the establishment
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:19.280]  Washington Republicans is I put forward an amendment about a year or so ago and
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.000]  I said that we shouldn't give any foreign aid to any countries that
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.120]  persecute Christians any countries that put together Christians who interfaith
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:33.080]  marriage or people who convert from Islam to Christianity they if they have
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.360]  laws on their books it says you are put to death they shouldn't get any of our
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:41.000]  money I've yet to meet one American outside of Washington who is opposed to
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  that as opposed to my amendment and yet in Washington when we voted on it 18
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.240]  senators voted to continue sending foreign aid even if the laws of the
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.200]  country we were giving the money to were to persecute Christians and so that's
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.080]  it I think just shows you how far apart we are the grassroots from those in
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:01.800]  Washington one of the things I'm pushing and going to continue to push is
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:06.920]  that really I think we ought to have term limits I think that we need more you
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:10.780]  know we need more revolving in and out of office we need more citizen
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:14.840]  politicians up there and I've become more and cooler convinced that the people
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.400]  up there are never going to fix it so our house cleaning periodically is
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.640]  something we're going to have to do if we ever have hope of fixing things
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:26.040]  well the few minutes we have left Rand Paul calm you've got fundraisers going
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:30.880]  regardless folks you need to back Rand Paul to inject anti-globalism pro
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:35.880]  Americana audit the Fed pro-second amendment narratives into the debate
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.000]  just like your father running built the libertarian movement that's now been
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.360]  able to get a major faction of the Republicans as hopefully a check on
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:48.800]  what's happening so this is a long war made up of battles but how do we help
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.400]  you a audit the Fed and then separately I'll say it again you have been it's just
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:57.760]  true the leader when it comes to doing filibusters that others that imitate
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:04.560]  which is great when it comes to opposing the TPP which is great and so I do you
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:09.400]  know really just want to thank you for the fact that you really have taken the
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:16.640]  true constitutional stance at the expense of media demonization campaigns so that
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:19.120]  proves you'd be the best guy for president the fact that you've engaged
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.680]  in real leadership I think the biggest thing that people need to remember is
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.640]  that when we were attacked when there are terrorist attacks is not to be
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:32.880]  fearful because then terrorists win when you're fearful when we give up on our
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.720]  liberties when we say oh we're going to trade our liberty for a false sense of
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:40.560]  security that's when we lose and that's when terrorism wins right now the
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.120]  biggest clamor in Washington led by Marco Rubio led by McCain and others is to
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:49.480]  get the government collecting all of our phone records all of our credit card
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.000]  statements because they say oh we need more information that's coming from the
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.600]  right on the left you have president Obama saying we just need gun control the
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.600]  problem is is they're both succumbing to the fear that the terrorists are trying
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.080]  to invoke upon us so the left wants to give up and get gun control the right
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.120]  wants to give up and allow people control and control of our records and
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:15.080]  invasion of our houses by the government so by all means don't let fear
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.440]  influence this thing stand strong and I know your listeners will step up and
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:24.200]  say you know we have to be very very careful of allowing more power to
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:28.440]  gravitate to Washington the power needs to go back to the states and it needs to
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:33.680]  go back to the people I want to put a question in here for you you are the
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:36.840]  guy that exposed that the West was funding al-qaeda and then ISIS and
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:40.200]  that's on record it's now been admitted you've been vindicated that was daring
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:46.280]  three years ago to explore years ago to expose that now they are running these
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:48.960]  clips of Obama from the state of the Union last night and I don't want to get
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:52.600]  your take on this where he says they will be punished we're going after them to
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.600]  see the guy that funded these rebels in Hillary that did this now taking credit
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:02.240]  for fighting them sir what's your view on that you know I think we're starting
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:05.600]  to get some of the real truth out there you know in the last presidential debate
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:10.680]  I put forward the proposition that regime change in Syria regime change in
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:14.920]  Libya it actually isn't making us safer it's actually putting us more at risk
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.440]  and this is an interesting debate because on one side you have Hillary
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.920]  Clinton you've got the president you've got Rubio you've got McCain you've got
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:27.760]  all these people who want regime change in Libya but we're actually less safe
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:33.440]  it's a failed state now a third of Libya pledges allegiance to ISIS and so I
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.360]  think we are for the first time in a long time actually having a public
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.520]  debate over that and that's why it's important that I'm in the presidential
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.960]  debates and that we are given a chance to compete for the presidency we still
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.240]  think there's a chance today there's a brand-new poll that came out in the
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:52.560]  Iowa Des Moines register and if you count that poll we would have been
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:58.280]  included and so we are still jockeying and saying absolutely count all the
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:03.160]  polls and get us in there because we deserve to be in what is my audience to
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:07.160]  to get you in that debate senator you know I think the best thing would be to
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:12.560]  call the Republican National Committee and tell Ryan's previous that they need
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.360]  to allow all voices to be heard in the debate and that it's not fair to exclude
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.720]  me from the debate we're gonna get that number and bring it up after the break
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.840]  you're leaving us now RandPaul.com are there any other websites folks should
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:28.600]  go to for support mainly RandPaul.com or if they want to go to our Facebook and

[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:04.000]  Obama's removing obstacles for driverless cars pushing back against state
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:09.080]  regulation clearing the road for Google. After Google cars were involved in 11
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:13.520]  accidents in six years the California DMV proposed new state regulations to
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:18.120]  require a human a steering wheel throttle and brake pedals on California roads.
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:22.160]  They don't have that Obama says can't have a patchwork of state regulations for
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:27.400]  robot cars. Google cars accident rate would work out to 83 accidents over 45
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:33.080]  years of driving. How many humans do you know that have had 83 accidents? Would
[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:37.360]  you get in their car? But don't worry Obama's just offering you a choice your
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:40.920]  own personal limo where you can just play on social media and leave the
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:45.880]  driving to them. Like Obama care with Obama car if you'd like your car you
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:50.080]  can keep your car. You just won't be able to afford the insurance to drive your
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:56.040]  own car because you know Obama cars are safer than you. Right 83 accidents not my
[02:30:56.040 --> 02:30:59.680]  fault. For info wars.com I'm David Knight.

[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:33.200]  Mondays through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:36.480]  We're live.
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:49.520]  Broadcasting across the planet. And we are here opposing the worldwide Luciferian
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:34:03.640]  conspiracy. And the God of this world wants to play God but is no God at all. I
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:08.640]  want to open the phones up. I've got so much news here. It makes my head spin. I've
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.320]  got so many video clips to play. It makes my head spin. But I want to open the
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:17.800]  phones up specifically on what you think about Rand Paul and what you think
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:24.920]  about Donald Trump. Because I really care about the polls and Ron Paul has done
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:29.480]  more than probably anybody else with his focus to expose the globalist in this
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:34.280]  country in my lifetime and probably around the world. And the senator's done a
[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:38.320]  great job up there and then I feel mad when I complain that he's not being
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:43.040]  aggressive enough in his rhetoric. But then I feel guilty when I was actually
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:47.440]  interviewing him thinking about all the things he's actually done and the trolls
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:53.320]  they've put out lying about him like saying he supported TPP, which he did. He
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:57.200]  said I support free trade but none of it's secret and this isn't free trade.
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:05.040]  See, they play those games. But imagine a Ted Cruz, Rand Paul presidency either way.
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:09.520]  One of the other president, vice president.
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:26.920]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. I support whoever I believe can win and turn our
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.720]  free market system back on again and leave our guns alone in not-engaged
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:36.920]  medical tyranny. I like Carson but he says he's for forced inoculation.
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:42.720]  Trump, you know, says I'm against all these wars. You don't believe how
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:47.760]  militaristic I am. So I'm like okay, you're against these wars. I like that.
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:50.560]  You say you're militaristic. That's kind of scary. You know, you say oh don't
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:53.480]  worry, I'll spy on them so much we'll get the terrorists. They don't let them
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:36:00.520]  spy on the foreign assets. They spy on us. I've had the top people on. But 95% of
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:05.040]  what Trump says is really great and you know, we've got tyrants on white horses
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:10.120]  under Obama and Hillary. I mean, we know there is bonafide bad, want to destroy us,
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:15.400]  mount our head on the wall, conquer us as we've ever seen. So am I a gambler? No.
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:23.400]  But Trump's looking really good right now because he's in the lead. He's destroying
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:28.000]  political correctness. He doesn't want our borders open. He's being demonized and
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:31.600]  both parties are after him. That's a certification right there is he got some
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:32.400]  problems, you bet.
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:43.120]  Paul has less problems politically and being a patriot. I mean, he's he's he's
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:47.760]  his dad's like 100% right on with what I agree with brands like 95.
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:54.480]  Trump's like 90%, 85%, whatever, but the rhetoric's better. The leadership, it's
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:58.720]  stronger. We need an arrogance in the face of these arrogance, socialist and
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.480]  globalist right as they're ready to be kicked over like a rotting facade full
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.600]  of termites. I mean, they really are a facade. And what's happening with this
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:13.200]  show exploding and people recognizing it is not some power trip for me because
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:17.520]  let me tell you, you want to walk point in a major counter offensive against the
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:25.320]  globalist. Oh, you're awake. It's not boring. I wouldn't not do this for
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:30.000]  anything, but because I'm committed and because I'm not a coward and because I
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.800]  want to fight tyranny and I don't like enslavement, not because I want to be the
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:41.240]  big swinging, jolly green giant of the Liberty Movement. Not because I got
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:51.480]  something to prove. I know where this road leads. I can't take my family there. So
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:58.720]  I don't endorse people or support them because they pat me on the head because
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:04.280]  they come on my show. Our ratings go up some with Iran, Paul or Donald Trump on
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:08.880]  but what people really listen to is just us talking about the news and humanity
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:12.640]  and the Second Amendment and what's happening and the guest we have the
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:18.440]  analyst on the economy and all the other big things. But the system's got a
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:24.160]  problem. The world government they want is finally arriving and people don't
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:29.880]  like it and it smells and it stinks and it's ugly and it's pathetic and it's
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:36.720]  bad and it's unfair and it's ridiculous. And now you rule this pile of crud
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:41.120]  because you're dishonorable and our decadence allowed the elites to take
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:48.760]  over. So we really do have to look at the mirror. That was my big awakening in the
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.440]  last five, six years. I mean I've been awake for 25 years politically aware for
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:39:02.240]  30 or close to it was when I started realizing why do I just hate some
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:08.960]  bureaucrat? Why do I get angry at some cop when they're just brainwashed mindlessly
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.680]  following some program? Shouldn't I be mad at myself that I'm not a great enough
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:18.280]  man to change the world and I'm not a great enough person when my forebears
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:24.400]  were to reach out to people in common cause and common honor and common
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:31.960]  association? Because when we look at the world and it's wrong and we're getting
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:40.720]  screwed over. It's because we failed as a people and that doesn't mean we blame
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:47.360]  ourselves more than them. Oh they get the blind share of the blame and
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:53.440]  they will be held accountable to quote V from the data. But in the end you want to
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.920]  know who's the blame just look in the mirror and with my children and my life
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:03.880]  and my health and everything I do the greatest part of what I've done in my
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:06.480]  life and what I know can heal others as well just from my own personal
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:13.440]  experience is not blaming other people for things that squarely lie in your own
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:24.520]  camp. I actually like genuine criticism. I really appreciate it. I want it. I want
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:31.640]  to be reproved. I want to be edified. I want to be rebuked. It's like that caller
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:37.960]  that time called was telling me where I was wrong about denying Christ and all
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:41.320]  I was saying was man if these radical jihadis are putting a gun to your head
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:45.040]  and say deny Christ you know when they attack these colleges and stuff they
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.440]  successfully covered up the whole Oregon thing not the San Bernardino. I don't
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:54.440]  know I got kids to go home to at night. I'm just not gonna be a liar on air like
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:59.080]  I'm this super guy it's not that I'm a coward but if I can get out of dying by
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:06.720]  telling some scumbag a lie I'll lie and I said is that moral because I won't lie
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:10.480]  up here on the big platform but at the moment I'm not in front of everybody and
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:16.480]  they're gonna win if I don't lie to them then I'd lie to them and he called in
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:19.400]  read me all the verses about no if you'll deny me before men all to buy him
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:24.400]  before my father and I did realize that no it's true you can't even do that you
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:31.760]  can't even lie period I mean he was right it was good to be but at the same
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:34.340]  time well then how do I sneak into Bohemian Grove and tell them I'm a
[02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:37.160]  member to be able to cover what they're doing there I mean you know the Bible's
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:40.440]  got spies going into different cities in line to folks I mean there's a time to
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:45.520]  do that but a person who's good has to have that debate with themselves not
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:48.840]  just say I'm good and I'm just gonna lie whenever I want because let me tell
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:56.240]  you something to quote Tony Montana I tell the truth even when I lie the lie
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:04.920]  is not in me and I realized people that lie they create false paradigms of lies
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.640]  I was talking about this with my mother last night at dinner she came over to the
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:13.640]  house my dad the kids were playing ping-pong and ate roasted chicken stuff
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:17.720]  it's good but I'm going off into that I just image everything I talk about them
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:25.160]  going to calls and she said you know really what serving evil is is about
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:28.520]  lies and she goes I don't mean lying and saying some foods good or a dress looks
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:33.440]  good on your wife or whatever but she said building a lie a whole world of
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:39.080]  lies that you then want others to buy into false reality that's what the devil
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:42.320]  is and I said you're absolutely right that's a very astute point you've made
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:52.640]  and I'm glad you boil that down for me but I lie less than anyone I know
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:07.520]  I love how the liars say they never lie but you know the best propaganda as
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:13.720]  Obama knows Joseph Kerbal taught him is just an outrageous stupid one that's so
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:20.040]  over-the-top you're like taken back by and and and and people want to believe
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:26.120]  it I'm gonna go to your calls right now ever Maya Kimberley Jason Antoine
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:33.520]  and others told me remember to join us 800-25-99231 and just briefly as I'm
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:37.240]  not gonna belabor this we need funds to continue the operation and hopefully
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:42.120]  expand it takes a lot of money to run the servers the bandwidth do everything we
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:46.560]  do we're victims of our own success you know I don't want to get up here to
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.160]  exaggerate so automatically dial stuff back the last six months the audio and
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:57.320]  video streams have basically tripled well it's worse than that it's just
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:02.440]  shooting straight up and we've got really cheap good bandwidth but I mean one
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:09.320]  stream was $56,000 last month and we buy from the one of the biggest companies in
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:14.360]  the world I mean it you know the folks Google gets it from I mean you think
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.600]  about really you know 15 16 million people tuned in on one stream in a month
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:22.080]  just our video streaming info wars.com forward slash show and I got to pay
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:28.880]  $56,000 and they have shows with 16 million viewers on TV that you know have
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:33.760]  like $10 million in advertising money comes in $5 million episode budgets I

[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:15.080]  there's no debating and you're gonna roll them off of you and you're gonna
[02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:18.560]  grab with superhuman force that knife politically you're gonna round right up

[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.920]  decide to do it politically you got to get savage we'll beat these people but
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:32.560]  you got to commit and stop letting them intimidate you you got to ram your head
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:36.200]  up against the wall you got to get your teeth out you got to get ready because
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:41.040]  because they're gonna attack anyways you might as well stand up and look at the
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.960]  crap we're up against look at these piles of filth stole our wealth to build
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:49.280]  the system and they set up there to intimidate us they're nothing what does
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:55.080]  it say about us if we let them tame us a mouse taming the lion it's a joke you
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:58.800]  could see these freaks spiritually folks you'd realize it's in our hands to
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.800]  defeat them instantly the moment we realize what scum they are and that's
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:07.760]  happening right now it's beginning the truth is coming out and removing the
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:15.200]  eclipse but they're racing it use the allegory of the x-wings going down the
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:21.400]  reactor shaft trying to fire the torpedo down it and the death stars orbiting the
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:25.600]  planet ready to fire I mean it's it's it's like that folks and everything you
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:28.800]  do now has the effect
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:36.240]  there's up first here let's go to Kimberly in West Virginia thanks for
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:44.560]  holding her on the air Alex hey welcome thank you hi okay well as for Rand Paul
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:52.280]  and Trump to be honest with you if they truly love America this is what they
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:48:00.360]  will do Trump will take presidency Paul will take vice president only vice
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:08.040]  president will step up to a more powerful you know front next to the
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:14.400]  president role but here's the problem Alex I don't believe for one minute there
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:22.560]  will be a 2016 election that's America's problem you know to be honest with you
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:30.640]  this is what I believe the EU announced that oil may be going to ten dollars a
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:40.920]  barrel today okay 12 of our Navy soldier sailor were taken by Iran today
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:47.000]  but it's not even made cover well I'll tell you what this is a repeat of Mr.
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.920]  peanut man and you were a little while you were a little young you're younger
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:57.240]  than me but you remember Carter yes you know they're just doing the repeat I
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:04.600]  really truly believe that those 12 failures are what Obama got out of the
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:10.480]  treaty with Iran take 12 sailors well I did think it was like the Republicans
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:14.000]  with that deal that I ran to make Carter look bad I mean that was a staged event
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.480]  and it kind of seems like the hostage rescue thing all over again we'll see
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.040]  if that actually happens but you've got big banks big central banks big groups
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:26.760]  think sell everything collapse is coming you got Soros running around saying
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:31.200]  it you got all the planets aligning politically for a lot of crazy stuff to
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:36.840]  happen and and you know I know Trump and Paul were friends and play golf quite a
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.960]  bit and Trump says you know that Rand is an amazing golfer and all these
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:44.440]  compliments you know I wish the two would start being friends but he was one of
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:48.640]  Trump's big challenges early on and that's one thing Rand did I thought was
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.040]  a mistake was bash Trump when Trump was so popular crews were smart and said
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.400]  nice things and so that was another miscalculation and Paul kind of jumped
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:04.600]  the shark on that I'm being honest so I would hope that if Trump does win that
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:08.880]  he works with Senator Paul in some way but I hear you and I appreciate your
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:12.640]  call Kimberly we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back I'm gonna do five
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:15.240]  minutes next hour and then we have a David Knight coming up I'm gonna go to

[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:33.000]  really amazing bad timing for Obama as he pushes for self-driving cars video
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  services of car driving in an endless loop backwards well they want to beta
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.320]  test and make us accept it that's to get rid of humans and get rid of driving
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:44.000]  taxes by the mile that's why I'm not against self-driving cars except the
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.640]  whole plan is a takeover to get more prisoners released without charge for

[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:17.480]  couple hours now this one's up on info wars dot com and of course they'll
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:21.200]  probably try to make these refugees congressmen or something because that's
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:26.120]  what they like to do Syrian refugees rape three-year-old boy in Norway
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:30.760]  migrants raping women children in Europe just massively thousands of them
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:34.440]  because it's a jihad and they deserve it you know if you're not part of the jihad
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:38.120]  then it's gonna happen then of course when you're part of the jihad it's just
[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:43.160]  a license to kill it's a political satanic movement it's taken over Islam you
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.120]  could argue it's always had that in it but I mean this is just getting crazy
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:50.320]  with all the weirdo left us supporting it and acting like it's a delicious
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:54.400]  fetish or something I mean what a bunch of freaks Everton Rhode Island you're
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:55:02.320]  on the air worldwide thanks for calling hello Alex before I get to the topic I
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:07.320]  just want to say you and your crew are excellent and listen to you since over
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.600]  the last summer well brother we're just trying to expose the craziness that's
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:18.480]  out the open but thank you oh you're not kidding but anyway on a trunk though I
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:24.840]  don't agree with everything that he says but either way he is far better than
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:28.920]  Hillary Clinton and over here Rhode Island there's so many Hillary supporters
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:34.120]  I don't know why don't know how but it's just how it is over there and I don't
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:40.520]  like it whatsoever but on Rand Paul he's trying his very best to protect our
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:45.520]  constitutional right because they're being slowly taken away from us when he
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:49.840]  had that rant on c-span over the summertime arguing to try to get five
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:56.560]  minutes to speak that opened my eyes wide open and people don't realize it
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:02.680]  that slowly but surely if they can take away our Second Amendment right they
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:07.440]  will take anything away from us and bottom line that's all he's been doing
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:12.160]  right from the get is to defend our constitutional right Rand Paul has a
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:15.720]  great record and that's why the establishment attacked him is not
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:20.840]  being patriot enough but they have absolutely tried to shut him down and
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:23.800]  regardless even if it isn't when this one down the road for presidency or
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:28.200]  whatever it's just good to have him there and you're absolutely right they
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:32.640]  have done everything they can to block him thank you so much for calling let's
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:36.840]  go ahead and take another call let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Florida go
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:41.480]  ahead sir you're on the air hi Alex first of all just wanted to say great
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.600]  interview there with senator Paul quick question for you and then I'll go because
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:50.120]  I know you have a thousand other callers in your mind we know there's a
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:54.720]  financial collapse coming you've talked about it who is the most qualified is
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.360]  it going to be a Donald Trump isn't going to be a Rand Paul who's the most
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:01.920]  qualified out of the GOP to help get us out of that eventual collapse in your
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:05.920]  mind well so much of this is confidence so much of this is bringing jobs back
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:12.720]  and not having basically political and bureaucratic hidden tariffs that shut
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:17.400]  us down but the global depression they're gonna try to continue the global
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:20.680]  depression and give the global banks more power so just not letting them do
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:24.080]  that's key and I would say you know Rand Paul would be great about going out
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:27.880]  of the central banks Trump would be great about getting the jobs back here I
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:31.880]  really don't know that's a complex question you know also think hey let
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:36.040]  Hillary get in their whole agenda will stall she'll get the blame for the global
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.360]  depression are they about to give it to Trump to then blame a capitalist for
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:43.840]  what's about to happen you know there's globalist above Hillary and above Trump
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:47.600]  fighting for power and they've got larger more sophisticated views here's an
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:52.240]  example if Hillary got in info wars would probably be more successful and
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:55.080]  have more viewers and listeners than if a Trump got in people went back to sleep
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:59.400]  but the same bureaucracy continued on that happened under Bush but I don't care
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:02.800]  I'd rather get a trumpet because I think he's better for the country though it's
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:07.320]  not good for my show because Hillary might go so far as arresting me or you
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:12.560]  know starting World War 3 so I don't do stuff off of what's gonna help me I I

[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:24.400]  get rid of the free feed at infowars.com forward slash show we will and
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.640]  maybe have a YouTube feed every day and just put it on the page I don't know but
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:34.440]  thank you for being prisonplanet.tv members oh yeah yeah I didn't get to
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:36.920]  this for the callers David can get to those because I'm almost out of time
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:40.320]  anyway so I want to talk to Jason and Maya and Antoine and Steve and Kenny and
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:44.200]  others Chris Carter came out in a couple news articles and said I'm based on the
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:48.160]  new X files pretty much on info wars the scripts and Alan Jones we're even
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:52.000]  having Alan Jones character that like a huggy bear on Starsky and Hutch that they
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:55.600]  learned from or Gandalf that leads them through who's the authority figure and he
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:59.200]  said I don't think Alex Jones is right wing I think he's a libertarian and I
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:03.080]  think world government's real and is happening wow and we're now in contact
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:07.560]  with Carter so look look for that and the trolls both mainstream on said it
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:11.720]  wasn't happening yeah that's right I lied about it all I'm Brian Williams
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:16.520]  everything's a lie how much energy to take the lie for three four hours a day
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:23.720]  that is just spew truth obnoxiously but here's a clip from their promo of the
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.440]  new X file season 2016 where they talk about Alex Jones there's actual video
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:32.240]  not just text of it and then we'll go to David Knight 9-11 was a false flag
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:36.800]  operation it was a warm-up to World War three Joe Mikhail plays Tato Malley who's
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:40.640]  a conservative talk show host just knowing that I was gonna be able to be
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:46.480]  on this series that I am a massive fan of I couldn't believe my good fortune and
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:50.880]  then you meet David DeCovney and Jillian Anderson they are so cool and I asked
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:54.520]  them a way too many questions so I think they detected that I was a fan
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:58.680]  especially when I asked them to sign my skin with a tattoo needle I cast Joe
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:03.800]  Mikhail after seeing his appearance at the White House Correspondents dinner
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:09.160]  which was hilarious and he had exactly the quality I was looking for he is very
[03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:14.840]  conservative but his ideas about conspiracy theories match up exactly with
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:19.280]  molders it's all part of a conspiracy dating back to the UFO crash at Roswell
[03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:25.120]  in 1947 my character wants to get ahold of molder and that's how it starts join
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:29.360]  me for a little ride right here is fine low-flying aircraft often employ what
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:32.280]  they call dirt boxes to record conversations that I prefer private
[03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:37.400]  aircrafts employed by home he's really an amalgamation of so many characters on
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.480]  the internet who believe that there is not just an alien conspiracy but a
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:45.680]  possible conspiracy of men what I need is your expertise our expertise for what
[03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:50.080]  I'm rattling some pretty big cages in the intelligence community I start a ball
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:52.760]  that's enough we can't get to it all and then they go through the article
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:57.200]  saying it's based on me all right folks David Knight's coming up Jigari Jackson
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:05:02.880]  and more remember when Congressman Joe Wilson couldn't contain himself any
[03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:10.600]  longer and shouted at Obama we needed that on a loop for Obama's last state of
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:14.800]  the Union the story on fo wars.com looks at three of his biggest lies Obama
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:18.000]  continues to pretend we're focused on destroying ISIS when there's been a
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:22.520]  continuous stream of information showing we created funded and armed ISIS and
[03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:27.160]  continue to do so he claimed Obamacare created jobs when in fact it caused
[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:33.520]  companies that can't afford it hey you now have two different jobs to make ends
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:37.160]  meet why are you complaining and then there's the strongest economy in the
[03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:41.600]  world claim the reality is all jobs growth has gone to immigrants with 17
[03:05:41.600 --> 03:05:47.240]  percent of jobs now held in the stock market this year is down 20% and there's
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:52.040]  the absurd claim about the resurgence of when General Motors has exported most
[03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:56.440]  of the jobs of China and Chrysler was sold to fiat for a song for more

[03:08:17.760 --> 03:08:25.720]  line of the info war welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:31.560]  host for the rest of this hour on this Wednesday January 13th 2016 I've got a
[03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:35.620]  lot of stories here especially because Rand Paul was on earlier with Alex
[03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:39.800]  Jones and of course he's at the center of a lot of political news today not
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:43.200]  only what's going on with the debate and we want to look at some of the details
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:48.440]  about his exclusion his possible exclusion see if hopefully Fox will
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:52.440]  change their mind and we'll tell you why I think they should change their mind
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:58.200]  but also the fact that his audit Fed bill was introduced and yet failed so
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:01.960]  we're going to unpack that for you why is that important who voted for it who
[03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:05.400]  voted against it we'll talk about that as well and of course things are
[03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:08.960]  shifting around with Republican donors are starting to fold some of the
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.560]  super PACs other spent millions of dollars trying to get Jeb Bush elected
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:18.200]  and it's having absolutely no effect there's not just because Jeb is an
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:22.680]  inferior candidate in every respect out of touch and contemptuous of the
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:27.400]  American voters desires no it has to do with the fact that the traditional
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:31.760]  media has completely changed Donald Trump has been able to get where he is
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:35.840]  spending very little money so a lot of these donors are looking at this and
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:40.400]  saying maybe we've wasted our money and maybe we've wasted it on Jeb they're
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:44.400]  concerned about where Jeb is going we also have a breaking story about UN
[03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:51.160]  peacekeepers yet again caught in another scandal of going into a country and using
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:56.240]  the underage children raping them turning them into prostitutes paying them
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:01.320]  50 cents for sex this is what the this has been something of a tradition now
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:05.120]  for the United Nations as they go into these places there's been so many of
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:09.160]  these stories when I first saw this story I thought this is an old story yes
[03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:12.880]  it is an old story and it keeps repeating itself so we're gonna go into all
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:16.880]  of that and much more but first I want to play for you this report Jakari
[03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:21.360]  Jackson did he interviewed Cody Wilson about Cody's ghost gun and understand
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:24.680]  that when Obama talks about doing gun control what he wants to do is create
[03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:28.920]  smart guns now that people don't want smart guns and why don't they want smart
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:33.880]  guns well the addition of a lot of complicated technology makes these guns
[03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:37.400]  far less reliable if you're gonna have a gun for protection you need it to be
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:41.760]  reliable but it also makes it far more trackable and controllable by the
[03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:46.080]  government that's why Obama is pushing what people don't want now the ghost
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:51.560]  gun just does just the opposite it uses technology to make guns and when you
[03:10:51.560 --> 03:10:56.200]  make your own guns the government doesn't have nearly kind of control that
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:10:58.480]  it wants to have let's go to that report
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:03.960]  Jakari Jackson reporting for infowars.com today we are in the city of Austin Texas
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:08.040]  we're on our way to see printable gun pioneer Cody Wilson now you guys may
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:11.800]  recall Cody he made headlines many years ago for his production of the
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:17.160]  Liberator the first 3d printed pistol since then his technology is advanced
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:20.680]  and he actually has a shop that we're going to see where he assembles what is
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:24.920]  known as the ghost gunner it's a mill that allows you to make among many other
[03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:29.560]  things a lower receiver for a AR-15 so we're go check out his shop and see what
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:34.080]  he thinks about the recent reasonable gun control proposals made by the
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:37.600]  president okay so we're here with Cody Wilson and he's gonna walk us through
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:41.840]  defense distributed and show us how he fabricates the ghost gunner. Cody?
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:45.600]  Yes. Alright you're in the shop small shop let's come to the back
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:50.960]  assembly line model as long as you're happy with the machine looking like this
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:54.520]  okay that's what it looks like that's what we make there's no variation
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:58.640]  everything's the same it's the model T of personal assault weapon fabrication
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:02.960]  we start with the empty shell over here machine proceeds around the assembly
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:08.240]  line in a U comes back down through here makes a lot of takes a lot of sub
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:13.360]  assemblies from the back which are inserted as it goes gets fitted out
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:18.520]  with electronics power supply we do a little bit of setup code testing comes
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.280]  off the line goes out the back door to your house so what exactly does the ghost
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:29.600]  gunner do? The ghost gunner is in actuality just a mill it's a very tiny
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.840]  computer-controlled mill a computer tells a moving in mill in space where to
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:37.080]  go how to carve out a piece of aluminum that you can kind of bolt down to a
[03:12:37.080 --> 03:12:43.320]  work surface it is previous century technology there is nothing in it of it
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:46.520]  that it is itself revolutionary but when you ask me what does the ghost gunner
[03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:50.000]  do I don't really think about the milling I think about what it does to the
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:54.960]  liberal imagination what it does to the elitist gun control imaginary it
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:58.040]  destroys it that's what the ghost gunner really does and now secretly in
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:02.240]  garages in a neighborhood near you someone may or may not be manufacturing
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:08.160]  AR-15 in their garage the ghost gunner has a price tag of $1,500 and sports a
[03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:13.600]  very long waiting list Cody's machine has the ability to take a hunk of billet
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:19.000]  aluminum known as an 80% lower receiver and mill it into a principal part of an
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:24.800]  AR-15 rifle but as one might expect not all politicians are on board this
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:29.600]  again is the engine to the high-part and semi-automatic assault weapons that you
[03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:36.200]  see displayed here today with that the lower receiver an individual can buy
[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:42.760]  this 80 to a hundred dollars online this doesn't have a serial number and it
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:48.680]  doesn't require a background check all the person has to do go to someone who
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:53.880]  has a drill press you are a self-proclaimed anarchist correct yeah
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:57.560]  look I'm anti-state now all the way this your philosophy further your
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:03.040]  technology or your driver technology my technology further my philosophy I'm not
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:06.400]  sure if the philosophy is furthering the technology that much I mean our our
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:13.520]  insight is that change is tool-based and can be technically based but I hope that
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:18.480]  I don't lapse into a certain kind of arrogant technicism in 2016 president
[03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:25.240]  Obama made headlines by outlining plans for biometric GPS tracked firearms we
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:30.120]  need to develop new technologies that make guns safer if we can set it up so
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:38.240]  you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint why can't we
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:44.960]  do the same thing for our guns do you have any plans to make a fingerprint
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:49.400]  scanner for ghost gunner not at all jikari I want every ghost gunner to look
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:54.520]  like its brother I want to take his as little information as legally necessary
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:14:59.000]  to manufacture to ship the the capital stock of guns in this country will never
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:04.080]  be converted into these new guns and then we will never see a similar capital
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:07.560]  stock of these biometric enabled guns and there is no way of even demanding
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:13.040]  under any statutory authority present that same level of biometrics and
[03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:17.520]  whatever smart technology in my machine my machine is a milling tool it's like
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:21.480]  saying well should your hammer have you know fingerprint technology it's the
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:25.440]  same thing yeah well let me ask you how long until a product that comes out of a
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:29.120]  ghost gunner is military-grade technology look I'll answer the question
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:35.080]  that it's military-grade now commercial low receivers for AR-15s are
[03:15:35.080 --> 03:15:39.200]  machined aluminum often billet aluminum you're getting the exact same product
[03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:43.160]  off of the ghost gunner to military specification because we we base our
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:47.160]  fixturing and our software around the military spec of the AR-15 lower so
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:52.120]  you're getting functionally materially identical components to the military
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:57.040]  component now you want to UT did you study engineering what did you study
[03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:01.800]  that no man I studied law at UT this is a lot of the guys in this shop don't come
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:05.440]  from engineering backgrounds per se but we think that the computer revolution
[03:16:05.440 --> 03:16:10.240]  the digital revolution they impart certain abilities or the ability to
[03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:14.520]  educate yourself in a way that formal education tricks you into thinking that
[03:16:14.520 --> 03:16:17.880]  you you can't be educated so everybody that came into the shop didn't
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:22.560]  necessarily have a hands-on machine type shop background but they've got it now
[03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:27.360]  before the ghost gunner Cody first shot to fame with the production of the
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:34.280]  Liberator a crude single-shot 3d printable gun he used his skills and
[03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:39.080]  equipment to print things such as magazines as well so consider a cat
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:45.160]  file containing the information for 3d printable weapon system that file was
[03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:50.080]  seated by 30 people let's say as long as there's a free internet that file is
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:54.280]  available to anyone at any time all over the world a gun can be anywhere any
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:58.080]  bullet is now weapon the defense is tribute its goal isn't really personal
[03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:01.560]  arm and it's it's more the liberation of information it's about living in a
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:04.520]  world where you just download the file for the thing you want to make in this
[03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:08.480]  life this machine did a all the principal liberator components for the
[03:17:08.480 --> 03:17:15.040]  liberator trials back in early 2013 it's an old 2003 Stratus SST machine I'm
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:18.640]  involved in a large lawsuit against the US State Department this now in the
[03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:23.880]  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and that is fighting them over their their total
[03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:29.240]  blanket ban on my posting of our work here our research our r&d efforts to
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:32.960]  the internet they've literally targeted no one else in history you can go to the
[03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:36.080]  air 15 forms you can go to any kind of cat repository you want the gun files are
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:41.480]  all over the internet and have been for years doj got back to Congress after the
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:44.400]  anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act and said oh look sorry people
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:48.920]  can post bomb plans to the internet free speech but somehow after liberator the
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:54.000]  Obama administration was so embarrassed that they sick the State Department on
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:58.280]  me and told me to prove it how bad I wanted to do this kind of work with
[03:17:58.280 --> 03:18:03.880]  this you're printing the lower receivers correct but for a 1911 how how fully
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:07.720]  functional would a 1911 be coming out of a machine like this in the very same way
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:10.720]  that we were not producing entire air 15 on this machine you're producing like
[03:18:10.720 --> 03:18:16.800]  the receiver in the 1911 there's a frame component that can be milled out of
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:19.760]  aluminum which is also sometimes considered to be the regulated component
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:23.640]  so we're talking about creating the regulated components of guns as much
[03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:27.240]  as we're talking about being able to meaningfully manufacture them so if I
[03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:32.840]  can make my own air 15 receiver I sidestep the entire FFL registration
[03:18:32.840 --> 03:18:37.200]  serialization network and I can assemble my own private air 15 but I don't make
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:40.680]  every single component of the air 15 on this machine I'll read you this quote
[03:18:40.680 --> 03:18:44.800]  from Kalajnikov of course the maker of the AK-47 I didn't want to design a
[03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:49.240]  weapon that was going to be used in widespread fratricidal war I only wanted
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:18:53.720]  to help protect my country's borders now the ghost gunner the liberator all the
[03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:57.360]  stuff is in its infancy let's say the technology advances it becomes more
[03:18:57.360 --> 03:19:02.040]  widespread there are more than a few bodies attributed to the technology do
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:06.280]  you foresee a day when Cody Wilson will share a sentiment similar to Kalashnikov
[03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:12.760]  I shares Kalashnikov sentiment now the rest of his sentiment was that he he said
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:16.160]  don't blame me for for this technology and it's and it's used playing the
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:19.520]  politicians blame the nation-states in these large protracted wars right which
[03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:23.440]  are the really the consequence of the behavior between states as states I have
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:26.720]  nothing to do with that and whenever these people get on TV and point the
[03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:30.760]  finger at the hobbyists they fail to mention how many air 15s they themselves
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:36.280]  are shipping to Mexico to al-Nusra through Turkey with CIA operations and you
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:40.200]  know all over these theaters of war in the Middle East I have nothing to do
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:46.440]  with that now or will I have Obama cries for first graders in Connecticut does he
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:50.520]  cry for the first graders in any other country to which he shipped these assault
[03:19:50.520 --> 03:19:56.880]  rifles himself I didn't send them there how'd they get there absolutely you know
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:20:00.000]  gun control is people control you're not gonna control us we'll be right back

[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:07.640]  about Donald Trump Ron Paul I think go ahead yeah so hi I wanted to talk about
[03:25:07.640 --> 03:25:14.240]  Senator Paul and Donald Trump I think they dilute in both candidates they
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:19.760]  take in the truthers off the stage of history I think that they are most
[03:25:19.760 --> 03:25:24.640]  afraid of the message of truth in stuff like patriotism and stuff they don't
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:28.960]  like it I think that I think that Senator Paul should support the truth
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:35.680]  sometimes you have to have a little enemy in you to know your weaknesses and
[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:39.840]  when you say they they don't support the truth I mean because they don't talk
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:44.640]  openly about let's say 9-11 for example is that what you're talking about they
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:49.120]  don't like all the all of the candidates on the stage who are basically
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:54.160]  talking proof type things bringing out stuff that they don't like even being
[03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:58.880]  Carson when he talked about Obama's you know real father you know that that's
[03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:05.080]  sort of yeah and and Rand Paul said that as much today he got on Morning Joe
[03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:08.920]  today and said they've been saying for months ago narrow the field I don't
[03:26:08.920 --> 03:26:11.840]  think it's the job of the establishment of the Republican Party to decide who
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:15.080]  isn't in it he says I'm the one voice saying that we shouldn't make the sand
[03:26:15.080 --> 03:26:18.160]  glow I'm the one voice saying we shouldn't be collecting all the
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:21.000]  government shouldn't be collecting all your records I'm the one voice saying
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:24.840]  we shouldn't lock up every kid for marijuana and he really is the only
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:28.280]  one who is saying that that's why I think it's very valuable for him to be in I
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:32.160]  think that's why they don't want him in that's why they excluded remember they
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:36.440]  excluded Ron Paul from several debates and they also did the same thing to Gary
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:41.680]  Johnson saying well Gary Johnson two-term governor out of New Mexico you
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:45.400]  know he's not showing very high in these particular polls that we have picked
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:50.840]  and those polls many of them did not even list him as an option so it's a very
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:55.600]  they can rig this any number of ways and of course I think it's very telling the
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:27:00.240]  fact that we had this poll that was done within the time frame that Fox News said
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:02.880]  they're going to look at polls it was done by the Des Moines register as well
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:07.440]  as Bloomberg and then they kind of held that poll for a couple of days until
[03:27:07.440 --> 03:27:11.040]  after the deadline for reporting it I wonder what's going on you think maybe
[03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:15.120]  Bloomberg doesn't want Rand Paul in the debate you think maybe Fox News doesn't
[03:27:15.120 --> 03:27:17.960]  want him in you think maybe the Republican Party I think all of the
[03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:23.400]  above is that's my opinion what do you think Antoine yeah I think that all of
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:30.320]  them don't want him in and I think they might start you know you know giving
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:36.720]  these other liars liars I call them more time and it is giving him more
[03:27:36.720 --> 03:27:41.800]  opportunity to dilute the truth cut them off and you root oh yeah there's a lot
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:45.320]  of ways you can control that and of course I've been involved in third-party
[03:27:45.320 --> 03:27:49.560]  politics of the Libertarian Party I know that even when you go through and do
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:52.960]  signature petitions to try to get on the ballot we had to do that every four
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:56.280]  years Republicans and Democrats don't have to go through that it's a tremendous
[03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:59.920]  amount of time resources money that spent on that once you get on the ballot
[03:27:59.920 --> 03:28:05.000]  they don't allow your your candidates in most cases to go into a debate they
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.200]  typically would exclude our governor candidate they always exclude the
[03:28:08.200 --> 03:28:12.640]  presidential candidate even though they're qualified on 50 states they
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:16.280]  won't let them on to debate the Republicans and the Democrats because
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:19.960]  they control the process and there's many different ways they can control it
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:24.720]  thank you Antoine let's go to Steven in Illinois go ahead Steven
[03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:32.400]  hi first I'd like to thank you guys for waking so many people up but I will not
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:38.960]  be voting for Donald Trump either Rand Paul will get my vote or it will go to
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:44.280]  Gary Johnson of the Libertarians yeah I agree well tell us tell people why you
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:51.680]  why you wouldn't well his statements about things like we shouldn't let
[03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:57.680]  Muslims into the country and my grandfather my great grandfather fought
[03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:04.840]  to free his father's homeland of Germany from the fascist will of Hitler I won't
[03:29:04.840 --> 03:29:10.240]  frankly vote for somebody who's made statements even close to what Trump has
[03:29:10.240 --> 03:29:14.560]  said yeah I understand I understand he's made some very authoritarian statements
[03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:19.240]  and and hasn't really talked a lot about fundamental liberty statements so
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:21.760]  that's the concern that I have that of course what he said about the Muslims
[03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:25.160]  was that he would he would stop immigration until we figure out what's
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:28.120]  going on he wasn't saying he banned them forever but until we figure out what's
[03:29:28.120 --> 03:29:32.120]  going on I agree with that particular policy I think it's insane to bring
[03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:35.920]  people in from an area that we have created essentially a war and we're
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:40.960]  bringing in people here and in Europe that are military age we're not bringing
[03:29:40.960 --> 03:29:45.360]  in the kids we're not bringing in the sick we're bringing in military aged men
[03:29:45.360 --> 03:29:49.800]  that should tell you something we'll be right back stay with us we're on the

[03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:36.520]  it it does not appear that Rand Paul is going to make the cut in this prime time
[03:30:36.520 --> 03:30:41.440]  debate but John Kasich is what is this world coming to just a little side note
[03:30:41.440 --> 03:30:44.360]  here the majority of Americans polled think that Hillary Clinton should

[03:33:19.440 --> 03:33:22.520]  gonna go back to your phone calls in just a moment but as we were talking in
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:27.480]  the last segment about Rand Paul and I read that quote of what he said on
[03:33:27.480 --> 03:33:32.600]  MSNBC's morning Joe show this morning saying I'm the only one who doesn't
[03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:36.400]  want to make the sangle basically saying I'm the only one who doesn't want to get
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:40.080]  involved in all these wars I'm the only one who wants to stop the government
[03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:43.320]  collecting all this information violating your privacy I'm the only one
[03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:48.240]  saying that we shouldn't lock up people for having marijuana and that's true and
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:52.600]  you know he's saying it more effectively and more strongly having his finger on
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:56.000]  the pulse even then I think Gary Johnson when Gary Johnson announced his
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:00.600]  candidacy what he was saying was well what's his priorities his priorities are
[03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:05.960]  to keep gay marriage and abortion legal to do some other things it's like really
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:10.240]  he didn't list the NSA there he didn't list all of these different wars that
[03:34:10.240 --> 03:34:14.960]  were involved in and I thought that is the weakest statement than not being
[03:34:14.960 --> 03:34:19.920]  engaged with the current issues that are going on and beyond that what Rand Paul
[03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:23.920]  didn't say here is he understands that it's the unelected unaccountable
[03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:28.800]  bureaucracy that is totally out of control it's the true government it is
[03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:34.080]  the real government in Washington these bureaucracies that continually expand
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:38.680]  their reach into our lives that create the laws and then prosecute and
[03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:42.760]  persecute people with excessive fines adjudicate whether or not you are guilty
[03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:47.200]  with their own people he has recognized that and he has pushed back against that
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:51.120]  with the Reigns Act of course the Republicans would not support that either
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:56.360]  and think about the fact that if they get Rand Paul out of here it's going to
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:35:02.240]  be a completely establishment debate with the people who are left except for
[03:35:02.240 --> 03:35:06.360]  Donald Trump that they can't push out because he's so popular Chris Christie
[03:35:06.360 --> 03:35:11.280]  for example he says well I'm evolving on guns okay he said that on this last
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:15.680]  Sunday show I've gone through an evolution okay Chris Christie is evolving
[03:35:15.680 --> 03:35:20.560]  he's evolving we'll see if pigs can fly but what he said was he you know he ran
[03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:24.760]  for office he was a supporter of assault weapon bands and when he was running
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:29.440]  for office as a supporter of assault weapon bands Chris Christie said that
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:34.040]  opponents of assault weapon bands were radical and dangerous you know what I
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:39.520]  think the idea that you just go through with a redactor and take out what you
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:45.720]  don't like in the Constitution Christie I think that is dangerous and radical and
[03:35:45.720 --> 03:35:49.400]  he goes on to say you know when these things involve public safety I'm for
[03:35:49.400 --> 03:35:53.160]  public safety I'm not going to just get behind the NRA I'm not just going to get
[03:35:53.160 --> 03:35:59.040]  behind the Second Amendment safety is more important no it isn't it's not more
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:03.480]  important to the let and I've said this a million times let me say a million in
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:09.560]  one times okay when you give up your liberty to some degree to that degree
[03:36:09.560 --> 03:36:14.800]  you become a little bit of a slave a little bit more of a slave people who
[03:36:14.800 --> 03:36:20.440]  are slaves are never safe so to the degree that you give up your liberty
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:26.560]  you are enslaving yourself and making yourself less safe there is not a trade
[03:36:26.560 --> 03:36:30.800]  off that it is not a zero-sum game where you give up liberty and you get
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:35.920]  safety that's nonsense that is a fool's bargain Benjamin Franklin pointed that
[03:36:35.920 --> 03:36:41.200]  out at the founding of this country that people who do that deserve neither
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:46.240]  liberty nor safety and history has shown that you get neither liberty nor
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:51.720]  safety you become a slave to that degree and slaves are not safe slaves are not
[03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:56.760]  respected by their masters slaves are slaves they're not free understand that
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:37:00.720]  and so when you see him saying that understand that he is channeling the
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:05.320]  same lie that is being fed to us by Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Hillary
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:09.640]  Clinton or Jeff Bush or the rest of them it is simply a lie you will not get
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:13.880]  safer by giving up your liberty let's go back to the callers John in New York go
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:19.360]  ahead John hey a long time listener shout out to Alex and all you guys keep up
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:24.200]  the great work thank you let's both Rand Paul I want to give you a cold hard
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:29.920]  dose of reality here and talk strictly fact Rand Paul won the most straw polls
[03:37:29.920 --> 03:37:34.520]  of any candidate running in this race with 12 that's including the largest
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:39.480]  straw poll this year Rand Paul is the only candidate running in the race that's
[03:37:39.480 --> 03:37:44.400]  Pete Hillary Clinton in the same five states that Obama won twice none of the
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:49.680]  other candidate that Rand Paul has the biggest ground game in Iowa with 130
[03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:54.680]  chairs and co-chairs and over a thousand precinct captives in all 99 counties
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:59.560]  that's the most of any candidate in this race he's got 10,000 students coming
[03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:03.960]  out from and he has a bigger ground game in Iowa than Ron Paul did and Ron
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:10.840]  wound up with 22 or 28 delegates from Iowa all of these fake CFRs CIA patrol
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:16.120]  mainstream media polls of 280 year old grandmothers on landline just ain't
[03:38:16.120 --> 03:38:20.680]  cutting it yeah that's not any sort of representation of the entire GOP populace
[03:38:20.680 --> 03:38:23.920]  you could toss every poll they mentioned on the mainstream media in the
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:28.120]  garbage when actual registered voters stepped into a room to vote real deal
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:34.400]  straw polls Rand Paul won 12 straw polls Donald Trump won zero Rand Paul is the
[03:38:34.400 --> 03:38:38.120]  real front-runner in this race not Donald Trump not Ted Cruz not Marco
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:41.160]  Rubio Rand Paul has more supporters than Christie
[03:38:41.160 --> 03:38:47.960]  Kaseich Rubio Fiorina and Bush combined I agree with you I agree with you I think
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:53.080]  that it's absolutely absolutely true that they can use these polls and do use
[03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:57.480]  these polls they use push polls everybody knows perhaps about push polls
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:00.760]  well they'll come out and they'll ask a question maybe the day before the
[03:39:00.760 --> 03:39:04.840]  election and they'll throw a hint out of some absent unsubstantiated charge
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:10.040]  accusing somebody of something trying to push you in the opposite direction and
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:13.760]  of course as you mentioned you know picking who they're going to poll is
[03:39:13.760 --> 03:39:18.560]  is one aspect of that but let's look specifically at how they are rigging this
[03:39:18.560 --> 03:39:22.360]  particular game okay they say the Des Moines registered Bloomberg politics
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:28.120]  poll this is Politico that was released this morning showed Paul at 5% alone in
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:31.400]  fifth place in fact if the Des Moines register poll was included in the list
[03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:36.080]  of the five most recent polls says Politico it gets Paul into a tie for
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:41.440]  fifth place with Jeb Bush at 4.2% but of course they want Jeb Bush on the stage
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:45.400]  they don't want Rand Paul on the stage and so they say look this poll was
[03:39:45.400 --> 03:39:50.560]  released 36 hours after Fox gave the deadline for inclusion but the poll was
[03:39:50.560 --> 03:39:55.600]  conducted between January the 7th and January the 10th which was the
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:59.160]  qualification time okay so it's kind of a gray area but then they point this out
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:04.040]  quite simply had the register and Bloomberg released their poll which was
[03:40:04.040 --> 03:40:11.200]  completed Sunday on Monday at 5 59 p.m. instead of on Wednesday at 6 a.m. Paul
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:16.600]  would have qualified for the main stage do you smell a skunk in that John I do
[03:40:16.600 --> 03:40:21.560]  I mean Bush has no supporter yeah there's no way that Rand Paul could be
[03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:25.560]  polling anywhere near Jeb Bush Rand Paul has millions of supporters
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:31.160]  swarming everywhere online sending emails and calling Fox nonstop to try to get
[03:40:31.160 --> 03:40:34.520]  them on a debate or saying that they're gonna boycott the debate there's three
[03:40:34.520 --> 03:40:38.720]  candidates that have actual physical supporters in this race Rand Paul
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:43.720]  Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders yeah I agree well take a look what do you think
[03:40:43.720 --> 03:40:50.080]  about Iowa in 2000 and the 2012 election cycle you had the situation
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:54.960]  where we're supposed to believe that Rick Santorum won that after they changed
[03:40:54.960 --> 03:41:00.480]  the winner twice on that okay he was having the day before the caucus he
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:04.920]  went into a bar and nobody paid any attention to us matter of fact the total
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:07.600]  was shut up and sit down they were watching something they're watching a
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:11.440]  game on the televisions in the bar and we're supposed to believe that this guy
[03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:16.920]  ran away with the Iowa caucus I mean they rigged election and caucus not just
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:21.120]  the polls that they're rigging of course okay they rigged the elections and we
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:25.240]  had numerous examples of that throughout the election last time rigging it
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:31.720]  against Ron Paul I saw was every single kind of election fraud possible yes
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:36.280]  literally every single state in Puerto Rico fraud in the primaries brought at
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:40.400]  the caucuses brought at the county state and national convention it had to be the
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:45.680]  most fraud in the entire history of US election yeah and we had a good ground
[03:41:45.680 --> 03:41:50.000]  game in Iowa he had 1200 precinct captains similar to what Rand Paul has
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:55.440]  now so you know hopefully that's that's a good indication of who's gonna win the
[03:41:55.440 --> 03:41:59.800]  popular vote but we all know Ron Paul won Iowa yeah yeah exactly I'm just
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:03.200]  looking at that I'm looking at what happened I think it was in Maine where
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:07.160]  you had people who were counting the votes locally at the precincts and then
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:10.640]  they saw how the votes were being posted at the state level and they said
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:13.520]  wait a minute that's not what we called in I mean they were they got caught
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:17.600]  switching the votes when they tallied them up at the state level I mean as you
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:21.640]  point out there was fraud everywhere and if people haven't seen that and aren't
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:24.960]  completely disgusted with that they need to understand that and I think quite
[03:42:24.960 --> 03:42:30.400]  frankly the takeaway for me in terms of trying to get involved with the election
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:34.640]  process I'm I'm somebody who doesn't have any faith whatsoever in it anymore I
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:39.120]  believe that the the ballot box has completely failed I think we need to
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:44.000]  turn to the jury box which has failed as well but we can reclaim that more
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:48.800]  easily that's just an educational issue and an individual backbone issue one
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:53.120]  person out of 12 can stand up and stop that and we could have some politicians
[03:42:53.120 --> 03:42:57.840]  at the either at the state level or at the national level that would remove
[03:42:57.840 --> 03:43:01.720]  some of the impediments some of the riggings of our jury process I believe
[03:43:01.720 --> 03:43:04.920]  that's where we need to start shutting it down with jury nullification and with
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:07.160]  state nullification I want to get some of these other callers but thank you John
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:11.800]  that was a great call let's go to James and Washington go ahead
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:15.600]  right there and David night no good go ahead
[03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:21.600]  hey just three quick comments Trump my my lady said it best the other night he's
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:27.080]  nothing but a repackaged neocon I love his tone I love his non-political
[03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:32.880]  correctness but imminent domain torture spying killing women and children that
[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:38.840]  guy's a scumbag I agree I'm tired of his candy coating the war on terror he's a
[03:43:38.840 --> 03:43:43.120]  great guy I like he's got a great attitude I love his spirit but he's also
[03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:48.320]  endorsed Jeb Bush's son George Kubush we need to confront him on that we need to
[03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:53.280]  make sure he's straight on 9-11 he says Obama's funded the the rebels and all
[03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:56.920]  that well why can't he come out and say 9-11 wasn't inside job and let's get
[03:43:56.920 --> 03:44:01.440]  straight to the point I'm tired of lies Oregon there's truth coming out down there
[03:44:01.440 --> 03:44:06.760]  right now actually just got just resigned rumor has it judge and sheriff are
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:14.740]  being exposed as we speak who just resigned I'm not pursuing now but
[03:44:14.740 --> 03:44:20.680]  fire chief is resigning in a nutshell all the cook all the crooks down in Oregon
[03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:24.680]  are being exposed right now and I love all you guys but I'm rebuking you all
[03:44:24.680 --> 03:44:28.920]  right now you need to get down there and it get a reporter on there 24 hours
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:34.120]  seven days a week shame on you guys for not putting in a light on this we know
[03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:39.240]  James way James you know what we were there and we had scheduled interviews
[03:44:39.240 --> 03:44:43.480]  with him and Bundy he repeatedly canceled those interviews and so we went
[03:44:43.480 --> 03:44:47.120]  there to talk to him and we've talked about what's going on about the larger
[03:44:47.120 --> 03:44:52.040]  issue about the sage bushrub rebellion I agree with the problems that are out
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:55.400]  there we've talked about what the congressman Greg Walden has talked
[03:44:55.400 --> 03:45:00.240]  about there in Oregon and that's that's exactly what the people need to
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:04.680]  understand is what the problem is there I don't agree with the process that
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:07.360]  they're doing there but we were going to give him and Bundy a chance to talk and
[03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:10.920]  he canceled multiple times on us so you know what I'm we're not going to hang
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:15.320]  out in the cold waiting until he deans it possible for us to talk to him that's
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:20.440]  total BS okay and I respect what they did at the Bundy ranch I think they did
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:25.440]  that very wisely very smartly I think this is a very bad tactic I think they've
[03:45:25.440 --> 03:45:29.280]  made their point I think for their own safety they need to move on I
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:32.120]  disagree with Hillary Clinton she wants to have them arrested okay she didn't
[03:45:32.120 --> 03:45:35.720]  call for the arrest of anybody with Occupy and these guys are protesting it
[03:45:35.720 --> 03:45:38.800]  they haven't hurt anybody they haven't hurt any property any government
[03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:42.600]  property I think they should be allowed to go I would like to see them go and
[03:45:42.600 --> 03:45:46.320]  start this movement in a different way there's other ways that we can do this
[03:45:46.320 --> 03:45:51.200]  and I think it's a very bad strategy let's go on to Brandon and Michigan and
[03:45:51.200 --> 03:45:56.680]  that'll be our last call go ahead Brandon hey how you doing doing good good good
[03:45:56.680 --> 03:46:01.160]  so but before I you know I'm sorry back it up a little bit I'm sure that all of
[03:46:01.160 --> 03:46:04.640]  your viewers even if they don't specifically agree with Rand Paul can
[03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:07.800]  appreciate the view that he's bringing to the race and what one thing he said
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:12.240]  before give a call down to the Republican National Committee and and ask
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:17.240]  them if they you know could sort of change the fact that they are sort of
[03:46:17.240 --> 03:46:21.120]  controlling who gets to be a candidate who doesn't so I'm gonna give you a
[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:26.760]  number right now okay we can't give out numbers on the phone because we don't
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:30.360]  know whose whose number that is we can't verify that but yeah look it up
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:34.520]  contact people get involved this is a time to scream and shout at them I
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:37.840]  really do think that that matters to some degree as whether or not it's going
[03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:42.120]  to matter if he gets into the debate if they're going to rig the elections
[03:46:42.120 --> 03:46:45.840]  and the rest of the process but we can at least fight we can at least register
[03:46:45.840 --> 03:46:49.960]  our discontent with them now one of the things that happened yesterday that
[03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:53.880]  that was pretty interesting was of course we had the Obama State of the
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:58.800]  Union he said he was going to they said it in advance that he was going to talk
[03:46:58.800 --> 03:47:04.960]  about self-driving cars turned out that he didn't however tomorrow he's going to
[03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:09.120]  have an official with the Department of Transportation that's going to go to the
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:14.000]  trade show in Detroit and there with the other car with car makers that are
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:18.880]  going to be in attendance there he's going to push to streamline regulations
[03:47:18.880 --> 03:47:24.040]  to make sure that we get self-driving cars more quickly and let me tell you as
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:28.200]  somebody who is concerned about surveillance somebody who is concerned
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:32.600]  about government exercising more and more control over certain areas of our
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:38.280]  life I am adamantly opposed to this I see a lot of problems in terms of safety
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:43.400]  as well let's take a look at this video here this was up on the grudge report
[03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:48.160]  dramatic video captures a driverless car doing donuts on a busy residential
[03:47:48.160 --> 03:47:52.560]  street and of course this is happening right in front of a busy apartment an
[03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:55.800]  apartment building in a busy street the driver didn't know why this had happened
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:00.920]  okay and he's got Honda Accord he says it was a mechanical error if you look at
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:04.920]  that videotape I don't believe that was one of these driverless cars and Honda
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:10.480]  has had a driverless car they announced it back in January of 2014 they brought
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:15.200]  it to the United States in September of 2014 I don't believe that that was one
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:19.440]  of their quote-unquote driverless cars but understand that if this is just an
[03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:23.120]  ordinary car if it's just a mechanical car with some there you can see the
[03:48:23.120 --> 03:48:27.840]  picture of it if you're watching this if it's just an ordinary car and it has
[03:48:27.840 --> 03:48:32.080]  that kind of a problem what happens when we make the car system more complex
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:36.840]  when we add more electronics when we add software to it see that's the problem
[03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:42.480]  with the so-called smart guns is the loss of control the problems that come
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:47.640]  about with system complexity and Google is talking about its car slip-ups at the
[03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:52.360]  same time it's getting the White House to try to shut down regulations and
[03:48:52.360 --> 03:48:55.320]  course the reason why the White House is getting involved here is because of
[03:48:55.320 --> 03:49:00.120]  Google and what's going on in California as we talked about before Google has
[03:49:00.120 --> 03:49:06.000]  had 11 accidents in six years of operating in California as a result the
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:09.720]  Department of Transportation California said we're going to require that you
[03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:13.840]  have a human as a backup system and their capability to control the car that
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:16.240]  means you give them a steering wheel you give them brakes you give them a
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:21.080]  throttle that sort of thing and Google doesn't like that that's going to
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:25.320]  cramp their roll out so what they did was they went to Obama in the same way
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:29.840]  that the the big agriculture companies went to the federal government said you
[03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:33.440]  know what we've got a lot of regulations that are coming up at the state and local
[03:49:33.440 --> 03:49:37.520]  level about GMOs we don't like that so we want you to shut that down nationwide
[03:49:37.520 --> 03:49:41.720]  we want you to come up with a law out of Washington that says that states don't
[03:49:41.720 --> 03:49:45.560]  have the right to do that which of course is a clear violation of the 9th
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:49.080]  and 10th Amendment if anybody's paying attention to the Constitution anymore
[03:49:49.080 --> 03:49:53.000]  but that's the way these guys operate if they're getting pushed back against
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:56.240]  their products because people don't like them feel that they're dangerous
[03:49:56.240 --> 03:50:00.760]  threatening then and enact legislation at the state and local level which they
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:04.520]  have a right to do then the federal government is brought in by the big
[03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:10.160]  corporations to shut this down now 11 accidents in six years and as I pointed
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:15.640]  out over 45 years I've had one accident it wasn't my fault just like these 11
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:19.160]  accidents were being told were not the fault of the Google cars but if you
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:23.720]  extrapolate that out that would mean that over my time of driving I've had I
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:30.440]  would have had 83 accidents 83 accidents over a lifetime of driving would you
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:34.280]  want to get in the car with me I will not get in one of these cars because of
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:40.280]  that and yet it's not even that they're talking about having 272 system
[03:50:40.280 --> 03:50:45.000]  anomalies there with Google 69 occasions in addition to that where the drivers
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:51.560]  had to seize control so it's well over 300 okay about 350 times and they said
[03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:55.280]  13 of these would have resulted in an accident stay with us we'll be right
[03:50:55.280 --> 03:50:57.520]  back
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:06.240]  my name is Don whiskin in 1994 I lost my 62 year old father to complications of
[03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:11.720]  bypass surgery in 1977 my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment
[03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:16.040]  he suffered a heart attack in January of 98 my mother had a stroke and passed
[03:51:16.040 --> 03:51:21.160]  away in her bed 21 days later my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival
[03:51:21.160 --> 03:51:25.760]  to the hospital he waited too long in June that same year I almost joined them

[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:31.400]  California was concerned about this and if we look at what happened in terms of
[03:55:31.400 --> 03:55:34.240]  their quote-unquote slip-ups this is an article that you can find on dredge
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:40.360]  report system anomalies cause drivers to take the wheel 272 times according to
[03:55:40.360 --> 03:55:44.560]  their records and they say in an additional 69 occasions the drivers
[03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:49.080]  seize control from the automated systems based on their own judgment calls
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:55.080]  nevertheless Google says the trend looks good looks good they say in 13 of
[03:55:55.080 --> 03:56:00.120]  those 69 driver-initiated disengagement would have resulted in crashes okay
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:03.800]  if they've been staring let me let me explain something to you okay is your
[03:56:03.800 --> 03:56:08.040]  iPhone working better today than it was three or four years ago when you bought
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:14.600]  it if you got an update chances are no what's gonna happen to your ibuic when
[03:56:14.600 --> 03:56:18.120]  a three four years after you got that car they find out that there's some
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:22.920]  problems maybe some vulnerabilities maybe some bugs in the system so they put
[03:56:22.920 --> 03:56:26.920]  out a new one for the new ibuics and then you get an update for yours too
[03:56:26.920 --> 03:56:31.160]  because if they don't they're going to have some liability perhaps in terms of
[03:56:31.160 --> 03:56:37.320]  safety so they give you that that update do you think that three-year-old ibuic
[03:56:37.320 --> 03:56:40.680]  is going to work as well as the new ibuic with a new software update see
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:44.000]  that's the problem with this they're going to gradually get better they're
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:47.800]  going to gradually get the bugs ironed out but then you're going to start
[03:56:47.800 --> 03:56:52.040]  bringing them in in spades we've seen that happen with every kind of electronic
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:56.040]  device I've watched that personally you know that from your experience I mean we
[03:56:56.040 --> 03:57:01.880]  see that car going around endlessly in reverse okay it's called an endless loop
[03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:06.520]  in software programming okay that's the real world example of an endless loop
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:09.880]  when you see that car out of control going in circles and of course we've had
[03:57:09.880 --> 03:57:15.320]  google maps drive people who foolishly rely on google maps drive them off of
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:19.240]  bridges kill them drive them off of cliffs into
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:23.640]  uh into the woods where they get stranded uh over and over again we've
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:27.480]  seen people but but google maps told me to do this and you know they can't
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:31.240]  possibly be wrong you need to not have blind faith and
[03:57:31.240 --> 03:57:34.760]  technology as part of this article they say engineers also used a powerful
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:38.920]  simulator to generate scenarios let me tell you
[03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:41.880]  something is somebody who's run simulations they're no better than
[03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:45.160]  your models that's the problem I have with climate change okay
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:48.920]  garbage in garbage out they say this stands in contrast to the
[03:57:48.920 --> 03:57:53.160]  hazy variability that we accept and experience human drivers says google
[03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:56.200]  never mind the 16 year olds we send in the streets to learn amidst the rest
[03:57:56.200 --> 03:57:59.480]  of us you know what my 90 year old aunt has a
[03:57:59.480 --> 03:58:02.840]  better driving record than the google cars yet
[03:58:02.840 --> 03:58:07.720]  obama says we're going to streamline the regulation of these we're going to
[03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:11.480]  remove this back we need to have a nimble flexible approach since when
[03:58:11.480 --> 03:58:15.080]  do they ever want to deregulate anything there's something more to this
[03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:18.760]  folks you need to understand they're coming to control your movements
[03:58:18.760 --> 03:58:22.120]  they're going to tax and track everything you do and control your
[03:58:22.120 --> 03:58:25.560]  movements join us tonight at seven central apm eastern for the nightly
