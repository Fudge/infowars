[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:31.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It is January 16, 2009, Friday. I've been with you all week.
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  My name is Jason Burmus. I'm a filmmaker, and I do a little talk radio here and there.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  Don't worry, Alex will be back. I believe he's going to be doing the Sunday show, but don't quote me on that.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  He'll definitely be back Monday morning, and it's been a real pleasure sitting in all week.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  Some of our great guests, and we're going to have great guests today, Ted Anderson coming on in about 30 minutes.
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  We're going to have Peter Dale Scott, you know, author of The War Conspiracy, which one of the first books to be banned in this country.
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  I talked about parapolitics. He writes a lot of op-ed pieces. He's recently done one over at 9-11truth.org,
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  and it's a long one. It's all on the bailout and martial law. So we're going to be talking to him about that.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  We have Webster Griffin Tarpley later in the day. He's got two books out on Obama,
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  and of course we're working on the Obama film here at the Info Warrior Studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  And we're also going to have the international forecaster Bob Chapman on later in the day.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  Now, we're making this Obama film, so we're trying to get as much Obama media as possible,
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  and last week I got here the story broke that Obama was going to be on the cover of Spider-Man.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  Well, let me tell you how hard it is to get a copy of this thing.
[01:49.000 --> 01:59.000]  It stands on Wednesday, and we tried to get it yesterday, Thursday, and it was sold out everywhere.
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  It's gone on eBay, and the cheapest that you can get this comic book for, this Obama book,
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  Obama Spidey, is about 80 bucks. You can get it for 80 dollars.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  It got printed a week and a half ago, shipped out, and it just hit the newsstands yesterday.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  A lot of people are hoarding it. You don't see them much in your local CVS or Rite Aid or Drugstore anymore.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  They're only usually in comic book shops, and of course, all the little comic book geeks out there
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.000]  bought 10 copies or 100 copies, and they all threw them up on eBay, and now we'll have to wait for a second or third printing.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  But it's actually made headlines. Spider-Man comic starring Obama sells out in record numbers nationwide.
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  See, that's what people don't tell you. The more there are, the less it's going to be worth.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  So in the long run, this comic book's probably not going to retain any value,
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  but, you know, since people are still in love with this image of Obama, now's the time to gouge people.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  Obama-Man. Obama-Man does whatever a spider can.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  Marvel Comics said it plans to print a second and third round of the latest Spider-Man comic book after the issue,
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  which features President-elect Barack Obama, sold out in record numbers Wednesday.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Just hours after hitting the stands, the company expects to be the industry's best-selling comic in over a decade.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  Wow. That should really speak to the cult-like status of Barack Obama.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  The plot unfolds when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker, who attends the presidential inauguration as a news reporter,
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  spots two identical Obamas just minutes before the new president is to give his inaugural address.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Yeah, if you go online, you can see some of this, and the chameleon, I believe, is the villain.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  The webcrawler springs into action and rescues Obama from the villainous impostor.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  The new president then thanks the superhero with a fist bump.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  That's right, he doesn't just fist bump his wife, ladies and gentlemen, Spidey. It's the hip president.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  We've got a hipster in.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  It's less of a political statement than it is of Spidey's fan made good, Wacker said,
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  but Wacker said that he never expected the issue to sell out in less than a day.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  I didn't foresee the book was going into a second printing. That caught me by surprise.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  But it's the new president, no matter who it is, it's going to get attention.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  Yeah, it's not the same thing.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  If they had put Bush on the cover in 2001, before or 2000, 2001, before the 9-11 attacks,
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  I doubt it would have sold out.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  In fact, I promise you that it would not have sold out.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  So you listeners out there, any of you comic book geeks that bought like 10 copies,
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  we'd appreciate you to mail us one, so we don't have to spend a hundred bucks on it.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  News blitz coming up.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  The FDA, of course, considering these genetically modified foods, no kidding.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back after this.
[04:46.000 --> 05:08.000]  PrismPlanet.com and FullWars.com.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  For those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  Self-preparedness is the key to survival.

[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[06:18.000 --> 06:27.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[06:27.000 --> 06:33.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[06:37.000 --> 06:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the tenth anniversary of life.
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.000]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you?
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  AkolaBlue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  The FDA pledges openness on gene-altered products.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  No kidding. Federal health officials Thursday pledged a new open process
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  for approving drugs and foods from genetically engineered animals.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  Consumer groups complain the policy won't do enough to tell people if they're eating gene-altered animals
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  and fails to protect the environment.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  They urge the incoming Obama administration to reconsider it.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  They won't reconsider it, don't worry.
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  The real problem with this is that, of course, they're going to pass all this genetically modified food
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  and then it doesn't have to be labeled.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  Okay, so now they're telling you, don't worry, don't worry, the FDA is finally going to look into this.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  We're going to have that great genetically modified food.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  It's going to be delicious. They're going to make sure it's okay for you, but they're not going to label it.
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  So, you know, have fun eating your cloned cattle and your genetically modified milk and cheese.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  It's outrageous.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  They are completely ignoring consumers' overwhelming desire for laboring.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  Labelling Sid and Mike Hansen, a senior scientist with Consumers Union, published a publisher of Consumer Reports.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  FDA officials said genetically engineered foods will be labeled if they are different in some important way from natural foods.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  For example, non-fat filet mignon.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  No, Mark. Oh, by the way, this filet mignon is absolutely cloned and genetically altered,
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  but if it's non-fat, we'll label it.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Just get ready, folks. Nothing changed.
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  I know everybody wanted to clamor for change and believe that this administration was going to bring in some kind of like superhero nonsense.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  I know everybody saw that Alex Ross painting of Obama as Superman, but that's fiction.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  Okay, that's not true.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  He's another frontman for the same globalists.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Let's say globalists real slow together.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Globalists.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Internationalists.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  They're the ones that control Obama.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  In fact, you and two Obama don't change Afghan strategy.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  And of course, all these policymakers are chiming in now that Obama is saying,
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  you know, we're going to redistribute our troops.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  He doesn't say redistribution.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  He says that we're going to have more troops in Afghanistan.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  Well, if they're leaving Iraq and they're going to Afghanistan, that's a redistribution of troops.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  You and two Obama don't change Afghan strategy.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Really?
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  We shouldn't change the strategy in Afghanistan.
[10:39.000 --> 10:47.000]  We've almost been there for, let's see, it's got to be running seven and a half years, almost eight years.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  Almost eight years we've been in there, but don't do anything different.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  Nothing.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  U.S. Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who toured the region earlier this month, said that things are going to get tougher in Afghanistan before they're going to get better.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that's because we're going to throw in a bunch of troops in there.
[11:05.000 --> 11:14.000]  We're going to say we're having the same quagmire type problems that we had in Iraq and we'll be stuck in the Middle East throughout the term of the Obama administration.
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.000]  A couple days ago, you may have remembered that I talked about city group and how they had about 48 hours before they were totally and completely done.
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I mentioned that their housing, their mortgage department had already been bought up by Morgan Stanley.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  Well, here it is, city group post loss splits up the bank.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  Okay, so it's further being decimated.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  It's pretty much gone.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  City group said Friday it is splitting into two businesses as it has reported a fourth quarter net loss of $8.29 billion.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  It's fifth straight quarterly loss.
[11:49.000 --> 11:59.000]  And city groups reorganization, one business, city corp, will focus on traditional banking around the world while the other city holdings will hold the company's riskier assets.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  Right now, money is a risky asset.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  I don't know how much riskier it could possibly get.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  Folks, get your money out of the city bank if you've got it there.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  Go to another bank, please.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  You know, I'm not going to try to sit here and promote Bank of America, but Chase Manhattan doesn't seem like it's going to go under.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  CEO, Valcom Pandit, this is the woman they were saying they were going to get rid of in the article I read a couple days ago,
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  move will allow city group to sell or spin the city holdings assets to raise cash.
[12:24.000 --> 12:34.000]  It also reveals the company's growing focus on back to basics lending and deposit gathering and dismantles the financial supermarket created a decade ago.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  Listen, there's just going to be more and more and more bad news.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  Bad, bad news for city group.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  Here, it looks like it's already being integrated with Chase Manhattan.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  Revenue fell 13% to 5.6 billion from a year ago.
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  At its peak performance in the second quarter of 2007, city group was pulling 25.8 billion in revenue.
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  City group used to be the largest bank by assets, but recently lost the title to JPMorgan Chase and company, the Rockefeller banks.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  More Rockefeller banks are coming up and it looks like probably city group will probably have to sell off to Chase Manhattan and JPMorgan.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  I can see that happening.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  More bad news, at least more bad economic news in the U.S. Circuit City to liquidate remaining U.S. stores.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  Now, they declared bankruptcy back in November right before the holiday shopping season, but now it's over.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  They're going to just have to sell it all off.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  They're going to liquidate the remaining U.S. stores, which is over 500.
[13:38.000 --> 13:46.000]  Circuit City stores incorporated the nation's second biggest consumer electronics retailer, the second largest one.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  Said Friday, it had run out of options and will be forced to liquidate its 567 U.S. stores.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  The closures could send another 30,000 people into the ranks of the unemployed.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  This is the only possible path for our company, James A. Markham.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  Acting Chief Executive said in a statement, we are extremely disappointed in this outcome.
[14:07.000 --> 14:16.000]  Well, when you're competing against Walmart that sells TVs, you know, one to $500 cheaper for the same model,
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  and you can't keep up with the market and no one has money to be spending.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  I mean, it was the worst Christmas in years, folks.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  They don't have money to be buying these big televisions.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  And these Blu-ray disc players, you know, the computer, they upgrade themselves every six months.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  You know, some people aren't buying those either.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  They're sticking with the computer they got two years ago.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  Of course, you're going to go under.
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.000]  And we don't make anything in this country, so get ready for more retailers to go under.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  Circuit City is probably just the beginning.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Just blitzing through the news right here.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  We covered this story a little bit yesterday and earlier in the week,
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  but courts ruled that teachers can have sex with their 18-year-old students and not come under any scrutiny at all.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  They get to keep their jobs.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  Parents are outraged, and as well they should be.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Whether or not you take this into a criminal prosecution, I mean, if the person is 18,
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  I can see why you wouldn't do that, but the guy should lose his job.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  He should at least be relocated, although relocation probably won't do much.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  He'll do it with another student.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  But, you know, this guy walked away.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  He beat the rap.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  He's a family guy, too.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  He had three kids.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  And the courts ruled, yeah, you can have sex with your 18-year-old kids,
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  but kids that text each other, teenagers, 16 and 17-year-olds, naked pictures, you know,
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  rambunctious teenage behavior, they're going to charge them.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  Yeah, they're going to charge them with child pornography.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  Unbelievable.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  You know, we played that clip yesterday.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  It was kind of mind-blowing.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  And they's like, oh, don't worry.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  We can't charge them with anything else other than child porn.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  But if they're convicted, they won't be on a sex offender's list.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Really?
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  I mean, something tells me that they probably will be on a sex offender's list and be forced to register.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  And it's absolutely, unbelievably ridiculous.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  First of all, it's ridiculous that we've gotten to the point where we're going to say,
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  okay, teachers can have sex with their students as long as they're 18.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  No.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  No.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  This is somebody who's been in a position of power most likely throughout this person's teenage years,
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  and sometimes their preteens, somebody who's gained their trust,
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  they have no business having a sexual relationship with a student, okay?
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  Wait for them to graduate.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  Please.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  I'm begging you.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  It's just the twisted priorities of this country, man.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  I'm going to go over it.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  House Democrats propose $825 billion stimulus bill.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  See, the spending's not done.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  That bailout's just the beginning.
[16:53.000 --> 17:00.000]  House Democrats on Thursday unveiled details of an $825 billion plan designed to boost the sagging U.S. economy.
[17:00.000 --> 17:09.000]  The package is a mixture of a $550 billion in spending program and a $275 billion in tax temporary tax cuts.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  The total had three to four million new jobs to the American workforce.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  Doubt it.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  We wanted to get the biggest bang for our buck of every dollar spent, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  Ugh, what a disgusting, wretched, vile woman she is.
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  At $825 billion, the legislation would be one of the largest bills ever to have moved through Congress.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  And by traditional standards, lawmakers were moving with unusual speed.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat from Nevada,
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  the majority leader, have pledged to have it ready for Obama's signature by mid-February.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  I'm sure it'll be early February.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  Why mid-February?
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  Let's not wait a month for the man to be inaugurated.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  We're four days away, folks.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  Four days away.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And don't worry, you can catch it on ESPN.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  Of course, Republicans are on an uproar.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  They're not part of the process.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  More WWE politics on the floor.
[18:05.000 --> 18:13.000]  I guarantee that this almost trillion-dollar stimulus package or something similar or exactly like it will be passed,
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  and we will be the ones holding the bag.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  We're the ones paying the bills.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.000]  That's right, you pay taxes.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  You got a job?
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  Yeah, we're paying for this.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  Just like we're paying for the criminal bailout.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  In fact, criminal bailout, that's another headline.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Where is that?
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  People are finally asking the right question.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  Conservative Zask is bailout unconstitutional.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Of course, it's unconstitutional.
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.000]  Dick Armey, the former Republican House Majority Leader, addresses the media at the Republican National Convention in 2008.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  And now, I guess, now that their boy's not in, now they're going to say,
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  oh, this is just terrible.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  This is out of the New York Times, by the way.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  While much of the debate over the $700 billion federal bailout plan has focused on whether the money is being spent wisely or well,
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  concerns are growing among many conservatives about its constitutionality.
[19:07.000 --> 19:13.000]  Remember, they had to threaten many of the Republicans who didn't want this with martial law before passing it.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  Some conservatives have argued that the law creating the program,
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  which Congress passed hastily in October, violates the constitutional principles that limit the amount of power that lawmakers can delegate to the executive branch.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  Wow. There it is. Checks and balances.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  Let's read that last sentence again.
[19:36.000 --> 19:45.000]  Which Congress passed hastily in October violates the constitutional principles that limit the amount of power that lawmakers can delegate to the executive branch.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  That's right. Three branches of government, folks.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  And we're supposed to limit that power. Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv.
[19:51.000 --> 20:19.000]  I'm Jason Bermas. It's The Alex Jones Show.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[20:31.000 --> 20:39.000]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.

[21:00.000 --> 21:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[21:23.000 --> 21:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[21:34.000 --> 21:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933,
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not,
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  Three, two, one!
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  Are you one of the millions of people who make New Year's resolutions?
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Are you also one of the millions who wind up breaking those resolutions?
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  I would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  Well, right now, success is one click away.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  Let this be the year you are going to protect yourself year round.

[23:59.000 --> 24:13.000]  Music
[24:13.000 --> 24:23.000]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  I focus on the pain
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  It's the only thing that's real
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  All right folks, we're back.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  It is the Alex Jones show. We are blitzing through the news.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  And I'm glad I get to blitz through the news. I really haven't had a big, big chance to do this
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  while I have guests on and usually the first hours when I get all this stuff in.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  It's out of the New York Times. We're just going over it.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  Conservatives ask if bailout is unconstitutional.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  Of course it's unconstitutional.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  We'll get to that in a second, but I want to thank one of our very great sponsors.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  Probably my favorite sponsor. I probably shouldn't be playing favorites,
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  but the Acola Blue Machine here is just 110% delicious, folks.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  Taking water from thin air and then purifying it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  It doesn't get any better than that. You can get it cold. You can get it hot.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  Get some tea. Good. Hit the hot button. It's amazing.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's a very cheap, I mean, literally you pay for it in a year if you buy a bottle of water.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  And that's even if you're buying the low-grade stuff.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  You don't even have to spend a ridiculous amount.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  The website to go to is www.ecolablue.com.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's ecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O, blue.com.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  Or you can call the toll free number at 866-585-4044.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  I also want to remind people that there is a seminar going on today and this weekend.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  First, it's in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  It's being put on by the Heartland Emergency Group.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  HeartlandEmergency.com is the website.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  The seminar includes speakers like Big John Lipskin of the host of Don't Tread on Me.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  And basically, we're going to be speaking about self-preparedness.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  What happens in the case of emergency?
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  How do you, you know, use your freeze-dried foods?
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  How do you use these seeds?
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  And this is going to be at 6 p.m. tonight in Fredericksburg at the Ag Building, 95 Frederick Road.
[26:21.000 --> 26:28.000]  And Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. in Austin, Texas at Brave New Books, 1904 Guadalupe Street.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  If you need to call somebody about the information is 512-921-9015.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  That's 512-921-9015 or 9016.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  Remember, that's HeartlandEmergency.com and we've got seminars going on the next three days.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  All right, so what's unconstitutional?
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  Well, I mean, all right, first of all, the independence new off the bat, Robert A. Levy,
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  an intelligible principal that provided clear guidance to an agency or a regulator,
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  but that, he said, is precisely what is missing from the bailout.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  In other words, there is no intelligible principal.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  We just said, here you go, print as much as you like, hide it all, buy up infrastructure.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  Now, even Dick Armey, you know, hardcore Republican, in fact, former Republican House majority leader, said this,
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  when Congress delegates so much authority to the executive branch with so few rules to guide its discretion,
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  Congress unconstitutionally transfers its lawmaking power to the executive branch.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  And that's what we've done.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  We've given the executive branch just an insane amount of control over our finances.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  And get ready to take it hard, folks.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Again, we're four days away from the inauguration.
[27:44.000 --> 27:52.000]  I don't know if we're going to put any credence into what Biden and Powell and Albright have said about the inaugural crisis.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  So Obama's inaugural crisis, I think it's here.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  Could it get worse? You bet it could get worse.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  So, you know, the best way to protect yourself, folks, is to get your fiat currency out of the bank
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  and get hard currency, you know, gold and silver.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  A lot of people are like, well, you know, you want to make some money on a boat?
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  No, this is about security.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  This is about having something that is going to retain value no matter what happens to the economy in the United States.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  Gold and silver will retain value in other markets.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  I promise you, it's a worldwide market.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  And it's not based on something that's not backed by anything, the U.S. economy.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  So, you know, gold and silver are the way to go.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  We're going to have Ted Anderson on of Midas Resources after the break.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  I do want to report a little bit of good news.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  Can you imagine that? Some good news?
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  Ex-officer pleads not guilty in Bart shooting.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  Now, you know, we covered this on the program earlier in the week.
[28:49.000 --> 29:00.000]  The guy in Oakland in the subway system held down by police officers and really gunned down in cold blood by Jonas Messerly, I believe, is his last name.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  You know, some young cop, younger than I am.
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  And he decided to pull the trigger, kill the guy, oh, don't worry, the cameras didn't work, everything's okay.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  People caught it on their cell phone cams.
[29:11.000 --> 29:19.000]  The guy was forced to resign and now he is being held in police custody and finally going to be charged in the murder of this gentleman.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  This is out of Oakland, California, CNN.
[29:22.000 --> 29:30.000]  Formed police officer for the Bay Area Transit System pleaded not guilty Thursday in the New Year's Day shooting of a passenger on an Oakland rail station.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  Well, let's hope and pray he gets convicted.
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.000]  This is the Alex Jones show. You can get all of the info wars news over at infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv.
[29:41.000 --> 30:06.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:11.000 --> 33:30.000]  All right folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones all week.
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.000]  Don't worry, Alex will be back. This is my final program here. I'm sure you guys miss him.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  Conservatives ask if the bailout is unconstitutional. A little late, don't you think?
[33:43.000 --> 33:51.000]  Of course it's unconstitutional. And the House Dems are now proposing an $825 billion stimulus bill.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  We've got Circuit City liquidating today. We've got Citigroup and more problems.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  Probably going to be selling itself off into other banks.
[34:00.000 --> 34:08.000]  So what do you do? How do you protect yourself? Well, we have Ted Anderson of Midas Resources on the line to really let you know how to protect yourself.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Ted, thank you for coming on the show.
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  Yeah, it's good to be up here again. I'm really appreciating you stepping in for Alex there. I miss him. He calls me about every day and we talk about this and that.
[34:18.000 --> 34:26.000]  And I'm just calling him and leaving messages on his voicemail now, just saying, yep, I tested all your streams, everything's up, running strong, just want to let you know.
[34:26.000 --> 34:37.000]  I hope you're enjoying your vacation. I can tell you right now, working with Alex for the 12 years that I have, he has such a tough time taking a break.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  I mean, to take a vacation and be with his kids and his wife, and in this case, his mom and dad, just it's killing him.
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  Even though he knows he needs to be there and he loves him very much, he just can't stop working.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  This guy is just a working machine and that's why he's where he is today.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  But you're right about that. I was pulling the same stories up right now.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  Merrill Lynch's losses are digging into city groups so hard that they may even need to be liquidated.
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  They're talking about another bailout for them and Circuit City is shutting down the rest of their stores.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  So Circuit City is going to be no more.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  One of the big things that happened here in the Twin Cities is the Minneapolis Star Tribune, a $500 million company is folding.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  I'm not folding, I should say, they're going into bankruptcy.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  And you just, you're hearing it all over the place. I mean, GM, Chrysler, everybody knows about that.
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.000]  But you have the regional companies that are struggling right now on everybody's market.
[35:34.000 --> 35:42.000]  You know, there are just so many layoffs. I mean, the unemployment came out with the numbers were just astronomical.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  The foreclosures on homes is up 81% from last year.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  I mean, there's just so many things that are going on and the bailouts just keep on coming.
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  Oh, by the way, the people that are interested, the creature from Jekyll Island spot will start airing on Rush Limbaugh's show.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and also George Norrie.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  They're starting February 2nd. So listen for those.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  It'll be great to get a little bit of new world order information to that audience.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  And then Dr. Laura, she started yesterday.
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  So we're working on it. We're working on it.
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  I mean, the way I see it, Jason, if we do nothing, we're going to get world government.
[36:24.000 --> 36:34.000]  We're going to work. I mean, this Constitution is practically gone already. As far as I'm concerned, there's not going to be a shred of it that's left unless we're willing to stand up and fight.
[36:34.000 --> 36:42.000]  As far as what do I have to offer? I did a little, I did some inventory searching to see what at what prices and so on and so forth.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  I paid for this stuff because gold is up today. It's shooting up today.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  It's up at about $830 an ounce. It's been up as high as about 835.
[36:52.000 --> 37:00.000]  And I just double-checked to see what I have. I had some British sovereigns and Franks left at that 770 level.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  And I priced them out to see where I'd have them at. And right now, currently, I have the Frank at 202, which is again, it's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  And we have the British sovereign currently right now at 250, which is a quarter of an ounce of gold.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  Now, the reason why I think that it's important to get into those is, first of all, there's small coins.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  They're coins from the late 1800s and early 1900s, mostly the 1800s.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  And so it's a very old gold coin. And a lot of dealers like to make the argument that you have to have pre-1933 gold, what this is.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  The Franks currently right now, if I priced them at today's market, it would be 212.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  And I'm currently right now selling them at 202. And the British sovereign is at 259 and I'm currently selling that one at 250.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  Again, I really think it's very important to have silver.
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  Small pieces of silver are going to be buying the food, the clothing, the things that you need.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  And they're at $8.40 or $168 per roll.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  And for those of you, I know there's probably a few left out there that don't know this yet.
[38:01.000 --> 38:09.000]  But I've been advertising the Creature from Jekyll Island book for the last 12 years on Genesis Communications Network.
[38:09.000 --> 38:19.000]  And we're charging $26.45 all the way back in 1996, going into 1997.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  Well, guess what? I'm still charging $26.45 for the thing.
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.000]  I guess it was a little cheaper because postage went up, but we're putting a silver dollar inside of each cover of the book.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  We just put them in a little flip. We stable it inside the cover.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  It's the same thing I'm doing on the Rush Limba show. I'm really trying to get the message out there.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  Silver dollars right now, you can even look on eBay. They're at the lowest.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  If you're lucky to win an auction, you might get them for $18.19.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  Yeah, but then you have the shipping. I go on there all the time, actually, to price out silver and gold.
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  And just like you said, you're not going to get an ounce of silver for less than $20 with shipping. No doubt about it.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  And really, with gold, you're going to spend over $1,000 on a one-ounce coin.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  There are no problem also plus shipping. I mean, eBay, you sell really under what things usually go on eBay for.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  Well, yeah, and typically eBay is a garage sale, too. People are just trying to get rid of their odds and ends,
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  and you're going to be piece mailing it, too, and you really don't know who you're buying from either.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  But the thing about it is that Creature from Jekyll Island book does give you a full education on the Federal Reserve system
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  and also central banks across the world. You need to know how the monetary system works,
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  because that's the machine that is financing the elite.
[39:30.000 --> 39:37.000]  I mean, in your DVD, Loose Change, you talk about the World Trade Center coming down
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  and who pulled the strings behind this and such a great documentary.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  But the fact of the matter is that the elite are getting money right now because we're laboring
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  and we're turning it over through taxation and interest on debt.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  And the further we go into debt, I mean, you're talking about another bailout.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  Well, guess who benefits from that? The people that benefit are the lenders.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  People who are actually able to lend the money to the people that we, the people of the United States,
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  have to take on an order bailout, these companies that are supposedly too big to fail.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  The further we go into debt, the more we owe interest.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  The profitability just shoots up through the moon for these people that are lending it.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  And the catch is that they don't even have to earn the money to lend it to us.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  They actually get it for free from us again. We go out there.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  We grow the cotton that is used at the Bureau of Engraving Out in Washington, D.C.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  They print the money and then they ship it off to the Federal Reserve System
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  and then they lend it back to us for interest.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  And we just, you know, the interest burden is just continuing to get bigger and bigger.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  And that's why we have to work so much harder, pay so much in taxes.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  You know, it takes mom and dad to work now.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  We're back in the 50s. It only took dad.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  And now, you know, if things keep going on, they'll probably have to give up the child labor laws
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  because we'll have to have our kids working too in order to eat.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  And that's just not the way that America was designed to run.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  And again, so if you're looking at something, if you want to understand the system
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  and how it really works, pick up that creature from Jekyll Island.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  You're going to get the silver dollar. That's worth 20 bucks.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  You're going to end up paying $26.45.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  The book is 600 pages, but it reads like a whodunit novel.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  It's very interesting.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And then when you're done reading it, keep the silver dollar.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  Pass the book on to somebody who needs to read it.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Tell them where they can get one of their own.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Anyways, at this particular time, I got to say, Jason,
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  probably the best buyer in the marketplace are those sovereigns.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  Either that or if you don't have a whole lot of money.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  And I truly recommend this.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  If you don't have silver, please get silver now.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  There's too many problems out there in the economy,
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  and you have to do something that will be those walking liberty haves at $168 per roll of 20.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's an amazing deal. Why don't you throw out the website and the phone number, Ted?
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  Yeah, the website is mitusresources.com,
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.000]  and you can get in touch with us at 1-800-686-2237.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  And boy, I can't wait till that info warrior is back here in Tommy.
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  I know, and you're so right.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Alex is so juiced up to do this stuff.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  It is hard for him to take a vacation.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  He called me last night.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  He checks in every day. How's the movie going?
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  How's the office? Are the callers treating you okay?
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  He really does keep up on this.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  And that's great because we need somebody motivated every day to be on the air
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  four hours a day to report on things like the bailout,
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  to report on the fact that this stimulus package is just going to put us into further debt,
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  to report on the fact that these banks are going to go under
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  and we're going to be left holding the bag.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  So I can't wait for Alex to get back myself.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  Ted, what do you think is going to happen?
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  I might as well get your perspective on this on Inauguration Day.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  A lot of people are talking about an inaugural crisis on the 21st or 22nd.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  Is it just going to be an announcement that the economy has tanked twice as badly as we think?
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  Well, Obama is already talking about his back peddling
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  and how much he can give away and so on and so forth.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  I don't know if we're going to have a crisis that very day is inaugurated,
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  but I can tell you right now, he's got an uphill battle.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  I mean, really, if we could convince Obama that we need to get rid of this banking system
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  and get back to constitutional money,
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  and if you'd pick up his ears a little bit and listen to the few voices out there
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.000]  that the Ron Paul type voices, Dennis Kasinich type voices in Congress,
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  we might be able to get somewhere, but we both know that that's not going to happen.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  Obama, you look at his cabinet, it's going to be just like the Clinton era.
[43:34.000 --> 43:41.000]  There's going to be no attention paid to the true economic problems that we have in this world.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  There's going to be an awful lot more bailouts, a lot more money being printed,
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  and we're going to start running into double-digit inflation.
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.000]  And for all I know, the next war, I know he was talking about beefing up things in Afghanistan,
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  and who knows what's going to be laid out in front of us.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  But this Gaza strip thing is a big issue out there right now.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  I just don't know which one's going to play out.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  Yeah, I hope that we don't end up entangled in another war in the Middle East.
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  I hope it's just financial, but you never know with these people.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  All they need is a certain event, and we'll clamor to go into Pakistan or into Iran
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  or wherever they really want us to go.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  Ted, why don't you give out the number on the website again for the Midas resources?
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  Yeah, well, let me just add in one more thing before I do that.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  I mean, one of the things that you've got to consider right now is that
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  the way that the Federal Reserve system gets money into the system is by making loans,
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  and right now there isn't enough credit-worthy borrowers,
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  and the ones that are credit-worthy aren't interested in taking on a lot of debt,
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  and that's why we're seeing what I would call deflation,
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  because they can't get the money into the system.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  It's like trying to push a string.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  You can't force money on people, especially when it's in terms of people taking on more debt.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  And so they're pushing really hard for the United States government
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.000]  to replace all the private sector debt and get this economy moving that way,
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  but this thing's going to blossom out.
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  I really see just more and more money coming into the system through the process of credit,
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  and that's when you get into the hyperinflationary thing like we have down in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico.
[45:18.000 --> 45:25.000]  The website Midas Resources Incorporated, the telephone number 1-800-686-2237.
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  If you haven't picked up your copy of that creature from Jekyll Island, get it now.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  I know Alex is advertising it all over the place because he feels passionate about it as I do,
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  and you can catch us at 1-800-686-2237,
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  and Jason, we will hold these prices clean through the weekend.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  I know the show will replay all the way through to the Sunday show
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  when Alex is actually in the seat running at the helm.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  Yes, that's excellent.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  And like you said, it's going to run all weekend.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  Ted locks in the prices.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  You can get it cheaper than really anywhere else.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Like I said, go check online on these auction sites.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  You can't do as well.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  And silver and gold, it's almost essential to have at this point with this very, very, very uncertain economy.
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  The only thing certain about this economy is that it doesn't look like it's going to be shaping up
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  into anything good in the next few years.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  I mean, it really looks like we're going to be struggling through this entire administration.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  I don't know how we're going to get out of it.
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  You know, I'm sure they're going to propose a bunch of new social programs,
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  but that's really not going to help the country, is it, Ted?
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  No, it's not.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  We have way too much debt, and we don't have enough productivity.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  We've shipped out our – all our jobs are shipped overseas.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  We're not a country of savers anymore.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  We deficit spend.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  People want to get away from their credit cards now,
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  and that just kills the whole process with the Federal Reserve system.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  Maybe that's a good thing, but I – unfortunately, a lot of people are unemployed.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  I think we're going to see an awful lot more.
[46:47.000 --> 46:54.000]  And it's not good news, and you should be getting out of debt yourself personally as quickly as you can.
[46:54.000 --> 47:00.000]  And if you do have a little bit of money left over, get some food and make sure you have your shelter covered.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  Cover your children for whatever it is that they need,
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  and then if there's money left over after that, pick up some gold and silver.
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  All right, Ted, thank you so much.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  And folks, this is how you really, really have insurance.
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  This is the real deal insurance.
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  You have insurance in gold.
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  You have insurance in silver.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  You have insurance in storeable food in case something happens.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  I mean, like I said, with this Circuit City liquidation,
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  we're looking at 30,000 more unemployed people, and that's from Circuit City.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  You know, a city group goes under.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  God knows how many people are going to lose their jobs.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  You know, again, they're proposing an 825 billion with a B stimulus bill,
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  which will turn into trillions just like the $700 billion bailout did.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  Remember, when you give the banks billions and billions of dollars in fiat currency,
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  it's not even real.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  They'll end out 10 to 100 times more of that.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  So that's why you have Bloomberg reporting that it's really $7 to $8 trillion.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Things don't look good.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  You know, I like to be a pretty positive guy.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  I'm a pretty upbeat fellow.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  But financially, the economic situation in this country is just, it's deplorable right now.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  And you don't have to be Jason Burmese to say so.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  You can be somebody who's been in the middle upper class,
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  and all of a sudden, your car payments on your three cars, you can't make them.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  And all of a sudden, the college bill of your two sons and your daughter is getting out of control.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  And you're going into more and more debt.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  You have no savings.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  It's a rough time right now.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  We're going to have a Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.com coming up at the top of the hour.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Let's take a few calls.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  Let's jam through a few calls on any of the news blitz, or Ted Anderson,
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  that we just talked about in the first 45 minutes.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  Let's go to Bear in California.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  I get the best names on this show.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Bear, what's happening?
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  How you doing, Jason? Excuse my voice.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.000]  I'm a retired Air Force vet, and I still work with the military.
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.000]  And I used to listen to Alex Jones on the radio, and I was like, didn't really take him serious.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  And then I stopped listening to him, and I'm like, hey, whatever happened to the Alex Jones,
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  because they kind of took him off the radio station I used to listen to.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  So I did some research, and I browsed, and oh, he's on the internet.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  So I checked out his internet site.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  I said, oh, you can listen to him on the internet.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  And I sat at a desk a lot.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  So I started taking him more serious.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  And I kind of like woken up, you know what I mean?
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  And when you are conscious of what's going on and what's reality of really what's going on in this country
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  and what's going on in this world, excuse my language, it pisses you off.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  And I'm going to do something about it.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  I'm starting a group up here in the high desert in California.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Excellent. What kind of group?
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  I don't know where the high desert is, but we're going to start it out as a gun group.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  I have some friends that shoot at the range, and they're going to teach me how to shoot a gun,
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  how to properly handle it, and all that.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make my own business cards and have Alex's websites on there
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  and educate people and tell them what's really going on.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  And I've been doing that.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  I have no problem talking to people.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  I have the gift of gabbing, like you do, Jason.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  It's an important gift, man. You have to talk to people, you know?
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  That's how you reach out.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  One-on-one always works better than, you know, a lot of people are listening to me right now.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  Like you said, you know, when you used to listen to Alex Jones, you didn't take him that seriously.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  I'm sure there are people out there scoffing at what I'm saying.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  But you have to communicate with people.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  The gift of gab is a great gift indeed when you're educated and you can wake up the masses.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Bear, I thank you for the call.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  We're going to take a few more calls in the next segment.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  It is the Alex Jones Show InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.tv.
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  877-327-0365.
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  Don't wait. Call today.
[52:00.000 --> 52:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.000 --> 52:41.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[52:45.000 --> 52:53.000]  Get the DVD at infowars.com. Forsee it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  What will you do when the economy collapses? Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.000]  How will you feed your family? True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops,
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  Getseeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[53:26.000 --> 53:32.000]  We offer a complete range of seeds, including heirloom tomatoes, old-fashioned beans, carrots, sweet corn, peppers,
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  cucumbers, celery, broccoli, onions, cauliflower, asparagus, spinach, melons, and a whole lot more.
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  This is one of the finest, most affordable seed offers that is on the market today.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  Variety in your garden means a diverse and healthy diet for your family year-round.
[53:47.000 --> 54:00.000]  So go to Getseeds.net or call 1-877-394-6657. Supplies are limited, so order today. That's Getseeds.net or 1-877-394-6657.
[54:00.000 --> 54:26.000]  You are at the tip of the spear of the Info War. It is the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Burma sitting in all week, and don't worry, Alex Jones will be back, I believe, Sunday.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  I'm going to keep him away from Radio Studios. We're going to go back to your calls in a moment.
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  By the way, with the calls, folks, if I cut you off, I'm sorry, but I have this long list of callers.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  I've got to get them in. Every time I'm talking to you, I've got five more waiting.
[54:43.000 --> 54:52.000]  On top of that, I get two types of emails on my Myspace. Usually, I can't believe you cut me off, or I just couldn't get through the show.
[54:52.000 --> 55:00.000]  It's kind of a conundrum. If I don't cut people off and give everybody their 30 seconds to 90 seconds on the air, then I can't have everybody come on, and I get a ton of emails.
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  Oh, I couldn't even get on the air. Well, we try to get everybody on the air. We try to get everybody's points in, whether you agree or disagree.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  Before we go back to calls, I do want to thank yet another one of our sponsors, eFoodsDirect.
[55:11.000 --> 55:21.000]  That is eFoodsDirect.com, of course, and the number is 1-800-409-5633. Okay, so you don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storeable foods company in the country.
[55:26.000 --> 55:35.000]  They also happen to be true patriots and the support of the freedom movement for years and years with the looming food shortages and current economy, the real deal.
[55:35.000 --> 55:42.000]  It is imperative that you make sure you and your family are prepared with non-GMO good, clean, storeable foods.
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633.
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  All right, let's jump to our next caller. Let's go to Paul in Colorado. Paul, what's on your mind?
[55:57.000 --> 56:05.000]  Hey, Jason, you're doing an awesome job, by the way. Nobody can do better at any age, really.
[56:05.000 --> 56:14.000]  Listen, I've been listening to Alex for probably 10 years now. I've heard him get really frustrated.
[56:14.000 --> 56:25.000]  He's looking for an answer on a particular area and I'm telling you, I don't care who you are, I don't care what church you go to, who Christian group you are, almost every single person out there
[56:25.000 --> 56:37.000]  never understands this one aspect. If you give me a chance to say it right now, it could literally unlock a lot of doors for the Info War or, should I say, for the fight of freedom.
[56:37.000 --> 56:46.000]  This is that the war that we're really fighting, which is clearly put in the Bible, is a war they call Principalities.
[56:46.000 --> 56:56.000]  That means a war between spirits. There is the evil spirit that the Satanic people are following. These are the people that are trying to take us over.
[56:56.000 --> 57:07.000]  Then, of course, who are they fighting against mostly? Christianity and freedom and goodness. Here's how we can win against these people.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  I hope your listening audience takes good note of this and doesn't scoff at it too much and actually takes it to heart.
[57:12.000 --> 57:23.000]  Believe it or not, most of these people that are really evil are being puppeted by an evil spirit. No joke, there's actual evil spirits and they're inside of people.
[57:23.000 --> 57:35.000]  I've tested this for more than 20 years personally and I've helped other people to test it too. Everybody's been flabbergasted how true this is.
[57:35.000 --> 57:47.000]  Why would you want to waste your time arguing with an evil spirit who is going to say, obviously, all the bad stuff and is not going to listen to you and never going to change anything that they do?
[57:47.000 --> 57:58.000]  Here's the part that no one wants to believe, but the power of the name of Jesus Christ can actually cast these people out.
[57:58.000 --> 58:09.000]  Just like in the Bible, Jesus cast evil spirits out. I have taught my friends, and I've done it myself, that you're arguing with someone who's evil.
[58:09.000 --> 58:19.000]  You don't even waste your time. You go in the restroom, cast the devil out, and you say, in the name of Jesus Christ, I command Satan and all the angels to leave his property, his house at once.
[58:19.000 --> 58:33.000]  Paul, I got a break. I thank you for the call. Look, I'm not Mr. Religious, but there is that passage in Revelations where it talks about the mark of man and those who rule act like Christians, but are in fact into the occult.
[58:33.000 --> 58:50.000]  And I think that is very, very real. You know, good and evil do exist. It's the Alex Jones show, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[59:03.000 --> 59:09.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[59:12.000 --> 59:22.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[59:22.000 --> 59:34.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, freeze dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[59:34.000 --> 59:45.000]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633. Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:45.000 --> 59:53.000]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. We are in the second hour on this Friday, January 16th, 2009.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  And we're going to have Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, on at five after the hour. We're going to take a couple more calls, but before we take your calls, and we'll take some calls on topic about the financial market with Bob Chapman in the second half of that.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  But I want to remind everybody that this weekend, when we're actually beginning tonight, Heartland Emergency, that's heartlandemergency.com, is going to be holding seminars on storable food, non-genetically modified food, heirloom seed.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And also, freeze-dried food, speakers will include Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, and this starts tonight, Friday night, January 6th at 6 p.m. in Fredericksburg at the Ag Building, 95 Frederick Road, or tomorrow and Sunday, Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. at Brave New Books, 1904 Guadalupe Street.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  They are great over there at Brave New Books. If you can't get to heartlandemergency.com, you can call them up at 512-921-9015. That's 512-921-9015.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  All right, let's jump back into callers. Paul, you know, I am not Mr. Religious again. I'm going to say it again. But, yep, I'm pretty sure that Paul is gone. But I just want to talk to all those listeners out there. I know that Alex has a huge Christian audience, and obviously good and evil do exist.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  And, you know, these people do occult practices. I mean, no matter what you believe, they do go out to the Bohemian Grove in California for two weeks out of the year. Many of the elites, including, you know, Reagan was a member, Nixon was a member, Clinton's a member,
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Schwarzenegger's a member, every Republican president since Coolidge is a member. And they do the cremation of care, which is a one-hour pagan ritual about killing dull care or your conscience, where they do a malacuman sacrifice in front of a 40-foot stone owl.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And so, you know, people that still don't know that just go to YouTube. Just Google Bohemian Grove. There is enough information out there that you can open your eyes.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Alright, let's go to Julio in Los Angeles. Julio, what's on your mind?
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Hey, Jason, I've been listening to you all week, man. And I just want to say you're doing a great job filling in for Alex and keep up the good work.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Thank you.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Don't take any, you know what, from no one. I think you should, you know, those people that are hostile toward you have been listening to all the really weird phone calls you're getting.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  You know, just cut them off, man. Let's leave the time that we have for all this important information for the people that want to be constructive.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  So you're doing a good job. I just wanted to say that Alex Jones and his program is helping me to get my life back in order.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And all the information that he's been given out is helping me to get my life in order and to start becoming more independent. So I'm not really physically fit right now and I'm going to the beach about two hours a day.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And I listened to your show. I put it on my MP3 and it really helped me and inspired me. So I just want to let you know that.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Well, thank you so much, man.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Thank you very much. I just wanted to pass one little piece of information. Maybe it's a little piece of the puzzle that, you know, it's hard to predict the future, but there are certain pieces of the puzzle that kind of point in the same direction.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I've been hearing you, you know, you yourself say you don't know what's going to happen on the 20th, 21st of January or whatever, right?
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Basically, I don't know if you've ever heard this and I'm going to email it to Aaron at infowars.com.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Aaron at infowars.com.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  That's A-A-R-WIN.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Yep.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Okay. There is this thing called the SICA, the S-I-C-A. It's basically an organization that has existed for decades in Central America, you know, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, etc.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And what they stand for is basically they've never taken any decisive actions for the most part.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Up until December, the 5th or the 6th of December of last year, all the dignitaries of all the countries in Central America, they got together and they decided that they're going to adopt one common currency and one common passport.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Send that information to Aaron right away. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back with Bob Chapman, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com.

[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  But unfortunately, it's just another daily driver with no performance.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  So for just about a dollar a day, you can drive the Ferrari of tees. Don't be fooled by size.

[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Alright folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show. And we'll take your calls at about 40-45 after.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  And hopefully they'll be on topic with my next guest, Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  And Bob, it's been a while, but boy do we have a lot to talk about. I mean, from the Democrats now proposing an $825 billion stimulus bill
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  to Circuit City about to liquidate to Citigroup. Basically, I mean, not going under, but being absorbed by other banks
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  and turning into different agencies. The economy is a sunder, is it not?
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  Well, it certainly is, unfortunately. And it's a certain fact that Citigroup is bankrupt. And Bank of America is bankrupt.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And the five major legacy banks are bankrupt. The major brokerage firms are bankrupt.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And they're all going to get bailed out by the American taxpayer. And that's what we're going through right now.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  And it's in the city if they should be allowed to fail.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  I absolutely agree, but they're not going to be allowed to fail now.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  You know, the media is hard pressing us to make us believe that only half of this bailout money, which they say is $350 billion,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  we know it's in the trillions because it's loaned and loaned again.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  And it really is only $350 billion. They can loan out and that's, you know, they can loan out 10 times that.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  So it's $3.5 trillion right there.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  What's going to happen? I mean, are we just going to pass?
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  I mean, Bernanke this week said that we're going to need more bailouts. Paulson, even in the beginning of the bailout process,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  said that some banks would go under anyway.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Now we have, you know, the new administration being inaugurated in about four days.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  The Democrats proposing a $125 billion stimulus package.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And now finally, finally in the mainstream media, a few quote-unquote conservatives,
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  it's time for the WWE left-right paradigm to come into play saying that these bailouts are unconstitutional.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Well, no kidding, they're unconstitutional. But how far are they about to go?
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Well, I think they're going to take it to the very end, whether we like it or not.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And we have no representation in our government, whether it's in the executive office or in Congress.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  We have no control. Very few of our representatives or senators listen.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  And so that part of the game is over.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  There's no way legally that we can change things in our government.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Our government has been usurped from behind the scenes by a group of people
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  who are bent upon turning the United States into a corporative fascist state
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  and eventually into part of a world government.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Where do we think this is going?
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  The Federal Reserve have driven down interest rates to zero levels effectively.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  On the short end of the market, which is the paper under a year and under two years,
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  they can probably get away with that for a long time, at least until the end of the year, perhaps more, perhaps longer.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  But in the 510s and 30s, that is the 5 and 10-year notes of the 30-year bonds, it's a different story.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  And I think as the federal government crowds lend us out of the market
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  and the fiscal and monetary aspects of the U.S. economy worsen over this year,
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  that interest rates will finally start to go up on that long end.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  And that will really put a crimp again into the issuance of mortgages.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Right now, you can get a 30-year fix for about four and a half,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  and the 15s are probably an eighth or a quarter lower.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  And I think that that would be curtailed later in the year, and that's going to cause problems.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  And during that period of time, over the next nine months,
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  the dollar is going to continue to lose momentum and move downward.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  During that period as well, with all of this money being thrown around,
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  gold will probably go this year, at least to $1,600 to $2,000 announced and maybe higher,
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  and later it will go higher.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  And I see this extension of these problems lasting another two or three years.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  And this is what Alex and I and Paul Craig Roberts talked about
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  when Alex said, well, it's got to happen now or soon.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  As opposed to that, Paul and I said, no, two or three years.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Now, you know why.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Now, they got a stimulus package, $825 billion.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  That'll check the economy up probably between March and September.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And it'll go right back down again.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  And that means they're going to have to keep on coming with these trillion-dollar packages.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  Well, every time they do that, they're adding to inflation,
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  and they're adding to the underlying problems of the solvency of not only the United States,
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  but the dollar and the economy and the whole financial structure itself.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  So you just said that after they pass the stimulus package,
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  that you'll see the economy boost from September to March.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  But my question is, how will that happen?
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  I mean, if the auto industries, by then, you know, they pretty much the bailout for them hasn't worked.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And they go public with that.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  How is it that the economy will do better even in those months
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  if we put this money in?
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  I mean, it will just do better on the news,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and people are still going to be feeling at home,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  or will we genuinely be doing better and then in for a big fall after March?
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Generally doing better between March and September,
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  and after that's over, it'll start to go into the Great Dark Pit again.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And three or four months later, they're going to do it over again.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  They're going to have to keep on doing it.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And what they're doing is they're creating make-work jobs.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  The same thing FDR did during the 1930s, particularly between 1935 and 1940.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And in 1939, unemployment was 17.2% down for somewhere around 30.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And today, long-term unemployment that goes back to 1990, government figures, is 17.5%.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  The U6, which are the people who no longer collect unemployment checks, is 13.5%,
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  and that ding-bat number that we're given, which is 7.2, means nothing.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  So if you're middle of the thing, we're already up at 13.5%.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  We've had two years of recession, and I announced a recession two years ago,
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  about a week or two weeks from now in February.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And we are now entering depression.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  This is the beginning.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Well, they call it a severe recession.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  No, it's not that.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  We're entering depression.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  A one-wheel depression get really bad two or three years from now.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  Everything doesn't happen overnight.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Well, you just talked about FDR and his program.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  So do you see a new, new deal like Tarpley has talked about,
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  or a resurgence of a works progress administration-type program,
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  where people without jobs are going to start building infrastructure again,
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  or going to start paving roads and building sidewalks and doing that sort of thing?
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Yes, that will be part of the package.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  And that's why there's going to be more packages coming,
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  because if you notice, the first package has been split up into pieces.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Medicaid is going to get so much education in on and on.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  And, you know, it's being segmented.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  It's being parceled out to different places.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  And that is not going to get them as many jobs.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  He's talking four or five million jobs now.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  He's out of his mind.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  I mean, if they create a half a million jobs, they'll be lucky,
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  you know, over a nine-month span here.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  And the jobs are working for the federal government,
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  or working for companies that are getting contacts from the federal government.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  They're all temporary work.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  I mean, maybe if they fix a road, maybe it'll become permanent or a bridge.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  The Hoover Dam was made there in the 1930s, and all those golf courses,
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  and they're still around.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  But they don't create anything.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  Well, I mean, even in my town that I grew up in,
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  you still see the WPA little metal plaques that are inside the sidewalk.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  So, you know, like you said, that's the 1930s program.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  They're still around in 2009.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  So, you're right.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  It's only going to be a limited amount of jobs for a limited period of time.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And then what happens?
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I mean, maybe they're figuring that will be in a world war by that time,
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  so the economy will boost out when that's over?
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  Well, you stole my thunder.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  The next step I was going to talk about was,
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  if you look at history, the only way that they got to go is to have another war.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  And we're having a backdoor war right now.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Our surrogate, Israel, has gone into Gaza and done what they've done.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  Now, next, we'll be lebanon in Syria and in Iran.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  And then we've got Afghanistan and we've got Pakistan.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  We probably have India.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  And who knows about the rest of the Middle East?
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  So, we're going to have a third world war.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Nuclear weapons will be used.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  And this will go out for the next 10 years, probably.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Oh, my God. Well, I hope you're genuinely wrong on that,
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  although I do see an escalation in the Middle East.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  You know, Obama is already talking about more troops in Afghanistan,
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  which basically is a redistribution of forces as we leave Iraq.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  And we're not just going to completely leave Iraq.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  People believe me, we'll still have forces there.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  But the majority of forces will be brought over to Afghanistan.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  You know, the media will play it up into some kind of military quagmire over there.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  And we're not getting out.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  Just like you said, I mean, if you look at the chief of staff pick, Rahm Emanuel,
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  a dual Israeli and an American citizen, calling for conscription of 18 to 25-year-olds
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  where they'll serve three months in basic training
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  and then be shipped off to a desert to fight for us,
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  really just fight for the globalists.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  And that's scary to me because, you know, Tom Blankley,
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  and we've been playing these clips all week,
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  but Tom Blankley of the Washington Times,
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  he's an editor of the editorial page there,
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  in 2007 was all over the news talking about conscription,
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  but said, you know, it wasn't going to happen under this Bush administration
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  because enough people weren't going to get behind him.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  He didn't have the image to be able to propose such a program.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  However, he said in the next administration,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  and that's why this week he was on Fox and Friends
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  promoting his new book called American Grit,
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  where, again, he's calling for conscription.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Only this time, under this administration, he believes it's possible.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  And Bob, I got to tell you, you know, with the image that they're portraying Obama,
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  I mean, he's on the cover of the new Spider-Man comic.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  The thing sold out in less than 24 hours.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  It's now selling for $80 plus on eBay.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  A little comic book, you know, with this guy's cover on it.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  They deified Obama on the cover of Rolling Stone,
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  literally putting him in the clouds
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  and putting a lightning glow aura around him.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  He's on the cover of the new Newsweek,
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  where the title is The New Global Elite,
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  and he sits as a part of MOLIC in this, like, design.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  So, you know, he is being pumped to the masses
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  as actual change as the leader that we can trust,
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  and I think that we can get conscription passed under him.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  We'll talk about that, that especially.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  In fact, we're going to bring up some clips with Bob Chapman
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  of theInternationalForecaster.com.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  It is the Alex Jones Show.

[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  the electrochemical plate structure in the battery

[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:18.160]  for quarter ounce. That's 857.72, 428.86, and 214.43.
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:25.640]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:29.920]  to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:33.880]  and interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:38.120]  November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However, the executive
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:45.960]  order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call 800-686-2237.

[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:16.040]  destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:20.880]  a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions,
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:25.280]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:30.760]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:36.440]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:04.840]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:10.040]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:14.080]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:19.240]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:25.320]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:30.680]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:36.800]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with

[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:37.840]  Before we go back to Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com, I want to play these clips of Tom Blankley, editor
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:42.840]  over at Washington Times, calling for conscription in 2007, saying it's not going to be possible
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.960]  under this administration and then this week going on to Fox & Friends. So hopefully we're
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:50.600]  set up there to play this clip. I'm about to hit play and hopefully it'll go out over
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:59.720]  the air. Okay, guys, we need audio on this clip. Okay, draft should be considered and
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:04.960]  has always been an option on the table. A Pentagon spokesman frontally rejected the
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:11.640]  idea today saying that the military is giving the idea, quote, absolutely no consideration,
[1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:17.760]  unquote. But is it time to revive conscription for the first time since Richard Nixon? Back
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:22.320]  to discuss it, our Democratic strategist, Stephanie Cutter, an editor of the Washington
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:29.440]  Times editorial page, Tony Blankley. Tony, it just seemed to me, political year. Nobody's
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:34.460]  going to recommend a return to the draft. But is the draft a good idea or is a partial
[1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:39.880]  draft a good idea? We've got 5,000 troops in the Army. It is breaking according to the
[1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:47.920]  Army Chief of Staff on the basis of two small guerrilla wars. Now, is the U.S. Army big enough
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:51.840]  and strong enough to handle all the commitments this country's got? It's not going to happen
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:58.840]  on Bush's watch because it's not time for that debate to occur. But the military clearly
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:03.560]  is not big enough to do the job that's going to be required of it. All right, let's stop
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:07.280]  that clip right there. Notice he said it's not going to happen on Bush's watch. No, we
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:12.040]  need somebody else to get behind, but the military is not big enough. Income Fox and
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:13.040]  Friends.
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.120]  Welcome back, everyone, seven minutes before the top of the hour. Can America's power
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:21.160]  last forever? And how do we achieve a new nationalism that puts our country's survival
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:22.160]  first?
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:25.680]  Those questions and more are addressed in a brand new book by Tony Blankley. It comes
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:30.760]  out today. It's called American Grit. What will it take for America to survive and win
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:35.240]  in the 21st century? And join us for his first TV interview about the book, is Tony Blankley.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:40.320]  Tony, good morning to you. Good morning. Thank you. You know, if you read some of the European
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:45.200]  papers they're talking about, America is finally in decline. They're getting what they've
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:51.080]  had coming to them all along. Do you believe that? Well, it could be so. We have it in
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:55.800]  our power not to be in decline, and that's what my book's about. I do believe that for
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:00.400]  the first time in our history, if we don't do a lot of things smart and tough, we could
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.280]  get overwhelmed by the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of radical Islam. We've
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:10.520]  failed to exploit our energy. Well, educate. We're not paying enough attention to what
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:15.600]  our kids are learning. Bill Ayers is actually a senior person in guiding the curriculum
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:21.200]  design of America. That started just this last March. But we have it in our power, and
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:26.200]  I try to write some tough proposals for what we need to do so that our grandchildren live
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.440]  in a country strong enough to protect our freedoms just as we do.
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:32.920]  Now, Tony, your book's going to get a lot of attention because there are some controversial
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:37.560]  bold suggestions. The first one, obviously, that caught my eye was that you were calling
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:42.800]  for a universal draft, which would mean that all 18-year-olds in America would have to
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:48.080]  serve for two years. Yes, look, I don't like it. I love the volunteer
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:53.360]  army. I've got a son who's a second lieutenant in the volunteer army. I know the young men
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:57.920]  and women who serve. They're the greatest young kids we've ever produced. But we don't
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.880]  have enough troops, and it's a manifest that we don't by several magnitudes. For instance,
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:08.320]  when George Bush wanted to have the surge, he was told by the senior generals, we didn't
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:12.400]  have the extra 20,000 troops to finish the war. Now, he decided...
[1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:16.040]  Now, you see how he uses that false argument. The surge was never intended to work, and
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:19.760]  if we had 20,000 more troops, we still would have been in Iraq, and it wouldn't have de-escalated
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:25.080]  any time sooner. But he uses that as an excuse, and he's always saying, oh, I love the volunteer
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:29.520]  army, but it's just not going to work. And he also grandstands the fact that his son
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:34.000]  is in the military to try to promote this idea of conscription. Bob, do you think that
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.720]  we're going to have conscription under this new administration?
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:38.720]  Absolutely.
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:47.280]  Boy and 10 girls. We're going to have them both. No one's going to escape it. And I would
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:52.720]  expect probably under the circumstances that a lot of young people would leave the country.
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:56.360]  I hope a lot of young people leave the country. I hope that we stand up about this. But when
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:02.160]  you say boys and girls, what do you expect? Do you expect that the women will mostly be
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:05.920]  thrown into some kind of a homeland security program while the men will have to go fight
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:06.920]  overseas?
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:20.160]  No, I think probably they'll have a volunteer offer. And if they don't get enough volunteers
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:28.080]  to fill the segment within the active army, then they'll change it.
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:33.320]  Well, I certainly hope you're wrong, but it does look that way. I also see them scooping
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:38.440]  up kids from poor black neighborhoods under the guise of Obama and this black power movement,
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:42.560]  this youth movement. Anybody can do this. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back with
[1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:51.160]  Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com after this.
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:30:00.880]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:04.840]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:09.880]  bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:14.800]  a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour. But we've only seen the beginning.
[1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:19.480]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times. Shortages
[1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:23.880]  and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land. The insiders have discovered
[1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:27.360]  that they must control two things to cease total power.
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:31.840]  Phase one is a one world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept. Phase
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:39.160]  two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortageusa.com

[1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:06.080]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:11.800]  against this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin
[1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:16.120]  Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:20.840]  Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:25.520]  to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:31.800]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:37.080]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers'
[1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:41.800]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:46.840]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at

[1:31:53.680 --> 1:32:00.640]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:04.440]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:05.440]  What?
[1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:09.480]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible. I read something and forget. I forget
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:13.480]  people's names. I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people but
[1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:14.480]  I forget.
[1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:19.520]  Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault. Factors like fluoride
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:25.040]  in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system
[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:29.120]  taught you. It's all meant to dumb you down. You know, I can remember everything now. Even
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:31.160]  entire books. What? How?
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:36.400]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory. Their online course is a real breakthrough
[1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:40.840]  in the field of memory improvement. In fact, they guarantee that every single person will
[1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:46.080]  be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books after they complete
[1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:52.960]  just 60 lessons. And they offer a no questions asked, no time limit, money back guarantee.
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.480]  Wow. What's the website?
[1:32:54.480 --> 1:33:00.240]  Now, don't forget. It's Pmemory.net, the letter Pmemory.net.
[1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:32.320]  That's right. I don't want any shackles on me, whether they be physical shackles or shackles
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:42.120]  on the mind. No, sir. I got to tell you, Bob, one of the more disconcerting things that
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:47.600]  I saw on the web and the reason I think that they are going to scoop out African-American
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:52.600]  young males from these poor regions is a teacher, I think it was out in Missouri or
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:58.440]  something like that, got all of his students to do this alpha, omega, alpha, omega, this
[1:33:58.440 --> 1:34:03.040]  little like Obama Brigade. And they all had to memorize a part of his health plan. And
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:07.720]  they're inspired to do, you know, I can be the next architect because of Obama. And they're
[1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:12.320]  wearing Obama shirts. And it shows like this lemming like mentality of people getting behind
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:17.000]  this guy just because of the color of his skin and not the content of his character.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:22.720]  So I really think that's going to be a big recruitment sect for our military. You're
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:30.520]  probably very right. It's all part of psychopolitical warfare as well. And, you know, when you have
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:36.840]  high unemployment and if you just take the median official figure, 13 and a half percent,
[1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:43.720]  and you extend it over the next year and let's say it grows to say 16 or 17 percent, again,
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:50.840]  you're at the levels you were in 1939. And there's a lot of disgruntlement. The major
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:58.360]  people who get unemployed are people between 18 and 25 years old. This is a problem Europe's
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:03.640]  having right now. And that's why you were seeing the problems in Greece, among other
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:11.160]  things. And so you got to get these people off the streets. Who does the fighting in
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:17.620]  warfare? Who causes the troubles? Who's got the strength? Who has the endurance? Young
[1:35:17.620 --> 1:35:24.920]  people do. I mean, that's why governments draft young people, usually 17 and older,
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:30.480]  and usually 17 to 25. So they want these people off the streets. So they have their make-believe
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:37.040]  war and they draft men and women and get them off the streets so that, you know, if there's
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:41.800]  revolution in the country, old people like me have to fight it.
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:46.360]  Bob, why don't you throw out the website and the phone number?
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:54.560]  The website, TheInternationalForecaster.com. And if you go there, you can get a free introductory
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:36:00.600]  copy of The International Forecaster. And you can also get one by calling toll-free
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:13.600]  877-479-8178. That's 877-479-8178 and TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:19.120]  All right. I want to play this Obama Youth Brigade marching formation clip just to show
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:26.080]  the mentality of these young kids. I mean, these are teenage kids, maybe 12 to 18. And
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:33.080]  you know, Obama is the next savior, folks. We got volume on that, guys.
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:37:00.680]  Because of Obama, I am inspired to be the next doctor.
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:33.920]  uh...
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:37.160]  and while they're doing this they're all doing special hand signals it's very
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:38.840]  military ask
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.040]  and uh... how about because of yourself you want to be
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:44.680]  the next engineer because of pride in yourself
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:48.800]  you wanna uh... be the next architect and why why are you worshiping someone
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.560]  who's on proven why are you worshiping
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:54.520]  a state senator up until two thousand and four who gives a keynote speech gets
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:58.080]  into the actual set for the first time in a four and then
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:00.720]  less than four years later in two thousand seven really less than three
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:01.520]  years later
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:03.920]  he announces his candidacy for presidency
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:07.320]  and wins it seems a little fishy doesn't pop
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:10.120]  well i started trading in nineteen ninety two
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:13.320]  and uh... if you look behind the scenes you'll see that
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:17.040]  and uh... what they're trying to do is create a cult here
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:19.920]  and you know we've seen cults before
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:22.680]  uh... in north korea and in china
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:25.360]  uh... we we also have seen them
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:26.920]  and in history
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:30.440]  and uh... it's a very very bad thing
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:34.080]  it usually ends up in a very very bad way
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:36.280]  yeah i would imagine it looks like
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:38.360]  it looks like bad news brown to me
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:41.400]  i want to talk a little bit about some of the appointments that have been made
[1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:42.560]  over the week uh...
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.040]  people now know that richard haases on the team
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  uh... they're well aware that ron manuel is the chief of staff mister
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:49.640]  conscription himself
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:53.280]  but a couple this week where john carrey is now the head of the uh... foreign
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:54.960]  relations committee and will be
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:58.440]  hillary clinton's right hand man see you throw an election in two thousand four
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:00.960]  you play ball you're the head of the foreign relations committee four years
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:01.840]  later
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:04.240]  and obama has also uh...
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.360]  named as his uh... global climate czar or his global warming czar
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:11.800]  carl and or a carol m browner
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:14.920]  uh... one of the fourteen leaders of the socialist groups commission for a
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.520]  sustainable world society
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:20.920]  which openly is calling for global governance and basically regulating you
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:23.760]  through a carbon tax is not delicious i mean
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:25.280]  these two appointments
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:29.120]  should should raise red flags all over the place bob
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:33.800]  well and they have uh... to to people who look and think and read
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:35.880]  uh... but it's always
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:38.280]  you know that group that
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.440]  absorb everything that's going on
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:42.400]  and then you have the rest of the people
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:45.560]  and have the people in in america at least
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:48.880]  i don't know what's going on don't care to know what's going on
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:50.560]  and uh...
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:53.880]  somebody said to me the other day one of the one of the programs or what do you
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:57.440]  do i think well the only thing you can do is use a machine
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:39:59.840]  and uh... but
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:02.120]  you know what order they expect
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:04.800]  uh... they think this is all going to go away
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.280]  uh... they don't they don't understand fascism socialism communism
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:10.960]  nor do they want to
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:13.840]  and they just hope that they can get the belly filled in
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  and go to the football games and things like that in
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.680]  that's all they care about so
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.440]  the other half uh...
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:21.840]  of the people who were left
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:24.840]  probably uh... tender fifteen percent
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:26.560]  will really carry the ball
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:27.720]  and uh...
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:29.280]  i think because
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:30.920]  we've been robbed
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:33.760]  of representation in our government
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:36.360]  uh... and we're going to have high unemployment
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:38.280]  and even if we have a draft
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:39.400]  uh... there's going to be
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:42.400]  terrible social problems in america
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:44.520]  i have to agree there and you mentioned the football game
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.840]  uh... for the first time ever espn
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.880]  is going to show the presidential inauguration that's how important obama is
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.800]  so the sports networks are even going to be covering obama and you know when i
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:55.760]  saw
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:59.720]  i saw this article uh... yesterday it didn't really surprise me because you
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:01.600]  know a couple months back
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:03.520]  even before he had been elected president
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.240]  i was sitting down watching sports and my friend obama's face
[1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:10.320]  you know popped up on the screen i'm like well why is obama on sports and
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:11.960]  the guys like all you didn't hear
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:14.560]  he's for a uh... college football playoff so
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:18.000]  espn has really been supporting and i'm thinking myself man
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.080]  you know as a sports fan i've always wanted a college football playoff so he
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:22.540]  really is playing
[1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:24.480]  to the bread and circus commoner
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:28.200]  and uh... you know that's what most people see like you said they don't see
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:31.680]  that he is backed by people like brzezinski they don't see
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:34.320]  that his team of with people like gates
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:35.760]  is you know
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:39.320]  same as the old boss old boss same as the new boss and uh... he is going to keep
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:42.600]  carrying out this globalist agenda for the internationalist
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:45.880]  i let's take some calls hopefully they're going to be on topic with bob
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:49.520]  chapman of the international forecaster dot com that's the international
[1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:54.600]  forecaster dot com let's go to a first-time caller jim in vegas jim
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:56.000]  what's on your mind
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.680]  and i thought you don't
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.400]  but yeah i i do have a question for bob uh...
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:06.240]  i'm buying gold and silver right now uh... gold eagles and um...
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.760]  other silver junk silver and whatnot
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:10.960]  and my question to you is
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:14.280]  is everyone saying that gold is going to go up so there's going to go up in the
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:15.200]  next
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:16.480]  eighteen months
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:19.640]  uh... how long do you hold on to it for
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:21.120]  because
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:22.320]  if gold is it
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:23.440]  a twenty
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.640]  two thousand dollars an ounce
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:29.280]  but it's two thousand dollars an ounce of worth of dollars and what happened if
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:30.880]  they call it in
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:32.120]  you know i'm saying
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:36.120]  you say twenty two hundred we know what you're saying and that you've asked a
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:38.200]  number of questions here first of all
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:41.320]  uh... people subscribe to the international forecast so they'll know
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:43.120]  when to make changes
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:44.760]  uh... second of all
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:50.280]  uh... i i i i i hope that you're doing business with mitis as well
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:51.600]  they do uh...
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:54.040]  uh... sell gold and silver coins
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:55.800]  uh... you didn't know that
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:57.480]  and uh...
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.840]  and also
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.000]  uh... i i think the accumulation there are
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:04.480]  is a good thing to do
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:07.080]  and i don't expect any kind of
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:09.480]  of uh... execution of law
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:12.960]  uh... that's going to relieve you of your gold and silver assets and
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:15.600]  the reason why is there's not enough americans
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:17.080]  who own
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:19.640]  enough amount
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:22.240]  gold and silver to make it worthwhile
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.480]  for the government to enrage everybody
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:29.600]  uh... i think if they wanted to do that they would go to the etf and say look
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:32.480]  uh... you people a professional so we need that
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.040]  uh... seven hundred twenty tons of gold that you've got there
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:40.160]  and uh... we'd like to relieve you of it but we're gonna pay you in dollars and
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:42.600]  professional investors don't really care
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:45.720]  uh... they'll take the dollars and say well what can i do about it
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:47.720]  but i don't see them going after
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:49.360]  uh... coins
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:52.080]  uh... and and uh... it's it's just
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:53.960]  to politically
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:55.080]  uh...
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:43:57.760]  undesirable under the circumstances
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:00.160]  because i have a lot of other problems
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:02.440]  and uh... those other problems
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:04.280]  are social in nature
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.400]  uh... if not
[1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:06.880]  quite a political
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:09.000]  uh... if you have a lot of unemployment
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.320]  and people have lost their homes in their jobs
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:15.240]  and their cars and
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:19.120]  you know they're on the streets that it it's it's going to be
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:21.560]  uh... a very very bad thing so
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.000]  uh... i i don't think the government will want any more heat than it's already
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:25.680]  got
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:29.040]  and if you're looking to exchange that the uh... gold for some type of currency
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.240]  and the dollar is already been blown out
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.160]  i mean it'll still be worth something in euros in pounds
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  in foreign currency where
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:37.520]  hopefully it
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:40.360]  i mean it's it's a it's a tightrope isn't bob i mean if
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:44.440]  if the dollar goes on it's a little bit of a point there and let me give you the
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:45.400]  bottom line
[1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:47.640]  there is no place else to go
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:51.360]  uh... the stock market has gone down and will continue to do so
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:53.000]  concerning the going down
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.080]  i mean we're never had deep recession already
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:44:58.120]  and depression is beginning
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:01.480]  it's just that nobody wants to admit it
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:03.520]  if that's the case
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:07.080]  the interest rates ultimately going to start moving back upward
[1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:09.280]  when that happens
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:12.760]  real estate is already gone down commodities are very gone down
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:15.120]  what is left
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:18.720]  and you're in a hyperinflationary environment or at least an inflationary
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:19.680]  environment
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:21.800]  at least for some period of time
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:23.720]  you go to gold and silver
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:26.440]  now when you get the to the apex
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:27.120]  all
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:28.720]  the hyperinflation
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:30.320]  and it starts to head down
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:34.560]  wood because you're having heading deeply into depression
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:35.760]  what you want to have
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:37.920]  is only gold bullion coin
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:39.440]  and the reason for that is
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:41.480]  it will hold its value
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:44.320]  there's no premium to speak of it although
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:46.040]  premium may happen
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:49.280]  along the way i i i i you know i don't know that for sure neither does
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:50.880]  anybody else
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:54.240]  but if everything goes down sixty seventy eighty ninety percent like it did
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:55.560]  in the nineteen thirties
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:58.080]  and gold holds its on your own
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:45:59.560]  and never goes anywhere
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:01.280]  you're a big winner
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:04.160]  but of gold goes to two or three thousand dollars announced like i think it
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:04.680]  will
[1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:06.960]  and everything else goes down like i think it will
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:10.120]  you're going to be a giant winner
[1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:11.800]  well i don't know
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:13.480]  all right thank you very much for the call
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:19.120]  all right let's jump to missy in michigan missy what's on your mind
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:22.640]  i've been hearing so much about um... dollar devaluation
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:25.680]  can you help me understand what that actually looks like how does that
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:26.880]  happen what
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:30.400]  happens in the real world they just come out and say your dollars now worth
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:34.920]  seventy cents or basically first of all if they do it gradually so you you are
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:39.600]  less and less aware but yeah every day uh... for instance before nine eleven
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:43.600]  uh... our dollar was high above the euro was about a dollar to seventy five
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:45.200]  seventy six cents so we were
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:46.480]  you know twenty four cents
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:50.800]  more than that now the euro is about a dollar thirty seven dollar forty
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:52.200]  compared to our dollar
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:54.280]  about why you explain it to her
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:57.400]  because people are talking about it like it's an event like something will
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:01.760]  happen and someone will declare now the dollar is devalued
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:03.880]  well the government can do that
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:07.600]  and government usually do that because they owe other people money
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:11.880]  and in this case we owe seventeen trillion dollars
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:13.880]  to to our creditors out there
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.960]  who are foreigners
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:19.280]  and uh... and it's just as bad for americans as well
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:20.880]  and so
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:23.320]  in order to get rid of that they say look
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:26.240]  uh... our currency is no longer selling
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:29.480]  at one thirty one to a euro
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:32.800]  it's now selling at one eighty two a euro
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:34.600]  and so we have decided
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:35.440]  that
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:38.200]  for every ten dollars that you have
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:41.480]  we're going to give you one new new one
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:44.800]  and that is the way devaluation takes place
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:47.560]  now there are other forms of devaluation
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:50.280]  devaluation is caused by inflation
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:51.640]  which rob
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.080]  the currency of its buying power
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:56.360]  that's more subtle
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:57.880]  it's still
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:00.120]  it's stealing
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:02.440]  now the other is too but it
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:04.880]  the devaluation
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:07.680]  in event it happens it's over
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:09.800]  whereas when you have inflation
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:12.040]  it gets you a little bit every day
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:14.800]  and you know that and i don't like the kind
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:18.200]  well an example for in the real world is if you were to go down to mexico ten
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:20.520]  years ago on a vacation and you brought the dollar
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:22.880]  uh... you know you would have probably gotten
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:25.560]  twice the bang for your buck because
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:26.520]  it was worth more
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:28.840]  you know it was more compared to the peso
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:32.080]  uh... if you've gone to europe you would have had it twice the value to your
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:32.680]  buck
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:35.520]  uh... you know going over there but now if you go online and you try to buy
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.000]  something out of europe and it's in pounds or in euros
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.280]  you're actually gonna pay almost twice
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:42.960]  what it would be in dollars
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:45.320]  so you know in the real world
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:47.480]  people are stopping taking
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.160]  uh... dollars i mean it is the real world although it's still the world
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.240]  reserve currency
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:56.400]  less and less people want dollars in fact some people are requesting euros
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:48:59.760]  i think that was even a subplot in in the latest bond movie
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:03.320]  uh... the dictators didn't want dollars anymore they demanded euros in brief
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.040]  cases
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:07.920]  missy well that i didn't see the movie with
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:11.160]  that's probably true but there are countries
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:15.680]  who would prefer not to take dollars particularly in central and south america
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:18.640]  all right let's take one more phone call before the break
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:23.200]  let's go to uh... ship in missouri ship what's on your mind
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:25.560]  a jayson how are you
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:28.160]  alright my question is for a bob bob
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:32.840]  i would like to know how you think the north american union and potentially
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:35.960]  the rise of the america plays into
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:37.280]  the whole thing
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.680]  uh... a new country could really shape it and so is this economic class are
[1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:44.520]  they just using it to consolidate
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:48.560]  uh... wealth and real resources to rob us just so they can say okay we're gonna
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:50.960]  start over and we're still on top i don't know
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:53.200]  could you speak to that please
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:55.560]  okay first of all uh...
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:01.120]  uh... the north american union has effectively temporarily at least
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:02.800]  been derailed
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:05.120]  thanks to the efforts of
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:07.040]  alex jones and others
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:11.080]  uh... the exposure of what the council in foreign relations and
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:13.400]  uh... mister pastor was trying to
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:16.680]  uh... get around us without letting us know
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.280]  uh... but he doesn't realize that lots of us read foreign affairs
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:22.880]  fact i've been a reader since nineteen sixty
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:26.800]  and uh... that is the household of the council in foreign relations
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:29.480]  and i came right out and said this is what we want to do
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  and so i think it's been stopped at the path
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:34.920]  and how long that'll last i don't know
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:38.880]  i don't think that they're going to use at a marrow in a devaluation in the
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:40.760]  united states
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:43.760]  the uh... the uh...
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:46.600]  right on the other side and we'll talk about the north american union the

[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:39.160]  what's not fun is the fact that we're being thrown into

[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:41.720]  now you're talking to ship and you were saying that you don't think that they're
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:45.400]  going to bring in and a marrow to bring in this north american union i tend to
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:47.720]  think that they're going to try to consolidate
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:50.920]  uh the three unions before they even announce a currency i think that you'll
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.600]  see legislation in canada and in the united states to do so
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:57.720]  you've already had people in the canadian parliament
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.920]  saying that we need to put the canadian dollar on parity
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:05.400]  with the u s dollar i would be pretty surprised if we saw an actual
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:09.480]  a marrow coin or a marrow dollar within the next year wouldn't you
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:12.920]  absolutely and you know they've been talking about that in canada for a
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:18.920]  long time and uh at least 20 years and more
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:25.240]  more so in the last several years but um there's a lot of national pride there
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:30.120]  and the canadians are going to fight this just as hard as the americans are
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:35.080]  i find in in my probing into mexico most people don't even know about it so
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:39.880]  it's not an issue but i don't see the a marrow
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:44.360]  being a currency that would be a new currency
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:49.960]  for the united states uh maybe sometime in the future five or ten years from now
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:54.520]  yet the north american union were to become a successful entity
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:58.200]  for the internationalist then uh there would be a good chance
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:01.800]  that an a marrow would appear but it's a long ways away
[1:57:01.800 --> 1:57:05.240]  uh if the dollar's going to be devalued you're going to get another dollar
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:09.800]  except you know you know you give five old ones for one new one or whatever the
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.080]  exchanges oh god well i sincerely hope that doesn't
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:15.720]  happen in this country but it is a great possibility
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:19.240]  all right let's take a look at my goal so important gold will
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:23.800]  appreciate in a way which will offset the loss
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:27.480]  in the value of the dollar and that's why gold is so important
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:32.840]  it goes up during hyperinflationary times and it is used in a flight to
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:38.280]  quality in deflationary times so it serves all the purposes
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:46.920]  of a financial being a currency a world currency that always nobody nothing
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:50.600]  all right let's go to william in montreal william what's on your mind
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:53.880]  hello um i'm calling you from montreal

[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:13.160]  new order in a financial crisis and talking about change

[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:33.640]  from sarkozy uh... recently about the economic crisis continue william
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:36.520]  yes that was two months ago and he was uh...
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:40.520]  he was talking about uh... a meeting they would have in november november 15 but
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:43.160]  i'm going to continue reading that he's been
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:46.760]  this crisis that now clearly can't be sold without massive intervention of the
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:47.480]  state
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:53.000]  the crisis called urgently of a new economical order financial monetary
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:56.760]  uh... that's right that's meant to perform some need for politics
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:01.560]  this crisis will probably mark the true beginning up for a new world order
[2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:05.320]  of the 21st century you know if you could get that in high quality
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:09.000]  um... we would love to have it over here i mean i mean i think that you can find
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:13.160]  on youtube you just type uh... sarkozy you would order or not see the youtube
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:15.800]  clip but we like the uh... the high quality stuff over here
[2:02:15.800 --> 2:02:18.760]  and yet he's not the first uh... world leader to call for this by the way i
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:22.120]  thank you for the call william i mean we had uh...
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.800]  we had the president of georgia on glenn back getting this fluff piece
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:28.840]  interview this love fest oh you're so good you're so good
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:31.480]  and then all of a sudden out of nowhere the uh...
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:36.440]  ahead of uh... georgia over there he says rush is against the new world order
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:40.360]  glenn and you know glenn beck tries to be this anti new world order guy he just
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:43.480]  got hired by fox office cnn and he's not
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.800]  as soon as uh... the georgian leader starts talking about the uh... the new
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:50.120]  world order glenn beck just wants to be like a
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:54.200]  uh... he wasn't supposed to say that but yes that
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:58.520]  this idea of a quote quote unquote new world order is not
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:02.120]  what i'm talking about it's not what alex jones is talking about
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.920]  it's what world leaders have been talking about now
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.680]  for centuries and really have increased their talk about it over the last few
[2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:12.840]  decades you know leaders like jesse jackson in the civil rights movement
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:16.600]  leaders on the right like george uh... h w bush
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:20.360]  you know leaders on the left like bill clinton they're all of just type in new
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:24.040]  world order in any of those names people like joe biden who write articles for
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:26.520]  the wall street journal saying how i love to learn
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:30.840]  or how i learned to love the new world order and the new world order is just
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:33.560]  about setting incremental policies to bring in global government
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:37.240]  that's why the bush administration made all these executive orders past the
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:40.280]  patriarchs one and two military commissions act all that good stuff
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:44.440]  and guess what the powers ain't going anywhere
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:47.640]  that's why newsweek puts out an article called
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:50.680]  obama's cheney dilemma you know cheney had all these
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:54.520]  terrible terrible powers but under obama we should keep them
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:57.960]  you know torture although it sounds good on paper that we should get rid of it i
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:01.960]  don't think we should get rid of it i think that it actually works
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:06.600]  but we're about to have a powerhouse guest on in the next segment it is a
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:10.520]  peter dale scott who's really he's been not

[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.880]  use all their electric through solar panels they only use the most minimal
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:00.600]  amount of energy and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:06.120]  independence from the power companies from the system my solar backup.com
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:10.120]  all right we have a very distinguished guest i was actually lucky enough to
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:13.400]  interview him while i was hosting the alex jones show over the summer
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.640]  this year he's the author of many books and his latest article is marshal law
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:21.880]  the financial bailout and war it's peter dale scott thank you for joining us sir
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:26.360]  but i'm glad to be back hi there well let's just get right into it i mean in
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:30.440]  the very beginning of this article you not only talk about paulson and the
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:34.840]  bailout there but you also talk about how congress was strong armed into
[2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:37.800]  initially passing this because the initial bailout did fail
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:42.120]  and then it was reproposed and after a few members including in hoff and
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:47.320]  sherman were threatened with marshal law it magically passed didn't it peter
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:51.000]  yes well there was an atmosphere of threats
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:56.120]  used on congress i think that the bailout was
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:09:59.480]  illed by certainly in the form that it was
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:04.200]  and of course the excuse that was used was that they had to act immediately
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:09.720]  but i think it's a test of the uh what what is really a bad about this
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.600]  bailout law is it's a means for taking public funds
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:19.160]  and giving them to enrich the rich after they had made
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:23.080]  very disastrous investments which went sour and
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:27.000]  instead of moral hazard applying and they're having to pay for it
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:31.720]  the we are stepping in to pay and it may be that something like this has to be
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:36.120]  done but it should have been done with restraints for example to tell them
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:40.760]  that they can't go on paying these outrageous bonuses for their misdeeds
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:47.720]  that they cannot continue to distribute dividends you know 85 percent
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.320]  of the stock in this country is owned by the richest 10 percent
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:57.560]  in the country so if you pass a public law to guarantee the continuity
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:03.000]  a continuation of dividends to banks which in fact are losing money badly
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.080]  you're using the public treasury to enrich the rich and that's
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:10.680]  a symptom of what's really wrong in this country i think that
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:15.800]  wealth has taken control of both parties and it was the influence of wealth
[2:11:15.800 --> 2:11:20.840]  that grows that legislation through and it's of course just happening again
[2:11:20.840 --> 2:11:24.200]  right now and it's not quite over because once again
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:29.400]  it will go into conference committee and i think this time
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:33.880]  this time they're intending to cut off bonuses and intending to cut off
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:37.400]  dividends but i think we should watch very closely to see if this actually
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:40.760]  happens when the final bill is signed well there's
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:43.480]  definitely some political grandstanding now going on as the
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:46.920]  administrations are about to switch i mean now for the first time i'm seeing
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:50.920]  the media report conservatives ask if bailout is unconstitutional and i
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:53.800]  would say yes it's absolutely unconstitutional
[2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:56.600]  but now now the mainstream is going to make this into a
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:00.440]  a right left argument especially with the house democrats now proposing a now
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:04.440]  a 825 billion dollar stimulus bill i mean is there any
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:08.280]  end in sight to these bailout packages to these stimulus bills i mean
[2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:10.440]  what do you see happening in the next six months
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:13.880]  well i think uh... i've always uh... uh...
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:17.480]  been in uh... unincline to predict the future i know
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:23.080]  i think it's a uh... an easy way to to make big mistakes but particularly
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.240]  right now we really are going into an
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:31.240]  you know people point back to the depression of the 1930s
[2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:37.880]  as an example of where we've been before but we're
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:42.120]  i think we're possibly in an even worse crisis than we were then and one thing
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:46.520]  for sure is that uh... uh... america's
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:51.960]  profile in the world is greater than it was so that the world will suffer
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:57.000]  more acutely um... yes you know the short answer to your question is
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.160]  absolutely there's going to be more and more bailing out trillions of dollars
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:04.600]  people have estimated up to eight and a half trillion
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.200]  some of it will be done through congress and a lot of it's going to be done
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:11.560]  already has been done a trillion or more
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:15.080]  has been done through the federal reserve and people should understand
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:19.800]  that what the federal reserve does is using our money
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:24.440]  but they don't go to congress they're using the powers that were granted
[2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:30.680]  them uh... decades ago and uh... it's completely secret
[2:13:30.680 --> 2:13:34.840]  there's no accountability and you get the uh... the irony that
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:38.520]  bloomberg who's a billionaire his company is suing
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:45.000]  uh... the uh... federal reserve to force them to say what they've been doing
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:48.600]  with our money and you really have reached a point where
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:54.680]  no longer democracy if taxation without representation going on through the
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:58.280]  federal reserve so there are left right and
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:02.440]  center in every direction the treatment of the banks treatment of the big
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:07.800]  multinational corporations we're going to see huge bailouts
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:13.480]  with a minimum of control and i think all we can do from outside is to insist
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:16.600]  is here are the things that we should insist on
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:21.560]  one as much transparency as possible there was really no transparency in the
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:26.600]  first day of the poulsen's bailout and uh... what i think is a vital
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:30.760]  criterion is democracy is suffering right now
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:35.880]  because we're getting from for about thirty years now we've been getting
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:39.880]  rapidly increasing disparity between wealth
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:44.120]  and poverty in this country the rich are that there are there are ways of
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:49.560]  measuring this and america has become of all the western uh... countries
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:55.880]  probably the leading example of extreme disparity between wealth and poverty
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:00.680]  and the criterion that should be applied to every law that's passed and all these
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:05.960]  bailouts is will it uh... diminish the disparity of wealth
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:09.960]  and income in this country or will it increase it and if it increases it
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.600]  it's a bad law and uh... that i think is something
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:20.920]  it's a sign of the problem that this obvious criterion has
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:26.920]  hardly been invoked uh... it has come up i think with the with the auto industry
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:30.760]  i think it's it's perfectly obvious that if you're going to ask the workers
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:36.200]  to uh... accept less in their paycheck then you should ask the people who
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:38.600]  probably are being overpaid at the top
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:42.520]  for two weeks at last too particularly because it was their failure of
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:46.280]  leadership that led into this crisis does that not make sense
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:49.720]  i absolutely agree with you and it's just disgusting how
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:53.400]  you know like you said the upper echelon continue to rake in the bonuses
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:57.000]  still have these massive salaries in the hundreds of thousands and millions of
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.880]  dollars in most cases and like you said uh...
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:03.720]  it's going to be the common worker who loses his pension who loses his 401k
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:07.640]  who loses his benefits and may not even have a job because i really don't see
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:11.080]  the auto industry surviving another year in this country
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:13.960]  uh... we don't make anything left and there's nothing we make in this country
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:16.520]  the last thing was cars and that's about to end
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:19.560]  and going back to what you said about that is that i think we're pretty good
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:23.320]  in high tech well that's true we've had sourced a lot of it but the
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:25.960]  the central leadership of that industry
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:28.600]  yeah but most of it's still built in india or china
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:32.440]  we have it uh... a lot of the jobs have gone but the
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:37.720]  the uh... america is uh... you know now we're talking about something that's
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:41.480]  been happening over 50 years and that is that uh...
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.400]  we've put so much emphasis on maintaining our military
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:49.400]  that we've allowed uh... civilian leadership to
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:53.640]  i mean civilian industry and the civilian economy to migrate to other
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:16:57.320]  countries and uh... i think
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:00.600]  one of the things that we have to say about this bay route is
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:04.280]  that the crisis it faced should have been faced
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:07.480]  much earlier and worse than that the states
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.480]  did they they they addressed the problem of predatory lending which is
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:15.240]  at the at the heart of it because uh... here were
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:21.080]  very unscrupulous companies going out and hard selling mortgages to people
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:26.040]  who they they knew couldn't sustain them particularly because these were
[2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:29.880]  variable mortgages that would start with a very reasonable rate
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:35.000]  of which they intended to jack up to 11 12 15 percent
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:40.440]  usurias rates they they knew that this was all a phony operation and that
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:43.880]  this is where the big banks are culpable because
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:49.320]  they uh... the uh... first of all they lobbied for congress to make it easier
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:52.360]  to do this sort of thing for them to invest in it
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:56.920]  and then they packaged all these mortgages into securities which they sold
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:18:00.120]  all over the world so that's why we have a world
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:04.360]  crisis now based on the failure in the uh...
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:08.040]  or the downturn in the american housing market
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:13.000]  little innocent countries like iceland who have done no wrong to anybody are
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:18.120]  suffering terribly because the banking system of the world
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:23.160]  is supported this bubble and now is having to pay for it
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:27.880]  everywhere every part of the world there's one other thing
[2:18:27.880 --> 2:18:32.360]  you could easily in legislation establish a principle
[2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:36.040]  of some kind of ratio between the richest return
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:41.560]  and the poorest in any business so if a worker in an industry is getting
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:46.600]  i don't know uh... how we say 30 thousand a year
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:51.640]  you establish a limit maybe 20 times that which would be the maximum
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:55.880]  that anybody in that industry can make and this is this has been kicked around
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:19:00.360]  for some years as a solution to the problem of disparity
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:04.040]  of income but uh... i'm not sure that are
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:09.240]  two parties that are so heavily subsidized by the wealthy
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:12.520]  are going to put that into legislation but they should
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:18.360]  just say 20 times as much as the basic pay is the most that anybody
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:22.360]  can make in any industry that not reasonable it seems reasonable to guys
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:25.240]  like you and me but to the global elite that's a
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:28.600]  that's going to cut into their profit margin quite a bit scared of them
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:32.440]  exactly and that's what that's what we learned
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:39.000]  in the bailout last fall is how vigorously they thought to maintain
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.880]  their bonuses and maintain their dividends
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:45.720]  even though they're lucky not to be in jail some of those people and some of
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:49.080]  them actually still not just made up and a number of other people
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:51.800]  i think they're super lucky it's the alex joneshal we'll be back with peter

[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:29.720]  federal reserve and i want to remind people that
[2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:32.840]  the federal reserve is an independent organization i mean you can watch
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:37.080]  alan greenspan on pbs actually tout that oh we're independent of the federal
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:40.040]  government and actually we have no oversight and
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:42.440]  we're really above the president in many respects
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:45.960]  and if you see how the federal reserve works the board
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:49.400]  and correct me if i'm wrong peter but i believe that your
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:54.360]  you vote for your um your constituent you vote for your uh
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:57.320]  congressmen your senators and things like that but those people are the ones
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:00.920]  who actually decide who's going to be on the board of the federal reserve and
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:03.640]  they serve i want to say what is it 13
[2:25:03.640 --> 2:25:07.160]  no it's 13 members and what do they serve eight-year terms
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:13.800]  yes it's uh it's uh a considered way of preventing
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:17.320]  people people just printing money the idea of it
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:20.760]  is and by the way you do get something like this in
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:27.960]  in england and in france uh because uh they're frightened of democracy
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:31.640]  cheapening money uh because obviously you think
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:35.080]  i i don't know what the right solution here is
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:42.120]  i i'm not as frightened my real fear is not the particular
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:45.160]  individual through in the federal reserve my fear
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.320]  of of the influence of the wealthy in this country
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:53.880]  which uh works through the fed it works through the treasury department
[2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:59.160]  it works very much through the cia and that's actually being my specialty over
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:03.240]  these years you know at the beginning the the cia was sort of planned on
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:06.760]  wall street and all the first directors or
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:10.680]  practically all the first directors and deputy directors
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:15.960]  were taken en masse from wall street firms of all firms and wall street
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:22.840]  investment companies uh and that bias uh in terms of preserving wealth has
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:26.520]  affected our foreign policy since the war it
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:30.760]  it wasn't totally uh evil at the beginning but
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:35.400]  it ever ever since america started having to tighten its belt which is
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:41.320]  roughly at the end of the vietnam war it's been done in such a way as to
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:46.600]  protect the rich and let somebody else pay and what we've seen from this is
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:52.200]  uh declining income in the third world which of course leads to increased
[2:26:52.200 --> 2:26:57.560]  violence in the third world and declining income real real income not
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:01.400]  just what the number is on a paycheck but real income
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:04.680]  became declining for the working class in this country and
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:07.720]  increasingly now for the middle class as well
[2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:11.320]  and that's why i say uh you know you've had to this
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:17.000]  this bubble this financial bubble that is being in a sense extracting wealth
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:22.600]  out of the body politic depositing it in the bank accounts of the rich and
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:27.000]  now the bailouts are still in a sense trying to preserve that particular
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.040]  relationship which uh we've got to talk about martial law and war in this
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:36.760]  program but i really am of course very wound up about this influence as well
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:40.120]  yeah that's exactly what i wanted to move into um you know martial law the
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:44.360]  financial bailout and more where does martial law fit into all this not only
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:47.800]  were they threatened with martial law but we have an obama administration that
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:50.040]  says that they're going to redistribute troops
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:53.160]  into afghanistan obviously there's tensions not only in
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:57.480]  gaza and israel but pakistan is now more and more you know showing up on the
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:01.720]  media as the enemy i mean is martial law here at home something
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:06.520]  that we should really be worried about um preparations for martial law have been
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:11.480]  increasing uh constantly for the last 30 years
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:17.560]  it really goes back to the uh the troubles back in the 1960s and 1970s
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:22.840]  when there was a case actually i i think i approved of calling out the
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:26.920]  troops in places like uh detroit because the federal troops
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:31.080]  were not as racist as the local police and were
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.800]  more efficient at restoring order but traditionally in this country as i'm
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:40.840]  sure most of the audience know uh you only use federal troops in an extreme
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:45.400]  emergency we have posicomy tattoo sacks dating back to
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:49.240]  reconstruction after the civil war which forbid
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:55.400]  the use of troops in a normal way in police activities
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:01.800]  and that's been undermined now since the early 1980s by secret planning
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:06.200]  by a committee that was set up under the regent administration
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:11.960]  and it's for for 20 years it kept on going into the chief people in the
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:17.000]  in the planning not the only ones uh were dick cheney and donald rumsfeld
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.840]  and this was and they were planning for what was in effect called
[2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:23.800]  the suspension of the american constitution
[2:29:23.800 --> 2:29:27.960]  first of all in an in an atomic attack but what
[2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:32.280]  the extraordinary thing was they took planning against an atomic attack and
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:37.240]  applied it to normal police activity and that's what we're getting today
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:41.320]  we'll be back with peter dale scott martial law the financial bailout and

[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:42.040]  in the 80s under uh reagan and what i found uh in my research and i have a
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:44.280]  little part of it in fabled enemies is in
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:50.120]  uh the late 80s early 90s the national programs office took over the cog
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:54.760]  responsibilities under george hw bush the then uh vice president
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:58.600]  and it just expanded their powers it was almost the birth of the sole source
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:01.480]  contract where they went into all these little black ops modes
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:06.840]  um why don't you talk about that so and then i just to carry it on there at the
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:11.880]  end of the ghw bush administration the new york times ran an article
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:17.560]  and said that there was no more atomic uh they you know with the
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:21.960]  disappearances soviet union they were no longer so frightened of an atomic attack
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:26.360]  so they were winding up these programs it was a very misleading article
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:30.200]  because what had happened was that they had shifted
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:37.640]  the planning from an atomic focus to just any emergency and one of the last
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:43.240]  acts of the reagan administration was to pass an executive order that
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:48.200]  made that official that it could be any emergency so the planning continued
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:53.160]  under clinton and according to alexander coburn clinton had no real
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:56.680]  idea of the extent of this planning he must have had
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:00.360]  some idea of it because he he signed a couple of
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:05.720]  orders himself but the the really extraordinary thing is that in the 90s
[2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:12.680]  under clinton uh neither uh cheney nor rumpfield had anything to do with the
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:17.160]  government each of them was a cio the major corporation
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:23.000]  but the planning continued and the army has
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:26.280]  one of the last troops of the clinton administration
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:29.560]  was a new new directive for the army which
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:34.440]  legitimized the idea that the army would permanently
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:40.360]  have a what they call a co-op for a a continuity of operations program in the
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:44.040]  army for the first time instead of the people who had
[2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:48.040]  worried about an attack from abroad would now worry from
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:54.440]  an attack at home from violence of any form and
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:59.480]  within right after 9 11 we got a whole series of things which i'm sure
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:06.040]  were a cog plan one of which is going to be very important in the future and
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:09.800]  that is the creation of an army command for north america
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:14.040]  just like you have a command for south com for south america there's now
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:17.960]  north com for north america and last
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:22.040]  september they announced that they they moved a combat brigade
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:28.280]  from iraq to the united states ready for combat in the united states this is
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:31.720]  entirely entirely unprecedented
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:34.520]  and it's been announced that this is probably
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:38.600]  but you know they they announced it in connection with the
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:42.360]  inauguration and we've seen since then the
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:46.520]  the troops are now in washington controlling washington
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:51.720]  but this is not an ad hoc thing this is a permanent thing under this new order
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:56.040]  absolutely and you know what let's play the clip of obama before he's elected
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:36:59.880]  talking about a civilian security force and he's openly said that he's going to
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:03.560]  bring 20 000 troops into the united states for domestic
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:07.720]  operations let's play that clip yeah here
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:11.720]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:15.640]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've said
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:18.600]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:24.680]  that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:27.720]  all right so you know it really does seem like again
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:31.480]  uh these are these are continuations that you see whether it's republican or
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:34.360]  democrat just like you said began with reagan
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:37.880]  into uh the bush one administration conduit government
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.440]  plans were then still expanded upon in the clinton administration and of
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:45.560]  course under the bush two administration like you said c o g was
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:48.360]  put into place on 9 11 a lot of people don't understand
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:51.640]  that there were already drills going on that morning and then by the time the
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:55.000]  attacks had hit the united states c o g was immediately put into place
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:58.440]  dick cheney was rushed off to a piac um you know
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:02.040]  george bush was put into an undisclosed location flying around air force one
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:05.640]  all day and um you know most people are here right
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:09.320]  yeah yeah and and most people scoff at the idea of this shadow government and
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:11.960]  it was on the it was on the cover of the washington times
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:16.760]  so i see only more expansion on this c o g type program
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:20.520]  uh i don't think it's a coincidence that this week is when we saw
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:24.920]  uh the 9 11 commission release over 1200 interviews uh transcripts of interviews
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:27.400]  at the end of the bush administration so they couldn't be ridiculed
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:31.800]  i'm sure that you know researchers you look at that schedule or almost half of
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:35.320]  them are still without it yes they're releasing them but not really
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:39.080]  releasing them yes and still has uh clearances on them they say oh well
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.000]  national security it's going to take legislation to get all of that stuff
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:47.800]  cleared and i don't have much confidence that this congress will do it but
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:52.600]  i would certainly i think it's you know if we're revamping the whole of our
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:56.360]  constitutional arrangement in this country because
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:02.520]  of this largest murder if uh certainly in the history of the united states
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:07.800]  and least investigated and we still don't know and we can't even see
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:11.720]  you know the after the kennedy assassination you had the warren
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:15.320]  commission which essentially covered things up but at least it had the
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:20.120]  decency to publish its evidence and we're going to get
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:23.240]  we're going to need legislation to force
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:28.520]  the evidence or whatever it was from the from the 9 11 commission
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:33.160]  release but let me tell you the thing that worries me most about obama we had
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:37.800]  an election uh where we had a choice uh the the parties
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:42.360]  gave us a choice between a candidate mccain who wanted to fight two wars
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:48.040]  and a candidate uh obama who by the way i mean i could say good things about
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:52.600]  obama on this program i'm i'm not totally hostile to him by any means
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:58.760]  except when it came to afghanistan and uh when he was talking about iraq
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:03.560]  this is what he had to say i'm quoting now from his website the scale of our
[2:40:03.560 --> 2:40:09.400]  deployments in iraq continues to set back our ability to finish the fight in
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:13.320]  afghanistan well uh it's very clear
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:19.720]  since then that obama means to uh not just to fight in afghanistan but to
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:23.880]  escalate in afghanistan and i think you've already said that
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:29.800]  that's a war which is going nowhere and is our presence is making things worse
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:36.440]  not better it's uh and any anybody any sane person looking at that war
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:39.960]  knows that you're even thinking of trying to finish it
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:43.240]  you know first of all you're not going to succeed the russians didn't the
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:47.320]  british didn't nobody has ever succeeded in doing this
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:50.600]  but if you're going to try you're going to have to put
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:54.280]  vastly more troops there than there are now
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:00.200]  and we are destabilizing pakistan which is one of the shakiest
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:04.680]  constitutional government in the region and is one with the
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:08.200]  with the nuclear weapons so what we are doing is
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:14.120]  has increased the chances that islamic fundamentalists may end up with a state
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:17.400]  of pakistan and nuclear weapons to boot so
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:22.200]  uh this is where i think uh obama needs to be reined in
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:26.520]  and i don't see that coming from congress no i don't see that either and i see it
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:30.760]  as a redistribution of forces um getting people out of an unpopular war in
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:33.160]  iraq only to put them in up to afghanistan
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:36.600]  and create the same kind of a quagmire situation
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:39.720]  so we still have our presence in the middle east i mean to me this is really
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:44.120]  about building a eurasian union it's it's what the peanut guys talked about in
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:47.720]  rebuilding america's defenses and having a presence there
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:51.320]  um i feel like iran is probably the most unstable block there but they haven't
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:56.120]  been able to really propagate a reason for us to go in there with the american
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:59.320]  people you know again pakistan's being demonized at the moment
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:02.840]  you know most people in this country are still behind a war in afghanistan and
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:05.960]  iraq because they still think the bogeyman osama and laudan is out there
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:09.720]  they just reiterated that by putting out an audio tape of him taking the
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:12.600]  palestinian plight so anybody who disagrees
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:16.840]  with um israeli force on the gaza strip is automatically
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:21.320]  you know associated with the deepest darkest villain there is out there
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:24.680]  you know i don't see us leaving peter i i i see us
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:30.280]  well i think i i eventually i i see us losing and leaving right yet
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:34.680]  numb but it took uh you know uh it it took a decade
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:38.120]  really after america realized it couldn't win
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:44.600]  before the vietnam war was over and uh an awful lot of people died and even
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:50.440]  americans died under nixon who won on the campaign of ending the war
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:57.240]  so uh we're used to uh presidents who campaign on ending a war who who make
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:43:02.040]  things worse uh and uh yes i fear it here i don't
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:05.640]  by the way i i'm not accusing obama of being
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:10.680]  a cynic who is out to deceive the american people i just see him as
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:16.600]  somebody hedged in by these forces uh who want that war
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:22.040]  we the underlying fact is that uh american oil companies have now
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:26.280]  invested a great deal in the oil and gas of central asia
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:32.120]  and uh they need ways of getting it out and they have one insecure pipeline
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.920]  going through georgia and we saw the trouble there last fall
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:41.560]  and uh they would like very much to have a gas and an oil pipeline through
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:46.440]  afghanistan it's not it's not going to happen by putting u.s troops there
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:52.280]  because that is just increasing the uh the tension in the country
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:58.680]  and uh you know the peanut goal was to uh it has been bought by the u.s army
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:03.160]  their their stated mission is full spectrum dominance in the world
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:09.080]  and uh part of that is this uh continuity of operations mission for
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:13.640]  the army here is to have full spectrum dominance in the united states because
[2:44:13.640 --> 2:44:15.960]  obviously if you want to dominate the world
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:18.840]  you're going to have to dominate this country too
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:23.800]  and uh these are still things that are not fully implemented and
[2:44:23.800 --> 2:44:28.840]  what people listen to this program have to do is to alert their friends and
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:31.960]  their neighbors that you know the real role of the
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:37.560]  us army is to protect the american people it is not to control the american
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:40.840]  people that the revolutionary change and it should be
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:44.840]  challenged and it should be stopped i absolutely agree with you there
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:47.640]  my question is do you think that conscription could actually happen
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:51.080]  under this administration uh tom blankley editor over at the
[2:44:51.080 --> 2:44:54.360]  washington times has been parading around the media now for the last few
[2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:58.600]  years talking about conscription i've got a clip of him on papu canons msnbc
[2:44:58.600 --> 2:45:00.840]  show where he's talking about it in the summer of
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:05.320]  07 saying well the time for that debate isn't now it'll be under a new
[2:45:05.320 --> 2:45:08.040]  administration uh low and behold we get that new
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:11.720]  administration in a week before they're inaugurated the same guy blankly puts out
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:14.760]  a book called american grit where again he's calling for
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:18.680]  conscription of 1825 year olds uh three months
[2:45:18.680 --> 2:45:21.960]  in a boot camp and two years mandatory service and this
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:27.640]  is echoed by obama's new chief of staff rama manuel he was just on c span over
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:31.080]  the summer talking about this same program is it going to happen is there
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:36.200]  a possibility of it happening here well again i i'm reluctant to predict
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:42.520]  because the big block to it happening is that we will go back to the america of
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:46.120]  the 1960s and you will have a new anti-war movement
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:52.120]  and this was the the big issue when america went into iraq in my in 2003
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:57.080]  and uh the the the generals were absolutely right it should have been
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:03.320]  done with 500 000 troops and uh run still said that's ridiculous we
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:09.000]  it's going to we can use our new sophisticated weapons and win it
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:13.320]  quickly with only a hundred and twenty thousand and of course
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:17.960]  he was wrong but the reason that they didn't want to go to 500 000
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:21.160]  troops is that they would have needed to have a draft for that
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.000]  and uh that's why i'm not going to predict that we'll get a draft we're
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:28.840]  going to get people who say if you want to maintain all these
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:33.560]  missions you're going to have to have a draft and particularly because one
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:36.840]  thing that's certain is that iraq has
[2:46:36.840 --> 2:46:41.080]  had very negative impact on recruitment for the army
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:47.640]  uh but as they uh the civilian people are very terrified of
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:51.240]  creating a situation where once again they are
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:55.160]  forcing young americans to protect themselves by getting involved in
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:59.080]  anti-war movement peter where can people get your information i know you're
[2:46:59.080 --> 2:47:02.360]  right for uh 911truth.org a lot and you're on blog
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:08.520]  my own website and i but my i used to put things in it now it's mostly just
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:11.880]  connection to i've written quite a lot of
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:18.280]  articles on the internet recently and my own website is basically just a
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:23.160]  kind of a gateway to going into it's hot
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:27.560]  linked to all these other articles uh be careful listening to this it's
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:30.440]  simple but it's important to get it right

[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:42.520]  not do peter dale scott dot com because that's a hostile

[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:54.040]  quite know what it is uh peter dale scott dot com was
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:47:57.960]  opened up in tinnia by a company that's now in bailey's
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:48:01.240]  the only thing that has on it that have anything to do with me
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:07.480]  are negative reviews of my book yeah how dare you try to expose light on the
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:11.000]  darkness over the past 30 to 40 years you've been at this forever haven't you
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:15.080]  i mean literally 30 or 40 years vietnam war started
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:18.840]  and then because of that i i saw a connection between the vietnam war
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:22.200]  and it really happened after kennedy was
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:26.440]  assassinated so i got drawn into that and again
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:30.120]  you know i don't think we'll ever really have a chance
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:33.640]  of rational government in this country until
[2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:38.120]  people on high admit that uh kennedy wasn't just
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:43.400]  uh killed by a disgruntled ex-marine but called lee harvey oswald everybody
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:47.000]  knows it but officially that's even you know nixon
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:50.920]  said that the war in the port was the biggest scam biggest folks ever
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:55.320]  perpetrated on the american people that's on one of the tapes we've got out of the
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:58.440]  white house but officially of course it's still the
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:02.760]  official doctrine that harvey also did it he acted alone
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:08.760]  and with 9 11 19 crazy arabes did it and they acted alone
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:13.400]  all the look at one of these what i call deep events
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:18.200]  deep events the ones which we know there's more to it than meets the eye
[2:49:18.200 --> 2:49:22.840]  uh instruct how much uh continuity of uh
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:29.080]  modus operandi there is uh between the kennedy of fascination and 9 11
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:33.160]  and i have references to those articles that are on the
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:36.440]  internet and that you can get through my website
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:40.920]  yeah there definitely does seem to be a lot of uh inter players players
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:44.920]  involved in both the kennedy assassination and uh 9 11 as well
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:48.840]  and you know in the mainstream media at least last week they were saying oh
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.120]  9 11 conspiracy theorists might be right there's this new document where
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:56.360]  this mob boss takes entire credit through an fbi asset for the uh
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:50:00.360]  kennedy assassination well a mob boss couldn't call the secret service
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:03.880]  off the uh off the car and you can see that in the video so obviously

[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:19.720]  underneath the texas schoolbook depository
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:23.000]  yeah and again he couldn't have called off those two secret service agents and
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.320]  you can see that right in the video folks
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:28.840]  come on this is a this is a government blackout from start to finish
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:31.800]  um use some mob players to get rid of some people

[2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:35.560]  dale scott peter dale scott dot net or dot org
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:37.960]  in the last few minutes peter i really want to get
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:42.120]  your take on some of the appointments some of the administrative officials in
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:44.760]  this i mean we've got ron manuel chief of staff
[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:47.960]  gates is going to stay on for at least another year they're telling us john
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:52.280]  carrey uh just appointed as the head of the foreign relations committee what
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:56.680]  you think about this new administration well you know
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:02.440]  um i get you know i see a mix of hopeful and depressing features about it
[2:55:02.440 --> 2:55:07.240]  i you know i'm 80 years old and i've seen a lot of new administrations and i
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:14.440]  expect them to uh lean in one direction to assure one constituency and another
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:19.960]  to uh reassure another i think the one that uh was most
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:23.480]  predictable and upsets me the most is ron manuel
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:29.800]  as chief of staff and that's because i've spent the last
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:36.680]  six or seven or eight years campaigning to have a genuine
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:43.640]  investigation of 9 11 and in 2006 we had a number of people in the democratic
[2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:46.520]  primaries who were saying the same thing and
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:50.360]  many of them could have been elected like colonel bowman for example
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:56.120]  and uh ron manuel and senator schumer uh went full out
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:55:59.960]  to campaign against those people in the democratic
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:04.600]  primaries even at the cost of losing the seat because
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:08.920]  the the candidate who defeated the good candidate was then defeated by a
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:13.960]  republican uh the uh on the economic side you
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:17.720]  have both geithner assuming that he's going to get
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:21.720]  confirmed which is not clear and uh i'm
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:26.520]  certainly not happy that marz summers is the chairman of the economic advisors
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:30.840]  but what's more important here is not the people that he put in to reassure
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:35.160]  the bankers because he has to do that it's the people he didn't put in to
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:38.200]  balance them and uh we could have had stiglitz we
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:42.520]  could have had paul krugman we could have had jamie galbraith or
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:48.840]  number of good uh uh democratic economists who are
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:55.080]  challenging the way the bailout went and i'm disappointed that they're not him
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:57:00.920]  i do think that uh the abuses of the justice department will be
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:04.680]  basically i i have no opinions really about holder but
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:11.320]  underneath him the new uh council of the legal office inside justice a very
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:15.320]  good person i think the idea that they get
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:20.440]  someone from outside the cia panetta i think is a good idea
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:24.680]  you know you can democrats in particular have trouble
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:30.120]  getting their nominees for head of cia approved and
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:34.520]  carter had this trouble and kennedy had this trouble
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:39.080]  uh i think panetta will get in he is an outsider and he will get
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:44.520]  uh further i think then tanfield turner was able to who was
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:49.080]  uh carter's nominee who was a very honest man
[2:57:49.080 --> 2:57:52.280]  and the cia just ignored him really and ran
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:56.120]  circles around him i think from that is probably a good choice so
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:58:00.520]  you see i'm not giving a very clear picture and i think we shouldn't have a
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:02.840]  clear picture i think we've got to give
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:06.200]  obama his hundred days and see if he can be like
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:09.560]  roosevelt and really get the country started up again
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:13.000]  or whether he's going to be like jimmy carter and just uh

[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.760]  john in ohio john what's on your mind
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:00.680]  yes uh... jason uh... i asked uh... but before i get to my point i'd ask
[3:01:00.680 --> 3:01:04.520]  that you have uh... tarply uh... talk about uh... the middle east i heard
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:09.080]  his last saturday program and uh... uh... he didn't talk about it but
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:13.640]  sometimes is a delay uh... they play the wrong week but at any rate
[3:01:13.640 --> 3:01:18.280]  i think that uh... i appreciate a lot of what uh... professor scott has done
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:21.320]  over the years especially his uh... research into the sea involvement in
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:25.080]  the kennedy assassination and the vietnam war
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:29.400]  uh... but i uh... think uh... he's typical of uh... many people
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:34.440]  who are saying please give him a chance after he's uh... after uh... obama has
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:37.640]  shown that he is nothing but a stooge for the other
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:43.000]  the worst wall street and war industry uh... interest uh... and he's done this
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.640]  uh... he's shown where he's uh... at even before these rotten up appointments
[3:01:47.640 --> 3:01:52.120]  like gates and uh... dennis ross this ultra zionist in the even more
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:55.640]  ultra zionist uh... uh... rabid war monger
[3:01:55.640 --> 3:02:00.360]  uh... rama manual uh... he's called for uh... uh... increasing the troops so
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:04.200]  long ago uh... by a hundred thousand he's called for uh...
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:08.120]  he's voted for every hundreds of billions of dollars for this uh... this rotten
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:10.920]  war against iraq
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:16.280]  he's uh... voted for the plaza uh... spying uh... or the negation of this
[3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:19.080]  other plaza and giving total immunity
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:22.280]  to to bush a reinstatement of the uh... patriot act
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:25.320]  we know where he stands and i think people are going to have to i don't know
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:26.360]  if it's too late
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:28.920]  at his inauguration punch this bubble
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:32.280]  this cult like uh... cool a jim jones bubble around him
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:36.680]  and and especially in this latest genocide and at the cleansing
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:38.840]  that he is uh... supporting
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:43.480]  uh... not only by silence but trotting out his surrogate able to axle axle rod
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:48.600]  to justify that the genocide that uh... uh... israel's perpetrating against uh...
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:53.320]  against the poor palestinian people i don't think there is uh... is much of a uh...
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:55.800]  argument against the fact that he is
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.560]  put in a a hawk like administration rama manual is
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:04.600]  is extremely hawk like you know it's just people like peter del scott people
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:05.880]  like reama govern
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:09.640]  um... you know they they're left leaning you know they're still able to get on
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:11.960]  stage with the likes of michael more at some of the
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:16.360]  i don't think he's left but jason i don't think he's uh... i don't think it's left
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.600]  to make excuses for this guy there are people on the genuine left like w s
[3:03:20.600 --> 3:03:22.040]  dubious dot org or
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:26.280]  or uh... uh... what even cut uh... uh... the counterpunch
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:30.520]  dot com uh... the uh... the uh... uh... coburn uh... site that's a doctor
[3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:31.240]  yeah
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:35.080]  then and these people are totally uh... opposed
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:36.840]  from the point of view of the left
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:41.000]  and uh... i think it unless people uh... don't keep on saying giving give him
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:44.920]  a chance when he's leading us into even bigger wars
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.160]  uh... against pakistan against uh... and justifying this outrageous
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:53.320]  uh... support for israel which is the number one fire starter war starter
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:54.200]  and trigger
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:57.560]  for everything that it's the night what the the worst elements of other u.s.
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:00.040]  military industrial complex is used to uh...
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:03.480]  incite war against iraq iran uh... well then you should like my next guest
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:07.400]  is webster jit griffin tarpley is not going to be giving obama a chance hasn't
[3:04:07.400 --> 3:04:10.040]  given obama a chance has really gone after him
[3:04:10.040 --> 3:04:14.440]  since day one i in fact i kind of hope that uh... tarpley is often his analysis
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:15.240]  uh...
[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:19.640]  you know he is given an extreme analysis this being the next wave of fascism
[3:04:19.640 --> 3:04:21.880]  and he may be correct i mean when you have
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:25.400]  a guy on the end by the way i think for the call when you have uh... a guy like
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:28.200]  obama on the cover of spider-man
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:30.280]  okay the cover of spider-man
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:33.880]  this isn't even the cover of spider-man right here is the new global elite obama
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:37.080]  but on the cover of spider-man and it sells out less than a day i gotta buy a
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:39.240]  comic book that is a price tag of four bucks

[3:07:04.600 --> 3:07:08.920]  but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and
[3:07:08.920 --> 3:07:12.200]  lack of exercise ph balance is the foundation of energy

[3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:30.120]  most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:33.160]  alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes
[3:07:33.160 --> 3:07:36.200]  too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it

[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:56.840]  webster griffin tarpley author and lecturer and he's got two books out
[3:08:56.840 --> 3:09:00.840]  right now about obama barack h obama the unauthorized biography and of
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:04.520]  course obama the postmodern coup and as we're working
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:08.040]  on this obama film here at the info warrior studios
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:11.800]  um you know i i tend to like this guy less and less and less and it does seem
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:15.960]  like there is a concerted effort to really promote him not only through the
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:19.160]  media i mean it's bad enough that msnbc was running
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:24.120]  commercials with all their anchors change with msnbc uh on the cover of
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:28.840]  spider-man this week sold out uh copies are going for upwards of 150
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:32.680]  dollars you can't get one less than 80 dollars cover of the rolling stone
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:36.840]  deified as a god and uh now newsweek even doing a cover
[3:09:36.840 --> 3:09:41.080]  article entitled obama's cheney dilemma where they make the case that the
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:44.840]  obama administration should not get rid of any of the executive powers that were
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:48.760]  brought in under the bush administration thank you for joining us webster
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:51.720]  thank you jason how are you i am good i'm good
[3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:56.120]  so i mean it really does seem like you know you know aside from the youth core
[3:09:56.120 --> 3:10:00.440]  and aside from the media promoting him that obama's cult like status is just
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:04.040]  growing and growing and growing i mean when i flew into texas last week
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:07.720]  you know one of the guys with the uh big orange batons
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:12.360]  was wearing you know not a a change obama hat not an obama oahap but just one of
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:16.600]  these stylist fashion things that you can get in any mall now because he's all
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.200]  over hats he's all over t-shirts i mean there's an obama line of shoes
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:24.520]  it's pretty incredible well i think it's um
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:29.560]  it's not encouraging for the future of democracy to have a personality cult
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.880]  on the model of uh the various totalitarians in europe and then in the
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:38.440]  1920s and 30s interestingly enough the washington post
[3:10:38.440 --> 3:10:43.080]  has recognized that the classic obama poster
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:48.200]  is directly out of soviet communism italian fascism and german
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:51.480]  national socialism and it's very interesting the guy who does these
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:54.520]  things is shepherd fairy you've probably seen him
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:59.080]  uh the cover of time magazine with the shepherd fairy the cover of
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:02.920]  washington life another one of the same type uh you probably seen the one with
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:06.280]  obama hope underneath uh things like this in the
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:10.440]  washington post this is the first time they've uh admitted
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:13.160]  because they've been supporting obama of course because they're the house organ
[3:11:13.160 --> 3:11:19.000]  of the federal reserve system um it says this branding is brilliant
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.920]  but it seems to disregard the iconic precedents of authoritarian propaganda
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:30.360]  originating in forms such as the soviet poster art of the 1920s
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:34.680]  that americans have traditionally resisted so you're being invited to join
[3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:38.760]  the personality cult of a uh of a demagogue
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:42.120]  who is uh he wants to become an authoritarian
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:46.520]  dictator um functioning differently than bush he's more demagogic
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:50.280]  he's using left cover compared to bush's right wing
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:54.920]  arguments right bush was talking bin laden elkide of war on terror 9 11 he
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:11:59.000]  was bush was ranting about 9 11 last night in his farewell which was a
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:02.040]  quite a spectacle but now with obama it's going to be different now it's going
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:05.800]  to be uh as he says uh the washington post headline of
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:11.640]  today i think is extremely ominous it is that obama is now pledged to loot
[3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:16.920]  and pillage and sack social security medicare and medicaid
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:20.440]  with the goal of course of convoying that money not to the poor
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:24.200]  but to wall street he's doing it under the direction
[3:12:24.200 --> 3:12:28.520]  of former federal reserve chairman paul adolf valker
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:31.640]  trilateral commission carter administration the guy who
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:36.120]  destroyed the u.s. industrial base with the worst usury
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:41.160]  in the history uh 22 prime rate that's valker he's the uh
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:45.160]  the elder statesman the eminence gree's of this entire thing
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:50.200]  and obama says he wants to uh he wants entitlement reform that means that
[3:12:50.200 --> 3:12:54.280]  your economic rights won by the american people in the american labor
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:56.840]  movement with with all kinds of struggles
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.600]  the detroit sit-down strikes the san francisco general strike the mini apple
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:05.080]  is teams to strike and the tolito auto light and a million other
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:07.880]  sung and unsung labor struggles over the years
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:11.720]  obama wants to take that all the way and he says
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:16.360]  this is where there are going to be very difficult choices
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:20.680]  and issues of sacrifice and responsibility
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:25.400]  and duty he says sacrifice responsibility and duty now this is not
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.720]  new uh michelle obama during the primary as i pointed out
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:34.200]  almost a year ago now was talking a litany of sacrifice
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:37.160]  meaning that they're going to drive down the standard of living
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:40.840]  they're going to obviously increase the looting rate increase the
[3:13:40.840 --> 3:13:44.360]  rate of primitive accumulation including through taxation of course
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:48.680]  through their lunatic program of cap and trade carbon tax
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:52.040]  and all the rest of this stuff motivated with global warming and i'm sure
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:56.360]  the people up in fargo north dakota where it was 44 degrees below zero
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:13:59.400]  overnight are going to laugh about that the whole upper midwest
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:03.160]  is in the deep freeze the work on calls from all my friends they're just uh i'm
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:04.920]  from the upstate new york and they're like
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:08.120]  dude it's it's negative 15 out right now and you just mentioned a global
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:11.960]  warming and a carbon tax well this week he appointed carl m browner
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:15.960]  as his uh global warming dark yeah i'm sorry carl m browner lunatic she she's
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:19.400]  a a retread from the from the clinton administration but this is a really
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:24.360]  big thing he's saying that uh that he is capable of bringing
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:28.440]  together a bipartisan what that really means is pan oligarchical he's going
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:32.680]  to get finance oligarchs of the left and finance oligarchs of the right
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:36.360]  republican and democratic financiers bankers and so forth
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:40.200]  and he's going to loot uh he's going to reduce the benefits
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:43.480]  he's going to increase the retirement age he's going to increase the uh
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:47.160]  the taxation on these things and it's it's so ironic because
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:51.320]  last night uh under obama's leadership the second round of the tarp
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:55.080]  was essentially approved another 350 billion
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:14:58.840]  and about half of it is already gone because it went to bank of america
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:02.760]  overnight bank of america a bankrupt institution
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:07.400]  bankrupt because of derivatives because of you know uh credit default swaps
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:11.080]  collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles auction
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:14.360]  rate securities uh asset backed securities mortgage
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:17.160]  backed securities all the rest of these crazy derivatives
[3:15:17.160 --> 3:15:20.440]  bank of america is bankrupt everybody knows it now they've been bailed out
[3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:24.600]  once under the first round of the tarp to the tune of 25 billion
[3:15:24.600 --> 3:15:28.760]  now they're getting a second round of 168 billion following city bank right
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:32.200]  city bank had been bailed out once and then had to be bailed out twice
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:36.200]  in november and everybody knows that city bank is about to go under for the
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:41.560]  third time and jp morgan chase uh is going down down down down
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:45.400]  so uh along with union bank of switzerland and all sorts of others that
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:48.920]  operate in the u.s. so this is a disaster
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:53.240]  uh i think obama has dropped the mask today he's talking about renewable
[3:15:53.240 --> 3:15:57.560]  energy and his green jobs well the problem with what he calls renewable
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:02.360]  energy meaning windmills and solar cells and ethanol and other
[3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:05.160]  boondoggles essentially that have to be subsidized
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:10.360]  is that every time you build one it's a net loss for the economy it's a net loss
[3:16:10.360 --> 3:16:12.600]  because the amount of energy you have to put in
[3:16:12.600 --> 3:16:15.960]  to to create some of these things or all of them virtually
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:19.080]  is more than you'll ever get out of it in the entire
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:23.480]  life of the investment so the more you have green jobs
[3:16:23.480 --> 3:16:27.640]  and renewable energy the poorer and more backward you're going to get obama
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:31.480]  today is talking about how countries like spain are ahead of the united states
[3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:34.680]  yeah they're ahead of the united states in the race to the bottom
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:39.240]  because they'll go bankrupt even faster because of their stress on green jobs
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:43.240]  renewable energy global warming and the polar bears so
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:47.480]  you're getting to the point now where human civilization the fabric of human
[3:16:47.480 --> 3:16:51.320]  civilization is at stake and obviously
[3:16:51.320 --> 3:16:55.640]  you can say well um you know let the depression work i suppose there are some
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:58.920]  who say you can't interfere with the depression you have to let it work
[3:16:58.920 --> 3:17:01.560]  itself out you have to hope for creative destruction
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:04.840]  and hope for a recovery on the other side i say that is
[3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:08.760]  that's ridiculous that's absurd and it's also going to get a lot of people killed
[3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:12.520]  we can and must and and can easily fight the depression
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:15.720]  successfully because we know how to do it right we have the examples of the
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:20.040]  1930s 1940s here in the united states you can take the examples that work and the
[3:17:20.040 --> 3:17:24.440]  ones that don't work from the new deal the roosevelt period the labor struggles
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:27.320]  that have to go together with that and you can apply that
[3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:30.840]  to the present time what obama's trying to do though is to is
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:34.840]  is essentially imitating it's it's not very widely known musolini
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:38.680]  musolini in the 1930s after he invaded ethiopia
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:42.200]  but was slapped with oil sanctions by the league of nations so the italian
[3:17:42.200 --> 3:17:47.160]  economy went into autarchy meaning energy independence including ethanol
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:52.040]  that's one of the ways that ethanol was developed was in italy in the late 1930s
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:56.280]  and this of course is a tremendous failure and it makes a society that is
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:18:01.160]  so impoverished and hysterical that you get yourself into wars very easily
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:04.920]  because the dictator has then got to pick pick quarrels with foreign countries
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:08.760]  to uh... somehow unload all of this tension so
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:12.360]  i'm very much afraid we're going into one hundred days to the fascist
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:16.600]  corporate state and it is imperative now to organize
[3:18:16.600 --> 3:18:20.840]  a sophisticated enlightened opposition
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:24.600]  to obama that the problem you have we can go through the the obama cabinet
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:27.320]  right the appointments that he's made some of these are just
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:30.040]  hair-raising i've already mentioned the valker but
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:35.800]  you look at people like geithner and summers and gates and the new dr rice
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:39.240]  and bill packet agriculture and arnie duncan
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:43.880]  and this guy donovan at the uh... at the department of uh...
[3:18:43.880 --> 3:18:46.760]  housing and urban development and uh...
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:51.880]  so on down the line this is the greatest concentration of wall street
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:56.440]  banker influence and power that we've ever seen in the history of the country
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:01.240]  there's nobody at the table except wall street labor counts for nothing
[3:19:01.240 --> 3:19:05.320]  retirees count for nothing women count for nothing black community counts for
[3:19:05.320 --> 3:19:09.000]  nothing hispanic count for nothing asians get nothing
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:12.760]  uh... small business gets nothing heavy industry gets nothing
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:16.280]  uh... the defense contractors get basically nothing big oil gets
[3:19:16.280 --> 3:19:19.240]  virtually nothing auto of course gets nothing
[3:19:19.240 --> 3:19:23.720]  so what you've got is the rain of pure finance here
[3:19:23.720 --> 3:19:26.920]  paperback derivatives merchants in other words
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:30.840]  the people who are now are they're now about to seize power in washington
[3:19:30.840 --> 3:19:35.480]  are the ones behind the one point five quadrillion dollar derivatives bubble and uh...
[3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:39.160]  god help us well they're calling for an
[3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:42.440]  eight hundred and twenty five billion dollar stimulus bill

[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:35.240]  domestic obama force well thank you starbucks the coffee i had was delicious
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:38.920]  and i'm glad that you're pushing fascism it's very nice of you
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:43.400]  so you know this is just another effort uh not only by the media
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:46.680]  uh but to really get the people behind them i mean again
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:51.240]  cover of spider-man the spider-man comic sold out i mean people hoarded it
[3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:55.160]  i can't get a copy for under $80 this is you know a four dollar comic book
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:58.440]  something that probably cost them 30 cents to make on a printing press
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:02.120]  and you know of course he's given the new cool guy bump with spider-man
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:05.560]  he's the real hipster and uh when i saw that you know we played the obama
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:09.160]  youth brigade clip earlier the obama youth brigade clip
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:13.000]  i mean because of obama i could be the next engineer because of obama i could
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  be the next architect well how about pride in yourself why do you need a
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:21.320]  a figure like obama to do these things and now the democrats have proposed an
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:25.800]  825 billion dollar stimulus bill one of many i'm sure i mean
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:29.480]  vernacchi this week came out and said uh they're going to need more bailouts
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:32.120]  paulson from the very beginning said that banks were going to go under no
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:34.840]  matter what happened with these bailouts so
[3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:37.960]  what webster what do you see happening in the next couple months we're six days
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:41.640]  away from the inauguration do you see another bailout bill being passed you
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:43.800]  see the stimulus bill going through
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:46.520]  what's on the agenda the second the second round of the tarp just went
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:49.400]  through last night so the second 350 billion
[3:25:49.400 --> 3:25:53.240]  and that got obama off the hook because bush is now given all that money to
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:57.640]  bank of america uh generally that the tarp is a monstrosity
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:01.640]  and you ought to set up the criterion not one penny more
[3:26:01.640 --> 3:26:05.320]  to banks insurance companies credit card companies
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:09.640]  mutual funds money markets or any other financial institution
[3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:13.480]  they were given the first round of the tarp saying if they got that money they
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:16.520]  would start lending again to business and industry well
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:20.600]  we had general motors ford and chrysler on the verge of bankruptcy
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:24.040]  jp morgan bank of america city bank refused
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:27.720]  to lend to the automobile industry the government had to come in and
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:31.080]  save them which i support you've absolutely got to save
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:34.600]  productive employment industrial assembly lines have got to be kept
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:38.200]  otherwise you're in the third world and the banana republic league and you
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:42.440]  don't get out of it so easily so the main idea is
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:45.320]  stop with the bailout of the derivatives bubble
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:49.560]  it's futile it's hopeless there's not enough money in the world
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:53.800]  to ever bail out 1.5 quadrillion of poisonous
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:27:00.360]  bloated cancerous fictitious bloated uh derivatives which are now the essence
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:04.200]  of the banking system in other words these these banks jp morgan city bank
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:07.320]  and bank of america they're all bankrupt they should be seized
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:10.600]  they shouldn't be demanding money they should be in chapter 11
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:14.280]  and indeed in chapter seven because i think most of them are just hopeless
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:18.840]  economic black holes now on the recovery program or stimulus program i think
[3:27:18.840 --> 3:27:21.800]  there should be one well let's ask ourselves
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:25.080]  should the government fight the depression yeah of course it should
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:29.560]  you damn right it should the question is with obama you've got a combination of
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:33.320]  only bailouts for bankers no money for productive activity
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:38.760]  and then his stimulus is basically green jobs which i talked about before
[3:27:38.760 --> 3:27:42.840]  every green job is a net loss for the economy you get deeper and deeper in
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:47.160]  the depression the more green you want you've got to have
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:51.720]  modern technology probably a hundred nuclear reactors two in each state
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:55.160]  would be the best energy policy you'd want to build a
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:59.320]  transcontinental magnetic levitation railway you'd want to put high speed
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:02.920]  rail commuter systems around the 25 largest
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:06.360]  metropolitan areas either rebuild the ones you have the ones in
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:10.680]  in new york city or a hundred years old or in many places like houston they're
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:13.480]  just there's nothing so you start from scratch
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.360]  so that would be another thing but with obama it's probably green jobs
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:22.520]  again a net loss and then he's got this stuff about community development
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:25.320]  grants now that looks very much like funding
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:29.240]  things like acorn and this fascist infrastructure in other words a
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:34.760]  series of parasitical organizations which are going to be used then to try
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:38.600]  to uh... become a battering ram against other groups in the society
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:42.680]  that may disagree with the way that things are going but the idea is
[3:28:42.680 --> 3:28:45.560]  ultimately this is a deindustrialized country
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:48.920]  the deindustrialization was done under paul adolf volker
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:52.920]  you've got to roll that back you've got to reconvert and reindustrialized
[3:28:52.920 --> 3:28:57.800]  we're looking now very soon at a crisis of the dollar that's obviously the next
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:29:02.200]  step three six months down the line i can't tell when
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:06.200]  but quite soon as this eight to nine trillion ten trillion
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:09.320]  of injected capital begins to work its way through
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:12.840]  you're going to see the dollar begin to fall against the euro and the end it's
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:16.200]  been falling against the end the whole time against the euro it's been
[3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:20.520]  it's been actually increasing and you'll probably and once you realize that the
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:23.240]  foreign value of the dollar is the value of the dollar
[3:29:23.240 --> 3:29:26.600]  you're going to get into dollar hyperinflation so you've got to do
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:31.240]  something about that and that means you've got to earn foreign exchange
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:34.600]  to pay for the imports that you want in other words you won't be able to give
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:38.440]  funny pieces of green paper you're going to have to earn the money or the gold
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:41.640]  it's the alex joneshow we'll be back with webster griffin tarply after this

[3:33:26.200 --> 3:33:29.480]  bush the unauthorized biography either and of course
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:32.760]  obama the postmodern coup you get that over at info wars
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:36.920]  dot com right now i want to shift gears just a little bit
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:40.440]  and talk about whether or not you believe that we'll have military
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:43.160]  conscription under this new administration i mean you've got rama
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:46.280]  manual talking about 18 to 25 everybody
[3:33:46.280 --> 3:33:50.600]  serves three months in basic training and then you're in the military
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:53.880]  we now have uh... charlie wrangled
[3:33:53.880 --> 3:33:57.160]  uh... reintroducing legislation to bring in the draft and then you have
[3:33:57.160 --> 3:34:01.080]  thomas blankly who's been talking about this now for two years
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:04.600]  and uh... you know talked about an msnbc said it wasn't the right time under
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:08.120]  the bush administration they have to wait for a new administration and now
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:11.640]  he released his book american grit this week goes on fox and friends and of
[3:34:11.640 --> 3:34:15.560]  course he doesn't like it but we're just going to need the draft for these
[3:34:15.560 --> 3:34:19.000]  emerging military threats in the middle east and one of those would happen to
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:22.600]  be pakistan and wept so you were the one of the first people to actually talk
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:25.400]  about this pakistani threats so do you think that we will see
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:29.000]  conscription in this country let me say first of all the people who went through
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:32.680]  2008 talking about an attack on iran
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:35.960]  uh... there was no attack on iran they will be no attack on iran and the
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:39.960]  israelis have been told that they're not allowed to attack iran so they've been
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:43.640]  essentially banned from attacking iran i think
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:50.040]  the certainly of a big push towards uh... what amounts to compulsory
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:54.200]  militias compulsory service masquerading as
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:34:57.280]  volunteer service here we have colin powell
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:34:58.880]  wants everybody
[3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:00.040]  to carry out
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:03.760]  volunteer service to celebrate martin luther king day
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:05.140]  i really wonder
[3:35:05.140 --> 3:35:06.360]  whether valker
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:07.480]  geithner
[3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:12.440]  jayme diamond of jp morgan chase blank fine from goldman
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:15.440]  uh... mac over at morgan stanley
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:20.280]  uh... mary summers from the white house i really wonder if if from the manual
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:21.840]  is going to be out there
[3:35:21.840 --> 3:35:26.440]  carrying out volunteer service and i somehow i doubt it and and the military
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:30.720]  side of it is perfectly possible and i think what you see now is a kind of
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:33.240]  gloating in the ruling class
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:34.680]  that they now
[3:35:34.680 --> 3:35:38.440]  have a whole series of options that had been foreclosed during the late bush
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:39.400]  years
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:43.960]  because of the fact that bush was so discredited and so hated and so isolated
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:46.880]  that they couldn't get away with those things and obviously the
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:49.880]  the military draft is one side of it
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:53.000]  and he would he would bring that in under the left cover he'd say
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:56.600]  we have a humanitarian emergency in darfur in sudan
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:35:59.080]  the bernie's government is oppressive
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:02.600]  the pakistanis are are harassing uh... women
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:07.280]  so it would be now a series of invasions conducted under left cover
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:10.360]  rather than under the the worn out discredited
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:11.600]  cliches of
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:14.760]  of nine eleven so i think all that's possible the other obvious possibility
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:15.640]  is the
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:17.080]  fall flag
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.840]  option and remember the famous or infamous speech by
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:23.400]  joe biden in seattle on october nineteen
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:26.880]  is going to be a foreign affairs crisis in the first six months
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:29.640]  it's going to be jimmed up generated fake
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:32.860]  the righteousness of the u.s. position will not be obvious
[3:36:32.860 --> 3:36:34.480]  gotta support parki
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:38.440]  and then the other one the twelve-month perspective that the economic policies
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:42.880]  of the new administration obviously now based on austerity sacrifice lowering
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:44.400]  the standard of living
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:47.760]  wage gouging uh... taking away
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:51.760]  various economic rights under left cover but that would make the whole
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:54.040]  obama team so hated
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:57.360]  that they're standing in the polls will have collapsed within twelve months
[3:36:57.360 --> 3:36:58.560]  which based on the
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:01.680]  on the model of jimmy carter i think is about right and actually i think it will
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:02.320]  even
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:03.600]  even faster
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:06.720]  this time around so they've they've got all of these things
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:09.080]  going and i of course urge people
[3:37:09.080 --> 3:37:13.360]  uh... don't suspend your critical judgment don't don't have your
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:18.200]  you know autonomous uh... judgment of the citizen taken away by this hysteria
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:21.400]  this hype you know the messianic utopian rhetoric
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:25.760]  the uh... the inaugural address will be a tissue of lies and a matter of fact
[3:37:25.760 --> 3:37:29.360]  let me ask people to if you have a chance tomorrow afternoon
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:32.160]  starting uh... it uh... two o'clock eastern
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:35.840]  you can on this same network genesis you can go over to my program the world
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:37.120]  crisis radio
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:41.520]  i recorded just in the past couple of hours a counter inaugural
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:44.400]  counter state of the union where i go through
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:47.520]  uh... an economic recovery program to fight the depression
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:49.320]  a program for world peace
[3:37:49.320 --> 3:37:52.680]  a program of institutional reform just just listen to that and you'll get the
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:53.520]  whole
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:56.800]  lowdown on the way the way that i see things but uh... the important thing
[3:37:56.800 --> 3:37:58.760]  now is to have an opposition
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:00.560]  if obama comes forward with a
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:03.840]  with a bailout of eight hundred and fifty billion it simply will not do to
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:07.520]  stand around in the corner saying i want the free market i want the free market
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:10.920]  it's like saying i want Santa claus the tooth fairy in the easter bunny
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:14.240]  become a big because the stuff just doesn't exist it's nowhere
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:17.800]  to be found in the world we live in a world of monopoly cartels
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:20.000]  trust all the gopoles
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:24.040]  uh... duopoly you name it uh... there's no free market that ever
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:25.880]  really has been in centuries
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:29.400]  uh... if you talk about free market and say you think that the
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:33.080]  the government ought to let the depression take its course
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:36.920]  uh... this basically puts you in a deep freeze it puts you off the political
[3:38:36.920 --> 3:38:37.640]  map
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:41.000]  which you've got to be able to do is have the sophistication to get in there
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:44.480]  and distinguish between the things that obama will have in his programs that a
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:45.240]  good
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:49.000]  and that ought to be in there he'll say more money for food stamps yes
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:50.880]  ten times as much as obama what
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:54.000]  you'll say more money for unemployment benefits fifty two weeks
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.160]  a hundred and four weeks yes
[3:38:56.160 --> 3:38:58.680]  ten times as much as obama what the middle-age
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:01.020]  green jobs and green energy no
[3:39:01.020 --> 3:39:04.960]  benefit community development block grants for acorn no
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  so that you get in there and actually grapple
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:12.240]  with these problems rather than retreating into some ivory tower
[3:39:12.240 --> 3:39:15.800]  uh... of of a world that that that has not existed and certainly does not
[3:39:15.800 --> 3:39:19.200]  exist now you've got to get in there and be able to fight
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:21.880]  point-by-point as as as obama
[3:39:21.880 --> 3:39:24.320]  says right he's got he's got a woman called
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:25.280]  killer for
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:29.720]  medical i suppose she's going to be madame killjoy or madame killer
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:32.080]  killer for is the performance
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:34.560]  officer of the administration
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:37.800]  we can avoid all the obvious talks about that but she the performance of the
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:40.720]  officer is that she's supposed to go through the federal budget
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:44.320]  line by line and find out the things that are not necessary so she's going to
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:45.320]  be the new
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:48.680]  uh... cap the knife right the new uh... austerity
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:50.920]  czar and budget deficit hawk
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:54.280]  and the kind of thing that somebody like this is going to do to medicare and
[3:39:54.280 --> 3:39:56.480]  social security
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:57.760]  and all the other
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:00.360]  you know remnants that we have of our pattern
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:03.480]  social safety that this is going to be an absolute tragedy
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:07.160]  but again you've got to be able to get in there and fight point-by-point
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:08.800]  you've got to get in there and grapple
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:10.320]  and i hope that people will
[3:40:10.320 --> 3:40:13.400]  will join in that right you can see some some ideas for the red act
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:15.640]  independent dot org website
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:20.000]  well going back to uh... you talking about left cover and uh... how we're
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:23.080]  going to you know have this uh... possible conscription
[3:40:23.080 --> 3:40:25.720]  don't you think that he's still using just a little bit of the right cover
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:28.760]  with the war on terry i mean first of all bush and in his uh...
[3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:31.920]  maybe not his farewell speech but his last media appearance he said that
[3:40:31.920 --> 3:40:34.920]  his number one thing was keeping america safe from another terrorist attack
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:35.920]  right that'll be
[3:40:35.920 --> 3:40:39.560]  the number one thing for the obama administration the obama administration
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:43.080]  is already talking about really a redistribution of force
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:46.280]  uh... from iraq of course we're de-escalating there but he says he's
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:48.040]  going to put them into afghanistan
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:51.560]  so i think i'm going to say that the only place in the world
[3:40:51.560 --> 3:40:55.040]  the only place in the world that they still talk about bin laden al-qaeda is
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:40:58.600]  this area where or obama and biden claim that that obama
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:01.640]  that that uh... that bin laden lives remember
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:05.240]  that was the line in an obama's convention speech was uh... bush says
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:07.200]  he'll go to the end of the earth
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:10.920]  to get osama bin laden but he won't go to the cave where he lives meaning let's
[3:41:10.920 --> 3:41:11.960]  invade
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:13.680]  pakistan now
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:16.240]  the other than that you're not going to see
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:17.600]  i don't think you will
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:21.600]  i doubt they're going to claim that bin laden is now living in sudan or berma
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:23.920]  or venezuela or china
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:25.640]  or russia for that matter
[3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:30.880]  uh... the the geography and and locus of confrontation has shifted
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:34.640]  uh... they're going to go after pakistan with the goal of dividing it up right
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:39.120]  remember it's beluchistan push to nistan was iristan
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:42.560]  punjab tribal areas the idea is to shatter it
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:46.320]  into many states right many states microstates regionalism
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:48.000]  and the general model is
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:51.080]  they're against big government they don't like big government the government
[3:41:51.080 --> 3:41:53.680]  is a lot about his big government they don't like it
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:41:57.680]  they want to have many states and above that the empire that's the new
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.320]  model and they have india now as a relatively willing spearpoint
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:04.560]  against that until somebody in india
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:06.040]  does something about it but
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:08.080]  if you look at that that the past six months
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:11.840]  it brzezinski and company have already been dictating policy in other words
[3:42:11.840 --> 3:42:12.680]  bush
[3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:17.000]  ocean cheney left power long ago they have not been calling the shots for at
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:18.280]  least a year
[3:42:18.280 --> 3:42:21.240]  and what that what has happened of course is georgia attacks russia
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:23.080]  straight brzezinski soros
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:24.040]  foreign policy
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:26.640]  ukraine has just cut
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:30.800]  the gas deliveries from russia to europe which i've been predicting for
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:34.120]  but four or five months since since august at least
[3:42:34.120 --> 3:42:38.600]  that there would be a uh... a natural gas crisis created by these nato i m f
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:39.500]  puppets
[3:42:39.500 --> 3:42:41.720]  in kia the ushenko
[3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:44.920]  regime so that they're trying to get that up and then behind that remember is
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:46.080]  the polish
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:50.200]  missile crisis and again that that supposedly got to do with iran
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:53.320]  but i think you're going to see that the that the nine eleven stuff gets to be
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:55.760]  less and less relevant for all areas
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:42:58.120]  other than pakistan which of course is
[3:42:58.120 --> 3:43:01.960]  is important and you're going to get more into this area of great power
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:03.200]  rivalry and i think
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:06.480]  that the great danger is of course that they'll be some new false flag
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:10.100]  that will essentially change the subject in other words it will be
[3:43:10.100 --> 3:43:14.600]  uh... you know bin laden has joined the k gb or bin laden has joined
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:18.000]  the beijing uh... secret police or something and now he's operating for
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:18.960]  them right
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:22.320]  some some you know form of this week the legion of super
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:26.840]  villains or something like this and and and then then try to use that but the
[3:43:26.840 --> 3:43:30.280]  main idea is that you can't muck around in the middle east again the fact that
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:32.640]  there has been no attack on iran
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:36.800]  notice biden went to the israelis and said guess what israelis
[3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:40.280]  there's going to be a nuclear iran and you're going to like it and you're going
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:42.240]  to do nothing
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:45.520]  now with the quality at the beginning of the hour wants to know about about
[3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:46.680]  god of course
[3:43:46.680 --> 3:43:51.880]  it's an orgy of genocide by the israelis and it it has to be stopped
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:53.960]  the one person who could stop it
[3:43:53.960 --> 3:43:57.560]  it's obama obama could simply make a statement i call on the israeli
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:43:59.800]  government to stop what they're doing
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:03.480]  at that point the israeli government probably collapse in the operation would
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:05.920]  would cease notice he doesn't do this
[3:44:05.920 --> 3:44:07.800]  the reason it is that
[3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:11.360]  the the attack on god is a kind of a consolation prize
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:15.000]  for people like zippy livney and they would barak who want to be
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:18.360]  the successors of all but they want to compete with netanyahu
[3:44:18.360 --> 3:44:19.800]  as warmongers
[3:44:19.800 --> 3:44:22.960]  so they've been given this opportunity they're told you know going to kill a
[3:44:22.960 --> 3:44:24.960]  thousand to two thousand people
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:28.640]  and uh... and then you can run on that and you can compete with
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:32.240]  netanyahu because you're not going to be allowed to attack iran and they're
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:35.920]  you know it's a constant flow of news stories that the israelis were pressing
[3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:36.880]  and asking
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:40.720]  and the answer kept being no no no and that came from gates
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:44.360]  it came from mullin and it came from the u.s. administration job because the
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:46.880]  u.s. and the british just don't want this
[3:44:46.880 --> 3:44:47.640]  they want to
[3:44:47.640 --> 3:44:49.320]  look at pakistan
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:51.840]  and again pakistan is an energy corridor
[3:44:51.840 --> 3:44:56.120]  pakistan is the way that iranian oil could go overland to china
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:44:57.440]  pakistan is a way that
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:00.440]  tankers could unload at the port of guadar
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:02.080]  and send oil up
[3:45:02.080 --> 3:45:03.320]  to pakistan
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:05.480]  all the way into china above
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:09.560]  uh... the himalayas above above uh... cashmere and so forth so it's an energy
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:12.200]  corridor pakistan has got to be destroyed
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:16.720]  not because of pakistan but because it's an ally of china and we're now in the
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:18.840]  area of russia china
[3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:22.400]  shanghai cooperation organization that's the new enemies list so
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:26.440]  generally speaking kick the chinese out of africa attack sudan to cut off the
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:27.600]  oil from there
[3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:31.520]  attack zimbabwe somehow to prevent the chinese from getting minerals
[3:45:31.520 --> 3:45:35.600]  from there attack anybody in africa who's dealing with the chinese attack
[3:45:35.600 --> 3:45:39.120]  pakistan attack berma these are all chinese allies
[3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:41.640]  uh... and then ultimately try to play china
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:45.040]  against russia so this is the uh... the perspective that
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:48.720]  that they have and they will need to evolve the ideology because you can't
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:52.240]  you can't come forward sounding like bush cheney neocons you've got to sound
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:45:53.720]  like something
[3:45:53.720 --> 3:45:57.420]  generally speaking i think they'll talk much more about human rights
[3:45:57.420 --> 3:45:59.640]  and uh... and and uh...
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:01.280]  you know genocide
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:03.320]  talk for being a barma
[3:46:03.320 --> 3:46:06.160]  places like this i think that's that's the way of
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:07.760]  of the future
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:10.440]  all right let's uh... let's take some colors in the last fifteen minutes of
[3:46:10.440 --> 3:46:14.040]  the show let's try to keep it on topic and for webster tarpley let us go to
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:15.080]  you
[3:46:15.080 --> 3:46:17.960]  in ohio matt what's on your mind
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:22.200]  hi jason thanks for taking my call and i have a separate hello
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:23.960]  i had a uh... my first
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:25.520]  uh... question was
[3:46:25.520 --> 3:46:29.760]  uh... do you have a uh... which one of your books discusses uh...
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:34.960]  give some groundwork for your economic plan thank you so much thank you if it's
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:37.360]  called the surviving the cataclysm
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:41.600]  in the second edition will come out from progressive press of california
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:42.960]  within a month or two
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:44.160]  uh... or
[3:46:44.160 --> 3:46:45.640]  but something like that we
[3:46:45.640 --> 3:46:49.840]  we meant to do this a year ago but then along came obama and i had to shift into
[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:51.480]  overdrive to try to
[3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:56.120]  warn people about obama at two books in in about five or six
[3:46:56.120 --> 3:46:59.680]  months but there is a second edition now that's practically in the press of
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:01.160]  surviving the cataclysm
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:04.360]  you can send an email to info at progressive press dot com
[3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:07.520]  and get on the list and be informed of this or that i think you can you'll
[3:47:07.520 --> 3:47:09.440]  probably even tell you a uh...
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:13.200]  an electronic version which is going to be a little bit messy but uh...
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:14.960]  it may be the thing and that was it
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:18.240]  the basic story that that was written about ten years ago
[3:47:18.240 --> 3:47:21.880]  and it talks about the industrialization and the derivatives bubble
[3:47:21.880 --> 3:47:26.200]  as leading towards a world economic depression of of unprecedented
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:30.640]  severity and that's that's where we are now so that was ten years before
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:33.800]  okay uh... the reason why i asked is because i'm uh... i'm pretty much a
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:35.840]  free market adherent
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:38.680]  and uh... i've heard you talk about uh...
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:41.920]  and uh... you you have your other radio program about uh...
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:43.840]  uh... a week or two ago and uh...
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:44.600]  right
[3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:48.080]  you didn't you don't seem to really think the free market would work in the
[3:47:48.080 --> 3:47:51.480]  situation so what you know i just kind of wanted to get some of your
[3:47:51.480 --> 3:47:52.340]  fortunately haven't
[3:47:52.340 --> 3:47:55.320]  drink enough for it and i'd be willing to question my
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:47:58.600]  function so i wanted to get some uh...
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:02.240]  you know some groundwork just uh... you know to to look relook at that analysis
[3:48:02.240 --> 3:48:04.920]  uh... will definitely check it out because you know what's again you put
[3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:08.000]  it out there ten years ago and that and right now ten years later is when a
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:11.720]  second edition is warranted and i'm sure you would you have a couple chapters
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:15.160]  basically assure that there's a new economic program is a new
[3:48:15.160 --> 3:48:19.920]  analysis of helicopter ben Bernanke there's a new uh... analysis of of the
[3:48:19.920 --> 3:48:20.720]  the top
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:23.480]  how to how to nationalize the federal reserve
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:26.520]  if you don't have the political power to nationalize at all at once at
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:28.240]  nationalize the fed
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:31.800]  by stages and it would see parts of it and fight from there
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:34.320]  and then use those parts to overcome the other
[3:48:34.320 --> 3:48:37.400]  the other parts the thing about free market is that this is a myth
[3:48:37.400 --> 3:48:39.200]  this does not exist uh...
[3:48:39.200 --> 3:48:42.800]  the nineteenth century generally knew that the subject you talking about is
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:44.760]  political economy in other words
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:48.200]  it's economics and the state economics and the government
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  and the only time that you don't have that
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:54.640]  is if you're in the old story right if you're in the paleolithic hunting and
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:48:57.880]  gathering caveman phase when there's no state
[3:48:57.880 --> 3:49:02.000]  then you could call call that a market i suppose but that's basically
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:06.360]  hunting hunting and gathering since the emergence of the state in any form about
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:11.360]  ten thousand bc right when you go into the neolithic right the new stone age
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:15.160]  then you've already got some kind of a state coming up
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:18.160]  and then you're talking about political economy so the idea that you talk about
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:20.120]  economics is that there's no government
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:22.840]  is crazy all of this goes out of rickardo
[3:49:22.840 --> 3:49:24.440]  the at the founder of
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:27.200]  monitorist economics is david rickardo
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:31.240]  who was on the board of directors of the british east india company and he ran
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:32.040]  opium
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:36.520]  and he ran the monster debt of the british after the napalmianic wars
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:40.600]  and from there it goes on to oxford and then it goes on to vienna
[3:49:40.600 --> 3:49:42.760]  and the various people from vienna you know
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:46.520]  and the thesis of that school is that production is impossible
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:49.840]  that there's no such thing as production that creates something qualitatively
[3:49:49.840 --> 3:49:50.600]  new
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:49:55.000]  in the universe but only rearranging things in space it's a it's a crazy
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:55.880]  thesis
[3:49:55.880 --> 3:49:59.440]  you find that in uh... in for me that's his book of nineteen twelve
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:00.640]  his main uh...
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:02.760]  theoretical uh... treat us so
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:05.760]  uh... what you need is industrial economics and
[3:50:05.760 --> 3:50:09.320]  this is a school that never mentions the word production
[3:50:09.320 --> 3:50:12.200]  they don't talk about production they talk about
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:16.040]  money supply and all the rest of this that it basically it's up in a
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:19.480]  in a never-never land in other words it's profoundly unrealistic
[3:50:19.480 --> 3:50:21.600]  why we should turn
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:25.920]  from the american school of hamilton and lincoln and franklandy roosevelt which
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:26.840]  is the most
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:28.280]  successful in the world
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:32.880]  to the austrian school which is a failure i mean is austria a model of
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:33.960]  economic
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:38.200]  success i i don't think so but america was and could be again

[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:09.520]  final segment of the alex joneshow
[3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:13.840]  yesterday we played a really quick clip of the fx program rescue me where
[3:54:13.840 --> 3:54:19.760]  daniel sinjata big ups to daniel um had a two and a half minute tirade for
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:23.840]  911 truth and it was just awesome well there's a new fx program that
[3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:28.880]  premiered last night called the beast and uh they slander 911 truth in that
[3:54:28.880 --> 3:54:33.200]  uh they have a 911 truth or come on he starts talking a little bit of truth
[3:54:33.200 --> 3:54:37.600]  but then they bring in the wacky no planes cgi planes butter planes theory
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:41.120]  in there and really in this is the guy that i guess the guy is like uh the
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:44.880]  crack smoker on the program he shot himself in the foot while trying to
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:48.560]  play russian roulette so the the major idiot of the program is pro 911
[3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:52.240]  truth in talking ridiculous cgi theories
[3:54:52.240 --> 3:54:56.160]  we have webster griffin tarpley with us and he is the author of barack h obama
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:54:59.600]  the unauthorized biography and of course obama the postmodern coup you can get
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:03.680]  that over at info wars dot com we're gonna fly through your calls right now
[3:55:03.680 --> 3:55:08.800]  for webster griffin tarpley let's go to chad who's out in very cold albany new
[3:55:08.800 --> 3:55:10.800]  york chad what's on your mind
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:15.360]  hey jason how are you good man how you doing good i had two points trying to
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:20.560]  make them quick um brahmanual's plan to make it compulsory to do
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:24.000]  national service whatever that means that would have to be approved by
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:26.720]  congress first they couldn't just backdoor that through an executive
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:31.360]  order right right correct um and the second thing is they have
[3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:36.640]  the votes right they do this although what it really
[3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:41.200]  i wouldn't put it past congress to to pass that because they have the huge
[3:55:41.200 --> 3:55:45.280]  majority now and they worship the ground obama walks on so
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:47.920]  any idea he comes up with must be brilliant right
[3:55:47.920 --> 3:55:51.760]  yeah and the house uh the speaker of the house nancy polosi is a total hawk
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:54.800]  you know she's been in for with this not only the bush administration but this
[3:55:54.800 --> 3:55:58.080]  administration for quite some time she headed up the initial congressional
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:01.200]  investigation she was the lead democrat of nine eleven
[3:56:01.200 --> 3:56:04.400]  and you know polosi is not a good person is she webster
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:08.320]  so she's a monster and she had to be to be out but
[3:56:08.320 --> 3:56:12.400]  remember these these people are totalitarians in the sense that they
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:16.000]  they believe whether they know it or not what they believe in is the musulini
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:20.000]  fascist corporate state and they believe in forms of national mobilization
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:24.160]  such as the so-called voluntary labor service that we saw in then in germany
[3:56:24.160 --> 3:56:29.280]  in the 1930s which was not voluntary at all so the point is
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:32.400]  the ability to get this stuff through is i think
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:36.000]  going to be largely concentrated in a hundred days in other words from
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:40.400]  january 20th to about may 1st you got to try to fight a holding action
[3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:43.440]  if you can stop obama in the hundred days
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:47.760]  after that he will crater as as biden predicted in other words his economics
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:52.320]  will be so unpopular that he'll be hated within a very few months and at that
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:55.520]  point it'll become much harder for him to get this stuff through so what you
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:56:58.960]  want to do ultimately is gridlock gridlock and
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:02.320]  partisanship and stop this stuff from going through
[3:57:02.320 --> 3:57:05.600]  and i urge everybody to mobilize now as you've never mobilized before
[3:57:05.600 --> 3:57:09.680]  between january 20th and may 1st if you can stop some of the most monstrous
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:13.440]  things from going through it'll be harder and harder as time goes on
[3:57:13.440 --> 3:57:17.600]  for obama to get it but you've got to be able to withstand this initial
[3:57:17.600 --> 3:57:21.360]  stormtrooper stuff that's going to be thrown at you with the hysteria that
[3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:25.760]  jason was talking about you know the this this array of products and
[3:57:25.760 --> 3:57:28.960]  you know hero worship personality cultism
[3:57:28.960 --> 3:57:32.480]  you know groupies and all the rest yeah get the obama collector played in the
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:35.760]  obama collector coin i mean they've all got them thank you for the call chat
[3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:40.240]  let's jump to ken in georgia ken last caller what's on your mind

[3:58:04.080 --> 3:58:08.480]  mexico and pakistan collapse and then um

[3:58:12.720 --> 3:58:16.080]  broadcaster taught about the collapse of mexico i got to
[3:58:16.080 --> 3:58:18.960]  let you go just because we're in the last 30 seconds of the program
