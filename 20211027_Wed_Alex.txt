[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  1884 is 1776.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  attacked and threatened.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Because we are effective.

[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  and never give up the fight.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Infowars.com
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Covens in Europe, in America, in Australia and they have one right here.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  That whole bunch. The parties with the singing and the flute and the chanting.
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  Those are espas, they're sabbats.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Read what they do, guy.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  They use blood in their rituals and the blood that has the most power is baby's blood.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  And they don't just use the blood, they use the flesh too.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Rosemary for God's sakes.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  Bloomberg, why is there at least 10 bills I've seen for implantable microchips implanted inside so-called vaccines
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  and vaccine tattoos that are little microchips that are embedded in your skin, microglass that's on the patch then goes into your skin
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  and global blockchain to control the human body and it's all from the UN and it's all from the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill Gates.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  I mean it's all there, you can pull up yourself.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  And then they just always call the bill numbers 666.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  A lot of people are aware of the 666 within Microsoft's pattern to use people's brainwaves to mine cryptocurrencies.
[01:57.000 --> 02:06.000]  Now, we see the number is on the H.R. point 666, COVID-19 testing, reaching and contacting everyone, trace, act.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  Why do we keep seeing the number 666 contained within all these patterns and bill numbers?
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  Is this deliberate?
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  Is this the true sign of the times?
[02:17.000 --> 02:28.000]  And they just fetishize that number to rub it in our face as they bring in a world cashless society that you cannot buy nor sell unless you take whatever the new thing is they're wanting to put in your body.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  They wanted to rub your nose in it.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Here's another one.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  Again, CNBC tweets this Pfizer article.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Pfizer wrote this for Pfizer.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  A COVID-19 vaccine may just be the beginning for the potential revolutionary promise of mRNA technology.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  That's experimental that they just foisted on us and is killing a bunch of people, but that's just the way it is.
[02:49.000 --> 02:49.000]  You're going to take it in your body.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  Now, let's ask ourselves what world we've reached here.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  This is a military globalist assault through the medical system by the central banks to collapse civilization.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Now, let me just show you this little, this little jewel for radio listeners all narrated.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  It's got an image of Scott Gottlieb who is at the FDA and then next to him a Pfizer executive who is him.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  Scott Gottlieb.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  On the left is the former FDA commissioner in charge of regulating Pfizer.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  On the right is a current member of the board of directors of Pfizer making tens of millions a year.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  Can you see that?
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  Here's another one.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  Stephen Hahn.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  Here he is at the FDA.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Here he is at Moderna.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  That means Gates.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  Stephen Hahn.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  On the left is the former FDA commissioner in charge of regulating Moderna.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  On the left is the medical officer of flagship pioneering, the venture capital firm behind Moderna.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  That's Bill Gates.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Oh, it's another one.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  Reuters.
[03:49.000 --> 04:02.000]  Oh, the CEO of Reuters who wrote two articles last week saying that we were making it up that, you know, Fauci cooked it up in a lab, which is all admitted, and that Fauci bragged about we need a new virus to scare everyone into accepting mRNA technology, which he said.
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  Oh, look, James C. Smith on the left is the CEO of Reuters in charge of informing people about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  On the right is a current member of the board of directors of Pfizer, James C. Smith.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Here's another one.
[04:19.000 --> 04:34.000]  Anthony Fauci on the left is the N.I.A.I.D. director under the National Institutes of Health. On the right is the funder of bio weapons research on gain of function back coronavirus is at the Wuhan Institute of virology.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  That's a fact.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  But let me guess, you know the fact checkers said this isn't true.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  It's all true.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  They're lying to you.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  You could verify this in 10 seconds.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Then why would they do that? Because they're training you psychologically to accept their criminal line and then buying the news like they've already done.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  I mean, this is a criminal takeover.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  These men are guilty of war crimes against humanity.
[04:56.000 --> 05:21.000]  They are on the same par as Adolf A. Lewis.
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.000]  I mean, it's got a big dose of the highest quality PQQ and CoQ10 and a bunch of other key ingredients that God gave us their nature that are simply amazing.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  It's 40% off.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  This product has been sold out for six, seven months because the supply came breakdowns because we would not cut the quality of the ingredients.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  We could cut the quality all day and buy crap from China and never be sold out.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  We're not doing that.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  This is the highest rated.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  40% off the sale ends on Monday, 40% off DNA Force Plus and a limited supply of brain force ultra as well.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  It'll be sold out on Monday.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  It's 25% off.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  So support the M4 while getting great products at the same time.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[05:59.000 --> 06:24.000]  My friends, we are now inside the global market.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000]  My friends, we are now inside the globalist trap.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  The extermination of the people of the West is now kicked into high gear.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  It is a psychological warfare operational likes of which humanity has never seen.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's Wednesday, October 27th, 2021.
[06:49.000 --> 07:02.000]  And if we do not break out of our trance and break others out of the trance and get out of the normality they have sunk us into like a hot poisonous bath.
[07:03.000 --> 07:15.000]  Then God will never forgive us for not standing up for the children because now they are coming for our children.
[07:15.000 --> 07:34.000]  The globalist big pharma owned and controlled FDA has basically forced two rounds of top scientists at the CDC and FDA to quit in the last three months, refusing to roll out experimental shots on five and ups.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  In fact, Europe's refused to authorize it because of the high death toll in adults.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  A lot of people draw the line at killing children, including the fictitious Tony Montana in Scarface.
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  But the Joseph Mingolas of the world and other mad scientists like the New Angel of Death, Dr. Fauci enjoy it.
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  They understand that once we allow this to be done to children, the final protections that God has put over the West will be removed.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  They will be green lit metaphysically to take out the majority of humanity.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.000]  Let me as calmly as I can tell you what is in the stacks today.
[08:14.000 --> 08:23.000]  Now, a lot of this we're going to report you've already heard hundreds of times and you've heard it predicted by hundreds of experts on this show that we've either interviewed or played clips from.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Top scientists, top urologists, epidemiologists, pathologists.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  But the first stack is unbelievable.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  It is a lengthy eight page article, a transcript of MPR.
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  From yesterday.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  ERs are now swamped with seriously ill patients, but many don't even have COVID.
[08:52.000 --> 09:02.000]  And nowhere in the article does it mention that they are the double vaxed, though we found local articles saying yes, we're overwhelmed and it's mainly the double vaxed.
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  And then I have the UK saying the same thing, German papers saying the same thing, even Canadian papers where it slips out.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  So here's this article.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  It says we've never seen this many sick people and they even give statistics from national statistics boards.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  They say it's happening all over the country.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  And the people do not have COVID, but wait for it, wait for it.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  You probably guessed what does it say they have?
[09:33.000 --> 09:44.000]  What does it say they have respiratory problems, blood clots, heart conditions, abdominal pain, suicide attempts amongst others.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  Heart attacks, blood clots.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  What did the CDC say in October last year that they were predicting it would cause blood clots and heart swelling and flat out heart attacks?
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  Here's one out of the UK.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Double jab Brits have worst lurchy.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  That means disease ever could actually have COVID without realizing it, even though they're testing negative.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  But it says that the people almost all are double jabbed.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  So at least in this article, they point out they're double jabbed.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  And of course, they're describing huge autoimmune responses, not being able to breathe.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  When they come in contact with a regular coronavirus, the vaccinated that have an autoimmune response, antibody dependent enhancement.
[10:29.000 --> 10:37.000]  The simple definition of ADE is quote raising antibodies that don't protect but actually make a viral infection even worse.
[10:38.000 --> 10:45.000]  And that's why they could never do vaccines for coronaviruses because they tried more than 100 times around the world, including the US government more than 20 times.
[10:45.000 --> 11:06.000]  And every time I play the congressional hearings here, it caused death, death, DEATH, death, death in a large percentage of people, including children they did trials on 15 years ago.
[11:06.000 --> 11:14.000]  So there's another headline, leaky vaccines, enhanced spread of deadlier chicken viruses, yet that's already begun here.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  Marics, disease, and humans is what they're warning of.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  These are all real things I'm talking about.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  So imagine being the MPR, globalist propaganda is at the highest level of this info.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  And they're reporting on the real fact that there's record numbers of illnesses in the hospitals.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  And it's all the side effects of the shot that was predicted, but they won't tell you that ever.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  Their answer is federalize the hospitals and have FEMA take it over, which is already happening with the military.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  It describes hellish conditions in the A-page article.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  Very hard to read, but you know what, I think I'm going to read a large portion of this on here next segment.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  Okay, let me move on from that super gigantic bombshell.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  By the way, I've got hundreds of these articles the last few months. It's all over the world from Israel to Gibraltar to Singapore to the UK to Germany to France.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  The higher the vaccinated area with these franken shots, the higher the hospitalization, the higher the death rates.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  And I even got the BBC going, well, you're twice as likely to get COVID if you've had the vaccine, but it's mild.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  I thought a vaccine makes it where you don't get something, period. You can't replicate it.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  But see, oh, this isn't a vaccine. It's a gene therapy. Oh, oh, oh, oh, you knew it was coming.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  Remember, you had all those FDA scientists, including the number one and number two quit a couple months ago,
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  saying that we should not have further injections of these mRNA shots.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  They said there's already problems with it. This was never approved.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  England has the UK and yellow slipped it, saying pull it, but they didn't.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  But the main advisory group over there five months ago said we need to pull these shots.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Remember, they started about four months before us, so they're right.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  We're three or four or five months ahead of them.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  So months and months ahead of us, they already come to the same conclusion you need to pull this.
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  And in the UK, they were smart. They didn't say resign. They just said we no longer listen to that national board that's statutorily in place.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  So what did they announce?
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  Well, they announced a few months ago, the head of the FDA, not her advisory board,
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  the lady that legalized OxyContin and fentanyl here in the United States.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  That monster, she legalized it for children, by the way, in the case of OxyContin.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  OxyContin, that death sentence.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  What did I say they'd do in a few months? Well, they just came out and said fourth shots now.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  So the board resigned, they quit.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  The boards voted against third jab, said it's going to hurt people.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  And they just said, we'll take your resignation.
[13:54.000 --> 14:03.000]  And now the actual big pharma heads directly call the shots and go on TV and say we don't care what government advisors say.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  We don't care what the boards say. We're just going to go ahead with all of this.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  So they've now announced a fourth injection.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  CDC says EMU compromised people can get fourth COVID shot.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Isn't that funny? Because it erases your immune system.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  So now they say you can get more of those shots.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And remember what the head spokesman doctor of the British main ministry said is six months ago bragged.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Oh, we already know the Pfizer shot erases your immune system.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  So people are going to need shots 10 times a year.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  They're already up to saying you're going to need five shots a year in Australia.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Now they're up to four shots a year here.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  Israel's up to five shots.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  But that's not even the big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  You know, adults want to buy into the lie or go in and take a deadly poison.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  It's illegal. It's happening. It's criminal. It's wrong.
[14:56.000 --> 15:08.000]  But it doesn't cross the final Rubicon line in my heart and soul where this morning, I mean, I could feel the spirit of God just ordering me to do what it takes to stop this and saying you will stop it or it's on you.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  And I don't like that, that, that, that super strong conscience.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  God working through that telling me that I'm thinking, yes, sir, I'm okay. What do I do?
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  And we're going to have a discussion about this. What are you going to do?
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  FDA panel backs Pfizer shots for children as young as five.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  We're never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  Wow, even admitting it's untested.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  And then the test on children, they've now started.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  They're causing a lot of illnesses and deaths.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Then they cover those up and suppress those.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  But there's a bigger issue here.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  This means mandatory shots for five and up for school for going anywhere.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  So they're now coming at your children with an experimental deadly shot, not just linked,
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  but shown to cause heart attacks, autoimmune disorders, ADE.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  So this is like people coming with a butcher knife at your child.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  They, they want to start a fight. That's their plan.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  They're trying to force a civil war.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  If you're concerned about the.
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  I am taping this update on the morning of Friday, October 22, 2021.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Listeners who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects of autoimmune
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  should be excited to know that we've got a limited supply of it in stock,
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  but it'll be sold out at current sales rates by Monday morning.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  Despite that fact, we're still offering a major discount of 25% off.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  It is an amazing, new tropic.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.000]  I went to one of the top labs in the country and I said,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  I want very powerful, quick acting, extremely clean, new tropic that wears off quick
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  because I want to be able to take it.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  If I've got to work on it.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  At night, take it at seven and for it to wear off by 10.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  And that's exactly what they did with brain force ultra.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Now we have other great products like turbo force that last for 10 hours.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  It's a different formula.
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  It's over the top powerful.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  So strong.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  I can't even take it.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  By the way, it's sold out right now.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  The brain force ultra is really something special.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  It's 25% off limited supply.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  We'll sell out early next week.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Info or store.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.000]  Why do the globalists take you so much?
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.000]  Why do they hate America so much?
[17:05.000 --> 17:12.000]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot go exist with.
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  It's very, very simple for their world government, their anti-human, post-human eugenics system to flourish.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  Freedom and liberty and due process injustice and God fearing systems must fail.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  They started a fight with you.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  They're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  And it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  It is specifically designed to establish healthy waste tanks and pits.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  BioPortaPro, Digest Grease, Fats, Oil, Sludge, Paper and Organic Matter with ease.
[18:31.000 --> 18:38.000]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for all portable restrooms, porta-potties, outhouses and pit toilets.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  It is also human and animal safe.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  Just pour and flush, it's that simple.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup and odor, guarantee.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Visit theBioPros.com and see for yourself.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[19:51.000 --> 20:13.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  Remember, you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing, you'll like it, you'll drink sewage water and eat river plants.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  Bill Gates says that you're going to get used to eating soybeans and getting used to the flavor.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  He's the biggest owner of farmland in the U.S.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  He's converting it from a beef production to soybean.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  The type of soybean he puts out through his holdings in Monsanto into McDonald's is the whole soybean.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  You know, soybean is fine if it's just the outside of the soybean,
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  but if you put the center of the soybean in, it's very toxic levels of estrogen.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  And then that gives women massive cancers and also feminizes men and then gives men cancer as well.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  So it's all about the chemical biological attack on humanity.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  They're not just hitting us through the poison shots,
[21:09.000 --> 21:18.000]  but they want the poison shots to be able to then bring in the world ID that is tied to the carbon tax and the social credit score.
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.000]  And then again, once your immune systems are raised, they will simply say, oh, you're sick and dying because of the unvaccinated.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  But then when it's heart attacks and blood clots and the lungs filling up with fluid,
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  they just say, oh, we don't know what it is and it's a big mystery.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  I'm going to be reading that report next segment and going over it.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  But do you understand we just can't get normalized to this information?
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  That's why they've been talking about giving our children these experimental shots for 20 months before they even had them ready.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  Of course, they really secretly already did have the developments come out.
[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  So you just get so sick of hearing about, hey, the FDA panel, the third one they had to put in charge with a bunch of big pharma heads on it now.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  They took the scientists off and put the executives on it, just voted.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  It wasn't unanimous, but it was the majority to start shooting five-year-olds up.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  And so now Biden will announce it as he promised to do months ago on Halloween.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  It's all a big in-your-face operation.
[22:20.000 --> 22:31.000]  So think about that and think about how huge that is that what they're really saying is your five-year-olds to go to school or to go on a plane or anywhere.
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  That's what they're taking us is they have to have this shot that erases their immune system for general problems,
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  but then heightens your immune system for any type of virus similar to COVID, which is a coronavirus.
[22:45.000 --> 22:53.000]  So they've already done the studies and the tests in the last year on children two and up with these sick leftist parents that are doing this,
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  that worship the states in the form of human sacrifice.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  But most of them just have Stockholm syndrome.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  But now they're going to try to force you to do it.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  So this is a real line in the sand they're crossing.
[23:08.000 --> 23:17.000]  And I'm just wondering how much we're going to put up with as a society and as a civilization because this is war.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  We confirmed with all these different studies and reports and even the advisories they've got to put on these shots.
[23:24.000 --> 23:34.000]  Now they can cause a raft of serious cardiovascular issues, heart swelling, flat-out heart attacks, death, and there it is.
[23:34.000 --> 23:42.000]  And then yesterday, Dr. Fleming and his big medical report and study put out with other scientists under the microscope
[23:43.000 --> 23:52.000]  showing that it takes oxygenated blood and destroys the hemoglobin when you put the Pfizer vaccine in with fresh blood in vitro.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  Anybody that knows about blood, it's very hard to get oxygenated blood to change its color.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  So this is doing a big, big, big, big, big disservice to everybody.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  And now we know why people that have taken the shots are having so much trouble breathing.
[24:06.000 --> 24:13.000]  It's because when it gets into a capillary that gets into an artery or vein, it then really triggers a chain reaction in your body.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  And a lot of people drop dead around the world here in the U.S. as well within 30 minutes of taking these shots.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  They fall down, they have a convulsion because it gets into an artery or vein and then it clocks up and then it hits the brain
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  or the lungs of the heart and it is bye-bye.
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  It is time to go six feet under for a long dirt nap.
[24:39.000 --> 24:47.000]  We don't just have all the documents of the science and the background and the pathology national board of Germany coming out and saying this five months ago.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Everyone I know has family that's dead or died after the shot.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  Everybody I know knows young people that took it and got either paralyzed or had heart swelling.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  Everybody I know.
[25:00.000 --> 25:16.000]  In fact, I was talking to a family member who has a really good friend whose sister's boyfriend who's 22 years old died in Florida two weeks after it had the shot.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And then they know another person that's died and then another and another.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  I mean, it's just, I was just hearing about that yesterday.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  And they even said, yeah, it looks like the vaccine killed them.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  The doctors know this, but it's not just Alex Jones up here anecdotally telling you this or what you see in your own life.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  This is the report right here that I'm getting to next segment.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  ERs are now swamped with seriously ill patients, but many don't have COVID.
[25:48.000 --> 25:57.000]  Is this the worst it's ever been? They've got national numbers on it and they say it's heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, and of course the other list of things.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  The FDA and CDC quietly predicted it would indeed be doing.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  And now they're coming after the children and then we've got the UK with the seminal numbers.
[26:07.000 --> 26:18.000]  Oh, and now, oh, sorry, fully vaxed. This is the third shot the FDA says and the CDC says. No, no, no, it's a fourth shot.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  Wow. So they're adding about a shot every couple months now.
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.000]  So I guess in a year we'll be up to seven, eight, nine, 10 shots, which is what Gates Moderna Prospectus about 18 months ago said.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  They said, oh, we'll be getting a lot of boosters every year up to 10.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  You see, because this erases your immune system and so they're going to say, oh, you're sick, you need more.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  Kind of like a person's drowning, you just say, well, let's tie a couple bowling balls to your legs.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  Or how about some cement buckets, some cement shoes? That'll help you swim the English Channel.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  We're going to go to break. We're going to come back and get into all this huge, massive news.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  You've seen food prices explode as we told you they would 20 months ago. That's a plan of the great reset.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  You've seen supply chains break down. That's all part of the globalist operation.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  And we just got word that our great supplier that had waited a long time to do this.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Other suppliers have gone up five or six times the last couple of years.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  They only went up a little bit a few years ago.
[27:18.000 --> 27:26.000]  But my Patriot supply is going to be forced to go up across the board some on all of their high-quality, storeable foods on November 15th.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  So the prices will go up some at infowarstore.com and preparewithalix.com.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  It takes you right to the subpage, the infowarstore.com, preparewithalix.com.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  And so I wouldn't wait. They got the food ready, fresh, packed, hundreds of different types of foods, specialty diets, stuff last decades.
[27:44.000 --> 27:52.000]  It's in big sealed plastic, you know, tote containers that would cost a lot of money at the store by themselves.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  And then they have sealed plastic pouches inside that are super strong.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  I mean, this is high-quality food, incredibly well packaged because that's very important.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  It's fresh and it's ready to ship to you right now.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And your purchase keeps the show on the air.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  The only way I see are going to fail is not getting a three-month bug out pack, not getting a six-month, not getting a year,
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  and not just having that, just looking at firearms and water filtration as a reserve.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  So preparewithalix.com.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  We have the Alexa Pure water filtration systems that are the highest rated.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  At about half the price you'll pay for leading competitors that are just as good in the rating service.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  And there's only, there's probably 100 gravity-fed filters. We're in the top three.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  And so, again, for the price, you can't get something better.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  So that's their air filtration, water filtration, all that.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  But the same folks that bring in my Patriot supply at infowarstore.com,
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  preparewithalix.com, I would get prepared now.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's how you beat inflation is to get that food and hold on to it.
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  And then down the road, well, it's going to go up faster than the price of real estate here in this hyperinflationary system.
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  Hey, everybody, Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday, October 22nd, 2021,
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  with a very important update for supporters of InfoWars.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  Several of our best-selling products are back in stock, limited supplies,
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  and are 40 to 50% off, like DNA Force Plus.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  That is 40% off right now.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  And that sale is going to have to end on Monday.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  It helps your telomeres. It helps your very cells, engines, the mitochondria.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10. It really is incredible.
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  It's 40% off. Some of the best-selling products are 50% off as well.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  And we got a very limited supply, very limited run in,
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  because I told the manufacturer whatever ingredients you can get whenever you have enough to make some,
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  even if it's a smaller run, do it.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  If you've got a very small run into the product that's been sold out,
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  and that is RainForce Ultra, it's 25% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  It's going to end up selling out on Monday as well at current sales rates.
[29:56.000 --> 29:58.000]  So get great products to support the M4 at infowarstore.com.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  It's all come out.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  and we are powerful.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  Is it true?
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  because they know we are strong.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  And in that documentary I predicted the globalists would establish world government of releasing a virus,
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns,
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  And now they've done it.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  How did I know they would do it?
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.000]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab.
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  And our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset.
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  Well, we're now living in it.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world,
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  not attached to the tyrannical corporate world government,
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  the total censorship, no due process,
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  the structure of the family,
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass-creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  This is what Info Wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[32:20.000 --> 32:25.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,

[33:18.000 --> 33:28.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:39.000]  Coming up today, Mike Lindell will give us an update on his ongoing election fraud investigation at 1230 Central.
[33:39.000 --> 33:48.000]  Leah Mathis, who's an amazing talk show host and really exposing the whole COVID fraud like none other, very eloquent will be popping in.
[33:49.000 --> 33:58.000]  Darren J. Beatty, who's been on Tucker a lot with Revolver News, spearheading investigations into the federal provocateur action on January 6th.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  He'll be joining us. And then of course, Roger Stone's got huge news dealing with election fraud and Trump and the future of the Republican Party.
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.000]  He's loaded for bear. I'll be hosting the fourth hour today with Roger Stone.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  Alright, let me just calm down again because the show tends to speed by and we have a lot of new listeners tuned in.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  And I want them to understand something. You're not going to be able to navigate what's about to happen.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  This isn't something where the globalists just do something and you kind of try to get around it and then, you know, it goes away.
[34:33.000 --> 34:41.000]  This is a complete post-industrial world and I don't think people know what a post-industrial world means.
[34:42.000 --> 34:51.000]  So when I start the next hour, I'm going to play Bill Gates on TV yet again saying no one should be allowed to have meat in the United States, period.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  He makes it a class thing saying we should give it all to the Africans.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  Yeah, he's not going to give the Africans anything but death.
[34:59.000 --> 35:09.000]  And so that's what they do is put a black face on the New World Order as their camouflage.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  So it's very, very, very, very simple.
[35:14.000 --> 35:22.000]  That's the cover of my film, The Obama Deception, that was seen more than 40 million times online thanks to you spreading it, still on YouTube free.
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  But in The Obama Deception, the cover of the film is a white guy, a corporate executive with a black face of Obama.
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.000]  He's holding up and that's the whole premise of the film is the globalists hate everybody or attacking everybody, but they're using racial politics to control us.
[35:38.000 --> 35:51.000]  So I thought I'd explain what really zero carbon means because Bill Gates is against organic farming because it uses cow manure on it and just anything from an animal or a plant is bad.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  I'm going to show you articles where environmental groups call for cutting down trees.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  That's the headline.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  Environmental groups call for cutting down trees and burying them to stop carbon.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  Trees are bad, see?
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  Well, if you want a new atmosphere on the earth, yeah, that's exactly what you would want.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  So Bill Gates wants us all to eat 100% synthetic beef.
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  He has a point, says Yahoo News.
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.000]  That's coming up for the future of farming according to Bill Gates and let's cut down the trees.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  Now, let's shift into the big news here.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  This is all global.
[36:29.000 --> 36:37.000]  And so in Australia and in France and in the UK, there are articles everywhere about the schools injecting children.
[36:38.000 --> 36:50.000]  Even though the government hasn't authorized under 16s, even their own regulatory agencies couldn't be made to do it by big pharma show the politicians are just doing it to people even in elementary school.
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  And that's coming out in the news.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  It's the same thing in China.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  It's not the law, but now they're just doing it.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  Big article from zero hedge up on info wars.com.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  China begins forcing jabs on children as young as three.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  And again, has nothing to do with protecting people.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  It's about normalizing standardized martial law worldwide under medical training.
[37:17.000 --> 37:26.000]  They're building central isolation sites with local authorities required by the end of October to create facilities of not less than 20 rooms per 10,000 people.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  The second the scale of each isolation site.
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  I see more than 100 rooms that goes into setting up the emergency centers all over their country to then forcibly hold people and inject them.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  This is right out of Bloomberg.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  This is all of it right here.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  So you need to understand this is a global UN run plan.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  Here it is in the United States.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  FDA panel backs Pfizer shots for kids.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  We've never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Never going to learn how safe it is unless we start giving it.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  We're never going to learn if this cancer drug kills things or not or helps them unless we test it on rats and guinea pigs.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  The PETA says don't do that.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  And so instead we're now going to do it to children as guinea pigs.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Dr. Rubin.
[38:24.000 --> 38:37.000]  Another one of these corporate Borg here literally coming at everybody with a chemical slash bio weapon that on record turns off your white blood cells and gives you blood clots.
[38:38.000 --> 38:38.000]  Here it is.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  And I think what toys me here is that is a very sort of personal choice.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  If I had a child who had a transplant recipient, I would really want to be able to use a vaccine like this.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  And there are certainly kids who probably should be vaccinated.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  The question of how broadly we use it though, I think is a substantial one.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  And I know it's not our question.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  And I know we're kind of pumping that to ACIP.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  But I do think that it's a relatively close call.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  And as Dr. Levy just said, as Dr. Ganz said, it really is going to be a question of what the prevailing conditions are.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless you start giving us.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  That's just the way it goes.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  That's how we found out about rare complications of other vaccines like the rotavirus vaccine.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  And I do think that we are going to, I do think we should vote to approve it.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  Okay, so vote to approve it.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  We don't know what it does.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  Covering his ass right there, but we do know what it does.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  And I'll cover that next segment.
[39:48.000 --> 39:48.000]  It's right here.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  ERs are now swamped with seriously ill patients at the record level, highest ever in the country.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  NPR reports with blood clots, heart attacks and strokes, including teenagers.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  And they don't know why they say in the article, we don't know why people 15, 16 are having heart attacks.
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  We've never seen this before.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  The hospital's full of young people having heart attacks.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  I'm going to read this to you.
[40:08.000 --> 40:21.000]  If you like, if somebody handed out shotguns with slugs in it and a bunch of people got shot by shotguns and slugs, and then they were on the news thing, we don't know why people got big bloody holes in them.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  They're getting shot with shotguns, getting shot with this garbage.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  And just a few months ago, it was all a third shot.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  Now it's a fourth shot today.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Because they've gotten rid of all the regulators that wouldn't do it.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  And now they're getting rid of the cops that won't take the shot.
[40:40.000 --> 40:48.000]  And firefighters and nurses, they're getting an army of people that will sit there and watch this death in destruction and act like it's not happening and even hurt themselves in the process.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  Oh, but FEMA is exempt from the shots.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  That's confirmed.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  So you lose your job as a nurse because you won't take it, but then the FEMA comes to take your job.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  Why is that?
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  Because they wanted to get you out of the way and set that precedent.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  All right.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  Again, I was up here late last night.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  I'm not complaining.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  You can't get me out of here.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  There's so much news and so much to cover.
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  But I have failed again.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  And that's your to your benefit.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  I have not come up with a new sale.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  And we have a sale coming up soon.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  I haven't got the ads for that.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  I just haven't been doing it.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  So one more day and then this has got to be it.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  This has got to be the last day.
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.000]  You can get DNA force plus that's so good for your telomeres and your cells, your mitochondria, the PQQ and CoQ 10 and so much more for 40% off.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  And you can get brain force ultra that's selling out today will be probably the last day.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And it is at 25% off at infoarstore.com.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  And we'll have one more week of bodies.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Ultimate turmeric frontal has been sold out for six, seven months or longer.
[41:52.000 --> 41:58.000]  It's back in stock so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, so good for your whole body.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  And this is 95% of humanoid leading competitors that you buy at the store that work pretty good by the way or 5%.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  The leading competitor is 70 plus percent of humanoid.
[42:08.000 --> 42:15.000]  We know because they make this and we paid them even more to make the highest for humanoid concentrate that they could make.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  And then this is all tested by outside labs.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  This is all done highest grade folks.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  It's like our krill oil and fish oil is the highest grade.
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.000]  It costs us like five times the regular fish oil and krill oil that they rip you off for and sell you for the same price.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  So we sell you this stuff at the same price that watered down stuff is sold to you, but this is not watered down.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  This is concentrated.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  It's your last week on this.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  We'll be doing that for another week.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  It's 40% off infoarstore.com.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  Oh, but by the way, there's a silver lining here.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  You can go to 50%off.com.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  That's one word.
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  50%off.com and get DNA force for 50% off even though it's about to go off sale and DNA force.
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  Info war.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  You're listening to this message in the weekend of Friday, October 22 2021.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  This is your last chance to get some of our best selling amazing products at infowarstore.com before they sell out like DNA force.
[43:13.000 --> 43:21.000]  Plus, it is the ultimate formula out there for strengthening your telomeres and the very engines of your cells.
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  I mean, it's got a big dose of the highest quality PQQ and CoQ10 and a bunch of other key ingredients that God gave us their nature that are simply amazing.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  It gets 40% off.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  This product has been sold out for six, seven months because of supply chain breakdowns because we would not cut the quality of the ingredients.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  We could cut the quality all day and buy crap from China and never be sold out.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  We're not doing that.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  This is the highest rated.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  It's 40% off.
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  The sale ends on Monday.
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  40% off DNA force plus and unlimited supply.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  A brain force ultra as well.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.000]  It'll be sold out on Monday.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  It's 25% off.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  So support the M4 while getting great products at the same time.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  Thanks to all of your support, infowarstore.com.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  Jacob in Ohio.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  Welcome.
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[44:17.000 --> 44:18.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  Alright, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  The XQ does wonders.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  I recommend it to everybody.
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.000]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  Get the product. Support the infowar.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  I mean, you're on the air. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  Honored talk to you.
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  Awesome.
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was to say I love the products.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  So just number one for a few of you.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Absolutely.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  hive mind in less than nine years.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  we know this is all really happening
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  And so we must prepare,
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds,
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  at infoorstore.com.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.000]  And because they couldn't take our guns,
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  and because we wouldn't bow,
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  because the left, which is the ideology
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  of this world government system,
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  couldn't win.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  Now we know, two years ago,
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  It's that simple.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19,
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  and you know the rest is history.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  Expose this paradigm, and we win.
[46:58.000 --> 47:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  I've got my ass together,
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  I'm gonna walk on all those.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  You know, give me back my bullets.
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.000]  Oh, ho, ho, yeah.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  What am I for the love?
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  Because I'm done messing around.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Now this ain't fooling around,
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  because I'm done had my fun.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'm done had my fun.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  Ain't gon' see no more damage done.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Give me back my bullets.
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  Give me back my bullets.
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  So they're coming after our children
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  with a deadly injection,
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  and all over the world,
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  from Canada to the United States,
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  to Australia to Germany,
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  they say, oh, we have ice cream trucks
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.000]  that go to the local parks
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  and the local recreational areas,
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  and we offer the children shots
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  as young as eight years of age
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  without parental consent,
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  even though there's no law.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  You're like, that's pretty bold.
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  Oh, like sending convicted pedophiles
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  all over the world,
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  funded literally by George Soros' money,
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  to have your children sit on their laps,
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  many times unannounced.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  It's called a war.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  A war is when an enemy attacks you
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  and doesn't care.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  And the hospitals are full
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  at record numbers across the United States,
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  NPR admits.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  It's the same thing in the UK,
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  same thing in Canada,
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  same thing in New Zealand and Australia.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  I look at the news all day.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  They're like, our hospitals are full
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  of people, can't breathe,
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  having heart attacks and strokes,
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  and nowhere, not in New Zealand,
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  not in Australia, not in Germany,
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  not in the US, do they go,
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  hey, we noticed they've all been injected
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  except the UK did.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  I got a bunch of articles.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  The UK has some of the most accurate
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  evidence of increase in cancers
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  and heart attacks and blood clots
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  and it's in the double jab
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  and they got this new allergy
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  with disease where their lungs
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  just fill up with water,
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  but they don't have COVID.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Yeah, they got A-D-E.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  What do all the scientists on this show
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  say would happen when you get
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  a regular cold virus in your lungs
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  and you've been injected with this mRNA?
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  Your body's gonna flip out
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  and create a bunch of antibodies,
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  I was a big outdoors guy.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  Wasps, bees, yeah, you count those
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  probably 30, 40 times.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  Gala jackets, red wasp, you name it,
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  honeybees, but I finally got stung
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  when I was 20 years old.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Claren Land, my parents had bought
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  the middle Austin.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  I was out there hand shredding it
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  and cutting it down and tilling
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  up everything when they wanted to
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  put a garden and I got stung
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  about 20 times.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  It was like a movie, they chased me
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  all those stingers out of my head
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  and boy, I swole up red.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  I had to take a bunch of medicine
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  to try to stop it.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  Got in the shower,
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  put a bunch of baking soda on my head
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  and the swelling went down and I didn't die.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  But then I got stung about 10 years
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  later and swole up just as bad
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  with one bee sting.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  That's how it works and that's
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  basically a dumb analogy,
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  but to compare what A-D-E does.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  A-D-E relaxes, folks.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  ERs are now swamped with seriously
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  ill patients, but many don't even
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  have COVID.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  It's the sickest they've ever seen.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  I'm going to read this to you in a
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  moment, but first, there's a clip
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  of this happening yesterday and
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  now they've confirmed it and
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  admitted it and the school in
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  Louisiana is saying,
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  we don't care.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  So they gave it to your son
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  without your consent
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  and now they're going to try to
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  make you down to age five.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  As soon as the FDA says you
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  give the experimental shot to a
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  child, which are now voted on
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  their panel to do.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  So again, Biden's going to announce
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  it on Halloween.
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  He said months ago he would.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  They love the F666 and their bills
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  and to do stuff on Halloween.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  Remember they filed impeachment
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  on Trump last Halloween.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  It was like 100 years ago, didn't it?
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  They're going to change because
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  we're under attack and they're
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  getting us used to collapsing
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  borders, collapsing dollar,
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  collapsing supply chain.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  They're just training us until
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  race riots and gun confiscation
[51:49.000 --> 51:50.000]  and just being locked up in your
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  houses and new viruses being
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  released.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  We're being set up for the fall.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  We're in the fall right now and
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  sure people are waking up that
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  it's Biden, but they'll just remove
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  it.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  They're going to do it again.
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  Goldman Sachs, they all did this.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  They run the show.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  I'll show you that next hour.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  Got a big stack on that.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  I'm loaded for bear.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  But here's mom to sue school
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  after some vaccine without
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  consent, but they don't care.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  WLTV reports the full reports
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  incredible, but here's part of
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  A mom from Kenner may soon be
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  able to get a vaccine without
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  her consent when an auctioner
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  mobile vaccination clinic rolled
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  in and allowed him to sign the
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  consent form himself underage.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  An attorney for Reveign called
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  the situation a nightmare and
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  claims other underage students
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  got the shot to writing to I
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  witness news, quote, the egregious
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  and reckless actions of auctioner
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  and East Jefferson High School
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  went well beyond any legal and
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  moral bounds and at a minimum
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  of two percent.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  She's exploring every avenue to
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  hold auctioner and the district
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  accountable.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  As outlined by the Louisiana
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Department of Health, a parent
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  signature is required for anyone
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  under 18 who wants the shot.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Auctioner Health System
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  apologized for the misstep at
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  East Jeff and says it's revising
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  its school vaccination program,
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  writing, quote, we have procedures
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.000]  in place to ensure that all
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  these policies will be strictly
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  enforced moving forward.
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  Jefferson Parish Public Schools
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  did not respond to multiple requests
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  to answer questions or comment,
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  but may soon have to answer to
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  Reveign's attorney, Devin Bartolotta
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  I witness news.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  and it's a policy.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  No, it's the law and they passed
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  along California to give abortions
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  and vaccinations 12 and up without
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  parental consent.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  This is being done all over the
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  world with ice cream trucks where
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  you get an ice cream.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  I'm not joking or a twenty
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  dollar to a hundred dollar gift
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  card when you take the shot.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  Look it up.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  Man, this is just like drug dealers
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  giving somebody their first crack
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  or their first heroin or their
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  first ecstasy or their first LSD.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  I mean, this is seriously
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  criminal,
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  seriously criminal.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  The big death penalties they had
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  in ancient Greece that even a few
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  famous philosophers got killed for
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  was called corrupting the youth
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  because it was up to parents until
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  somebody left the house to tell them
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  how they should live and what they
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  should do.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  And if they caught anybody, including
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  a teacher, teaching things that were
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  against what the customs were,
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  they were taken to a cliff and thrown
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  off of a cliff.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  That was the execution for that.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  Look at famous Greek philosophers
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  executed for corrupting the youth.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  Some very famous ones did.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  A lot of them had to drink poison.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  He said, can I just drink poison
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  instead of be thrown off the cliff?
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  They said, yeah, you drink poison.
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.000]  You're so famous.
[55:05.000 --> 55:06.000]  He's one of the most famous.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  Everybody know his name?
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  Everybody know his name?
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  We'll get to that later.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  Nobody cares if I say that.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Everybody will go running around
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  by the school or hurt them.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  Don't do anything violent.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  I'm saying they're violently coming
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  at you with an experimental shot.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  They're violating the Nuremberg code.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  You got antibody dependency enhancement
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  happening all over the damn world.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  How many experts do we have on?
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  That's a video we should put out is
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  get on a bunch of the medical doctors
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  we've had from the past.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  Take a few clips of them saying,
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  and Mike Adams said it a bunch or two
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  20 months ago, 18 months ago,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  saying by this winter,
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  you'll see massive hospitals full
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  with people with ADE.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  And they'll all play dumb and say,
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  we don't know why you're having
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  heart attacks and strokes and blood
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  clots.
[55:58.000 --> 55:59.000]  And then right here I got MPR saying
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  we've got national statistics.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  This breaks any record by 20%.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  These ERs have never seen so many
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  people.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  They're piled up outside with heart
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  attacks and with heart swelling
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000] .
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  ERs are now swamped with seriously
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  ill patients, but many don't even
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  have COVID.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Maybe it's more powerful if I play
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  it from them.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  Yeah, grab the audio.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  Got a lot of guests on today, but
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  look, if you don't go read this
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  article, you're nuts.
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.000]  Okay.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  And again, I got a stack of news
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  here from Australia, the UK,
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  Canada.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  You know only, let me see,
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  25 European countries get the
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  Pfizer Moderna garbage.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  And then you got the UK, there's
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  three countries.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  Well, there's more than that.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  There's other countries, part of
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  it, Protectorates and Commonwealths.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  But you've got less than a third of
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  the world population that is being
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  given these.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  And it's all former Christian
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  nations, former free market nations.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  We are literally having our population
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  wipe out every city on the planet
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  when they launch their takeover.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  Everybody watches that incredibly
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  well done movie and you see it
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  like, wow, this is amazing.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  This is being done through the
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  injections.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  Remember that meme I showed you on
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  Monday, the history of warfare
[57:25.000 --> 57:26.000]  starts with a rock, then it's a
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  spear, then it's an arrow, then
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  it's a 308 round.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  And then it's an injector with
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  COVID-19 vaccine.
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.000]  The Bill Gates stuff is just over
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  the top, all over the news.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  We've got a man beef.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  He's like, oh, they'll never do
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  that. They'll never do force
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  inoculations either. They'll never
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  come after our kids. They are.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  This is war. This is war.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  This is war.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  Alex Jones here on the morning
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  of Friday, October 22nd, 2021
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.000]  with a very important update
[57:57.000 --> 57:58.000]  for supporters of M4s.
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.000]  Several of our best selling
[58:01.000 --> 58:02.000]  products are back in stock, limited
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  supplies and are 40 to 50%
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  off like DNA Force Plus.
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  That is 40% off right now.
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  And that sale is going to have to
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  end on Monday. It helps your
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  telemares, it helps your very
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  cells, engines, the mitochondria.
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  It really is incredible.
[58:22.000 --> 58:23.000]  It's 40% off. Some of the best
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  selling products are 50% off as
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  well. And we got a very limited
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  supply, very limited run in
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  stock because I told the manufacturer
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  whatever ingredients you can get
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  whenever you have enough to make
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  some, even if it's a smaller run
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  do it. You got a very small run
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  into the product that's been sold
[58:42.000 --> 58:43.000]  out and that is Rainforce Ultra.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  It's 25% off at M4store.com.
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  It's going to end up selling out
[58:48.000 --> 58:49.000]  by Monday as well at current
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  sales rates. So get great products
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  to support the M4 and M4store.com.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  They're here all over the world
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.000]  and the insurance are tracking
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  everything you do, everywhere you
[59:01.000 --> 59:02.000]  go. And then coming to your house
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  and threatening in some cases
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  actually taking people away into
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  the night to their facilities.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  And they're planning in the next
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  year to expand their shield
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  process where they come and take
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  healthy people away and put them
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  in facilities for their safety.
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.000]  This is nothing less than martial
[59:21.000 --> 59:22.000]  law. And one big thing you can do
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.000]  to fight back is to get high
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  demand, meaning U.S. government
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  military grade at M4store.com.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  We have the entire line of
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  silent pocket ready to ship to
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.000]  you when you visit M4store.com.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.000]  We have special dry bags.
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.000]  We've got them for cell phones.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  We've got them for laptops.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  We've got them for iPads.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's all there at M4store.com.
[59:47.000 --> 59:48.000]  So protect your privacy today
[59:48.000 --> 59:53.000]  at M4store.com.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  Mike Lindell giving us updates
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  on the election and the latest
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  research he's doing.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  In 30 minutes, we've got Lea
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Mathis, who's just an amazingly
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  smart lady joining us on the
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  whole tyranny rollout.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Darren J. Beatty, who runs
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Revolver, who's been bringing on
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  a lot of information about
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  providers and others.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  On January 6th, a lot of big
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  developments on that front will
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  be chronicling. And then Roger
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  will be back in the fourth hour.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Okay, Greg Rees is always
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  knocking it out of the park.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  And this special report needs
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  to be seen by many because it
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  really is the big issue.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  I should be making a bigger issue
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  out of this.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  The invasion of Taiwan is the
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  crisis for the great reset.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Here is that report.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  And then in the days and weeks
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  we're going to be covering this
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  more because currently big
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  changes are taking place.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  We're going to be covering this
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  more.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Everyone alive today in the
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  industrial world have been
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  conditioned to expect World War
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  3, conditioned through print
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  media, pop culture, and
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  ultimately a Second World War.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Today's serial propaganda keeps
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  the human mind anticipating the
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  inevitability of a Third World
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  War.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  The former Soviet intelligence
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  agent, Yuri Besmanov, warned
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  us nearly 40 years ago that
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  America was under a sophisticated
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  attack of communist subversion.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Stage one, demoralization
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  takes up to 20 years because
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  its purpose is to demoralize
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  an entire generation, creating
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  an army of disenfranchised
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  minions.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  An army who is then used for
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  stage two destabilization.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  This only lasts three to five
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  years and is the precursor to
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  stage three, crisis, system
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  failure.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  This is where we are now at the
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  precipice, awaiting the crisis
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  just as the CCP is poised
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  to invade Taiwan.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Taiwan was part of China for
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  centuries.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  And when the communists came to
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  power in 1949, destroying
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Chinese culture, millions fled
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  to Taiwan to preserve it.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  In 1971, the UN's General
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Assembly admitted communist
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  China and expelled Taiwan,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  taking a clear stance against
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  the people of China.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Xi Jinping plans on uniting
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  all of China under the CCP
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  by any means necessary.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  And his time is running out.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  His power is being challenged
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  within the party.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  The CCP regularly rehearses
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  invading Taiwan and recently
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  released a video of it.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  If America were to allow the
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  CCP to invade Taiwan,
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  then the message is clear.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  The US cannot protect any
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  nation from the CCP.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  And communist China becomes
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  the world's prevailing superpower.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And if we defend the people of
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Taiwan, it will be World War
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  3.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  And who decides how America
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  reacts?
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Joe Biden?
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Because they are so dependent
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  upon one another, a military
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  conflict between the US and
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  China will be devastating to
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  both economies.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  But it will give the
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  international banking community
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  the great reset they are all
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  pushing for.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Which cannot exist in a world
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  of national sovereignty.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  World War 1 and 2 created
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  by the U.S.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  are still in power.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  While millions perished.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  War with China gives the
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  international banking community
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  the opportunity to destroy
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  America's culture of freedom
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  and usher in a world of
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  authoritarian dominance.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  For those of us who have
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  awakened, it is obvious that
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  this world war is between the
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  people and their own governments
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  and the unawakened masses will
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  go along with whatever they are
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  told.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  So the only hope that we have
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  is the awakening of the people.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  There are far more of us than
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  there are of them.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And the only way to avoid World
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  War 3 is for the people of the
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  world to wake up.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  T.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, get right
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  with God right now.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  I will be right back.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  I am taping this update on the
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  morning of Friday, October 22,
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  2021.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Listeners who have already tried
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  and really seen the powerful
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  effects of Rain Force Ultra
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  have got a limited supply
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  of it in stock, but it will be
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  sold out at current sales rates
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  by Monday morning.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Despite that fact, we are still
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  offering a major discount of 25%
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  off.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  It is an amazing, new tropic.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  I went to one of the top labs in
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  the country and I said I want
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  very powerful, quick acting,
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  extremely clean, new tropic
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  that wears off quick because I
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  want to be able to take it if I
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  want to.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  So, this is what they did with
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Rain Force Ultra.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Now, we have other great products
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  like Turbo Force that last for
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  10 hours.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  It is a different formula.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  It is over the top powerful, so
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  the strong can't even take it.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  By the way, it is sold out right
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  now.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  The Rain Force Ultra is really
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  something special.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  It is 25% off, limited supply.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  From the front lines of the Info
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  War.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  so much for joining us on this
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  live October 27,
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  2021 broadcast.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  I am going to try to be as
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  focused on this as I can be
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  and just point you in the right
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  direction to do your own research.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I think everybody knows now this
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  is out in the open and so the job
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  of just exposing what is going on
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  with the globalist is becoming
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  more and more important than
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  what they exist like proving the
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  sun came out this morning versus
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  what are we going to do to stop
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  them.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Though it is still important to
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  get the general public's mind
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  wrapped around what type of elite
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  revolution against humanity this
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  is and an establishment revolution
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  against God himself and against
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  God's creation or the act of
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  playing God that these individuals
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  are involved in.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  So I make a lot of statements here
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  on air and I know a lot of them
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  sound crazy and a lot of people
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  say Jones is nuts because I will
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  tell you what the globalists
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  are saying at the UN level but
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  they are putting in public books
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  they have written in white papers
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  and then people will hear me
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  repeat it and it just sounds
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  crazy like you will own nothing
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  you will have nothing we are going
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  to end the nuclear family we are
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  going to erase people's immune
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  system.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  And I also just like last week
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  I was talking to some neighbors
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  and I said yeah you know that
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  this whole carbon thing is a way
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  to tax and control all life on
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  earth and the global carbon tax
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  has already been set up by Black
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Rock and by the Rothschilds and
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  the Rockefellers and Vanguard
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  and they are going to track every
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  movement we make and taxes but
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  also tell us where we can go and
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  what we can do and they are like
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  now the majority of trees saying
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  that oxygen is bad too not just
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  carbon dioxide and the neighbor
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  didn't believe me so I pulled out
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  the phone showed them and they
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  just giggled because again you
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  are hit by something so nonsensical
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  you don't respond to it but it
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  actually starts happening.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  You understand so instead of me
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  just telling you about this let me
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  just show you some of the headlines
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  and we will play a clip from 60
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  minutes recently with Bill Gates.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  There is a couple of them which
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  clips you guys have I forgot to ask
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  during the break.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Okay okay yeah I am just asking
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  put it on screen for me how long
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  each clip is I had forgotten to
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  ask how long each clip is so how
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  long is the 60 minute clip we will
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  just do this live on air.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Okay minute 12 great make sure I
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  have time for that and then we
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  will play the we just inject GMO
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  right in the kids statement
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  he likes to tell you what he is
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  really doing like well what about
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  your old buddy he said you didn't
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  know but turned out you lived with
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  him Jeffrey Epstein he goes well
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  he is dead what about it well he
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  is dead he is dead and we are going
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  to get the human population down
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  to zero and I love Planned
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Parenthood there is too many people
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  and yeah we are going to ban you
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  eating meat and you are going to
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  drink sewage water if you are even
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  allowed to live I mean these are
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  the things that are going to happen
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  so I want you to understand where
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  they are taking you it is not a
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  very happy place when you comply
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  with the vaccine passport that is
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  the carbon passport that is the
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  global social credit score it is
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  a hellish world that is not around
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  the corner it is here so Bill
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Gates wants us to eat 100%
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  synthetic beef he has a point
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  that is yahoo news oh he has a
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  point and it is just we are evil
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  we are white we are racist the
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  political correctness we have got
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  to do all this and so they are
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  moving ahead with it and promoting
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  the impossible burger they were
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  reporting has five times the
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  estrogen of the estrogen they
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  would give a sex offender order to
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  be on estrogen therapy so that
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  they don't assault children in a
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  month this is all just your
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  estrogen therapy boys continuing
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  according to Bill Gates rich
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  country shouldn't be eating real
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  meat there is another one Bill
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Gates thinks people should only be
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  eating synthetic beef Bill Gates
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  let them eat fake meat and it goes
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  on and on and on sky news we are
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  rich we shouldn't be allowed to eat
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  meat oh my god by all means I
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  won't now when I mentioned all of
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  this people think I am joking but
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  I am not joking here is some of the
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  news articles right here where even
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  CNN is calling this year for cutting
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  down trees plant trees sure but to
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  save the climate we should also cut
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  them down well that's a double
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  think double think it's like a
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  double double thing plant trees by
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  cutting them down to save the earth
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  from the evil carbon that's part of
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  the life cycle four things make life
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  on this beautiful planet and of
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  course the fifth element is God
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  making us and originally engineering
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  us but and then planting us here but
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  you have to have the sun you got to
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  have water you got to have carbon
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  oxide and oxygen both trace caches
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  that are at the lowest level ever
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  recorded in human history from the
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  ice core and mud samples and so it's
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  really God's plan I guess that we
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  found all this fossil fuel and then
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  brought all this tied up carbon back
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  to the surface because just like
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Mars the earth has been losing its
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  atmosphere right around the time
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  that humans show up on the scene
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  of course that's according to the
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  official timelines but the point is
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  is that the Sahara is expanding
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  because of low carbon dioxide levels
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  yeah it went up a little bit the
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  20th century but compared to a
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  thousand years ago or 100,000 years
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  ago or 10 million years ago it was
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  dozens and dozens of times higher
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  why do you think plants grew so
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  faster were so big during those
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  periods the earth was covered with
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  stuff like redwoods previously they
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  find redwoods buried in Antarctica
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  the fossilized redwoods so this
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  earth was once way more lush we know
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  that and you know had gigantic plants
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  so big that it could supply brachios
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and huge herbivores enough plants to
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  eat but do I need to debate with
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  people that cutting down trees is a
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  good thing for the earth I mean these
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  people are psychotic but they want
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  power over all life
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  so this is seeing in Democrats have
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  set their sights on passing major
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  climate legislation but with a
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  razor thin majority in Congress they
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  need to look for common ground so
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  they spin it saying Republicans
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  like to cut down trees no they
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  don't they like to plant them and
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  then reharvest them and replant them
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  and there's more plants now than
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  there was 100 years ago in this
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  country there's more trees one of
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  the most promising ideas is to plant
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  them and they say that trees are
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  actually bad because they create
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  oxygen and carbon dioxide well that's
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  what Bill Gates says he says I don't
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  want organic farming because that's
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  got organics involved bacteria and
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  lichen and funguses and plants and
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  they put off what do they do just
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  like evil humans they put off carbon
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  and that's what Bill Gates and the
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  founder of the impossible burger oh
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  it's impossible it's so amazing it's
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  basically a solid slab of estrogen
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  and you can go read all the articles
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  the future of farming according to
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Bill Gates he says we got to have
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  herbicides and pesticides and grow
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  things in laboratories he says grow
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  meat in laboratories and have people
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  eat bacteria soups made from sewage
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and it just goes on from there the
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  biofuel debate will cutting trees cut
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  carbon New York Times these people
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  are unbelievable what they want is
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  power and control over absolutely
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  everything on this planet and we
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  come back I'm going to tie it into
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  the actual investors and those that
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  control your investment money your
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  investment money and the rest of it
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  and how they're going to hold you
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  hostage with those in the future
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  with the global social credit score
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  they're already telling all the
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  billionaires to prepare for and how
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  they're going to announce you still
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  get your retirement but 40% of it
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  has to be put in global green fund
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  and you've got to behave a certain
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  way on your app on your phone or
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  you won't get your retirement and
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  the average boomer I guess will just
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  submit to that thinking being held
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  and so they'll just roll over and
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  submit to that too putting themselves
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  and all of us in chains.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  We're going to tell you about BlackRock
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  and their plans to euthanize you and
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  your family straight ahead.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Alex Jones here on the morning of
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Friday October 22nd 2021 with a very
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  important update for supporters of
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  InfoWars.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Several of our best selling products
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  are back in stock limited supplies
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  and are 40 to 50% off like DNA
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Force Plus that is 40% off right
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  now and that sale is going to have
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  to end on Monday.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  It helps your telomeres, it helps
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  your various cells engines, the
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  mitochondria, it's got the PQQ, the
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  CoQ10, it really is incredible.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  It's 40% off.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Some of the best selling products
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  are 50% off as well and we got a
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  very limited supply, very limited
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  run in because I told the manufacturer
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  that whatever ingredients you can get
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  whenever you have enough to make some
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  even if it's a smaller run do it.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  You got a very small run into the
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  product that's been sold out and
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  that is Rainforce Ultra.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  It's 25% off at InfoWars.com
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  that's going to end up selling out
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  by Monday as well at current
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  sales rates.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  So get great products to support the
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  InfoWars.com.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  of subservience, a symbol of
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  subservience, that the medical
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  tyranny combined controlled by the
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  global private corporations has
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  put in place.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  emergency from which we will never
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  emerge.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  It is the symbol that we are diseased
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  that evil and bad must cover our
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  diseased criminal faces from the
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  light of the sun.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  It is the symbol of our complete
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  and total absolute surrender to
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  evil.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  The entire future destiny of
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  humanity is upon us.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  they're coming out with implantable
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  microchips as part of the World ID
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  in carbon taxes.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Things only get worse from here if
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  we submit.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  They only get better if we resist
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  and say no.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Noncompliance, noncompliance,
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  noncompliance.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  On the dark side,
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  join Bill Gates
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  and together,
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  we will defeat humanity.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Then our gods will reward us
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  with eternal life.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  That's basically the ethos
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  of the globalists.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  They must first play God.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  They must first prove that they
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  are the fittest
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  in their social Darwinistic system.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  And in a way, they're right.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  If we let them lie to us
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  and dumb us down and poison us
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  and destroy our children's futures,
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  the evidence is overwhelming
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  and out in the open, we really
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  deserve what's happened to us.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  So I ask you now,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  are you going to step up
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  and expose the dual order even more?
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  I know I'm pledging to step up
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  and redouble my efforts.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  The front lines of the fight
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  is infowars.com.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  I've ever had in my 47 years
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  on this planet.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  I've had a lot of loss
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  like everybody else has.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  And it's because
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  it's a loss of ancestral
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  freedom
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  that so many people fought
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  and died
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  and bled and sweat for.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  And I see the general public,
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  ENA, medically induced,
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  scientifically induced,
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  behavioral psychologically controlled
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  tranche.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And I know we're being fed
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  into this globalist beaker under
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  But this is the process
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  of birth and then growth
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  and then falling apart
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  and then degenerating and collapsing
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  is just the globalist are actively
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  trying to steer and control
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  this process of decadence and collapse
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's continue
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  looking at the rulers
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  of this system.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  So if you go online, you can look this up yourself.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Vanguard is the second largest
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  mutual fund.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  They go back and forth with BlackRock as being number one.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  And they are the number one
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  owner of Pfizer stock.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  Number two is BlackRock.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  And these are the guys,
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  when you study them and you look at them,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  that are lobbying governments
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  for forced inoculations
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  with these shots that are killing people in mass
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  and causing mass ADE
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  to fill up worldwide hospitals,
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  which is now confirmed even by NPR.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  So this isn't some theoretical thing
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  that all these top scientists warned of
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  in the last 20 plus months.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  It's happening, it's confirmed
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  and they're killing us.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  BlackRock Chief,
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  how COVID could help save the planet?
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  BBC Larry Fink
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  tells the BBC,
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  you have a speech to globalist
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  that, oh,
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  we need to
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  use these lockdowns
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  to train people to accept lockdowns
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  and have new carbon lockdowns
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  and have everybody have an app on their phone
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  to track you and tax you.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Go read the article to make sure you save the earth.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And remember, you'll own nothing,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  you'll have nothing, you won't get to eat meat,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  you'll eat soybeans all day.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  If you're allowed to, your smart funnel
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  if you're allowed to leave your house,
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  they're training school children in Europe
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  and the UK on this 10 years ago.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  I've shown you the in-school PSAs
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  they show them.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  In the new, wonderful future run
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  by the United Nations Food Bureau
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  worldwide,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  the system will decide when you get
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  meat and when you don't,
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  your smart phone will tell you
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  when you can leave your house
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  and where you can go,
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  you'll be told by the government
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  that pets, because pets are carbon creatures too.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  We're being taught that living creatures
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  are bad from cats to dogs
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  because they pass gas
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  and methane is poison gas.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  They listed you as a toxic waste,
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  not part of this atmosphere.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Is this like a they live movie plot
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  and these are aliens that can't breathe
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  our gases or something?
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  I mean, I'm not saying that's what it is,
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  but I mean, this is so
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  freaky
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  and it's really going on
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  and all the real science shows
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  we need more carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  So here's BBC,
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Black Rock Chief,
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  how COVID could help save the planet.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  We're going to take you off your farm
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  and ranch.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  We're going to eat GMO.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  We're going to make you take these deadly shots.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  We're going to break up the nuclear family.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  We're going to fund all this political correctness.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  We're going to fund Black Lives Matter
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  and what it does,
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  all they have a global lockdown
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  and shut down the planet.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Yes, and they stick tubes up cows bucks
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  in Canada
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  and now in Germany
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  and they pump it up full of gas
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  and make the liberal dairies
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  then pay to have the methane
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  pumped into mine shafts
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  and seal it in the earth
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  because any human activity is bad
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  and well, your milk cows farting.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  So we're going to run a big
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  fire hose up its ass.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  This is really happening.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Excuse my French.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  This is the animal abuse.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  This is the ridiculousness
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  to see what they can get us to do
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  in the Overton window
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  with learned helplessness
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  in Stockholm syndrome
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  and who's financing it all?
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Look it up.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  It's Larry Fink.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  It was a real rat Fink.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  The pandemic has
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  extracted a terrible toll
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  on human life,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  which the globalist launched.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  He used the lockdown to kill people.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Let me start over.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  The pandemic has
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  exacted a terrible toll on human life
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  and the livelihoods.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  It is hard to see
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  how anything that could possibly
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  be described as positive
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  could come out of such a devastating crisis.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  But the world's biggest money
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  manager suggests there may be one.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  It goes on.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Climate lockdowns.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  BlackRock manages $8.7 trillion
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  of savers money.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  Some of the new social credit score
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  do like he says
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  or he's going to keep it,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  which won't be theft.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  It'll be liberal.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Like the Federal Reserve says
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  they're devaluing the dollar to zero
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  and they said to help black people.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  That's a quote to fight racism.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Oh, okay.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Hitler killed people
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  to help him as well.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  It is possibly the most influential
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  financial firm in the world.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  And it continues.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Larry Fink,
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  the Chief Executive of BlackRock
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  in its annual letter to the bosses
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  of all the companies in which
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  the colossal sum is invested
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  and he tells them how to invest in what to do
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  says the pandemic could ultimately
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  help the fight against
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  an even greater crisis.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  Climate change,
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  climate lockdowns, climate passes,
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  which Davos announced two weeks ago.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  I believe that the pandemic has presented
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  such an existential crisis
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  such as the stark reminder of our fragility
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  that it's driven us to confront
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  the threat of climate change
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  more forcefully and to consider how
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  like the pandemic it will alter our lives.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  And then he announces shutting down
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  everything further and the UN running
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  at all.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  And of course,
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  who agrees with him?
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Oh, I forget.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Noam Chomsky.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Larry Fink wants a hundred billion
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  for decarbonization aid
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  that they give to their own companies
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  for quote getting rid of carbon
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  shutting people down.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  That's Forbes, by the way, they got it.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  BlackRock creates biggest climate
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  exchange trade fund.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Oh my gosh, isn't that nice?
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Reuters just created that in the last
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  few months to make you now pay
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  trillions of dollars of your money
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  into when you buy or sell or do any
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  activity.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the next
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  $1,000 billion startups
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  will be in
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  climate tech, all the chips
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  and all the drones and all the sensors
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  tracking and controlling
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  and reducing carbon one hundred
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  and fifty trillion in the next decade
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  of your tax money
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  to shut down carbon, including
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  cutting down trees can't have those
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  damn dirty trees.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  BlackRock's transfer of power
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  New York Times
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  BlackRock's Larry Fink blames gig
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  economy for stoking inflation.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  That's not the big bankers doing it.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  I mean, look at this guy.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  No, no, it's you having children,
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  it's you having a car and it's that
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  tree in your backyard.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  That's the problem.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And Larry, if Larry can get your trees
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  cut down, he can cut you down.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  I mean, if you'll accept the trees are
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  bad, you'll accept anything.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  If you'll accept pedophiles visiting
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  your school, if your kid is sitting
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  on their lap, you'll put up a thing
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  on your watch.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  It's all about raping us.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  And BlackRock says America
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  must keep investing in China.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  There's another article on that.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  So that's who these people are,
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  ladies and gentlemen, and that's
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  what they're doing.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  And oh, BlackRock made record
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  profits during the pandemic that
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  they orchestrated and engineered
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  with their minions, Fauci's and
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  others and Walmart and Amazon
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  and all of them that were essential,
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  and all these retired people sit
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  there and look at their retirement
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  fund and look at all the inflation
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  in the stock market and think that's
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  real value.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  And now they're going to hold you
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  hostage with your carbon footprint
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  and your carbon allowance.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  It's all being announced today.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Paul Watson is doing a video on it
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  and may already be on infowars.com
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  where they're announcing in the EU
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  and the UK.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Yep, your phone's going to have a
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  lot of money.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  You can tell you when you're allowed
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  to go somewhere and what you're
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  allowed to do.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Who in their right mind would go
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  along with this?
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  But all these leftists just get
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  paid to be part of it, not
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  understanding it.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Once the chains are on, once the
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  feudalism is in place, it's going
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  to be hellish.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  I mean, we are being inducted into
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  a super authoritarianism and the
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  global social credit score.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  And it's all the Stockholm syndrome
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  women that couldn't survive 10
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  seconds out in the wild and men as
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  well that are signed on to it.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  The weakest dumbest people are
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  signing on to this.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  So many people say to me, Alex,
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  I am taping this update on the
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  morning of Friday, October 22, 2021.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Listeners who've already tried and
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  really seen the powerful effects
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  of Rainforest Ultra should be
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  excited to know that we've got a
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  good supply of it in stock, but
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  it'll be sold out at current
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  sales rates by Monday morning.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  Despite that fact, we're still
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  offering a major discount of 25
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  percent off.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  It is an amazing, new tropic.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  I went to one of the top labs in
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  the country and I said I want very
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  powerful, quick acting, extremely
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  clean, new tropic that wears off
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  quick because I want to be able
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  to take it if I've got to work
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  till 10 at night, take it at 7
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  a.m.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  Now, we have other great products
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  like Turbo Force that last for
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  10 hours.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  It's a different formula.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  It's over the top powerful, so
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  I can't even take it.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  By the way, it's sold out right
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  down.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  The Rainforest Ultra is really
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  something special.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  It's 25 percent off.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Limited supply.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  We'll sell out early next week
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  products at mfullwarstore.com
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  before they sell out like DNA
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Force.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  Plus, it is the ultimate formula
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  out there for strengthening
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  your telomeres and the very
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  engines of your cells.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  I mean, it's got a big dose of
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  the highest quality PQQ at CoQ10
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  and a bunch of other key
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  ingredients that God gave us
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  their nature that are simply
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  amazing.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  It gets 40 percent off.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  The quality all day and my crap
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  from China never be sold out.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  We're not doing that.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  This is the highest rated.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  It's 40 percent off the sale
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  ends on Monday.

[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  It'll be sold out on Monday.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  It's 25 percent off.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  So support the M4 while getting
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  great products at the same time.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  Thank you all for your support
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  and thanks to humanity.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  I have decided that all of you
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  will take a special injection
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  so that you will be safe.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  But the injection is not ready.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  And so I need all of you
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  to stay indoors
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  for the next 15 days
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  to flatten the cans.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  I also need you to wear masks
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  and I also need you to only shop
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  at mega corporations.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  That way we can consolidate control
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  and bankrupt the world economy
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  leaving companies that only I own
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  profitable.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  You will then be my slaves.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  And then you get that special shot
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  of freedom from Cobra
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  will remove your immune system.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  So you'll be dependent on me
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Info Wars Life is bringing you
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  a breakthrough in modern medicine
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  introducing pollen block.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  We have found an extraordinary
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  new natural way to alleviate
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  seasonal distress symptoms
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  including promoting clear nasal
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  and sinus passageways
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  and respiratory function.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  In the 1960s researchers
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  in France noticed that people
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  who ate certain quail eggs
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  experienced less seasonal
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  They began studying this effect
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  in published trials
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  and decades later we now have
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  the fruit of this research
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  Pollen block is natural
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  and effective.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  In fact current research has found
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  that it actually acts by blocking
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  the activity of tryptase
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  immune and inflammatory responses
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  in the body.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  Info Wars Life.com
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  and grab a pack of our pollen block
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  chewable tablets.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  show.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  From the front lines of the
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  information war
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  Well he is the founder
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  of MyPillow Empire
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  and he's had a lot of courage
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  and really done a great job
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  supporting President Trump
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  and supporting integrity and elections
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  and he's been targeted by some of the
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  nastiest groups on the planet
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  and I really wanted to get Mike
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  Lindell on because I talked to a lot
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  of people out there
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  across the board including people
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  in the Trump operation
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  and they say that without Mike out
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  there and all the investment he's
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  got is information coming out
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  about bona fide confirmed stuff
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  going on in the 2020 election
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  that they would be able in the mid
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  terms now just a year away
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  to repeat what they did again
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  and so he's got a ton of breaking
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  news and information joining us
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  he also without me ever even

[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  in history so successful and
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  here's why number one nobody

[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  the packet captures and all the
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  data we have is from the 2020
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  election sit but what happened
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  there all 50 states were
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  represented at the cyber symposium
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  what they did the everybody went
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  home remember the media went dark
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  on me they I call it going Fox on
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  someone they went Fox on me
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  they didn't talk about me they
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  didn't even slam me in the media
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  they just went completely Fox on
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  me remember Fox is horrible
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  because they don't talk about the
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  2020 election they don't talk
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  about what happened to me
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and what happened to me
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  and what happened to me
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  I think we'd be like a hub
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  of a wheel we could it's called
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  the information fusion center
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  and we took we're in 38 states
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  now all this information coming
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  in and then we we feed it back
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  out what each state needs
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  but in the meantime what I've
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  been doing remember I promised
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  everybody that we would get
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  this to the Supreme Court when
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.620]  everybody, that we would get this to the Supreme Court with all the evidence they didn't have
[1:37:59.620 --> 1:38:05.220]  back in last year when they denied even looking at anything.
[1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:11.220]  So what we've had, I've been going around and meeting with Attorney Generals, and because
[1:38:11.220 --> 1:38:16.920]  they're the ones that are going to be on this case, we're bringing to the Supreme Court,
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:24.600]  this case is going to drop on November 23rd at 9 a.m. in the morning, two days before Thanksgiving.
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:28.120]  And everyone out there can say, oh, come on, Mike, the Supreme Court isn't going to take
[1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  it.
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:30.120]  I believe they will.
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:36.000]  I believe they'll take it 9-0 because they're there to save our country from a foreign intrusion.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:41.840]  We now have, we've been in all these states, what I did, Alex, is I went to states, instead
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:46.520]  of fighting with the six states, that you're getting such pushback because they're either
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:51.800]  a Democrat, Secretary of State, or Governor, or you have terrible corrupt governors like
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:39:01.400]  Ducey and Kemp, and Brad Rassenberg, Secretary of State of Georgia, they've been all obstructionist
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:04.880]  to get to the bottom of the 2020 election.
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:10.840]  Well, when we had, so what I've been doing, each state, we go there, we show them their
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:13.720]  own voter rolls, we get them from the state.
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:17.640]  Some of them I had to pay, I had to pay $30,000 to get Alabama's.
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:21.880]  These are people that were registered and people that actually voted, and what we do
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:28.640]  is we show them, hey, look at this empty lot over here where 30 people voted, or this one
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:31.880]  bedroom house, and only one person lives there.
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:38.800]  Or we show them these anomalies like Wisconsin, 23,000 people voted in Wisconsin from a prison
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:40.840]  and used all the same phone number.
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.760]  Now people didn't do this.
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.080]  These people, some of them were passed away, some of them don't even live in Wisconsin.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.760]  The computer just pulls their names in, everybody.
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:54.520]  As you know, like right now, just two days ago, I'll give an example.
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:01.760]  In Pima County, Arizona, 106% of the people voted that were registered, that's impossible
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:05.440]  unless they pulled people's names and used names.
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:10.360]  These people really didn't vote, they just used, they pulled and used their names.
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.520]  This is where the machines are, everybody.
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:15.000]  The machines have got to go.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:21.680]  But the machines are still here in the 2022 election, our country's gone forever.
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:26.880]  This is our last chance in history to change the course of mankind.
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.280]  This has been a spiritual battle and a good versus evil.
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:37.160]  They've come in, they took our country with a cyber attack of the biggest historical,
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:39.000]  biggest crime in history.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.680]  Now you can even see what just happened in California on that recall in Newsom.
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:44.920]  So many people got there.
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:47.400]  They're not even hiding anymore.
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:49.560]  So many people got there and said, what do you mean I voted?
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:50.560]  I didn't vote.
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:55.080]  On CNN, they took 300,000 yes votes and moved them to the no section.
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:57.520]  The computers did this.
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:02.640]  Every election coming up here next week, like in Virginia and stuff, forget about it.
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:04.800]  They're going to be a Republican winner.
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:09.600]  If there is, they wanted him to win because he's corrupt as the other ones, as a Democrat
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  one.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  It doesn't matter.
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:17.040]  Because this, it would happen in every state in the country.
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:20.280]  Every single state in the country had an attack.
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:25.160]  The most votes that were flipped were California number one, Texas number two, and Florida
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:26.160]  number three.
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:29.920]  Florida had almost one million votes.
[1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:33.720]  One million votes more Trump won by one million votes were in question with it.
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:40.120]  He won by and people and but this was all across the country and you don't want credit,
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:42.520]  I've got to give you credit because I've had people all over the country and I see the
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:44.800]  local news articles is why they hate you so much.
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:48.120]  You're the guy that spent millions of dollars of your money and thanks to folks supporting
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:52.680]  and buying the products, you're able to do that to pay for these recounts, to pay for
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:53.800]  the forensics.
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:57.840]  And so without you, all this stuff we're seeing, a lot of it wouldn't have happened.
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.360]  So that's why it's so important for people to continue to support your work at mypillow.com
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:03.360]  and mypillow.com.
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:05.200]  You're absolutely right.
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:08.760]  Why would anybody not get your high quality American products?
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:11.440]  Why would anybody not support you when they're already so great?
[1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:15.380]  They're already great prices and you're fighting the tyrants at point-mic range.
[1:42:15.380 --> 1:42:19.160]  Everyone should with all these supply chain problems, I know you've got plenty of product
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:23.160]  because you're here in America that a lot of places aren't even able to have Christmas
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:24.760]  or people are getting gouge with their prices.
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:27.480]  If you want to just go back and say again as we go to break, we'll come back with more
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:32.080]  news of what's happening is that's why it's important to shop with the Patriots to keep
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:36.320]  us on air and to keep Mike Lindell being able to fight because he is doing so much important
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:39.400]  work and so are we in this fight against the globalist.
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:43.360]  So thank you all for your support at mypillow.com forward slash Alex.
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:46.800]  We have some of the best deals there period or use promo code Alex.
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:49.880]  So Mike Lindell is on fire, man, amazing information.
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:54.200]  We'll come right back in a few minutes and he'll have the floor of the rest of the segment.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:43:04.920]  The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:09.480]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:15.040]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.240]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:22.080]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:23.440]  with the boy.
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:25.880]  Is it true?
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:31.720]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:35.480]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:42.160]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:43.880]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:47.640]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full wars in the air now more than
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:52.040]  ever because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting and
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:57.080]  setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast

[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:28.240]  success story and he's the classic American underdog story taking on big tech taking
[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:32.920]  on the big voting machine companies and going around the nation flying around the nation
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:39.280]  spending massive amounts of his money to challenge what's happening and to expose what's going
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:44.680]  on and he's joining us right now to talk about where this is going and what's unfolding
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.400]  but I want to point something out that he said a few months ago on the show he said
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:55.360]  listen Alex when the food prices explode and the economy falls apart under Biden the general
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.400]  public and it's going to put pressure politically on the Supreme Court and others and there's
[1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:05.080]  going to be real pressure to remove Biden and not replace Biden with Kamala Harris and
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:10.920]  they'll be the political will to have this happen now that sounded kind of far out then
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:16.160]  to me but it's starting to happen here so I know this the election was illegitimate
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:19.840]  and we're not supposed to say that or will be censored well screw the system that's
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:25.320]  an American right but we have all the evidence so as Trump said two weeks ago the real insurrection
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:32.080]  happened on November 3rd not January 6th and this this was a stolen election so Mike recap
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:37.520]  what you were saying and then lay out where this is going because this is amazing yeah
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:42.000]  okay I'm just checking here the uh here's what here's where we're at everybody what
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:47.160]  I've done I spent millions and millions of dollars um we're leading up to when I got
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:53.520]  that first piece of evidence on January 9th that showed that this was a cyber attack by
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:49:00.080]  China on our country okay on January 7th there was a letter from Radcliffe that came out
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:06.360]  that he said about this China intrusion and uh that's that by the way will be also included
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:11.840]  in our case well from that point on I was all in went all in I have all the evidence
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:17.920]  it was brought to me uh every single uh packet capturing data on the from that end call that
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:23.800]  the back end the attack then obviously really leading up we did the cyber symposium because
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:28.120]  I would say well Mike why didn't you drop this on the Supreme Court's doorstep to get
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:34.440]  the selection pulled down a lot sooner for one reason everybody is it just like everything
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:39.400]  else that's went on in our country we are in a fight with the media the media will either
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:44.280]  suppress it or they will block it they will they will they will they will bet you know
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:49.640]  attack it like they did attack me and attack my platform and everything so since the cyber
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:55.720]  symposium now we have all these attorney generals on and this isn't by the way this is not the
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:01.080]  dominion lawsuit everybody that's another deflection they're doing all the dominion
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:06.840]  lawsuits that they've sued that's nothing that is their big game my dominion lawsuits
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:13.720]  right now everybody are just a big game so they can push it out past the 2022 election
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:19.480]  and take the rest of our country forever they have over 200 lawsuits and 200 threatening
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:23.800]  letters to people which you probably don't know out that know out there but we got a
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:29.000]  class action lawsuit of all the people that were sent and threat sent threatening letters
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:35.080]  by dominion and they sued dominion in a class action lawsuit you can't do this to citizens
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:39.720]  that were mother and father sisters and daughters that were just poll watchers but anyway what
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:44.960]  we've got going this is the big case the case we're bringing to the supreme court is what
[1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:49.720]  I've been telling everybody we were going to drop it in August after the cyber symposium
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:55.720]  but we need attorney generals are the plaintiffs not Mike Lindell so we've been going around
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:59.760]  in meeting secretly I'm not going to give out the names of the states that are already
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:05.000]  on board but there's going to be a lot of them we only needed one and they and now this
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:10.360]  case goes before the supreme court it involves the fourth and the twelfth amendment I believe
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:16.360]  I'm not a lawyer we're going to have this all laid out on on Frank speech dot com on
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:21.560]  the website of what that what the premise of everything is but believe me we every state
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:26.760]  has standing we're suing the United States of America that that what was done in this
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:32.200]  election and this was an attack by China on our country of course there were bad people
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:37.160]  here that helped them we know that and the and the cover up this being the biggest cover
[1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:42.560]  up in the history of any crime in history I mean the cover up huge so what we're doing
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:51.240]  this we're launching this we're bringing to the supreme court the second the the day two
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:58.560]  days before Thanksgiving at 9am and why two days before Thanksgiving everybody well the
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:03.040]  supreme court is not even in session well let me tell you this is all about getting
[1:52:03.040 --> 1:52:09.280]  the word out that this is maybe even fox will report that this case got brought to the supreme
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:14.080]  court now there's evidence in there that no one's seen every states there's evidence
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:19.920]  in there stuff that you can't even believe like I'll go Missouri 47,000 people put on
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:24.480]  their voter rolls two days before the election four days later taken off and you're going
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:29.080]  to see things like you know this is stuff we've seen videos of and on the ground and
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:35.160]  everything else that that's that happened during that but so you have what we have is evidence
[1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:40.680]  is not just all the cyber breaches and cyber flips but we do have stuff like this stuff
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:46.320]  you didn't see back then but it's not going to be duplicate duplicate evidence this is
[1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:51.880]  stuff that is a hundred percent non subjective evidence that where we've taken it right from
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:57.800]  China the attacks coming from China right down through machines through routers we
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:03.120]  know evidence of going through the intrusion IDs of the computers and everything and by
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:06.560]  the way you were the first to say all that and now they've confirmed in Arizona indeed
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:12.200]  that there was cover-ups destruction of videotapes destruction of router evidence major stuff
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:17.360]  being hidden now there's a criminal investigation in Arizona and so and you said months and
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:21.160]  months ago that attorney generals were going to be joining in and doing this and now I
[1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:25.720]  do see that in the news that other states are now opening investigations and if you
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:28.760]  hadn't done what you did and get and get and been attacked for I know it's not about the
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:32.520]  credit Mike but you've been the man in the arena if you hadn't done that we wouldn't
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:37.040]  have a fighting chance right now right way Alex in there and here's two things well I
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:41.520]  think my platform brought the awareness out there when no word was getting out I think
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:46.160]  we had enough evidence in November and December everybody knew that to take one little piece
[1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:51.800]  for everybody in the country and convict 300 some million people of a crime to go to prison
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.440]  for life this is that we have more evidence than we ever need but what we need we need
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:54:03.120]  is people to put pressure on the Supreme Court which was gonna come which will when we dropped
[1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:06.560]  this two days before Thanksgiving there's two things that are going on I want to tell
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:11.720]  everybody so we're doing that and then we're having a marathon from Wednesday night until
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:16.960]  Sunday on Frank speech dot com so you can go there and we're gonna show everything piece
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:22.280]  by piece for those three days or four days over Thanksgiving so you can be sitting around
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.280]  the Thanksgiving table instead of watching football going arguing with someone which
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.760]  most people believe now even the Democrats at this election was told say hey let's go
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:36.760]  see what was dropped before the Supreme Court now Alex they're nine they are nine people
[1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:41.960]  they're people they are they've lived the American dream they have families grandchildren they
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:45.760]  have neighbors they have if you know any of the justice you need to tell them they're
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:51.360]  there to protect our country now they're gonna if they accept this nine zero which I believe
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:55.960]  they will this is gonna be a great uniting of our country because they have a lot of
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:00.560]  options they could do a new election with paper ballots but one of the things that has
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:08.240]  to come out of this and we're in 38 states working right now 38 what we're doing is from
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:14.040]  this point on from as I speak we have to get rid of the machines by next summer there is
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:19.320]  a replacement system we have and I know we're not making money on is costing money we're
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:23.560]  giving we're gonna give it out to all these states here's how you can replace where you're
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:29.120]  doing paper ballots the replacement system if there are machines I don't care what anybody
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:35.280]  says every machine they were all online any state that says anything different they just
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:40.760]  misconstrued I had Bill Bill O'Reilly the other day said no the theft wasn't through
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.280]  the machines it was here Bill was naive he didn't know he shouldn't be opening his mouth
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:50.880]  if he doesn't have the fact and the fact is every machine they're online and now they
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:56.280]  even have what about the hours of videos of all the Democrats up until 2000 saying don't
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:02.120]  press machines they're a fraud and them giving examples Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid I mean going
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:07.440]  back they all say what you say so how can you be silenced and sued for saying what they
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:12.320]  will admit it to back when they thought Republicans were stealing right right and the world we're
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:17.840]  living in now everybody is is we're not gonna computer world and if you get a cyber attack
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:22.320]  my pillow gets attacked all the time credit card companies get hacked businesses get
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:27.720]  hacked you have gas lines getting hacked we have trained things get hacked if you get
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:33.640]  a cyber attack there all that can be made up with money but when you attack a country
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:40.280]  an election you steal freedoms you steal everything from that country we've lost our country if
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:45.400]  we don't get rid of the machines right away and let me tell you getting rid of these machines
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:50.640]  is going to be easier than you think Alice because even the Democrats 35% of Democrats
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:55.200]  now know that selection was stole and they're afraid of the you know the cyber attack and
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:57:01.160]  everything you see going on right now by this terrible administration you can see it's communism
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:06.040]  we skipped right over socialism to communism and it goes right back to November 3rd and
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:09.080]  they're a and they know they stole it and they're trying to dismantle the country and
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:14.240]  destroy it right now they are trying to destroy the dollar our borders are everything we are
[1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:19.920]  in a race they're over here how much damage can they do before we get rid of these machines
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:24.840]  trust me I am not quitting till these machines are gone we're gonna have that supreme court
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:31.080]  case two days before Thanksgiving you can watch on frankspeech.com of 72 hour marathon
[1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:36.160]  with all this dumped and then on a parallel track we're gonna get it struck to everyone
[1:57:36.160 --> 1:57:40.760]  how you can get the machines rid of get them out of your state all the states are doing
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:52.280]  all this too Mike like I know you gotta go here but I gotta talk to you during the break
[1:57:52.280 --> 1:58:11.960]  October 22nd, 2021 listeners who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:34.560]  of the
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:38.120]  last for 10 hours. It's a different formula. It's over the top powerful. So the trauma
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:41.860]  can't even take it. By the way, it's sold out right now. The brain force ultra is really
[1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:47.440]  something special. It's 25% off limited supply. We'll sell out early next week info or store
[1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:54.680]  dot com. I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:59:01.840]  news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:07.000]  the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:12.840]  in studies they did on children, it caused myocarditis that starts swelling and architects.
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:16.520]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the associated press, it's not getting
[1:59:16.520 --> 1:59:20.920]  any circulation. It's not on the national news. And it's very hard to even find on places
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:26.640]  like Instagram or Twitter. It's just crazy. And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:30.840]  there's no damage from the vaccines. It doesn't hurt anybody. Your conspiracy theorists, if
[1:59:30.840 --> 1:59:35.360]  you say it, it's just crazy. And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came
[1:59:35.360 --> 1:59:39.240]  out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems. They gave the exact reasons
[1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:44.520]  why and now it happened. That's why info wars is on air. Because if we weren't on air, they
[1:59:44.520 --> 2:00:05.760]  wouldn't get away with even more of this crap. This is just insane. These people are killers.
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:12.120]  All right, Mike Lindell is with us. Mike Lindell joins us for five more minutes and he is really
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:16.320]  excited laying out a lot of key information. The corporate media told us no evidence of
[2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:19.560]  fraud was there. Now it's coming out everywhere. Attorney generals are getting involved. A bunch
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:24.320]  of states are involved. He is right in the middle of it really giving exclusive information.
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:28.880]  So recap in the next few minutes what you broke down the last 30 and then any other
[2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:33.760]  key pieces of information, Mike. Okay. So everybody out there, I just want to tell
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:38.440]  you I've been since the cyber supporting meeting all these states right up to the attorney
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:43.480]  generals. We get all these attorney generals this case that's going to the Supreme Court,
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:49.120]  which will drop on November 23rd at 9am. And they say how many attorney generals I hope
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:55.000]  to have. It'd be nice to have all 50 because all 50 states were where there was a cyber
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.600]  attack through the machines. But we have all the attorney generals that are going on there
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:04.080]  and we're bringing this case. Now the case we're bringing is to get this election pulled
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:10.080]  down. This was a fraudulent election. China attacked us. And to get it pulled down, that
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:15.200]  would be the relief. There's a lot of options the Supreme Court will have. Maybe a new election.
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.760]  Maybe they throw it back to the state. They're going to have all kinds of options. But what
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:24.560]  we knew is we need you out there to also put pressure on the Supreme Court. And the way
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:30.000]  you can do that, we've got a let's say called fix2021st.com. You can go there and sign the
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:38.580]  petition today at fix2021st.com. But also during this time, we have frankspeech.com.
[2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:43.640]  Over Thanksgiving, we're going to run for four days and you yourself at home can pull
[2:01:43.640 --> 2:01:48.240]  up the evidence or watch us on TV, but you can go to Frank's Beach and you're going to
[2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:53.280]  have a tool there because we put the voter rolls and the people that voted on, we put
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:57.320]  it on the Frank's Beach site. We're going to have that on there. It's going to be up
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.440]  within about a week. And you can put, you can also find out what happened in my state,
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:07.600]  but you can put in your own voter rolls and see things like 20,000 people voted with the
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:13.040]  same address. 20,000 non-residents voted. They didn't vote. They used their name. So
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:17.600]  you're going to see fraud that's non-subjective. This is all on the voter rolls. You're going
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:23.120]  to see why maybe your county 110% of the people voted. They didn't vote. They used their name.
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:28.360]  So, and then, and then you guys were in 38 states and to get your, you yourself can look
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:32.920]  up your state, how to find out what you can do in your state to help get rid of these
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:39.120]  machines once and for all, and we will have a good election in 2022 and get back our country
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:45.720]  or, or an apparel or track that the Supreme Court pulls down the election of 2020. Remember,
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:49.960]  we can't go anywhere unless we fixed 2020 first.
[2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:55.040]  You're right. And just in closing, what you're doing is great because they did steal it.
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:58.960]  There's fraud. They don't want us questioning. You're attacking on all fronts. That is amazing.
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.000]  That's why it's so important for viewers and listeners through their Christmas shopping

[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:41.880]  right here in the U S and we don't have those problems that they're going to have bringing

[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:02.840]  saved, basically. And so what, what we've done is we've said on from Mike Lindell,

[2:06:23.200 --> 2:06:28.880]  Thank you so much for joining us here. And I've got a clip I want to play of this lady
[2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:34.880]  before we get her on. And I was saying I would, I would love to have somebody like this lady
[2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:41.480]  be the president. Leah Mathis is our guest right now. We just had Mike Lindell on. We
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:46.160]  got Roger Stone and others coming up as well. But Leah Mathis is a well known on social
[2:06:46.160 --> 2:06:51.800]  media for being an outspoken of the truth. In fact, after posting a viral video, we played
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:56.680]  earlier this month, her TikTok was taken down and that was her fourth account. She's been
[2:06:56.680 --> 2:07:03.440]  banned on Facebook 27 times, as well as being banned on Twitter and Instagram. For the time
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:11.360]  being, you can also follow her latest for now on TikTok at lily again with three ends
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:18.360]  TikTok lily again with three ends. But she's here with us live right now on info wars.
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:23.360]  But here's the latest video on the COVID situation that got her banned again.
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:32.960]  A gentleman argue with me today saying that the unvaxxed are dying at a rapid rate compared
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:39.240]  to the vaccine. Okay, he wanted me to show him proof and not to tell him to look up his
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:46.400]  own research. So I provided him with CDC stats and the FDA where they recall the PCR test
[2:07:46.400 --> 2:07:57.240]  because they were 200% wrong on their positive cases. That was over completely ignored. I
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:01.640]  sent him article after article about how West Virginia governor said that 97% of people in
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:12.200]  the hospitals are double vaxxed. That doesn't count. So imagine still two years later thinking
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:19.120]  that this is about a virus. Imagine still thinking that this is not a power grab by
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:28.400]  the government. Imagine still, okay, thinking that mass save lives. Imagine still thinking
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:34.600]  that if you're unvaccinated, you're going to die. Even though there's a 99 points and
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:42.960]  I have had COVID. Do you know what I did? I took Advil. And that's fine. I've had worse
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:48.720]  quotes. Why do these people think that getting COVID is is not a death sentence? Also, why
[2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:57.080]  are people only dying in the hospitals? Why? Why? Why? Why are more people asking? Why?
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:03.840]  Is discernment dead? Is common sense dead? Do these people literally just watch their
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:13.320]  TV screens ago? Okay. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. But I'm going to live it. I want off.
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:21.760]  I want off this fucking ride. And I want this movie to end because I have lost respect for
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.760]  half of society.
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:32.880]  Well, my friends, we've only got her to the bottom of the hour. You're back for a full
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:37.720]  hour soon. And she joins us. Leah Mathis, thank you so much for coming on. Wow, I know
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:41.920]  you're a talk show host in your own right. Also do sports talk. But this is just crazy
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:45.600]  and it's such a common sense you're putting out. And I mean, I guess you got censored
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:47.400]  for that thought crime we just saw.
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:52.800]  Oh, I get censored all the time, Alex. I'm used to it by now, you know, it's just it's
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:56.080]  part of the game, I guess. If you're a truth teller, you have to get used to being censored
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:00.040]  because they don't want anything but the mainstream media narrative out there.
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.720]  Well, they're trying to suppress you and you're an amazingly articulate lady. So let
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:07.200]  them have it. But what about all the latest developments wanting to inject five year olds
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.040]  and up the hospitals full of people with A. D. E. from the vaccines, admitting record
[2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:16.200]  levels of microcarditis and heart attacks. I mean, we're living like in like end of day
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:18.920]  stuff. If this keeps getting worse.
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:22.800]  It's absolutely dystopian. I mean, it's Orwellian even it's if you've watched or if you read
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:28.800]  1984, which I'm sure you have, we're living in those times right now. As far as everything
[2:10:28.800 --> 2:10:33.000]  being censored, they're rewriting the definition for vaccination. Now they're rewriting the
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:38.480]  definition again to fit their narrative yet again. The CDC has more power than than the
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:41.440]  federal government. It seems and the federal government just follows along with anything
[2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:47.280]  that they choose to do and and whatever fit their agenda at the time.
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:50.760]  How do we fight back against this?
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:55.040]  You know, I think that that's everybody's question right now and we feel helpless and
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:11:00.680]  that's the biggest downfall in this current time in America as we all feel helpless. We
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:05.720]  don't know how to fight back, but the one thing that I can do is keep being vocal keeps
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:10.920]  spreading awareness keeps spreading information. Regardless of how many times they ban me or
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:14.040]  or silence me, I'm going to keep coming back. They're not going to they're not going to
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:16.800]  be able to succeed.
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:22.040]  Now tell folks about where they can find you because so much of this fight is getting outside
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:27.200]  of social media networks and promoting radio stations, TV stations, people's private websites,
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:30.280]  folks setting up their own infrastructures like Band-Aught Video because you're you're
[2:11:30.280 --> 2:11:33.800]  a super smart lady. Once I learned about you, I watched a bunch of your videos. I'm like,
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:37.360]  just leave us better videos than I do. And there's so many really amazing people like
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:41.680]  you out there that are being suppressed. So folks don't hear about them.
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:46.760]  Yeah, I mean, that's a part of the game. If you, you know, well, better than anybody else,
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:51.360]  Alex, how they, they, they only want their narrative out there and they only want their
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:55.160]  soldiers out there, the people that are going to pair it, the mainstream media, the virtue
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:59.280]  signaling and everything else. They only want those people to have a platform because I
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:03.480]  have been harassed and bullied by, by those people and they don't get censored. But all
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:08.080]  I have to do is post an article about Agenda 21 or just most recently, I just posted something
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:13.520]  about the new patent that was approved for digital surveillance with a credit score and
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:18.320]  it was banned for miss or for what was it, a community guideline. How it was an actual
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:23.400]  article and it was an actual patent number, but that, that violates community guidelines.
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:28.480]  So as far as finding me, my only outlet right now is Tik Tok because everything else has
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:32.400]  been banned. I am, I'm a bad girl, I guess.
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:38.540]  Well, what I like is, is that you're not backing down and you're persevering over and
[2:12:38.540 --> 2:12:43.000]  over again. So many well-spoken, articulate people get slapped down and they just go away.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.520]  No, the answer is keep coming back with perseverance because people are looking for the truth desperately
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:48.520]  right now.
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:53.960]  Absolutely. I totally agree with you. And if we roll over and do what they want, then
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:57.920]  we're submitting to, to the establishment and the system and what they want us to do.
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:01.880]  That's what they're trying to do with these illegal mandates and this criminal gaslighting
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:05.440]  and this berating and virtue signaling. They want to beat us down to the point where we
[2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:10.360]  feel defeated and we roll over and we give up and we just submit. And that is not what
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:14.480]  Americans stamp for and that's not, not who we are.
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:17.280]  In fact, that's something I was planning to do today, but I always get behind and don't
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:22.680]  get to most of what I say I'm on a cover. I saw this footage on Instagram of four lions
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:26.840]  bringing down a giant giraffe and it takes them, you know, about six minutes to do it,
[2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:31.120]  holding each leg, putting weight on until it finally collapses and they, they kill it.
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:34.760]  But, but that's what they're doing to America. There's all these lions attached to us trying
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:38.160]  to pull us down, trying to destroy us, trying to make us collapse, trying to make us give
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:40.920]  up, but we've got to be aware of it and not give up.
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:45.760]  Well, I like to think that we're the lions and they're more of the hyenas. But yes, I
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:49.040]  like that analogy for sure.
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:54.520]  Where do you see things going with Biden? Like, like, what else has A and then B? What
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:14:00.680]  else have they particularly censored? What hot buttons make them really afraid of you?
[2:14:00.680 --> 2:14:06.400]  The border. Let's talk about the border. Let's talk about how the Obama administration deemed
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:13.800]  a immigration crisis at 1000 immigrants crossing the border per day. And now during this administration,
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:20.120]  there's over 6000 per day and it's no big deal. And then when Saki is asked about when
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:23.680]  is Biden going to go visit the border and she said, well, he's been to the border and
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:28.200]  then she's, you know, rebuked with that statement saying, well, no, no, he hasn't, not even as
[2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:32.360]  vice president was he at the border. She goes, well, he drove by it and they, they claimed
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:37.080]  to be the most transparent administration in history. Well, that's not transparent.
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:42.000]  My seven year old lies better than soccer. This, this border issue, this is willingly,
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:48.200]  this is on purpose and, and it's criminal. It's treason. So I don't know how we're going
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:53.400]  to going forward. We need people in Texas to step up. We need more government officials
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:59.760]  to sue this administration. We need more people to step up and take accountability for what's
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:05.560]  going on, but we can't with the media working for this administration and censoring everything
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:10.240]  they do that is wrong. It's really hard. It's really hard. We have to have people like me.
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:13.680]  We have to have digital warriors. We have to have people, have people on ground zero
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:16.800]  with their video cameras and their phones out there to get the information because it's
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:23.160]  not going to get out there any other way. Well, it's a premeditated, preordained program
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:27.120]  of agenda 21 that you just mentioned to do this. It's called replacement migration. These
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:31.040]  people will never get jobs. They're here to be permanent clients of the system just like
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:36.360]  Europe. And again, the Democrats know the world's awake to them. So they're just trying to break
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.720]  the economy and destroy it as fast as they can. I want to get your take on Biden, the
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:45.200]  midterms coming up and how they're going to segue out of Biden in the next three years.
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:49.560]  I don't see him staying there another year. Maybe I'm wrong. Lea Mathis will give us her
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:54.320]  take and find her on TikTok at Lee Lee again with three ends at the end. And there it is
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:16:02.080]  on screen. Hey, everybody. I want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:06.560]  our world. It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know the privately owned
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:13.040]  central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:20.760]  and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property,
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:26.440]  energy. They're using it to buy people to buy influence. And in the past, they created
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:30.440]  thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets, but they
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:35.440]  never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:40.560]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:46.520]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[2:16:46.520 --> 2:16:51.080]  force the collapse of civilization, making the companies they do find the only things
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:55.280]  left handed. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now. Warn everyone is
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:01.480]  the only way to stop it. All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air. We'll continue

[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:50.080]  Stay good, buy to drain problems, gas buildup and odor. Guaranteed. Just pour and add water.
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:56.240]  It's that simple. Visit the bio pros.com and see for yourself.
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:19:01.160]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:05.480]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:08.800]  didn't stand up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:13.800]  so he didn't stand up. And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:17.440]  up. Well, the global social credit score that China is putting in that's banning people
[2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:21.160]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government, you can never
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:25.680]  buy or sell again. Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:31.120]  of COVID vaccine passports. They even admit it. Now, there's going to be a carbon tax
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:34.640]  attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:38.920]  can go and what you can do. That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:43.680]  accept anything. So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and
[2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:47.040]  tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:50.600]  be targeted by this nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:20:00.640]  promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:07.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:21.800]  Well, we've got fellow thought criminal, Leah Mathis on with us and I was asking her
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:26.080]  how we stopped the tyranny and during the break, she was laying it out the real knowledge
[2:20:26.080 --> 2:20:32.240]  about who's in charge. And the main captain of this is Barack Obama. So you were laying
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:37.760]  out some of the inside intel for folks that aren't as informed as you are. Explain why
[2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:41.520]  things are so bad and how this is premeditated.
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:47.000]  Well, if you know about the Smith Month Act, it was actually originated in 1948 and it
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:53.200]  was to make sure that the media told the truth and they couldn't use propaganda to influence
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:21:00.160]  the people internationally and nationally within our own house. In 2012, Barack Obama
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:07.600]  actually revised that bill and took away the fact that you can't lie. He actually made
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:12.920]  it legal for the media to use propaganda to influence the American people. And he calls
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:17.840]  it the Modernization Act. So apparently being modernized means that you can manipulate the
[2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:21.440]  people with mis-truths and misinformation.
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:30.120]  And that needs to sink in. I mean, speak more to that and why that's so important.
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:34.680]  Okay, so parents now are being labeled as domestic terrorists and take on the school
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:39.960]  boards. Patriots are being labeled domestic terrorists because they go against the mainstream
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:45.280]  media narrative. This is all propaganda. This is to influence the masses to make the good
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:52.080]  guy seem like the bad guy. And this was the catalyst to make that happen. This is manipulation.
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:22:00.840]  This is brainwashing at its best. For those who have intellectually malleable minds, you
[2:22:00.840 --> 2:22:04.400]  watch your TV screen and they tell you the sky is green. You're going to repeat the
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:09.920]  sky is green because if you repeat a lie enough, it becomes the truth. And that's exactly
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:16.240]  what they're doing to majority of the population that still believes that the media is honest.
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:22.600]  Well, that's right. Techniques developed by the Pentagon of deception developed to fight
[2:22:22.600 --> 2:22:27.800]  al-Qaeda, which was never used against al-Qaeda is now being used against the American people.
[2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:32.240]  And they're externalizing the method that gun owners, veterans, people that challenge
[2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:37.240]  elections, people that challenge lockdowns or forced vaccine mandates or terrorists.
[2:22:37.240 --> 2:22:41.800]  What made that the official U.S. government policy in June? And now we're seeing the externalization
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:48.640]  of that hierarchy. Absolutely. They're villainizing the people that actually are descendants of
[2:22:48.640 --> 2:22:53.280]  those that fought for this country. And they're the reasons why we don't speak with a British
[2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:57.680]  accent right now. We are the descendants of those people. And let's think about that
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:02.480]  for just a moment. Literally, the federal government's hijacked. It's dissolved the
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:07.120]  borders. It's devaluing the dollar. It is selling us out to communist China. It is coming
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:11.880]  after us with poison shots. It is suppressing known treatments for COVID-19. The hospitals
[2:23:11.880 --> 2:23:17.400]  are full of people with ADE from the shots. And now they're coming and saying Americans
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:22.480]  can't have gas pipelines or oil under the UN, but Saudi Arabia needs to up its output.
[2:23:22.480 --> 2:23:27.200]  I mean, simply put, we're not just saying they're a foreign outside power. The Democratic
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:31.040]  Party works for the globalists that are ending the country as we know it. And what does an
[2:23:31.040 --> 2:23:35.840]  occupied force do? It declares the domestic real citizens terrorist. So it's just like
[2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:40.820]  the VC French in World War II. They already quietly sold out to Hitler. That's why the
[2:23:40.820 --> 2:23:45.360]  French military folded like a, you know, house of cards. And then they were given control
[2:23:45.360 --> 2:23:49.360]  of the country by Hitler. And so that's what globalists are. They are collaborators that
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:52.400]  have sold out the country to multinational corporations.
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:56.520]  Absolutely. And they're going to continue to do so until something happens where the
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:24:00.680]  people unite and we stand together. And they're seeing that slowly right now. It won't be
[2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:05.240]  televised. The revolution never will be. But you are seeing Black Lives Matter, you know,
[2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:10.840]  from an arm with patriots in New York City the other day, protesting these mandates.
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:14.640]  And it's only going to get bigger. And in Atlanta. And in Atlanta and all. Exactly.
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:19.120]  That's really scaring the system. Yes. Oh, that's their biggest fear. Their biggest
[2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:23.920]  fear is unification of Americans because they have worked so hard and they've spent so money,
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:27.360]  so much money trying to divide us. And they still continue to do so.
[2:24:27.360 --> 2:24:31.360]  Why do you think even the good Republicans like Rand Paul and others won't get into the
[2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:34.960]  great reset, the new role order? When Klaus Schwab's like, this is all great government.
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:39.080]  We have seized America. I mean, he's on his website saying we control them now. It is
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:43.440]  we are going to shut that energy off and teach them that we are in command. And it's like
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:48.520]  some crazy German dude that looks like a James Bond villain. And then our own leaders are
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:52.520]  pointing out to Americans. This is a foreign attack.
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:56.800]  In my own personal opinion, as much as I've researched the deep state and the shadow government
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.560]  that we know is really running things because Biden can't even form a coherent sentence.
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.920]  We know that he is not the one in charge making these decisions. I think that there's a lot
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:10.000]  of darkness that that even we don't know about. And I think that if if it was exposed, I think
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:14.320]  that half of society would not know how to absorb that information.
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:17.920]  I think that the people in power, there's a lot of rhinos. And that's actually why I
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:21.800]  left the Republican Party and consider myself constitutionalist. But I think they're scared.
[2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:25.680]  I think there's a lot of things that go on behind closed doors, a lot of threats, a lot
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:31.040]  of blackmail, a lot of things like that, which, you know, inhibit honest men from from being
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:32.040]  on it.
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:36.480]  Well, that's right. They already shot at Brian Paul and broke his ribs and punctured his
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:41.680]  lung. They already hit Scalise. They've already attacked him when he goes outside. And so,
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:47.120]  yeah, they're hunted. And the Southern Power Law Center and ADL run the major Nazi groups
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:50.760]  in the country. And then they'll, I mean, they'll just come shoot your ass. So yeah,
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:51.760]  it's serious.
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:55.800]  No, it's very serious. There's things, you know, as a part of George Parnell instead
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:25:59.240]  of best, it's a big club and you ain't in it. And there are things that they do behind
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:02.640]  closed doors. And even out in the open, if you pay attention, little hand symbols, they'll
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:06.840]  make to each other. And then their facial expressions change and they turn around quickly
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:10.760]  and then, you know, they, they are all flustered afterwards. You have to pay attention to the
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:14.840]  little things, the details. And they always tell on themselves, you know, they always,
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:18.320]  they reveal the truth without trying to reveal the truth. You just have to read between the
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:19.320]  lines.
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:23.040]  Well, you're absolutely right. Well, I want to get you up again and hell you ought to
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:27.160]  come co-host for us sometime or do the fourth hour because you're being nice and pausing
[2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:32.280]  for me to talk. But we got two and a half minutes to break. Hit us with another rant
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:35.080]  that they're trying to censor.
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:39.320]  Another rant that they're trying to censor. Well, let's see. Well, let's talk about how
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:44.600]  the, the FDA panel was caught live on television when they were trying to approve the vaccine
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:49.280]  for five to 11 year olds. And it was unanimous that they approved it. But then when they
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:55.320]  had that little video tape, one of the advisors was saying, how will we know if, you know,
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:59.540]  the vaccine's safe unless we distributed to the people. These people are trying to give
[2:26:59.540 --> 2:27:05.280]  our children mRNA when all the animals in the trials died. So what did they do? They
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:10.120]  just stopped those trials. And now let's just give it to the American children. Okay, the
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:17.640]  CEO of Pfizer has not been vaccinated. Pfizer employees are exempt from being vaccinated.
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:20.800]  Immigrants at the border are exempt from being vaccinated. And if you talk about that on any
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:26.600]  platform whatsoever, shut down for misinformation when it's all factual information.
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:32.120]  And let that sink in what you just said. The board members that just voted to inject five
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.640]  year olds and up with an experimental shot said we won't know if it works till we give
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:40.680]  it to them. But they know in all the previous studies, it kills the majority of the animals
[2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:46.040]  in some studies, all of them. I mean, wow, this is premeditated murder out in the open.
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:51.360]  Absolutely. It's a war crime. We are at war, right?
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:56.040]  Gut level, Leah, though, it seems like you're optimistic that we're going to win.
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:00.600]  I, you know, it's better to have faith and I am a faithful woman. I believe that good
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:07.240]  resides over evil and good will always win in triumph over evil. There's no way with
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:11.360]  with all the people and there's a lot more of us. I mean, we are we outnumber, we are
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:15.920]  the majority. These people that you see on TV over and over again, they are not the majority
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:19.920]  no matter how hard they try to convince you that they are. They're not. We are the majority
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:24.680]  and we will win. We win every time. I mean, we're Americans. We're undefeated.
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:30.560]  Wow. Well, I'm sold and I really appreciate you. Please join us again. Anytime you've
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:35.080]  got breaking news, that's Leah Mathis. You can find her on Tik Tok at Lee Lee again with
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:39.320]  three ends at the end. There it is. Wow. Thank you so much.
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.720]  Thank you. All right, we got the guy who was just on
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:49.920]  Tucker Carlson again, Dr. Darren Betty. He's going to be on talking about what really happened
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:57.200]  on January 6. Stay with us. We'll be right back. If you're concerned about the power,
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:04.040]  you're listening to this message in the weekend of Friday, October 22, 2021. This is your

[2:29:53.120 --> 2:29:58.680]  the same time. Thank you all for your support info or store.com. If you're ruthless mega
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:03.200]  corporations have taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to
[2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:08.720]  destroy the middle class in any form of operability, you've got to divide and conquer the public
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:13.840]  so they don't know they're being targeted. That's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves
[2:30:13.840 --> 2:30:19.680]  in the name of LBGT and African American rights and all the rest of it all over the world.
[2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:23.720]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:28.600]  China and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:33.680]  the big tech and the central banks in other zone. So this is a criminal takeover and when
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:40.280]  you look at the new super class, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's
[2:30:40.280 --> 2:30:44.320]  the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff and their families,
[2:30:44.320 --> 2:30:51.160]  it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who are all exempt from the poison shots but
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:55.080]  not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true
[2:30:55.080 --> 2:31:01.200]  discrimination that's going on. The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with
[2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:06.960]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out. And they're
[2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:11.400]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the creator and
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:17.840]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that
[2:31:17.840 --> 2:31:24.480]  famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:30.840]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their
[2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:36.520]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[2:31:36.520 --> 2:31:41.720]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who
[2:31:41.720 --> 2:31:45.840]  is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now
[2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:50.520]  more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:55.000]  in setting up is safe handling. And we are opposing the one world government and the
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.320]  mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:31:57.320 --> 2:32:02.600]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:07.360]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr.
[2:32:07.360 --> 2:32:11.200]  Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:15.280]  skills, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:18.480]  that too. You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know, and I got really excited
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:23.880]  about that. So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:29.240]  my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:33.680]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[2:32:33.680 --> 2:32:38.080]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:42.800]  I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:47.120]  It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:51.280]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[2:32:51.280 --> 2:32:52.280]  own hands.
[2:32:52.280 --> 2:33:00.080]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[2:33:00.080 --> 2:33:04.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:04.120 --> 2:33:21.000]  Dr. Darren J.B. is our guest.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:32.200]  So I've been on air 28 years and I've learned a lot. In fact, I'd learned more in a year
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:35.760]  now that I learned the previous five or six years. That's part of getting older and having
[2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:37.260]  experiences.
[2:33:37.260 --> 2:33:41.440]  But I remember in the 90s, warning people about certain militias that were calling for
[2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:46.680]  violence and saying, clearly, that's a Fed running those. And then all these other militias
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:51.640]  would say, you're against militias. You're against the Second Amendment. You must be
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:55.800]  a Fed. I'm like, no, I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in lawful militias and
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:34:00.000]  I believe citizens should be like civil defense. And I'm not even against people having militias.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:04.840]  You know, if they're like a civil defense club and don't call for pipe bombing people.
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:10.120]  And then it would always turn out that indeed it was Feds running the groups who'd even
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:17.200]  been attacking me saying, don't listen to Jones. You know, he's he's a Fed or Jones
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:18.200]  more recently.
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:23.480]  He says Q is run by the deep state. Why Q says Trump's invincible. And we know it was
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:27.200]  all a cut out. And so I've been proven right over and over again. But you've got to be
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:31.440]  an idiot not to understand this. We had a million people, the Trump rally at the ellipse,
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:36.120]  the left's trying to conflate that with the 500 600 that went the capital, the majority
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:40.240]  of those waved in by police that were told to stand down. And being there that day, there
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:44.920]  were provocateurs everywhere saying, attack, attack, a bunch of them looked like antifa.
[2:34:44.920 --> 2:34:50.000]  They were a bunch of, you know, theater geek types up on platforms saying, get in there,
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:53.600]  get in there. And by the time I showed up the capital, I said, turn back, don't go in.
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:57.520]  You're we're gonna have a Kent state. Somebody's gonna get killed. And indeed that happened.
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:04.960]  The reason I tell that story is this same thing that happened 20 years ago in the nineties
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:11.160]  or 25 years ago to me happened again. I started, you know, having people like Dr. Bede on the
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:14.760]  show after he'd been on Tucker's and had big articles in revolver. That's what I'm getting
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:19.280]  emails and calls saying, you better not say there were any feds there. You're saying we're
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:24.360]  feds. And I said to those people, I'm not saying you're a fed. I'm saying, clearly some
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:29.400]  of these people were feds. No, no, no, there weren't feds provocaturing. Don't look into
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:34.160]  that or you're saying we're all feds. So that same tactic was done again to me. And I'm
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:40.240]  like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a little weird here. So he only had, you
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:44.240]  know, 10 minutes or so on Tucker, we'll go a little bit the next hour and then Roger
[2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:48.200]  Stone's coming up with a lot of breaking news. So I wanted him to have a chance to talk more
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:52.360]  about this, but I'm not here like the French Inquisition or the Spanish Inquisition saying
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:56.000]  you're a fed. That's a fed. This is a fed. But I am here to be able to look at the evidence
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:02.480]  and talk about people that provocatured like this Ray Epps guy, not being arrested. But
[2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:07.720]  Owen Schreuer, who was there and did nothing and told people not to go in, he's been arrested.
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:11.840]  And now they want to arrest me. They're saying they're trying to claim I did this. So it's
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:15.320]  really wild to try to stop people going in the building with police permission, by the
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:19.520]  way, and to be them saying arrest me in the news, but then people that are like attack,
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:25.080]  go in and burn it down, get them, get them. They're all protected. So Dr. Darren Beatty
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:29.080]  is a former professor of political science Duke University who went on to serve in the
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:33.080]  White House as an advisor and speechwriter to President Trump. He's also the founder
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:38.600]  of revolver news, revolver.news. So we're here talking about things we're not supposed
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:43.400]  to talk about according to the super patriots, Darren, but you've been vindicated in the
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:47.280]  last four or five months exposing this. It's now come out that indeed there were feds and
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:51.080]  informants and they did provocateur. And since you did that, it forced the FBI to come out
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:55.240]  and admit that myself and Trump and Roger Stone, because they've got all our phone records,
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:59.240]  were not coordinating what happened that day. That made us look like idiots. That was a
[2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:04.120]  disaster for America. And for the 10 day investigation we wanted the Senate. So I'm done ranting.
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:07.440]  I want you to be able to flesh out what's happened and unfolded since you were on Tucker
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.440]  a few days ago.
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:13.880]  Well, first of all, thanks for having me on. And this is a very important subject. And
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:20.520]  as you pointed out, you've been knowledgeable and have known the basic truth about how the
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:25.720]  government infiltrates various militia groups for a long time. And this revolver.news piece
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:31.560]  that you mentioned that covers this particular fellow Ray Epps and his apparent role in orchestrating
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:38.640]  the first breach of the Capitol. This piece actually concludes because Thomas Massie really
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:43.960]  drew attention to the Ray Epps article in his interrogation of the Attorney General,
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:49.800]  Merrick Garland. And so our piece fittingly concludes with a little bit about Merrick Garland.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:55.440]  And it really reminds people that this is not Merrick Garland's first rodeo. He's been
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:38:01.760]  involved in the quote, unquote, domestic extremism beat since the nineties when these infiltration
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:08.240]  operations really started to kick into high gear. So let's start from the beginning.
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:12.120]  Who is this fellow Ray Epps? I don't know if you've shown some of the video footage
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:16.000]  yet to your audience, but I think we've shown it in the last week. Quite a bit. We've shown
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:19.960]  your Tucker clips as well. But yeah, that's important to add. No wonder they didn't want
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:24.440]  you investigating this, because since you did the best focus on this and Tucker did,
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.440]  this is now the subject of ongoing hearings in Congress with the Attorney General. So no
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:32.280]  wonder you're under attack. I'm under attack. Tucker's under attack because we are right
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:34.320]  over the target on this.
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:39.880]  Absolutely. So I mean, let me just kind of contextualize what this video is. So in the
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:46.320]  mountains of footage that we have on one six and the events leading up to one six, as far
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:53.400]  as I'm aware, this is the only footage of someone the day before calling repeated occasions
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:59.280]  to multiple different groups saying, we need to go into the Capitol. We need to go into
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:03.320]  the Capitol. There are all kinds of Trump supporters there. There was Black Lives Matter.
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:06.920]  There are all these different groups that had all these different agendas. It seems
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:13.800]  like this individual Ray Epps was focused on one specific agenda going into the Capitol.
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:17.880]  Now it would have been one thing if it's just some crazy guy the evening before, and that's
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:23.520]  the last that we heard of him. But on the next day, on that fateful day, January 6th,
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:29.520]  it's a veritable where's Waldo. This guy Ray Epps is everywhere. He's directing people
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:34.880]  to the Capitol. In fact, as the president was speaking, he was directing people to the
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.160]  Capitol. He said, this is where our problems are. Go to the Capitol. Go to the Capitol.
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:46.040]  Then sure enough, seconds before the initial breach in the Capitol, Ray Epps is there.
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:53.760]  He whispers into somebody's ear and then two seconds later, that person conducts the first
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:58.040]  breach. That's right. He's right there. When the first barriers are knocked down, when
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:03.760]  the first quote breach begins, I mean, this guy is a field marshal of this whole operation.
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:10.200]  And so a couple interesting things to point out. Some very concrete and factual, some
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:17.080]  subjective, but very suggestive and I think important. The subjective part of it that
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.720]  I think I encourage your viewers to watch these videos.
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:25.400]  And there he is directing him to ram a fence over a cop that's crushed under it. Why hasn't
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:30.960]  the FBI arrested his ass? It's on video. He's he provocateurs and commands people to ram
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:35.120]  over police. And then he's not been arrested, but Owen Schreuer is facing years in prison
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:36.120]  for nothing.
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  No, exactly. And this is something I want to get to very soon. But I just want to point
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:46.000]  out the subjective element is this, is that I do think there are a lot of people on January
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:51.440]  6th. Emotions were high. The government's been screwing us. People were angry and they
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:56.200]  got caught up in the crowd psychology, let their anger get the best of them. And they
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:41:00.880]  made maybe a foolish decision. Do they deserve to be labeled domestic terrorists for that?
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:05.520]  No, but people got caught up in the anger. The interesting thing about Epps, though,
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:13.040]  is if there's one word to describe his disposition and his behavior on that day, it's professional.
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:20.120]  This guy is not angry. This guy approaches the entire event with a cool detachment of
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:26.680]  a seasoned professional. He's very calm throughout. He's very authoritative throughout. People
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:31.640]  just listen to him is actually remarkable how people just listen to him. But he's very
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:37.680]  cool. He's very detached. He's very professional. And that kind of emotional detachment from
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:44.240]  the situation is in pretty stark contradiction to the radical nature of what he's actually
[2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:49.520]  suggesting. And I think that really is a huge red flag in terms of somebody being a
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:53.480]  provocateur versus being someone who's just angry and caught up.
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:58.200]  Well, I remember seeing him and getting the willies like that day or the day before thinking
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:02.160]  what a look at him saying that is a creepy bad dude. I mean, out of all the people,
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:06.520]  I'm not like paranoidly walking around looking for that. And as minute I saw him alarm bells
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:07.520]  went off.
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:13.080]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And look, and you see, he's right there as as the very first
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:17.560]  breach of the capital occurs. Now, the question is, why is he a free man? Why hasn't he been
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:22.360]  arrested? Why do the fed seem to have no interest in him when they have interest in everybody
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:26.240]  else? They have interest in you, they have interest in Shroyer, everybody else? Well,
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:30.160]  that's a very interesting question. And in fact, to understand the full context of this
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:36.680]  question, you have to know that Ray Epps actually was among the first 20 people that the feds
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:41.880]  put on their January 6 most wanted list. They pretended at least that they wanted to know
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:42.880]  who he was.
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:47.000]  And then they did their stick where they say, oh, we're calling on the public to help us
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  identify.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:52.240]  All right, Dr. Beatty, stay there. We'll be right back. We're right back. This is really
[2:42:52.240 --> 2:42:55.240]  important. And then he'll be with us a little bit at the next hour, then Roger Stone's coming
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:43:02.520]  up with big why do my enemies Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday, October 22, 2021
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:08.040]  with a very important update for supporters of info wars. Several of our best selling

[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:41.560]  whatever ingredients you can get whenever you have enough to make some, even if it's
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:42.560]  a smaller run, do it.
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:46.720]  If you got a very small run into the product that's been sold out, and that is Rain Force

[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:57.640]  at current sales rates. So get great products to support the info war at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:03.080]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:07.040]  happening in the atmosphere. But if you look at all the different studies reports about
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:11.720]  my NASA and other governments, other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:18.520]  with the climate. The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:23.240]  So yes, climate change is totally real. But notice first they called it global freezing
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:26.680]  back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and that didn't really
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:30.680]  happen the way they wanted it to. Okay, now it's just climate change. But did you know
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:36.640]  that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:42.720]  Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have weather control trees from 1979.
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:47.560]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:51.480]  two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:56.800]  engines to control the weather. So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:01.280]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioPros and how they're creating amazing products.
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:06.800]  We've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation products

[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:29.280]  You see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.120]  and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:37.680]  this great recent. Well we're now living in it. The purposeful collapse of the third world
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:42.320]  and the first world, none attached to the tyrannical corporate world government. Total
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:47.800]  censorship, no due process, destruction of the family and then incrementally more and
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:53.720]  more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:47:00.160]  This is what Info Wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[2:47:00.160 --> 2:47:20.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:34.160]  When the evening sun goes down, you will find me hanging down the nightlife.
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:39.040]  Dr. Darren J. Beatty is our guest. He is the owner and also one of the best writers over
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:44.960]  at revolver.news. And I'm not ready to talk about all this shit because I'm going to see
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:50.400]  these people expose themselves. I haven't even told Darren about this yet.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:53.320]  But now that I see what the committee is saying and doing and what their, quote, witnesses
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:59.440]  are saying and what's being quoted, my worst concerns are starting to become clear that
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:04.440]  there was pretty much a group in the White House as well and without that was actually
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:09.720]  working with the deep state provocateur operation and planned for something far worse to happen
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:15.720]  that day. But by the grace of God, it basically was a dud like an explosive that goes off.
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:20.880]  But it doesn't fully detonate. It was meant to be hundreds of times worse.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.000]  And again, I'm not at liberty to talk about this yet, but I'm not stupid. And I've been
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:32.680]  around the block a few times and I'm not a paranoid person. I just go off the facts.
[2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:36.680]  And this was really, really a nasty operation. Now you've got these Pentagon whistleblowers
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:41.320]  that have come out and exposed the fact that there was people in the Pentagon that were
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:47.400]  manipulating and trying to set something up on January 6th as well. And so we're really
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:54.520]  blessed that this didn't turn out even worse. But going back to Dr. Beatty here, Doc, you
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:49:01.120]  were getting into the fact that this guy has not been arrested. He was on the most wanted
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:04.240]  list, but then they suddenly took him off. Please continue.
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:09.520]  Yeah. So he was on the most wanted list and the FBI did their thing similar to what they've
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:15.040]  done with this as of yet unsolved pipe bomb issue that they've claimed, oh, we really
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:20.040]  want the public's help in identifying this guy. And the internet got to work and it took
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:25.560]  the internet like a couple of days to identify REAPs and crickets from the FBI. Now that
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:31.200]  he was identified, they seemingly had no interest in him. And then about five months later,
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:38.040]  they quietly and very mysteriously simply scrubbed REAPs off of their site completely.
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:44.720]  And one of the many scoops within the Revolver.News piece is we were able to interpolate the exact
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:51.760]  day that they scrubbed EPS off of there. It happened to be the very day after Revolver.News
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:59.720]  ran a major investigative story on an oath keeper, the head of the oath keepers, which
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:04.960]  was I think very interesting timing. And so we don't know why they scrubbed it. The timing
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:12.600]  is very suspicious. And you know, a lot of a lot of answers that we don't have. And I
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:18.080]  think it's worth kind of providing some some context into this is to say that it's one
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:22.960]  thing for the feds to basically have known that something was going to happen on one
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:27.960]  six and they did nothing to stop it. They just knew and they let it happen on purpose.
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:34.160]  As damning enough due to the political ramifications of this new domestic war on terror against
[2:50:34.160 --> 2:50:39.960]  all Trump supporters. But it increasingly looks like the truth is darker still. And
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:45.040]  in fact, tracks much more closely with what we now know the feds role to have been in
[2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:51.140]  the Michigan kidnapping case, which is not simply one of having passive informants passing
[2:50:51.140 --> 2:50:58.140]  on information to their handlers, but that we have key individuals playing proactive
[2:50:58.140 --> 2:51:04.720]  incitement roles in the event. And that's even more of a scandal than simply knowing
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:09.640]  and letting it happen. But that seems to track what we see. It seems to track what we know
[2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:16.200]  about Michigan. And it seems to track the entire history of the government's infiltration
[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:22.260]  operations into the various militia groups, which Merrick Garland has been a key instrumental
[2:51:22.260 --> 2:51:26.600]  figure in overseeing going all the way back to the 90s, which is very important for your
[2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:27.600]  audience to understand.
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:32.920]  Well, that's right. We were talking just a few days ago, me and one of my crew members
[2:51:32.920 --> 2:51:37.480]  with a young man going through ROTC, he's about to be commissioned as an officer. And
[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:45.200]  he said, even before this happened, going back about two years ago, before January 6, 95%
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:51.320]  of their training is right wingers and conservatives and gun owners in a revolution, how the military
[2:51:51.320 --> 2:51:57.920]  is going to have to crush domestic terrorists. So even before Trump got removed from office,
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:52:03.280]  the deep state of bureaucracy was preparing for a war with the American people. So obviously,
[2:52:03.280 --> 2:52:07.600]  just like Michigan, which did turn out to be a staged event by the FBI, they are doing
[2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:12.160]  that again here. And they're obviously planning it again for the midterms. That's my really
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:16.400]  big concern is that they're really gearing up through the groups, the Southern Poverty
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:19.120]  Law Center, ADL and others control.
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:25.320]  Absolutely. And just on this point about the militia infiltration operations going back
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:32.640]  to the 90s, there's a mainstream researcher, real expert in quote unquote, domestic extremism
[2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:38.040]  called JM Berger. And he has an article on the entire history of the infiltration operations
[2:52:38.040 --> 2:52:43.160]  going back to the 90s. And he refers to an operation that I'm sure you're very familiar
[2:52:43.160 --> 2:52:48.080]  with and your audience, thanks to your extensive knowledge, is probably very familiar with
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:54.040]  called a Pat Khan. And his description of Pat Khan goes as follows. This is the domestic
[2:52:54.040 --> 2:53:01.320]  extremism researcher. He said, in 1990, the FBI began picking up on rumors about an effort
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:08.480]  to reconstitute a notorious terrorist gang known as the order. To prevent the rise of
[2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:17.640]  a second order, FBI undercover agents would become it. To prevent the rise of another
[2:53:17.640 --> 2:53:23.800]  terrorist group, the FBI would have to become it. And sure enough, Pat Khan was launched
[2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:28.920]  with the establishment of a honeypot militia type organization that was set up for the
[2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:36.680]  express purpose of an entrapment operation such as this. And so given the key and integral
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:43.760]  role that now AG Garland played in these infiltration operations in the 90s, we have to reformulate
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:50.800]  JM Berger's statement and ask very directly, very pointedly, very damningly, is it also
[2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:59.240]  the case that in order to prevent this fictional MAGA insurrection, the feds essentially had
[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:05.640]  to invent one. They had to become the insurrection. And does that explain all of these damning
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:13.760]  examples of key figures who seem to play key roles in the events of 16, going free, feds
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:18.400]  not interested in them. And meanwhile, all the little figures, all the people have done
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:23.160]  nothing. A lot of them are rotting in jail. And there are a lot of people like you that
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:27.680]  have nothing to do with it, that the feds are interested in for political reasons.
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:32.240]  Well, we also have a lot of former veterans of PsiOps. Let me have it on screen right
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.160]  here from OAN earlier in the week, coming out and saying this is classified stuff we
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:41.040]  developed. We never even use it on radical Islamist overseas. It was seen as too immoral.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:45.600]  But he said they're now publicly using it. And he lists names against the American people.
[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:51.720]  Again, that's deception and disinfo against us, claiming that we are evil and all these
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:56.520]  horrible things. And that is Pentagon directed. So here's the Q movement we know. Yeah, they
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:55:01.040]  use 4chan and 8chan as the front. But that was former intelligence operatives. And I
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:04.280]  have the sources. I'm not supposed to give them out of your own air. But we know the
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:08.840]  story of Q folks. I told you this years ago. And it was actually the deep state Democrats
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:12.960]  with Barack Obama basically in control of Q the whole time.
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:19.760]  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't have any special insight into that. I would only say that if
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:28.520]  Q is actually an operation from the Pentagon, it's surprising in the very narrow sense that
[2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:33.760]  I'm amazed to see anything effective coming out from the Pentagon, because I'm simply
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:37.440]  not impressed with the intelligence of people at the Pentagon. So if they actually pulled
[2:55:37.440 --> 2:55:45.200]  off Q, then that's that's impressive in a certain way. Well, I mean, let me be clear.
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:50.200]  It was criminal elements using the system, some in some out in different agencies, the
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:55.000]  CIA, mainly the Atlantic Council, people like that. But yeah, they created an invincibility
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:58.920]  narrative of Trump that Trump was secretly preparing a military coup. They even tried
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:02.600]  to present Trump later with this to get him to go with it so they could arrest him. They
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:08.040]  were trying to get Trump to try a coup so they could do a counter coup and bring in
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:13.160]  martial law. No, I mean, this is very interesting. And so I'm not an expert in in in Q, but I'm
[2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:18.920]  just as a casual familiarity with it. In my sense is that part of its effectiveness is
[2:56:18.920 --> 2:56:25.680]  that it draws upon two illusions that are really seized upon by people on the right
[2:56:25.680 --> 2:56:30.480]  in the United States. And one of those illusions is that like the military is on their side,
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:34.720]  that the military is somehow going to protect them, that the military are the good guys.
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:40.040]  I think conservatives and people on the right desperately want to believe in this, not only
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:47.680]  good, but also competent military when I think that all of the facts fly in the face of both
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:52.200]  of those narratives, I don't think that the DoD is certainly at the highest levels are
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:58.280]  not advancing the interest of the American people. And as for the DoD's competence, well,
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.280]  I'd say just look to the recent example of Afghanistan, which is not terribly encouraging,
[2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:08.760]  but I think there are 100% agree with you. And I think Trump, who I know you work for
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:13.520]  and I respect him as well, he bought into the military was loyal to the top and we're
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:16.880]  good guys. When they were his biggest enemies, million others stay right there. I want to
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:21.000]  come back and ask where all this goes now, and what you expect them to pull the next
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:26.880]  12 months during the midterms because I mean, their whole architecture, their whole posture
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:31.960]  is that the right wing, you know, soccer moms are going to machine gun everybody and blow
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:35.360]  everything up. They're doing on the straight face. And as you said, Garland was put in
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:39.800]  there because he ran these operations before with Eric Holder, I should add. So we'll be
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:46.600]  right back. Stay with us. Hour number four, Rodgers John as well. By now, you've heard
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:53.840]  me talk about I am taping this update on the morning of Friday, October 22 2021. Listeners
[2:57:53.840 --> 2:57:59.480]  who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects of Rain Force Ultra should
[2:57:59.480 --> 2:58:04.200]  be excited to know that we've got a limited supply of it in stock, but it'll be sold out
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:09.960]  at current sales rates by Monday morning. Despite that fact, we're still offering a major discount
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:15.040]  of 25% off. It is an amazing, new tropic. I went to one of the top labs in the country
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:20.720]  and I said I want very powerful, quick acting, extremely clean, new tropic that wears off
[2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:24.160]  quick because I want to be able to take it. If I've got to work till 10 at night, take
[2:58:24.160 --> 2:58:30.160]  it at seven and for it to wear off by 10. And that's exactly what they did with Rain Force
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:33.880]  Ultra. Now we have other great products like Turbo Force that last for 10 hours. It's a
[2:58:33.880 --> 2:58:37.480]  different formula. It's over the top powerful. So strong. I can't even take it. By the way,
[2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:42.560]  it's sold out right now. The Rain Force Ultra is really something special is 25% off limited
[2:58:42.560 --> 2:58:51.960]  supply. We'll sell out early next week in full or stored.com. If you only knew the power
[2:58:51.960 --> 2:59:02.960]  of the dark side, join Bill Gates. And together we will defeat humanity. Then our God, Saint
[2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:11.800]  will reward us with eternal life. That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They
[2:59:11.800 --> 2:59:17.840]  must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[2:59:17.840 --> 2:59:23.000]  Darwinistic system. And in a way, they're right. If we let them lie to us and dumb us
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:28.160]  down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out
[2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:35.120]  in the open. We really deserve what's happened to us. So I asked you now, are you going to
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:41.160]  step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble
[2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:50.680]  my efforts. The front lines of the fight is info wars.com leading a frontal assault on
[2:59:50.680 --> 3:00:12.080]  the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. All right, Dr. Darren J. Beatty is
[3:00:12.080 --> 3:00:18.320]  our guest at Darren J. Beatty on Twitter of Oliver.com. He'll be with us another 10, 15
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:23.400]  minutes, and then Roger Stone is coming up. He wants to get into election fraud in 2022
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:27.520]  and some big news he's got. When Roger reaches out, it's always big news. Usually it's me
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:30.880]  just getting him on for some subject. I've got that usually pretty well, so that should
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:35.720]  be very informative. I've been going back to you, Doc. I've got a lot of the questions
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:39.400]  here. I've got a lot of points to make, but what else is on your radar screen concerning
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:46.200]  January 6th? Well, I'd like to see all of these events and all this research play out
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:52.680]  to its conclusion. As you know, there are a number of people that Revolver has highlighted
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:57.080]  in terms of the curious federal protection that they seem to enjoy, and some of these
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:01:03.240]  people are very senior members of the key militia groups imputed to 1-6. We're looking
[3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:10.200]  at the issue very carefully and we hope there's some kind of resolution that actually brings
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:15.880]  to bear without any question what actually went on about 1-6. It's so important and it's
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:23.160]  not just about absolving people languishing in prison for nothing. It's much bigger than
[3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:29.920]  that. It's about absolving over half the country of suspicion of being domestic heiress, and
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:34.560]  it's about undercutting the very narrative that the government and its apparatchiks in
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:42.400]  the media are using to promote this new domestic error 2.0 narrative. There's a tremendous
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:47.560]  amount at stake and it all comes from looking at these little details and pointing out,
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:52.360]  look, we're doing major investigative reporting showing that everything that the government
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:59.600]  and the media has told us about 1-6 is a lie. Well, doctor, there's no doubt that it's
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:05.520]  unprecedented not just in history but world history. When a major country says we're basically
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:11.840]  listening moms that protest racial brainwashing, racist brainwashing as terrorists and all
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:16.680]  the rest of it, and with a straight face they say yes, this is the big threat that clearly
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:21.120]  this is an authoritarian illegitimate regime that is now trying to sell the public on the
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:28.400]  idea of engaging in commissar type political police operations. It's on a scale of 1-10,
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:34.560]  this is like a 9.7. I mean, what they're attempting to do is as bad as it gets and then where
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:36.560]  it leads us is hell on earth.
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:44.000]  No, I think it's absolutely right and what this shows is effectively, wokeness is the
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:51.560]  de facto official ideology of the American regime or what I've come to call the globalist
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:58.040]  American empire. And you see that in every dimension of American life, you see that in
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:04.200]  every major institution in America, wokeness is the de facto official religion. In fact,
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:09.400]  spokesmen for the State Department just came out celebrating how they have gender neutral
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:16.240]  designations now on our passports. So it's a full spectrum development. It's across
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:22.600]  every institution. It's across every sector in society. This is the new ideology of the
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:27.920]  American regime, of the globalist American empire. And I think there are two very important
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:34.800]  takeaways that people should know who object to these developments. And everyone wants
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:38.640]  to change the issue. A lot of us are angry about it, but there are two things to really
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:44.040]  understand and this is directly connected to this narrative of 1-6. And that one is
[3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:49.480]  what you began with earlier, that for the most part, all of these militia organizations,
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:55.240]  United States, if they're not explicitly honeypots, they are functionally honeypots.
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:03:59.680]  And so people need to be very careful about these groups because what a perfect idea to
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:05.560]  just set up a militia and say, hey, we're set up for the express purpose of breaking
[3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:12.760]  laws and reformulating it as, oh, we're adhering to our oaths, but we're really about people
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:17.200]  willing to break laws. And then they got the Little Fake Army. They controlled to be the
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:22.680]  trigger to bring in real martial law. Exactly. So that is one very specific thing people
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:28.720]  need to understand, that militia groups are heavily infiltrated, they're honeypots, basically
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:33.160]  stay away, be careful about it. The second, which is a broader extension of this thesis
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:43.000]  is that the national security state's injection into domestic political arena is a major,
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:49.040]  and I would say the preeminent bottleneck to any progress being made politically within
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:56.040]  the domestic sphere. Stay there. Let's talk about that back in 60 seconds.
[3:04:56.040 --> 3:05:00.240]  I am taping this up. I now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating
[3:05:00.240 --> 3:05:06.320]  amazing products. They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation

[3:06:08.240 --> 3:06:16.080]  You are listening to aninfowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:20.080]  you are the resistance.
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:32.160]  All right folks, so there is a foreign multinational globalist force taking the country over. They
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:37.880]  need to provocateur a fight with an American resistance that they control so they can discredit
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:43.280]  a resistance so that a real resistance doesn't politically take back things peacefully. They
[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:47.120]  want it to be violent. They know what Jesus Christ knew and what Martin Luther King Jr.
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:53.640]  knew and what Muhammad Gandhi knew was true that if we have the superior political philosophy
[3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:59.720]  and idea of a free market, American, pluralistic, classically liberal society, their leftist
[3:06:59.720 --> 3:07:04.480]  corporate globalist fascist system won't succeed. So they are wrapping all their surveillance
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:10.880]  and all their tyranny and all their race division promotion in the wokeness. So the private
[3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:14.200]  federal reserve is destroying the currency. They put out press releases about being woke.
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:21.880]  And then you have got hundreds of city attorneys and county attorneys and district attorneys
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:25.240]  put in by Soros and others that are literally letting murderers out of jail. They are letting
[3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:30.560]  people that rob banks and pistol whip people out the next day. A young man in a leftist
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:36.440]  city in North Texas shoots three people and they release him in a couple hours and they
[3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:41.520]  are still in the hospital. I mean this is the destabilization of the country and here
[3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:48.040]  it is. Judge Amy Jackson released a January 6th defendant from pretrial custody after
[3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:53.480]  he disavowed Trump in a letter. His lawyer suggested a political conversion. I've never
[3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:56.960]  seen anything like this, says Cernovich, and I've got the article right here. They even
[3:07:56.960 --> 3:08:02.120]  said his mental processes were letting him go. For thought crime, another one, Capitol
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:07.720]  police to open field offices. You know about that around the country. So they are just
[3:08:07.720 --> 3:08:13.840]  expanding all of this and it is so incredibly dangerous that they have gotten to this point.
[3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:19.600]  So I think that is what Dr. Darren Beatty was getting to and how it is impossible as a nation
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:23.200]  to function with these types of things going on. So what can you do? What can I do? What
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:28.520]  can Trump do? I mean I guess you've done so much just with revolver by taking it on and
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:32.720]  exposing it. You've got congressional hearings now with the Attorney General being grilled
[3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:38.040]  on just this subject. So it looks like there is some light at the end of the tunnel.
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:47.320]  There is and I think really the title of your immediate empire really underscores the operative
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:51.800]  place to focus and that is the Info War. The Info War is all that matters. That's where
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:58.120]  everything real happens. It's all about narrative control and what I'm very proud of in relation
[3:08:58.120 --> 3:09:03.800]  to what revolver.news has been able to do apart from our I would have to say world class
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:08.800]  investigative reporting is that we've been able to shape and drive narratives and therefore
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:15.040]  participate successfully in the Info War. Now in light of a lot of our reporting it's
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:22.040]  a major narrative on part of the national discourse that yes the the feds and the government
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:29.520]  probably played a key role in the events of 1-6. I think really focusing on the Info War
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:35.400]  learning how to play it in a very sophisticated way, understanding all the dimensions of information
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:40.920]  and its distribution that's the only way we can hope to win. It's not about focusing
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:47.120]  on militia groups that are controlled by the feds. It's probably at this stage not even
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:52.120]  very optimistic in terms of winning elections because again we have this machine we can
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:09:56.760]  win elections and how often does that translate into what we actually think it does. You need
[3:09:56.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  to understand where the bottlenecks are and as I laid out and as you've been an expert
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:08.440]  on for decades one of the biggest bottlenecks here is the Americans national security state.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:13.000]  You need to really figure out a way to bring it under control, bring it under underheal
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:19.120]  and one of the first steps toward that is kind of successfully unplugging this kind
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:24.840]  of dispositional right-wing conservative veneration of the national security state and getting
[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:29.640]  them to understand these guys are not your friends. These people hate you in fact. These
[3:10:29.640 --> 3:10:34.000]  people are conducting war on you. They've declared you domestic terrorists so stop
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:41.440]  saluting them, stop worshiping them. They are not your friends. I remember people fetishizing
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:46.480]  all of those people like Millie and the rest of them and these guys are true and true globalists.
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:50.600]  They are corporate elitists. Yeah, the rank and fall military are the best people you'll
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:56.520]  ever run into. A lot of them are my friends but they'll tell you on top it is a woke litmus
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:02.480]  test to get out the good people and they are turning the US military completely into a
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:07.760]  weapon of war against the American people and you said it. We just need to have a huge
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.480]  awakening here in America to this and then withdraw our consent from it and then not
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.120]  be suckered into violence against it because that's what they want. So people are like
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:20.960]  you're not tough. You don't want to have a war with these people. It's an ideology
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:25.880]  of corruption. It's a system of global corporations. It's an evaluation of the dollar. It's the
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:32.280]  corporate media waging war on us. This is a serious long-term scientific takeover and
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:38.400]  only waking up and pulling back and getting a 35,000 foot view of the globalist system
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:42.240]  gives us any chance. I mean you have to see the matrix to get out of the matrix. You can't
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:49.160]  just fight different tentacles of it. No, absolutely and unfortunately it takes some
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:54.920]  education. It takes some, you know, a very effective command of the infoward because
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:12:00.080]  again it's like there's a reason that a lot of the best critics of the national security
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:05.280]  state come from the left and that's because the leftist psychological disposition is to
[3:12:05.280 --> 3:12:12.000]  critique structures of power and those on the right want to venerate institutions like
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:16.160]  the military like the national security. But now notice how that's flipped. The left hated
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:19.840]  the national security institutions and all of it because they didn't fully control it.
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:26.520]  Now that it's theirs, they worship it. True, true and unless there are some outliers, people
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:30.600]  like, you know, Glenn Greenwald and Sange and all this, these are some of the classic
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:35.120]  critics of the national security state and one thing I really like about Revolver.News
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:40.240]  is we're helping to do that on the right. We're helping to provide the necessary software
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:45.160]  updates as it were on the right to understand this new political era that we're in in which
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:47.800]  the national security state is very much at war.
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:51.280]  Do you think Trump finally gets it? Because in hindsight he said, my God, these generals
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:55.320]  lied to my face. They were left to scum the whole time. I mean I think for Trump this
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:59.840]  was quite the educational process because he was naive about how bad a shape of America
[3:12:59.840 --> 3:13:03.520]  was in and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I mean Trump really tried hard but I think
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:07.440]  they're really scared of him if he got back in now with an even bigger landslide because
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:11.000]  he would definitely not make a lot of the same mistakes.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:16.560]  Well I certainly hope that's true and will I await with an open mind to see evidence
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:22.680]  of it. There's a lot of mistakes and again it's like Trump thought, I guess, with some
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:27.600]  sort of, you know, we can sympathize with this thinking a little bit. He thought these generals
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:31.320]  were general Patton. That's what he thought just in the same way that a lot of people
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:38.080]  think the CIA is James Bond but this is entirely fictional. The Pentagon is not, you know, full
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:42.360]  of Pattons. They would probably be the first to expel Patton and probably throw the jail.
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:46.960]  The Pentagon killed Patton. The Pentagon killed him.
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:52.760]  And the CIA is certainly not full of James Bond so like their info war has been very
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:13:57.440]  good. They've been very effective in the PR arena but that's just not what these institutions
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:03.400]  are and they're able to keep roping conservatives in and the next big thing is all they have
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:08.720]  to do is talk about China and the threat from China and I guarantee so many conservatives
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:15.480]  will come just crawling right back to the national security state in light of this new cold war
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:21.040]  with China. They're going to say, okay, they're talking about China now. Even though the American
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:25.280]  national security state has declared war on me, I'm going to side with them because they're
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:28.240]  talking about China and the weak years and such.
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:34.040]  Well, Dr. Beatty, congratulations on, I mean, it's not about credit but credit is due as
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:38.360]  people know who is most effective with the truth. You have brought this front and center
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:42.600]  to be a big issue in America and that cripples their attempts at provocaturing and false
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:47.680]  flags. It cripples their attempts to start this fight and lays the American people as
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:51.560]  the new enemy and instead take the initiative back. It's really blown up in their face right
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:58.920]  now and so they're really on their heels and you're owed a lot of credit for taking on
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:03.200]  this very, very tough subject because I know the minions of the system come after you.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:08.040]  When you touch this rail, other provocateur operations, they get very, very pissed and
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:11.720]  very, very aggressive. Revolver.News, thank you so much, Doc.
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:12.720]  Thank you.
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:13.720]  Thank you.
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:18.360]  All right, Roger Stone is waiting in the wings and is about to take over with big breaking
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:22.400]  news and nobody knows about him trying to set you up like Roger. In fact, I've got all
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:25.960]  the articles here. They're trying to set he and I up right now. He's been subpoenaed by
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:30.400]  this kangaroo thing in Congress, supposedly quarterbacking the attack on the Capitol,
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:35.720]  which he wasn't even at. So we'll talk to Roger about that. But first, 2022 elections
[3:15:35.720 --> 3:15:41.880]  and a bunch of electoral news that he wants to cover when we come back. infowars.com,

[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:14.240]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about one to 2% per year. This

[3:16:55.880 --> 3:17:05.480]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:09.880]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:16.440]  in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[3:17:16.440 --> 3:17:21.880]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:30.600]  faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:38.320]  surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:42.880]  destiny of humanity is upon us. Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:48.360]  microchips as part of the World ID and Carbon Taxes. Things only get worse from here if
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:54.120]  we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance,
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:58.480]  noncompliance. The engineers at BioProse are very excited
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:04.680]  to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market. Since their
[3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:10.480]  rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they come out with four new products.
[3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:20.520]  BioRVPro, BioMarinePro, and BioPortaPro. For decades, oil companies and other major chemical
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:26.840]  corporations have been using patented naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat
[3:18:26.840 --> 3:18:33.240]  oil spills and other toxic waste disasters. That's how powerful these naturally occurring
[3:18:33.240 --> 3:18:38.680]  microbes are. The BioProse system is light years better than traditional enzymes that
[3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:44.520]  only work once. These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank. And now it's
[3:18:44.520 --> 3:18:50.120]  available for the general public's use for the first time on the retail market, exclusively
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:59.160]  available at TheBioProse.com. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:03.880]  my heart, deep in my soul. I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:13.920]  lot of loss, like everybody else has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:21.440]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing
[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:27.880]  it all away. And I see the general public's ENA medically induced, scientifically induced
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:34.920]  behavioral, psychologically controlled tranche. And I know we're being fed into this globalist
[3:19:34.920 --> 3:19:41.560]  meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:46.400]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:51.760]  again. It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:58.760]  death and some collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:29.120]  We're about a year out, a little more than 12 months from the incredibly important 2022
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:33.120]  elections. We know there was a coup, we know there was fraud, it's overwhelming. And now
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:38.680]  we know they've declared even people protesting at school board meetings as terrorists. And
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:44.280]  the National Education Association operative that put that postulate forward has now been
[3:20:44.280 --> 3:20:51.040]  brought and put on the National Education Board by Obama. And that's who runs the White
[3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:55.600]  House is Obama in his third term here. He thought Roosevelt was the only president to
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:21:01.440]  serve three terms thing again. Here we are in Roger Stone, the guy that got Trump to
[3:21:01.440 --> 3:21:05.880]  run for office, the guy that has been the one of the number one enemies of the number
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:11.600]  one enemy of the left in this country and in battled. And of course, former cohost of
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:16.120]  the war room with Owen Shroyer joins us. He's got a lot of news on the electoral process
[3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:21.640]  and what's coming up on what's happening. And of course, the January 6th witch hunt,
[3:21:21.640 --> 3:21:26.640]  the new improved witch hunt trying to claim that Roger and I were scheming the attack
[3:21:26.640 --> 3:21:30.680]  on the Capitol with absolutely no evidence. It just gets crazier and crazier. So Roger,
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:35.200]  thanks for coming on with us, my friend. Alex, it's, it's great to be here. I feel
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:39.800]  like I'm back home. First of all, I guess I'd like to observe the fact that my good
[3:21:39.800 --> 3:21:45.920]  friend Sean Hannity is not completely correct when he says journalism in America is dead.
[3:21:45.920 --> 3:21:50.040]  There's one guy who's actually practicing legitimate journalism and that's my friend
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:55.280]  Darren Beatty at the revolver. And he has been a fountain of truth when it comes to
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:02.040]  the entire January 6th fiasco. He is a bold, fearless reporter who prints the truth. So
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:07.320]  if you're not following revolver, you need to, they really understand exactly what happened
[3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:13.720]  on January 6th and their reporting has been without parallel. Also have to salute my friend
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:18.920]  Tucker Carlson who's had the Cajones to put Darren Beatty on the air and let him expose
[3:22:18.920 --> 3:22:25.160]  the truth, not to mention info wars. So Alex, the most important thing I want to talk today,
[3:22:25.160 --> 3:22:31.640]  the thing I'm really outraged about is a statement by a gentleman named Wesley Wilcox.
[3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:37.600]  Now, Wesley Wilcox is not just the supervisor of the Marion County Board of Elections here
[3:22:37.600 --> 3:22:44.720]  in Florida. He's also the chairman of the state association of supervisors of election.
[3:22:44.720 --> 3:22:49.280]  And he has put forward an incredible memo in which he tells everybody to shut up and
[3:22:49.280 --> 3:22:56.280]  pipe down about the question of election integrity. No, but only a Republican, Wesley
[3:22:56.280 --> 3:23:03.200]  Wilcox actually says free speech is a threat to democracy. No, Mr. Wilcox, I think you
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:08.800]  have this exactly backwards. Free speech is what preserves democracy. And he's already
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:14.760]  gone so far as to say nobody's going to audit my elections and people need to stop talking
[3:23:14.760 --> 3:23:22.240]  about election integrity. I think this is a setup. You see, Marion County is in partially
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:27.920]  in the district that is in which my friend Laura Loomer is running for Congress. So what
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:33.000]  is it Mr. Wilcox has in mind? Let me point out that the last time Laura Loomer ran for
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:40.120]  Congress in a hopelessly blue district. She won on election day. She won in early voting
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:45.560]  and she was only swamped in the mail-in votes. No Republican has ever won in that district
[3:23:45.560 --> 3:23:49.240]  on election day. That's right. They're scared of her and they're all and this guy's a micro
[3:23:49.240 --> 3:23:53.200]  cousin. They're all over the country. Republicans and Democrats, but also Republicans saying
[3:23:53.200 --> 3:23:56.840]  don't question elections. That's something we have a right to do. That's something Democrats
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:02.960]  have always done. So again, this is outrageous. No, it really is. And I think it is a setup
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:08.960]  now. I think we can tell whether Mr. Wilcox is up to dirty business because they have
[3:24:08.960 --> 3:24:14.640]  upcoming municipal elections in Marion County. And I'm going to be monitoring those very,
[3:24:14.640 --> 3:24:18.720]  very closely. You know, people may not be aware of it, but there's a terrific group
[3:24:18.720 --> 3:24:24.160]  here in Florida, Defend Florida, that is working day and night to audit the last elections
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:29.200]  and turn up overwhelming evidence of fraud. If you're not following the Fed's report.
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:33.040]  So I think he protests so much. I mean, let's not look at elections. I'm not going to allow
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:37.800]  audits when that's by law. You do that. I mean, that's very suspicious.
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:42.400]  We have one million phantom voters in the state. One million people who are on the voting
[3:24:42.400 --> 3:24:48.720]  rolls who don't really exist. It's really incredible. And you can already see that you
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:55.360]  have Governor Ron DeSantis up in 2022. He is the number one enemy of the deep state.
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:00.440]  He is led on masks. He has led on censorship. He has led on election integrity.
[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:03.720]  They want to discredit him. They want to use him as an example.
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:08.400]  Absolutely. They want to show what happens to governors who stand up to the deep state.
[3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:14.440]  Soros and his pals will drop $1 billion into Florida to try to take out Ron DeSantis. Now,
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:19.600]  look, his election integrity package is not perfect. His internet censorship package is
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:23.000]  not perfect. But when it comes to COVID-19-
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:27.600]  Better all get behind him 110%. It's like Senator Cruz isn't perfect. Was you rather
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:29.600]  a Beto or Rourke?
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:35.720]  Exactly. Exactly. So look, I'm 100% for Ron DeSantis. But let me stress. Defend Florida,
[3:25:35.720 --> 3:25:41.360]  which is a totally grassroots group here in Florida, is doing the hard work with volunteers
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:47.520]  in every county and they're uncovering extraordinary results. There are one million people on the
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:51.280]  Florida rolls today who literally do not exist.
[3:25:51.280 --> 3:25:55.080]  And by the way, that's the good thing that's coming out of you and Mike Lindell and all
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:26:00.040]  the listeners fighting hard is all over the country. We're finding the real evidence so
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:05.360]  we can hopefully ferret it out and stop it before the midterms. How do we save this country?
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:08.360]  How do we get more election integrity so they can't pull the scam?
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:12.920]  Well, first of all, let's let Mr. Wilcox know we're watching. You can call his office at
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:20.640]  352-620-3290 and respectfully, don't yell, don't call non-sweet and hang up. We don't
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:24.560]  do crap like that. Tell him your name and express your disappointment that he thinks
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:29.760]  these are his elections. These are not his elections. He says, no one's touching my vote.
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:33.960]  Tell everybody the county, tell everybody his name and then give out his number again.
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:39.760]  Yes. His name is Wesley Wilcox. He's the supervisor of the Marion County Board of Elections. But
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:45.400]  more importantly, he's the chairman of the statewide association of supervisors of elections.
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:53.440]  His number is 352-620-3290. Now, we don't like anonymous calls. We don't like yelling.
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:56.880]  We don't like insults. Don't call him and tell him he's a piece of crap. Call him and
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:01.480]  tell him you objected his public statements. These are not his elections. These are our
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:08.040]  elections and free speech does not damage democracy. Free speech is what preserves democracy.
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:12.560]  This guy is nominally a Republican, but Alex, I think he's getting his talking points from
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:16.840]  the Democratic National Committee. Well, sure. We know just like the governor of Georgia,
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:20.360]  they're these Republicans that know there's fraud, but if they play nice, they get left
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:26.000]  in power. Look, what I see here is an effort to defraud Laura Loomer in her next election.
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:30.800]  They are definitely afraid of this woman because she's got guts and because she's coming and
[3:27:30.800 --> 3:27:36.240]  they know it. She's going to knock off a rhino in the primaries coming up and part of her
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:40.120]  district is in this county. So he's trying to prepare us for the fact that there's going
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:44.600]  to be shenanigans just like there was in Palm Beach County, where I believe she was cheated
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:49.080]  out of a congressional seat in the last election. So I'm going to be watching these elections
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:53.960]  coming up in the municipal elections to see if he's monkeying with the results. And let
[3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:59.480]  me tell you, Mr. Wilcox, I have got a platoon of lawyers ready to bring you to court and
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:04.760]  the citizens of Marion County won't stand for shenanigans in the upcoming elections,
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:05.760]  not for a cent.
[3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:09.000]  And you brought lawyers in and decided some big elections before. Roger, another reason
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:12.960]  the Democrats hate you and I know you you may come up as for it, but you didn't know that
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:17.680]  George W would be just as bad as Al Gore, but you helped, you know, with that whole election.
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:20.720]  And so you're not playing games. And speaking of the devil, we're going to come back and
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:26.800]  talk about elections. Do you think Trump is going to be able to run and defeat that little
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:32.200]  devil Joe Biden we've got in there? But can Joe Biden even hang on and stay in there much
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:38.360]  longer? We'll get Roger Stone's take on all of this on the other side. And Roger, what's
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:44.120]  the best website for people to find everything in stone land? Stone cold truth dot com stone
[3:28:44.120 --> 3:28:49.960]  cold truth dot com tonight at nine o'clock. I'll be on Lindell TV to talk more about this.
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:53.440]  People need to know what's going on in Florida because it's absolutely stay there. Yes,
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:29:09.560]  the Florida's the battleground. You know, I want to explain something that is absolutely
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:15.440]  seed understanding our world. It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know the
[3:29:15.440 --> 3:29:21.840]  privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[3:29:21.840 --> 3:29:27.240]  of trillions. And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[3:29:27.240 --> 3:29:31.560]  leverage that manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general
[3:29:31.560 --> 3:29:36.120]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and
[3:29:36.120 --> 3:29:41.840]  are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies
[3:29:41.840 --> 3:29:47.480]  operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the
[3:29:47.480 --> 3:29:58.080]  companies they do find the only things left handed. The engineers at bio pros are very
[3:29:58.080 --> 3:30:04.680]  excited to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market.
[3:30:04.680 --> 3:30:08.640]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they come out with four
[3:30:08.640 --> 3:30:18.720]  new products. Bio Drain Pro, Bio RV Pro, Bio Marine Pro and Bio Porta Pro for decades.
[3:30:18.720 --> 3:30:24.560]  Oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented naturally occurring
[3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:31.200]  specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters. That's how
[3:30:31.200 --> 3:30:37.160]  powerful these naturally occurring microbes are. The bio pro system is light years better
[3:30:37.160 --> 3:30:42.640]  than traditional enzymes that only work once. These bacteria begin to breed and live in
[3:30:42.640 --> 3:30:48.080]  your septic tank and now it's available for the general public's use for the first time
[3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:55.360]  on the retail market exclusively available at the bio pros dot com.
[3:30:55.360 --> 3:31:00.920]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to
[3:31:00.920 --> 3:31:04.960]  the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:09.440]  do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:14.680]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:20.080]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:24.080]  and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law and
[3:31:24.080 --> 3:31:28.440]  one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:32.600]  which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military
[3:31:32.600 --> 3:31:38.000]  grade at info or store dot com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship

[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:33.000]  because of supply chain breakdowns because we would not cut the quality of the ingredients.
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:36.640]  We could cut the quality all day and buy crap from China and never be sold out. We're not

[3:33:00.600 --> 3:33:29.600]  Jones show. Well, Roger Stone has got the answers for us is Trump really planning to
[3:33:29.600 --> 3:33:35.080]  run in 2022 because you know, the elections of 2024, but how is he going to be involved
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:40.720]  engaged in the midterms? Because that's obviously already getting ready to run in 2023 to make
[3:33:40.720 --> 3:33:45.480]  his announcement or even earlier. And what do we do to make sure that we can get Trump
[3:33:45.480 --> 3:33:51.400]  to run? And what is what does Roger Stone thinks can end up happening with Joe Biden
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:33:58.080]  who we knew was a individual over his expiration date? But but the deterioration is so accelerated
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:03.280]  now that when Roger and I first three years ago, you know, said that the presumptive candidate
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:07.720]  had had another stroke and had cognitive problems. We were censored and attacked. But even by
[3:34:07.720 --> 3:34:15.040]  the campaign, it was completely evident. Now it's begun even a bad comedy. So those those
[3:34:15.040 --> 3:34:19.880]  issues are obviously intertwined, Roger. Yeah, Alex, you're absolutely right. Look, there's
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:24.720]  been a kind of an evolution in my thinking here. I'm a veteran of 11 national presidential
[3:34:24.720 --> 3:34:31.360]  campaigns. And previously, I did not think the president would run or that he should
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:35.960]  run. I've completely changed my view. I now recognize that he is without any question
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:40.880]  our strongest candidate. He's the only one who can keep the entire America first movement
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:47.000]  united. The left fears him even more than they fear Alex Jones or Roger Stone. They're not
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:52.080]  big fans of ours in case you didn't know that. By the way, this shirt, this T shirt triggers
[3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:57.120]  the left more than anything other than a Roger Stone, do nothing wrong, T shirt. I wear this
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:01.040]  to the supermarket, people go out of their minds, out of their minds. It just triggers
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:05.840]  the left. So if you don't have an info wars T shirt, go to the web sort and get one now.
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:09.240]  By the way, that's one of our best sellers forever. It's been on about six years. It's
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:14.880]  bright red on navy blue info wars.com and info wars.com on the shoulder in the back.
[3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:19.760]  And yeah, I think that's called the info wars in your face shirt. But definitely that will
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:24.880]  that will drive them crazy, Roger. Well, and if you want to get your Roger Stone did nothing
[3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:32.440]  wrong T shirt, go to rogerstonestore.com rogerstonestore.com and you can get it there or go to stone
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:37.640]  cold truth.com in the store there. But you need to have one of these because if the country
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:43.080]  goes to hell, you can sell it to the Smithsonian for a couple million bucks. Well, I mean,
[3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:47.280]  you know, we may get shut down, you may get shut down. I mean, we've been in this fight
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:51.720]  so long, you longer than I that we've kind of gotten friends with friends with our destruction.
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:55.840]  We've kind of become acquainted with it. But man, I mean, this is an authoritarian nightmare.
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:00.040]  You were talking during the break though about the election fraud and not knowing if Trump
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:06.040]  would run because of that. Yeah, I think this is a legitimate question that the former president
[3:36:06.040 --> 3:36:12.160]  current president has to face, which is how do we guarantee that he could run a letter
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:17.480]  perfect campaign, raise all the money he needs outwork outfox out campaign them as he did
[3:36:17.480 --> 3:36:25.760]  in 2016, have an incredible comeback as he did in 2022 2020 pardon me, and then get cheated
[3:36:25.760 --> 3:36:32.600]  out of it because we do not have a free, fair honest election and Florida is is ground zero.
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:38.720]  We cannot get to 270 electoral votes without Florida. That's why I love what defend Florida
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:43.440]  is doing. This is a great group grassroots group is going into the each county and auditing
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:49.000]  to find fraud. There are one million phantom voters in the state, one million people who
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:53.360]  don't exist. This is really simple. The state board of election pardon me, the state board
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:58.080]  of health, when somebody dies, that they should be automatically removed from the roles. They
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:04.560]  should not be left on the rolls. No, that's not fraud. That's not that's not Jim Crow.
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:10.400]  There's nothing racist about that. It's logical. But the left doesn't respect logic. They don't
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:15.320]  respect the Constitution, and they don't respect the law. So the president's got to face a
[3:37:15.320 --> 3:37:20.660]  legitimate question. What will be the measure here? It's pretty simple. 2020 will tell the
[3:37:20.660 --> 3:37:27.160]  story on 2024. If we don't have an honest election, if the Democrats overwhelmingly sweep the
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:34.120]  house in the Senate with gas prices going up higher than Hunter Biden, going up faster
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:40.280]  than the scale when Brian Stelter steps on it, which is what's happening when we're being
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:46.000]  humiliated around the globe. When we're being told that we're heading to another shutdown
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:52.120]  to destroy our economy, suddenly we have food shortages. We didn't have any food shortages
[3:37:52.120 --> 3:37:57.080]  when Donald Trump was president. Suddenly we have supply chain problems. Guess what?
[3:37:57.080 --> 3:38:01.520]  We didn't have any supply chain problems when Donald Trump was president. We had the most
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:07.400]  robust productive economy in American history, and they are dismantling it as quickly as
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:12.360]  they possibly can. So I think he has to run. I think he must run. I think he's the only
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:18.200]  person with the Cajones to take these people on frontally and beat them. But what if he
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:27.720]  beats them again, but we can't get an honest count? 2022 will tell us the story for 2024.
[3:38:27.720 --> 3:38:32.080]  Once you're around somewhere, there it is, one of my friends, Richard Reeves, saw that
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:37.160]  in Austin, Texas. Somebody stuck. I did that bumper sticker on the gas pump. So Info Wars
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:41.280]  is printing a bunch of those right now to put free in all of our orders. That's really
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:49.560]  smart, but at the same time it's scary. It's up to $5 plus a gallon for unleaded in California.
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:56.440]  It's up to four bucks in Texas. So again, with him having the lowest approval rating
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:01.080]  in modern history since World War II, since they started doing approval ratings, and even
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:06.240]  those are mainly Democratic voters, they pulls with probably higher. Where does this go?
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:09.920]  What happens to the Democratic Party? Because they're trying to brand this idea that all
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:14.400]  their opposition are terrorists and shocker moms at the PTA are terrorists. That doesn't
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:18.640]  seem to be going too well. I don't remember a political party in America that declared
[3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:22.680]  its opposition terrorist before. That doesn't seem to be a very good plan.
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:26.680]  Well, first of all, Richard Reeves is a great American. You won't remember this Alex, but
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:31.320]  I wouldn't even know you if he hadn't introduced us. And I pray for his good health every day.
[3:39:31.320 --> 3:39:35.080]  He's a patriot. You're absolutely right. The Democratic Party has declared war on the
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:39.320]  middle class. They've declared war on the American people. So if you're a parent and
[3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:44.720]  you're concerned about your kids reading hardcore pornography in the ninth grade or in that
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:49.920]  sixth grade, and you go to a school board meeting to object, well, they drag you out
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:53.580]  because you're a domestic terrorist. No, parents have a right to speak up for their
[3:39:53.580 --> 3:39:54.580]  children.
[3:39:54.580 --> 3:40:02.160]  Roger, I had never in my life at 47 seen an image of children having sex. And then in
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:06.280]  Austin at the library, we went and checked to see if they have these books. They're there.
[3:40:06.280 --> 3:40:10.240]  And I looked at it and I felt abused. This is what they're putting in seventh and eighth
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:15.400]  grade libraries is literal images of the adults screwing children.
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:21.000]  No, and look, a great piece by my friend, Jacob Engels at the Gateway Pundit today.
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:26.760]  He went to an Orange County school board meeting. He tried to read aloud the book that they
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:30.800]  actually have in the library for children and that police dragged him out. There were
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:35.560]  no children in the room. Everybody was an adult. So this filth that they're pushing,
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:38.440]  it's okay for the kids, but we don't want the adults to hear it.
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:42.080]  Oh, exactly. I can't put this on broadcast TV and one on a lot of stations and I understand
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:46.240]  I agree. Okay, it's an adult show, but we're not vulgar. We don't. But I mean, if we're
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:51.600]  showing it to sixth graders and seventh graders, then sorry, it should be on national TV. That
[3:40:51.600 --> 3:40:55.800]  would end it real quick, Roger. But oh, no, no, we show it to children only, not to adult
[3:40:55.800 --> 3:40:57.800]  audiences. I mean, that's incredible.
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:41:04.880]  Yeah, no, it's truly, truly sick. And you know what? I blame not the Democrats. I blame
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:10.680]  the factless, gutless, weak needs, spineless establishment Republicans. They're the ones
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:15.240]  who should be ashamed because they won't get on board for the American First Agenda. They
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:19.880]  won't stand up for honest elections. They want to go along with the fraud that, oh, no,
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:25.320]  there was no, there was no irregularities, no, no improprieties in the last election.
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:30.800]  You're crazy if you say that you're a conspiracy theorist. No, we're conspiracy realists. We
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:36.440]  go where the facts lead us. So the other day I said in a speech that inadvertently I said
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:42.320]  millions have been injured or damaged by the COVID-19 vaccinations. No, I wasn't wrong.
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:44.840]  I was just premature. That's all.
[3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:49.560]  Well, that's right. Well, I mean, actually, it's come out that hospitals are filled with
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:52.960]  people that took the shots. They go, they have these mystery illnesses where they can't
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:57.720]  breathe and it's like COVID, but they don't have COVID. It's called ADE, antibody dependent
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:41:58.720]  enhancement, Roger.
[3:41:58.720 --> 3:42:05.360]  No, it's exactly right. And even the CDC says their estimate of the number of the deaths
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:12.640]  is 1% of the national total. So if there are 20,000 deaths, you do the math. This is a
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:18.840]  fraud upon the American people. We know that there is no liability for those vaccinations,
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:22.760]  for those who made them. We know that there have been no clinical trials and we know that
[3:42:22.760 --> 3:42:29.040]  Tony Fauci lied under oath to Congress about it. So when are 29 FBI agents storming his
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:33.320]  home at six o'clock in the morning? That's my question and we can knock it out of the
[3:42:33.320 --> 3:42:37.200]  park on the other side. That's right, Roger. I've got a bunch of questions and a bunch
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:39.720]  of items I want to cover, but what do you want to hit next when we come back in a few
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:40.720]  minutes?
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:44.800]  Well, I think we have to touch on January 6th, the incredible work being done by Darren
[3:42:44.800 --> 3:42:49.800]  Bady at the Revolver and kudos to you, Alex, you and Tucker Carlson, who have the courage
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:53.840]  to put him on the air so he can tell the American people. Stay right there. That's exactly where
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:54.840]  I wanted to go.
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:43:02.720]  Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday, October 22nd, 2021 with a very important update
[3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:08.440]  for supporters of M4s. Several of our best selling products are back in stock limited
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:16.800]  supplies and are 40 to 50% off like DNA Force Plus. That is 40% off right now. And that
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:21.760]  sale is going to have to end on Monday. It helps your telomeres, it helps your various
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:26.520]  cells, engines, the mitochondria, it's got the PQQ, the CoQ10. It really is incredible.
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:32.600]  It's 40% off. Some of the best selling products are 50% off as well. And we got a very limited
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:37.640]  supply, very limited run in, because I told the manufacturer, whatever ingredients you
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:41.280]  can get whenever you have enough to make some, even if it's a smaller run, do it. If you
[3:43:41.280 --> 3:43:45.960]  got a very small run in of the product that's been sold out, and that is Rainforce Ultra,
[3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:50.520]  it's 25% off at M4store.com. That's going to end up selling out by Monday as well at
[3:43:50.520 --> 3:44:03.720]  current sales rates. So get great products to support the M4 at M4store.com.
[3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:08.160]  William in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled. I agree. How do
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:12.720]  you make the sleeper awaken, William? Hi, Alice. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:20.920]  the IELTS real quick? Yeah, go ahead. Hey, I'm in my 60s, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds,
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:22.840]  and I worked them into the ground, and you wanted to know why. And I've tested this,
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:28.080]  and I've taken your B12, and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:34.160]  do. I take that B12, and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy
[3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:40.080]  work with the highway department, and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:46.280]  in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:45:01.440]  my life. I am taping this update on the morning of Friday, October 22, 2021. Listeners who've
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:07.400]  already tried and really seen the powerful effects of Rainforest Ultra should be excited
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:12.000]  to know that we've got a limited supply of it in stock, but it'll be sold out at current
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:17.400]  sales rates by Monday morning. Despite that fact, we're still offering a major discount
[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:22.520]  of 25% off. It is an amazing, new tropic. I went to one of the top labs in the country,
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:28.160]  and I said, I want very powerful, quick acting, extremely clean, new tropic that wears off
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:31.600]  quick because I want to be able to take it if I've got to work till 10 at night, take
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:37.640]  it at 7, and for it to wear off by 10. And that's exactly what they did with Rainforest
[3:45:37.640 --> 3:45:41.360]  Ultra. Now, we have other great products like Turboforce that last for 10 hours. It's a
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:44.760]  different formula. It's over the top powerful, so it's strong. I can't even take it. By the
[3:45:44.760 --> 3:45:49.480]  way, it's sold out right now. The Rainforest Ultra is really something special. It's 25%
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:53.840]  off. Limited supply. We'll sell out early next week in FullWarStore.com.
[3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:59.440]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:03.800]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group, so he
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:07.200]  didn't stand up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group,
[3:46:07.200 --> 3:46:12.120]  so he didn't stand up. And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:15.760]  up. Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in, it's banning people
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:19.480]  to three hours of video games a week. And if you criticize the government, you can never
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:23.960]  buy or sell again. Well, that's that's being brought here and all over the world. The guys
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:29.440]  in COVID vaccine passports, they even admit it. Now there's going to be a carbon tax
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:32.960]  attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:37.080]  can go and what you can do. That's what the lockdowns are about. You'll accept that. You'll
[3:46:37.080 --> 3:46:42.000]  accept anything. So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:45.360]  tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to
[3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:48.920]  be targeted by this nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and
[3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:58.560]  promote them. Or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[3:46:58.560 --> 3:47:04.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:04.840 --> 3:47:18.760]  All right, folks, final segment of the Alex Jones show and then Owen Schroyer takes over
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:24.440]  with the war room. Owen's been arrested and charged with attacking and entering the capital.
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:28.840]  Something he didn't do. They're trying to get Roger and I arrested and I haven't got
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:33.920]  to this yet and I'm not going to dig too deep into it till I'm ready to talk about it, but
[3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:38.040]  there are articles like the one in the Rolling Stone that came out earlier this week that's
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:44.240]  very long. Exclusive January 6 protest organizers say they participated in dozens of planning
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:48.760]  meetings with members of Congress and the White House staff and then they're quoted
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:54.360]  by the Rolling Stone and others is saying they were mad when Trump said go to the capital
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:48:00.200]  and that that was just too much for them. Well, I saw all the organizers praise that
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:05.240]  and say that was great and go woo, woo, because I was there with them in the second row. They
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:10.800]  were all sitting around me. All of them. All three groups that didn't like each other.
[3:48:10.800 --> 3:48:17.640]  And I saw them all run down there and run down to the capital all excited. So and then
[3:48:17.640 --> 3:48:22.480]  I see these articles like, look, here's Roger Stone or Alex Jones at this hotel. We found
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:27.080]  the secret war room and there's Alex Jones in the interviewing General Flynn and they
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:32.400]  got photos of here is the hotel photos. And you could tell this is the same room Jones
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:36.040]  was in. We never hid the fact that we were in that particular hotel. But the idea that
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:40.320]  we're like in their meeting to attack. And now we know why the day of the event the next
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:47.240]  day January 6, they sent a SWAT team to Roger's door. But Roger said this is BS. This thing's
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:51.960]  badly handled. This is out of control. He couldn't even get to the crowds to the ellipse.
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:56.920]  So he got on an airplane and left and said, I advise you to basically get out of there.
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:03.760]  This is idiotic. He said, this is a cluster f u dash CK. So I'm going to leave it at that.
[3:49:03.760 --> 3:49:07.320]  And I'm not trying to give it inside baseball. We've talked about this before, Roger, but
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:11.840]  I mean, I used to laugh at them calling you a Russian agent and then they indicted you
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:15.520]  and then falsely convicted you were pardoned. So I'm not laughing now, even though I know
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:21.080]  none of this is true. They are literally obsessed with you and I and Trump and Gozer and a few
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:26.600]  others claiming we all schemed for January 6 when it was the FBI and others that clearly
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:32.600]  helped run that fiasco, not us. Yeah, no, this is actually a historic moment. The Washington
[3:49:32.600 --> 3:49:39.640]  Post for the first time in 40 years has actually accurately reported something regarding me.
[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:43.960]  If there was a war room in the Willard hotel, I don't know about it. I wasn't there and
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:48.800]  know nothing about it. I wasn't there on the ellipse. I wasn't there at the Capitol. I
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:52.960]  don't know anything about it. I denounced the illegality as soon as it happened. It was
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:59.080]  stupid counterproductive. Now ABC News has tried to smear me through guilt by association
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:03.320]  because I had my picture taken with somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody who might
[3:50:03.320 --> 3:50:08.280]  have been arrested. The Washington Post actually correctly reported. I don't know anything about
[3:50:08.280 --> 3:50:14.320]  a war room. I wasn't there. I know nothing about it. This is part and parcel of the same
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:15.320]  thoughts.
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:19.360]  But they call it a war room. I had a suite to do interviews. That's what I do. I'm a
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:26.080]  news person. Like they ask, why did Jones have the rooftop by the Capitol rented? Because
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:30.480]  anybody can go there. I was up there with 30 different news agencies and we rented a
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:37.720]  little outdoor area. I mean, it's like, why does Jones have satellites? Yes, we went to
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:44.000]  cover the event. Yes, I'd rented it many times before and done the show from the damn rooftop.
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:49.640]  It's not a war room. The show is called War Room, which means a political war room.
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:54.280]  Well, and the real war room is with Owen Schreuer later in the day, not the fake war room. By
[3:50:54.280 --> 3:50:59.080]  the way, this has to be disposed of. The Steve Bannon question is really extraordinary.
[3:50:59.080 --> 3:51:03.000]  All Steve has to do is say the following, I assert my Fifth Amendment rights not to
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:08.360]  be questioned. They can't charge him and they can't compel him. Why is he being a drama queen?
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:12.480]  I'm not really sure what that's all about. Just assert your Fifth Amendment rights.
[3:51:12.480 --> 3:51:15.960]  No one in their right mind would go before in this committee under oath knowing that it's
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:16.960]  a rigged deal.
[3:51:16.960 --> 3:51:20.880]  I know you should admire Bannon, but back during the campaign when Trump first got elected
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:24.560]  and then later towards the end, you got concerned. Is there any way for you and Bannon to bury
[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:25.560]  the hatchet?
[3:51:25.560 --> 3:51:29.720]  No, he testified against me falsely. Look, he told the House Intelligence Committee,
[3:51:29.720 --> 3:51:34.640]  he never spoke to me regarding WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, and on the stand as a star
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:39.240]  witness for Robert Mueller, he said that, oh, he'd only talked to me about it in every
[3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:44.240]  single phone conversation he had. So he was prepared to send me to die in a dank Georgia
[3:51:44.240 --> 3:51:48.240]  prison. And no, I'm not getting over that. Sorry. Just not getting over it.
[3:51:48.240 --> 3:51:52.360]  Hey, I understand. I understand. It's just he does do a lot of good work, as you know.
[3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:56.800]  So do you. And that is wrong. I mean, I don't know. Maybe he should answer for that. I mean,
[3:51:56.800 --> 3:52:00.320]  he should explain how he testified that you weren't talking to WikiLeaks, but later he
[3:52:00.320 --> 3:52:01.320]  did.
[3:52:01.320 --> 3:52:04.840]  Well, look, I've challenged him to come here on Info Wars. That's fine with me. Come at
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:09.880]  Stone Cold Truth, if you want to meet me at Real America's Voice, where he has a show.
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:14.160]  He doesn't respond. But you can read in the New York Post, even Jonathan Turley, the George
[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:18.720]  Washington University law professor, who's a liberal, read his testimony before the House
[3:52:18.720 --> 3:52:23.280]  Committee, read his testimony on the stand where he was working with Robert Mueller.
[3:52:23.280 --> 3:52:26.920]  And it's very clear that he lied in one place or the other. That's what they charged me
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:32.080]  with, lying to Congress, even though no misstatement that I made to Congress was either material
[3:52:32.080 --> 3:52:35.160]  or relevant or hit any underlying crime.
[3:52:35.160 --> 3:52:40.200]  Yeah. Well, let's talk 35,000 foot view here. We need Trump to run. He's not perfect, but
[3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:44.400]  I know he means well and he wants to save America. Obviously, he's the best guy. DeSantis,
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:47.640]  I think, is pretty good as well, but went to Yale. You know, that's a little bit of a
[3:52:47.640 --> 3:52:51.280]  strike against him. How do we make sure Trump runs, even if they're going to try to steal
[3:52:51.280 --> 3:52:57.120]  it? We need him in there to create a huge surge that, you know, only a giant landslide
[3:52:57.120 --> 3:53:01.760]  can override a fraud slide. So we've got to get Trump to run. He's been exercising a
[3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:06.760]  lot. He looks better than he did even a year ago. I know you talk to the big guy a lot.
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:10.200]  And you know, a few months ago, you said, no, he's going to run. And that's what he
[3:53:10.200 --> 3:53:13.920]  was saying then. The media did not pick that up because they don't like that news. But
[3:53:13.920 --> 3:53:18.160]  they're definitely scared. Fiona Hill, Prince Valiant, you know, is saying it's the end
[3:53:18.160 --> 3:53:23.800]  of America and Trump basically gets reelected. We must have Trump run again, shouldn't we?
[3:53:23.800 --> 3:53:27.040]  They're so afraid of him. It's so obvious that they're afraid of him. That's why you
[3:53:27.040 --> 3:53:32.360]  had this New York witch hunt, trying to knock him out. That's why they are constantly investigating
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:37.240]  when there's nothing to investigate. He strikes fear into the heart of the deep state because
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:41.440]  he's beaten them twice and they know it. So he's my first choice. I want to be absolutely
[3:53:41.440 --> 3:53:45.040]  clear about that. And I pray that he runs, but I've also made it very clear that if he
[3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:49.520]  chooses not to run, I am going to launch a national effort to draft General Michael
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:56.560]  Flynn. He is a man of destiny. He is a Bible-believing Christian. He believes in the U.S. Constitution.
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:01.160]  He's fearless. He proved that on the battlefield where he saved other soldiers and put his
[3:54:01.160 --> 3:54:02.640]  own life on the line.
[3:54:02.640 --> 3:54:05.440]  Absolutely. Flynn's the real deal.
[3:54:05.440 --> 3:54:09.760]  He is. Look, I don't think he wants to run for president. But you know what? Alex Dwight
[3:54:09.760 --> 3:54:13.640]  Eisenhower didn't want to run for president either. And he's one of the greatest presidents
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:19.600]  of my lifetime, brought us unprecedented peace and prosperity. So look, if Donald Trump doesn't
[3:54:19.600 --> 3:54:24.160]  run and I pray to God that he does, because he's our best candidate, I'm very clear. I'm
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:27.600]  going to try to draft General Michael Flynn, whether he likes it or not.
[3:54:27.600 --> 3:54:31.000]  Well, I'm in the same boat because we didn't think Trump was going to run six months ago.
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:34.800]  And now it looks like he is. Wow. What are they going to throw at Trump to try to keep
[3:54:34.800 --> 3:54:38.640]  him from doing it? Because, you know, they mess with him too much. That'll only make
[3:54:38.640 --> 3:54:39.640]  him stronger.
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:45.360]  Well, now they're investigating his golf courses in New York, having found nothing in his business,
[3:54:45.360 --> 3:54:50.960]  having charged an 80-year-old, you know, CFO, Allen Weisselberg, who by the way is one of
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:57.360]  the most honest guys I've ever known, known him for 30 years. Oh, he used an apartment
[3:54:57.360 --> 3:55:02.720]  when his place was being renovated and he didn't report that. And he had use of a car. These
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:09.040]  are not exactly capital crimes. Anthony Fauci went before Congress and he lied about the
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:17.080]  origins of a virus, the vaccination for which has damaged or injured thousands of people,
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:18.080]  probably hundreds of thousands.
[3:55:18.080 --> 3:55:22.640]  And he know when we weaponize the virus, he should be arrested immediately.
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:27.400]  When is he, when are 29 FBI agents charging his home at six o'clock in the morning? When
[3:55:27.400 --> 3:55:32.320]  is he being gagged so that he can't respond to the charges against him? I don't think
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:36.400]  that's going to happen. This guy's an epic criminal. Let me be very clear. I've had it
[3:55:36.400 --> 3:55:39.920]  up to here with Anthony Fauci.
[3:55:39.920 --> 3:55:43.920]  For radio listeners, he did that up to his waist. All right, Roger, again, where do people
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:47.840]  find their Stone Cold Truth T-shirts? Where do they find their Roger Stone did nothing
[3:55:47.840 --> 3:55:48.840]  wrong shirts?
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:52.680]  Well, the worst part about this, Alex, is that the president and I are being sued in
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:58.920]  a completely bogus lawsuit by the Lawyers for Civil Rights, not a group funded by...
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:02.520]  You're being sued for running the attack on the Capitol. I don't know. They're trying
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:06.640]  to destroy us all. So you need people to support you at StoneColdTruth.com.
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:11.640]  Or go to StoneDefenseFun.com. I got to pay for my lawyers, StoneDefenseFun.com. They
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:17.000]  don't keep... I've already won. I prevailed in 11 lawsuits that I've gotten dismissed,
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:18.880]  and I have six more that I have to fight out.
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:22.120]  No, I got it. And if folks want us to stay in the fight, they got to support us. Roger,
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:26.080]  thank you so much. Come on again soon. All right, come to Austin.
[3:56:26.080 --> 3:56:30.000]  I like that idea because I need a big old steak. And by the way, Owen Schwerer, you
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:36.240]  got to pay off on that bet. It wasn't a hot dog, dude. It was a big old chop Tomahawk
[3:56:36.240 --> 3:56:37.240]  steak.
[3:56:37.240 --> 3:56:38.740]  What was the vet?
[3:56:38.740 --> 3:56:41.320]  It was the outcome of the congressional elections.
[3:56:41.320 --> 3:56:46.120]  Oh, yeah, you were right. All right, take care. There goes Roger. Speaking of that, look,
[3:56:46.120 --> 3:56:49.360]  folks, you will keep us in the fight. We're here. We got great products you already need.
