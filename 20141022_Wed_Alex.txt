[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.720 --> 00:21.480]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.480 --> 00:28.520]  welcome to the alex jones show I'm david and I'll be your host today we have an
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.160]  exciting show very informative we're gonna have dr. francis boil on in the
[00:33.160 --> 00:38.000]  third hour he's going to tell us why there's been so much bio weapons
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.160]  research done in africa in the very countries where we see this outbreak
[00:42.160 --> 00:47.680]  happening and he should know he's been involved in writing to bio weapons
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.320]  treaties for the united states he's going to be joining us in the third hour
[00:51.320 --> 00:55.080]  alex will also be joining us with some special reports you know we've had a big
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.000]  victory in the info war we see the fast food industry on the rocks not
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.600]  literally I mean that not with ice but basically we're see their profits
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.360]  plunging mcdonald's coca-cola other fast food outlets I think it's a victory in
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.600]  the info war alex does as well and he's going to talk about how the government
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.960]  not only won't protect you against Ebola but how they ultimately can't protect
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.240]  you against Ebola you know we keep looking for these magic cures from
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.920]  government they really don't have one they do have a threat that we need to
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.040]  worry about down the road with these vaccines that we may potentially be
[01:30.040 --> 01:36.440]  forced to take without them having been properly vetted properly looked at and
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.520]  there's always the issue of what is added to the vaccine even if they do
[01:41.520 --> 01:45.200]  these trials and so we're going to talk about that as well as some media
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.800]  manipulation that's going on against the narrative that people are as we look
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.880]  at the different things that we see coming from the government the stories
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.040]  that don't quite add up when we start doing investigation we immediately get
[01:59.040 --> 02:02.920]  some pushback labeling everything conspiracy theory conspiracy theory
[02:02.920 --> 02:05.840]  well that's the way you do an investigation you start looking at
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.600]  histories of things you start looking at the usual suspects and so the
[02:10.600 --> 02:14.520]  Washington Post has pushed back using a strawman attack against us we're going
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.040]  to talk about that not just against us but against everybody that is looking
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.000]  at what's going on in Africa with the Ebola outbreak but we're also going to
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.240]  look at another Snowden document that's been released by Glenn Greenwald this is
[02:28.240 --> 02:32.760]  an amazing document to me I think it really sheds light on the attempts that
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.600]  we see to manipulate people in the Infra war by the government to give you a
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.960]  preview of this this is a slideshow presentation from the British
[02:41.960 --> 02:46.920]  government's version of the NSA and it basically one of the slides that talks
[02:46.920 --> 02:54.080]  about the four D's deny disrupt degrade deceive that's your governments at work
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.600]  when we have governments like that who don't want to be held accountable who
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.680]  shut down all efforts at transparency that's what we should be really be
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.400]  concerned about they're also going to be joined by as I mentioned Anthony
[03:06.400 --> 03:09.320]  Gucci already is going to be joining us to talk about how you can take control
[03:09.320 --> 03:12.640]  of your health jacari Jackson is going to be joining us near the bottom of the
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.200]  hour and he's going to be talking about this breaking story that's going on in
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.240]  Canada of course there were shots fired in the Canadian Parliament that is
[03:19.240 --> 03:24.840]  developing as we speak we see reports from BBC that witnesses saw a gunman
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.120]  firing at the Ottawa War Memorial reportedly a soldier was shot there
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.920]  then running into Parliament so they say that this is increasing fears that
[03:34.920 --> 03:38.360]  there's some kind of a terrorism outbreak in Canada because they were just
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.720]  just raised their threat level from low to medium because of a soldier that was
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.600]  hit and run earlier this week they believe that had some terrorist
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.280]  motivation behind it we'll see now there's also a story that we're going to
[03:50.280 --> 03:55.920]  be looking at later 33 police officers fired 600 bullets into a car knowing
[03:55.920 --> 03:58.680]  that it contained a hostage hopefully that's not what they're going to do in
[03:58.680 --> 04:02.720]  Canada maybe they won't be that trigger happy let's hope they don't shoot up
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.400]  their own Parliament this is an amazing story a 41 year old mother of two was
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.940]  abducted and it was a car chase sequence and the police let loose 600
[04:14.940 --> 04:20.200]  bullets that's about 20 each that they put in we also have a report on someone
[04:20.200 --> 04:27.360]  who was making 3d guns in Japan and he got a two-year sentence it was a heinous
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.240]  crime the judge said because it threatened the very core of their
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.080]  control over citizens this guy knew exactly what he was doing he was a gun
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.000]  rights gun freedom advocate and we're going to talk about that so stick with

[08:12.120 --> 08:32.520]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday October 22nd 2014 I'm David
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.200]  Knight I'll be your host today we have a very interesting show but I'm gonna
[08:37.200 --> 08:40.840]  break down who's gonna be there but I wanted to cover this shots being fired
[08:40.840 --> 08:44.280]  inside the Canadian Parliament right now we have a breaking story there we're
[08:44.280 --> 08:47.520]  gonna have Jacarie Jackson joining us in the next segment he's gonna give us
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.720]  updates as to what's happening we had some shots fired in Ottawa war memorial
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.160]  reportedly a soldier there was shot and then the person ran into the Canadian
[08:57.160 --> 09:02.120]  Parliament and apparently we're getting different reports some people are saying
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.960]  that it hasn't happened but two Canadian MPs later said that the gunman has been
[09:05.960 --> 09:10.840]  killed so we'll be getting an update from that from Jacarie Jackson as I look
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.560]  at that one of the stories that came across the play today was 33 police
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.240]  officers shooting amongst themselves 600 bullets into a car knowing that it
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.200]  contained a hostage this lady was in a bank as these guys were robbing it they
[09:25.200 --> 09:28.920]  took her out of the bank as a hostage a 41 year old mother of two she had a young
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.240]  child in her car she asked them not to let her child see them take her out of
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.680]  the bank as a hostage they complied with that they said don't worry nothing's
[09:38.680 --> 09:42.760]  going to happen well nothing happened from the robbers but the police fired a
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.760]  volley of 600 bullets into the car killing her along with the bank robbers
[09:48.760 --> 09:54.720]  and now they're being sued by the family we also see another gun news we see that
[09:54.720 --> 10:01.840]  in Japan a man gets a two-year sentence for making 3d guns now he knew what he
[10:01.840 --> 10:05.880]  was doing he was pretty much a self-defense gun rights advocate he was
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.520]  making a point as we've seen those who do that here in the United States as well
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.320]  they want to make the point that we have the right to defend ourselves he was a
[10:14.320 --> 10:17.880]  staunch advocate I would say of the Second Amendment except they don't have a
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.920]  second amendment in Japan so this is what you see happening actually what
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.560]  they've got instead of a second amendment they have a swords and firearms
[10:26.560 --> 10:32.200]  control law that's right you can't even have swords in Japan unless the
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.400]  government gives you permission evidently so I guess the samurai deli
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.520]  wouldn't happen in Japan in reality but this guy who was arrested who was now
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.120]  get him in two years in jail he once allegedly wrote on Facebook freedom of
[10:48.120 --> 10:54.200]  armaments to all people also a gun makes power equal yes that's essentially what
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.160]  chairman Mao and other dictators understand they understand that power
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.160]  comes out of the barrel of a gun and it is something that the people need to
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.040]  have people need to have that power we have the fundamental right to protect
[11:07.040 --> 11:12.520]  ourselves just as this Japanese guy understands it's not given to him by
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.040]  constitution a government can take it away a government can lock you up but it
[11:16.040 --> 11:19.800]  doesn't come from the government it is not something that is a privilege that
[11:19.800 --> 11:23.600]  can be granted earlier this week on the nightly news on Monday we had a story
[11:23.600 --> 11:29.680]  of a local jurisdiction that was requiring Facebook passwords on gun
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.160]  applications see when you turn this into a privilege there's no telling where
[11:34.160 --> 11:37.040]  they're going to take this and they weren't just looking for their Facebook
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.840]  page they wanted their password their password what are they going to do alter
[11:41.840 --> 11:45.840]  their account well basically the judge said he intended to demonstrate that
[11:45.840 --> 11:50.680]  firearms are manufactured easily and to publicize that widely over the internet
[11:50.680 --> 11:57.280]  that was a heinous crime well you know it's not just governments and individuals
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.560]  who shoot people we also have false flags that are involved this we have now a
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.280]  narrative that has been destroyed as it was delayed an investigation of the
[12:08.280 --> 12:12.080]  flight of MH 17 if you remember this was the flight that was shot down over the
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.440]  Ukraine our government tried to use that to push us into a war we have a
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.240]  legislative requirement that the Congress declare war because these types of
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.920]  things need to be debated it needs to be a deliberate process before we enter into
[12:26.920 --> 12:32.600]  war so of course that's been totally totally circumvented by our government
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.200]  as the president now since troops anywhere he wishes and essentially keeps
[12:36.200 --> 12:42.520]  them there as long as he wishes the only thing holding that back is the
[12:42.520 --> 12:48.160]  alternative media questioning whether or not this was really a shootdown by the
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.880]  anti-Ukrainian government forces or not if that was something that we should
[12:52.880 --> 12:56.840]  rush in to fight against those people now because that was such a heinous event
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.880]  yes it was an awful thing to see the bodies raining down out of the sky but
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.240]  it's also important to know who did that just as it was important to know who
[13:05.240 --> 13:10.600]  unleashed that gas that poison gas in Syria we later found out that it wasn't
[13:10.600 --> 13:15.120]  the people that we wanted to go to war with it was probably the people that we
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.720]  were supporting there so it's very important to take your time doing that
[13:18.720 --> 13:23.160]  because in this particular case we now see a German foreign intelligence agency
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.120]  has concluded that the anti-aircraft missile battery involved came from a
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.360]  Ukrainian military base this is reported by the German news magazine
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.960]  Der Spiegel and this is up on David Stockman's contra-corner he was the guy
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.800]  who was the budget director for Ronald Reagan looks like he's opened up his
[13:41.800 --> 13:44.560]  perspectives a little bit to publish something like this but it's very
[13:44.560 --> 13:47.920]  important that we take the time to look at these things we tried to have the
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.120]  mainstream media as well as the Obama administration tried to push us
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.440]  into war it's a good thing we didn't do that now isn't it maybe we should take
[13:56.440 --> 13:59.920]  our time and look at all these things even if the Congress isn't going to do
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.760]  that we also see a breaking story on the Guardian the US is ordered to explain
[14:04.760 --> 14:11.040]  withholding of Iraq and Afghanistan torture photos the Obama administration
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.280]  doesn't want to show you the Bush administration's torture pictures they're
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.440]  fighting this they have 2100 pictures they say of detainee abuse it's said
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.400]  to be more disturbing than the infamous Abu Ghraib photographs that sparked a
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.840]  global fewer in 2004 this is a Guardian reporting they say the imagery is a
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.800]  subject of a transparency lawsuit that both the Bush and Obama administrations
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.760]  backed by the US Congress have strenuously resisted there we go it's a
[14:42.760 --> 14:49.360]  bipartisan thing why is it that Obama isn't going to use this to blame Bush to
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.440]  blame the Republicans because he's involved in this type of thing as well
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.840]  of course he bragged about how he's really good at killing he's got his drone
[14:58.840 --> 15:04.160]  strikes as open assassination of people most of them innocent civilians further
[15:04.160 --> 15:08.560]  inflaming the war but they say oh no drone strikes don't inflame the war what
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.880]  would inflame the war would be if we showed you pictures of what we did to
[15:12.880 --> 15:18.280]  prisoners in 2009 Barack Obama said that it would further inflame anti-american
[15:18.280 --> 15:24.960]  opinion and put our troops in greater danger that's what his drone strikes do
[15:24.960 --> 15:30.040]  actually we need to come clean we need to put some people in jail we need to be
[15:30.040 --> 15:36.160]  transparent the pictures are not the problem what's happening is the problem
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.760]  the cover-up of what's happening is the problem and that's why we need to get
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.280]  these people out unfortunately unfortunately he's joined by the
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.320]  Republicans and by Congress and covering this up they don't think you have
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.280]  the right to know what they're doing in your name now in the third hour we're
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.600]  going to be joined by dr. Francis Boyle and he's going to ask some questions
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.880]  about what's going on in Africa in terms of the countries that we're seeing
[16:03.880 --> 16:08.520]  these outbreaks centered in why are we seeing so much bio weapons research in
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.440]  those particular areas now he should know because he's written a couple of
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.480]  treaties for the US government bio weapon bio terror treaties he's also
[16:17.480 --> 16:19.960]  written a book on the subject he's going to be joining us in the third hour
[16:19.960 --> 16:25.120]  we've had big victories in the information war in terms of nutrition we
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.640]  can see that reflected in the lower sales figures the lower profits of fast
[16:30.640 --> 16:36.080]  food companies of soft drink companies it was done by the marketplace it wasn't
[16:36.080 --> 16:41.480]  done by fiat by edict like Michael Bloomberg was doing and interestingly
[16:41.480 --> 16:49.360]  enough the head of the CDC Frieden was his guy he raised taxes on tobacco from
[16:49.360 --> 16:55.520]  8 cents a pack to a dollar 50 cents a pack that's 1875 percent increase what
[16:55.520 --> 16:59.720]  happened well he got a huge black market that's what happens every time you do
[16:59.720 --> 17:03.640]  something like that it's essentially you know prohibition creating a financial
[17:03.640 --> 17:08.240]  incentive that's what we see with the war on drugs problems like that if you
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.440]  want to stop people from smoking if you want to stop them from eating junk food
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.440]  and drinking soda you don't put bands on everything you don't band salt on the
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.000]  table or certain size drinks on the table as the CDC former head dad you know
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.680]  he can do that but he's not he's gonna ban the trans fats but he's not gonna
[17:24.680 --> 17:30.160]  ban the transnational flights of people who might be bringing in Ebola into this
[17:30.160 --> 17:36.320]  country that's the absurdity of the nanny state and the way that you stop
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.160]  this is through education so we're gonna have a special couple of special reports
[17:39.160 --> 17:44.520]  from Alex Jones not only on our victory and nutrition but also on Ebola we're
[17:44.520 --> 17:49.280]  also gonna have Anthony Guciardi joining us and there's a major article that's
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.080]  come out that I really want to focus on and I don't have enough time to do this
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.760]  I'm gonna do this at the bottom of the hour this is another Snowden document
[17:56.760 --> 18:02.640]  that's come out it's actually a slideshow a training program from
[18:02.640 --> 18:09.000]  Britain's NSA the GCHQ most people didn't even know about that before the
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.920]  Snowden documents shed light on it but it's got and this is one of the things
[18:13.920 --> 18:17.240]  they'll tease this to you one of the things that they're telling people to do
[18:17.240 --> 18:22.400]  in this is the 4d's deny we see that a lot from the government don't we
[18:22.400 --> 18:27.360]  disrupt the internet somebody's web service their business their personal
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.880]  life degrade their personal life stop their destroy their company destroy
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.840]  their personal reputation and deceive there you go that kind of sums up our
[18:36.840 --> 18:41.400]  governments doesn't it deny disrupt degrade and deceive and so we're gonna
[18:41.400 --> 18:44.960]  break that down with you we're gonna show you the slides on that and there's
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.240]  also an interesting article that we're gonna talk about at the bottom of the
[18:48.240 --> 18:54.360]  hour from the Washington Post pushing back on people looking at the
[18:54.360 --> 18:58.720]  developments here with this Ebola situation pushing back calling it a
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.640]  conspiracy and essentially putting up a strawman argument of a news item that
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.120]  was from a small Liberian newspaper talking about how they believed that
[19:10.120 --> 19:16.520]  the Ebola outbreak in that country wasn't just the natural progression of
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.680]  the disease but it was being exacerbated in some kind of a false flag with
[19:20.680 --> 19:23.840]  formaldehyde so I'm gonna take a look at that that that really happened and
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.360]  what's behind the Washington Post's coverage of that that's going to be an
[19:29.360 --> 19:33.360]  interesting segment with us and in the next segment coming up right after the
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.240]  break we've got Jakari Jackson is gonna give us an update as to what's going on
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.080]  with the situation the shooting in the Canadian Parliament of course as I
[19:41.080 --> 19:44.960]  mentioned earlier we had shots fired inside the Parliament building after
[19:44.960 --> 19:49.920]  shots were fired at a military memorial there reportedly one person was killed a
[19:49.920 --> 19:53.680]  soldier and reportedly the gunman has been shot inside the Parliament we're
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.680]  gonna get an update on that right after the break from Jakari Jackson stay with

[24:14.960 --> 24:17.960]  Jacari Jackson just a moment he's gonna give us an update on what's going on in
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.560]  Canada with the shooting there in the Parliament building but before we do I
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.520]  want to let you know about our super survival shield iodine x2 you can find
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.120]  it on info wars life comm you know when I was looking at the Ebola outbreak I saw
[24:33.120 --> 24:37.480]  that there were six separate monkey outbreaks within labs we had three lab
[24:37.480 --> 24:42.520]  contaminations at different times there's only been about 32 outbreaks and
[24:42.520 --> 24:46.080]  this outbreak that we've got now is four times bigger than all the others
[24:46.080 --> 24:49.760]  combined there were some very small ones however that you may not know about the
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.560]  biggest ones were about 300 or 400 people but this one now is nearly 10,000
[24:55.560 --> 25:01.800]  people if you sum up all the previous 32 outbreaks you get about 2400 people so
[25:01.800 --> 25:04.480]  we're about four times that size now some of those outbreaks the reason you
[25:04.480 --> 25:08.080]  haven't heard about them is that they were very very small they were lab
[25:08.080 --> 25:12.320]  contaminations where things were released accidentally in Russia there were two
[25:12.320 --> 25:16.880]  deaths and two separate incidents of humans there were six separate monkey
[25:16.880 --> 25:21.400]  outbreaks with lab animals now the interesting thing about that is that in
[25:21.400 --> 25:26.240]  a couple of in two of those humans actually developed antibodies that means
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.400]  that they were exposed that they picked it up either airborne or otherwise they
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.560]  picked up Ebola in a small enough amount but enough that it triggered their
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.800]  immune system when you look at this your key thing in surviving any kind of
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.760]  pandemic like this whether it's Ebola or whether it's some of the more common
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.600]  viruses that are very dangerous nevertheless the mystery viruses or
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.520]  SARS or MERS or any of these things that we see in the past the key is your
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.520]  immune system so you want to make sure that your immune system is in top shape
[25:57.520 --> 26:00.680]  one of the ways that you can do that is to make sure that you have all the
[26:00.680 --> 26:06.000]  nutrients you need iodine x2 you can find that at info wars life.com a great
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.680]  way to get yourself healthy and to a great way to get yourself healthy and to
[26:11.680 --> 26:18.160]  build your immune system and joining us now is Jakari Jackson Jakari what's
[26:18.160 --> 26:21.720]  going on in Canada what's the latest development there has there been any
[26:21.720 --> 26:24.960]  new information well you know we were watching this earlier before the show
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.040]  David and they had reports of a shooter running around the Parliament area now
[26:29.040 --> 26:32.640]  Fox News reporting that there are potentially multiple shooters two guys
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.600]  jumping out of a Toyota Camry it says multiple gunmen opened fire at the
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.800]  Canadian Parliament complex shooting at least one soldier in spring as many as
[26:40.800 --> 26:45.360]  30 shots inside the government building just two days after a terror attack in
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.400]  Quebec shook the nation officials said and it goes on to say that there are
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.960]  multiple tweets going out some by people who are claiming to be witnesses
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.800]  some by police but Bernard Trotter a Toronto area MP tweeted that the gunmen
[26:58.800 --> 27:02.920]  inside the central block has been shot and killed the other was reportedly
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.680]  being sought so you know the story has changed since when we are watching it
[27:06.680 --> 27:09.880]  earlier this morning but it's my understanding David when you go to these
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.240]  Parliament buildings they have armed security as soon as you walk in the door
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.640]  if you go to the Texas Capitol yeah armed security as soon as you walk in the
[27:16.640 --> 27:21.560]  door so if there was type some type of active shooter situation you know how
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.800]  do they respond to that you know this is just another example of the suppose a
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.880]  Canadian gun control yeah and control doesn't work exactly because just like
[27:29.880 --> 27:33.680]  whether it's Christopher Dorner this the story that you mentioned earlier today
[27:33.680 --> 27:37.720]  about the young lady who was taken hostage by the bank robbers and ended up
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.280]  being shot 10 times by the police when they opened fire on the vehicle yeah you
[27:41.280 --> 27:44.200]  know you know it's not even so much bashing the cops but you know the cops
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.320]  they they don't know what to do where the shot come from does that guy have a
[27:47.320 --> 27:50.560]  gun why is he wearing that heavy coat they don't know exactly how to respond to
[27:50.560 --> 27:54.760]  the situation but you know luckily at the Texas Capitol if there is active
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.840]  shooter situation you can have you can still carry and defend yourself from you
[27:58.840 --> 28:03.720]  know set attack I think it underscores the fact that even with stringent gun
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.080]  control laws like they've got in Canada they can't even the government can't
[28:08.080 --> 28:12.640]  even protect itself they certainly can't protect you and so whether or not this
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.800]  is a terrorist event whether it's a false flag event whatever it is you need
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.720]  to have the fundamental right that we all possess as individuals just like I
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.520]  was reading in the last segment the guy in Japan understands that you are
[28:26.520 --> 28:30.720]  essentially a slave if you don't have any means to defend yourself and of
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.080]  course in Japan they actually try to control swords it's not just not just
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.880]  firearms I mean they've got their own swords control I guess so you know we
[28:40.880 --> 28:44.760]  joke about that you know hammer control I guess is the next thing you know that
[28:44.760 --> 28:47.720]  they're gonna blunt objects because you know people at least in this country they
[28:47.720 --> 28:51.880]  get killed or rather frequently yeah with hammers blunt objects you know
[28:51.880 --> 28:55.920]  baseball bats all that type of deal but we'll keep an eye on this situation as
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.200]  it continues to develop they say at least one soldier has been shot we
[29:00.200 --> 29:03.600]  don't know yet if the the gentleman has died or if the soldier I should say has
[29:03.600 --> 29:08.080]  died but yeah and I think they when they said that they were shooting shots at
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.240]  the war memorial I would assume that you know it wasn't that he engaged the guy
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.040]  yeah it's a whole complex yeah yeah then the you know some witnesses say you
[29:16.040 --> 29:19.320]  know witnesses say that you know guys are running down the street they're running
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.240]  around the area it gets it potentially more than two we don't know but as of
[29:23.240 --> 29:27.320]  right now Fox News is reporting that there are at least two sounds very much
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.080]  like what happened at the White House doesn't it oh yeah the guy just comes
[29:31.080 --> 29:33.760]  over the fence is allowed to run all the way across the line in the White House
[29:33.760 --> 29:37.000]  that's the question they were asking on the on the major networks all right so
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.160]  we're gonna be right back thank you jacari jackson that update is what's
[29:40.160 --> 29:43.280]  going on in Canada we'll keep you informed if there's any new updates on
[29:43.280 --> 29:46.160]  that thank you so much jacari say with us gonna be right back and we're gonna
[29:46.160 --> 29:50.960]  talk about the control of your we're on the march and the press and the watching
[29:50.960 --> 29:57.080]  those pushing back against that Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.720 --> 30:04.080]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[30:04.080 --> 30:07.600]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[30:07.600 --> 30:11.640]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[30:11.640 --> 30:15.480]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend
[30:15.480 --> 30:19.720]  90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[30:19.720 --> 30:23.880]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[30:23.880 --> 30:27.640]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[30:27.640 --> 30:31.000]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.720]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.120]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[30:39.120 --> 30:42.960]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[33:09.040 --> 33:24.800]  network welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we have some major
[33:24.800 --> 33:30.360]  changes in the way the CDC is telling people to care for Ebola patients this
[33:30.360 --> 33:34.840]  week we got new rules on Monday now listen to some of the new rules and the
[33:34.840 --> 33:39.060]  new rules they're told to wear double gloves they're told wear waterproof boot
[33:39.060 --> 33:43.680]  covers that go to at least mid-calf single-use waterproof or water resistant
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.200]  gowns that extend to mid-calf single-use face shields that are disposable
[33:48.200 --> 33:51.600]  surgical hoods to ensure complete coverage of the head and neck and so on
[33:51.600 --> 33:55.880]  and so on these are things they did not tell us that we needed before listen to
[33:55.880 --> 34:01.720]  this one use of a respirator at all times at all times this is the CDC saying
[34:01.720 --> 34:07.840]  this either an N95 respirator or a powered air purifying respirator are
[34:07.840 --> 34:12.300]  they admitting that it can be transferred airborne with aerosol
[34:12.300 --> 34:16.840]  particles is that what they're now saying clearly we see that something needs
[34:16.840 --> 34:20.320]  to be changed we saw that the first patient that was brought in the United
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.520]  States one patient gave the disease to two people that's the same rate of
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.200]  transfer that we've seen within Africa now of course that didn't happen when
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.640]  they brought in the other patients to the secure facilities at Emory University
[34:34.640 --> 34:37.920]  the other nurse is being treated interestingly enough one is being
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.400]  treated in Emory as the doctors who were brought in previously were taken to
[34:42.400 --> 34:47.520]  Emory and I believe the other one was in Nebraska I'm not sure about that guys
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.040]  but anyway the other nurse that has it is at the NIH facility in Maryland
[34:52.040 --> 34:57.640]  they're not leaving them in the regular hospital in Dallas to be treated
[34:57.640 --> 35:01.120]  because we've seen that there were a lot of problems with that treatment there
[35:01.120 --> 35:07.160]  but a lot of the problems were what they were told and not told by the CDC how
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.600]  many times though can we do that they sent our soldiers into the heart of the
[35:12.600 --> 35:18.600]  Ebola outbreak now into Liberia not giving them any hazmat equipment simply
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.360]  giving them gloves single gloves and a face mask and then saying well you know
[35:24.360 --> 35:27.240]  we're just trusting that they won't come into contact with anybody yet they're
[35:27.240 --> 35:32.040]  going to send out first it was 3,000 then 4,000 now 5,000 soldiers into that area
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.680]  I think we're going to see it come back if that's their attitude that they're
[35:36.680 --> 35:42.040]  going to take and of course even though they stockpiled 160,000 hazmat suits
[35:42.040 --> 35:45.800]  according to one supplier back in September they're not going to be
[35:45.800 --> 35:48.800]  giving those to the soldiers who are going over there we're going to be
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.280]  talking to Dr. Francis Boyle in the third hour he's someone who knows a great
[35:54.280 --> 35:58.500]  deal about bio weapons research having written a couple of treaties about the
[35:58.500 --> 36:02.960]  subject also a book about the subject we're going to ask him why there is so
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.600]  much research going on in those these very countries where we see this
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.320]  outbreak but you know whenever we question the things that the CDC is
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.400]  doing the reckless behavior that they're modeling the lack of adequate
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.600]  protocols how they're standing down from their own protocols as we question
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.400]  that we're called of course conspiracy theorists and the Washington Post is
[36:26.400 --> 36:31.720]  using what I think is a straw man to attack anyone who questions the
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.720]  government narrative on this this is an article that came out on the 17th so I
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.320]  think it was those last the end of last week a major Liberian newspaper they say
[36:42.320 --> 36:46.840]  is turning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy that's that's the magic word
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.880]  you say conspiracy and it shuts down all investigation all questioning of what
[36:51.880 --> 36:57.280]  the government is doing and they use this particular paper this article to
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.880]  it's kind of a straw man to push back on US bio weapons research anybody has
[37:02.880 --> 37:06.680]  questions about that they push back on open borders they push back on vaccines
[37:06.680 --> 37:11.600]  listen why they say they say the observer in Monrovia was saying that
[37:11.600 --> 37:16.200]  someone was going around dressed as nurses giving people Ebola vaccines and
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.040]  they were immediately getting getting sick and dropping into a coma and they
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.640]  say recent articles published by the paper have speculated that the US Defense
[37:23.640 --> 37:28.440]  Department manufactured the Ebola outbreak and they've alleged that the UN has
[37:28.440 --> 37:33.080]  deliberately introduced the Ebola virus and they fretted over the impending
[37:33.080 --> 37:37.680]  influx of foreigners so there you go they if you question us bio research
[37:37.680 --> 37:43.680]  you're just as crazy as this conspiracy theory in this paper if you question
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.320]  open borders then you're xenophobic like this this newspaper there or if you say
[37:49.320 --> 37:53.520]  that you have concerns about what's in vaccines of course then then you're just
[37:53.520 --> 37:59.760]  a conspiracy theorist well you know there really is a reason to question this
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.440]  article they don't give the guy's name that they say was going around dumping
[38:03.440 --> 38:07.880]  formaldehyde and wells I say someone was dumping formaldehyde in specific
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.440]  locations when they caught him he said we are many we're doing this in several
[38:12.440 --> 38:18.200]  cities but no other outlet reported that they didn't have the guy's name there
[38:18.200 --> 38:23.680]  was no arrest information record and yet they use this to push back not only on
[38:23.680 --> 38:28.320]  conspiracy theories but kind of equivocate on the Liberian government
[38:28.320 --> 38:32.680]  wanting to censor the press censor reports about what's going on in their
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.120]  country but I want to point out something pretty obvious to the Washington Post to
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.760]  our listeners and that is people really are dumping formaldehyde in our
[38:44.760 --> 38:51.120]  vaccines yes this dangerous thing is being put into our vaccines they do a
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.920]  lot of that with things that are supposed to agitate your immune system
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.840]  that's the theory it's going to agitate your immune system more so that you'll
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.680]  make even more antibodies so they put things like formaldehyde into the
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.040]  vaccines it's not that they're dumping it in the water they actually are
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.640]  dumping stuff in our water as well they're dumping fluoride a class for
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.240]  toxin you've seen the video that we've had here at info wars we had clandestine
[39:15.240 --> 39:20.360]  footage we took the tour of the water facility here in Austin took pictures of
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.400]  the from of the not formaldehyde but the fluoride container that was being
[39:25.400 --> 39:31.240]  dumped into the water a toxic class for designation on the container as well as
[39:31.240 --> 39:36.240]  a corrosive pipes they're dumping that in the water if you think that fluoride is
[39:36.240 --> 39:39.880]  healthy for you and of course this is a different form of fluoride but if you
[39:39.880 --> 39:45.120]  think that you need fluoride then take it as a medicine why would you mass
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.160]  medicate the water supply with anything you can't control the dosage some
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.440]  people are going to get too much some people are going to get too little you
[39:54.440 --> 39:59.800]  should never dose medication through a water supply but of course that's what
[39:59.800 --> 40:03.880]  we see happening all the time but let's get back to the press aspect of this
[40:03.880 --> 40:08.560]  course as I said the Washington Post basically gives us a template a straw
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.800]  man to push back against anybody who questions our bio weapons research our
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.840]  open borders or vaccines but then they go on and they talk about how the
[40:16.840 --> 40:22.080]  librarian president asked for broader powers to control false media reports
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.240]  they said she said because falsehood and negative reporting on the state of the
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.120]  affairs is likely to defeat the national effort and the fight of the
[40:29.120 --> 40:33.960]  Ebola virus it's important that it be discouraged and prevented well they
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.480]  don't criticize that actually they say well there could be a case for doing
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.240]  that because look at how crazy this particular newspaper is it was voted
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.360]  down by the Congress that they did not enact that but what they wanted to do
[40:46.360 --> 40:53.000]  was to censor anybody from the press reporting on Ebola in the country or
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.200]  what was happening there they had their own numbers that they were putting out
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.640]  and the WHO the World Health Organization said we have no confidence at all in
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.240]  their numbers but they were going to actually penalize any health care
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.960]  workers or government officials who talked to the press that's how stringent
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.920]  it was but does the Washington Post have a problem with that no they say
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.880]  there's it's not really a zero-sum game they said there's there's actually a
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.040]  precedent for the librarian press acting irresponsibly so they kind of say
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.800]  well you know we really ought to kind of take a look at this because they're
[41:26.800 --> 41:34.440]  irresponsible let's remember when the Washington Post starts giving a pass
[41:34.440 --> 41:39.960]  equivocating censorship massive censorship in Liberia with inaccurate
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.840]  reporting let's remember that it was the Washington Post itself in 1980s that
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.480]  had a Janet Cook story that won a Pulitzer Prize they had to take that
[41:50.480 --> 41:55.000]  they had to give it back because it was found out that it was pure fiction now
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  resonated with people because it was about the war on drugs and there was a
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.880]  lot of elements to that that people could believe that it was a true story
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.120]  but it was a total piece of fiction and they didn't vet it any more than this
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.720]  librarian paper vetted it but that's no reason to allow the government to
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.520]  essentially shut down and control the press and we see them moving in that
[42:18.520 --> 42:23.480]  direction over and over again we have yet another indicator of that again from a
[42:23.480 --> 42:27.040]  Republican on the FCC on the Federal Communications Commission remember he was
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.880]  the guy who blew the whistle on the survey that the FCC wanted to do they
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.400]  were they announced that they were going to do a content survey on different
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.440]  media outlets including online media outlets which there's no reason for them
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.360]  to get involved including print media newspaper they were going to do surveys
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.680]  on that how do you form your opinions how are you putting this stuff together
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.720]  they're still interested in that they're still the government is still funding
[42:53.720 --> 42:56.960]  now through the National Science Foundation a million dollar grant
[42:56.960 --> 43:02.840]  they're funding a study called the truthy study and as Ajit Pai points out
[43:02.840 --> 43:05.880]  the member of the Federal Communications Commission that blew the whistle on
[43:05.880 --> 43:11.720]  this content survey and why is that a problem obviously the FCC is not there
[43:11.720 --> 43:16.920]  to judge the content of what media companies put out they're there to
[43:16.920 --> 43:20.840]  allocate frequency spectrum that's why they shouldn't even be involved in the
[43:20.840 --> 43:24.280]  internet certainly not in print newspapers but he asks this question he
[43:24.280 --> 43:28.360]  says if you take to Twitter to express your views on a hot button issue does a
[43:28.360 --> 43:31.960]  government have an interest in deciding whether you're spreading misinformation
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.600]  if you tweet your support for a candidate in the election should taxpayer
[43:35.600 --> 43:41.520]  money be used to monitor your speech and evaluate your partisanship okay so they
[43:41.520 --> 43:47.440]  named this a truthy project after Stephen Colbert's program where he where he
[43:47.440 --> 43:52.240]  talks about that but they're saying that they want to look at social pollution
[43:52.240 --> 43:56.920]  they want to study what they call social epidemics in other words how our means
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.080]  created how do they spread through the pop culture how do they propagate they're
[44:02.080 --> 44:08.040]  not just interested in the propagation of information and how that moves they
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.380]  want to scientifically study this so that they can control you that's what
[44:13.380 --> 44:19.360]  this is all about that's why this is so scary there's an amazing article great
[44:19.360 --> 44:24.000]  piece of work here from Glenn Greenwald on the intercept another Snowden
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.760]  document that's come out this one is a presentation that was put out by GCHQ
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.040]  that's Britain's NSA essentially as he points out it's a previously secret
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.240]  unit within that organization and we're going to take a look at some of the
[44:38.240 --> 44:41.960]  slides here but basically this was something that was given to NASA not
[44:41.960 --> 44:46.240]  NASA to the NSA sorry and to the English-speaking Five Eyes Alliance now
[44:46.240 --> 44:51.640]  that's the New Zealand Australia the UK America and Canada they're looking
[44:51.640 --> 44:54.040]  they're sharing intelligence and there was an article that came out the other
[44:54.040 --> 44:58.240]  day talking about how much I think it was a New Zealand I think paid a hundred
[44:58.240 --> 45:04.480]  million dollars just to get information from this Five Eyes consortium here but
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.960]  they point out that it has two tactics one is to inject all sorts of false
[45:08.960 --> 45:12.880]  material into the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.080]  say they assassinate your character then they assassinate you that's how they
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.520]  kill the messenger you need to see that movie by the way the Gary Webb movie but
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.680]  here's the other thing they do they use social science and other techniques to
[45:25.680 --> 45:32.280]  manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes that they
[45:32.280 --> 45:37.520]  consider to be desirable see that's what's behind this study that the FCC
[45:37.520 --> 45:41.720]  commissioner blew the whistle on that's what's behind the survey that's what's
[45:41.720 --> 45:48.040]  behind this truthy project they're not just curious as to how we get social
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.720]  pollution it's more than just the government looking at this and pushing
[45:52.720 --> 45:56.920]  back against people and saying that's true that's false we're going to expose
[45:56.920 --> 46:00.640]  that no that's not what they're going to do they've taken off the restrictions
[46:00.640 --> 46:04.560]  from Voice of America from Radio Free Europe to broadcast within the United
[46:04.560 --> 46:08.920]  States but it's not going to be that obvious it's going to be a scientific
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.440]  approach that's what we're going to see from this look at some of the things
[46:13.440 --> 46:16.440]  that they have in their playbook these are some of the slides pull these up the
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.360]  disruption operational playbook here's some of their tactics infiltration
[46:20.360 --> 46:26.080]  ruse set piece false flag false rescue disruption a sting operation here's how
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.280]  some of this is going to work if you want to discredit a target you set up a
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.840]  honey trap in other words a sexual trist like we see the way they took down
[46:34.840 --> 46:40.440]  allegedly Julian Assange alleging that he had raped two women was that
[46:40.440 --> 46:44.240]  essentially a honey trap I think it was you could change the photos on their
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.160]  social networking sites this is their slide this is how they're teaching their
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.680]  government agents to discredit targets people they don't like they could write
[46:52.680 --> 46:56.120]  a blog reporting to be one of their victims they could email or text their
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.840]  colleagues their neighbors their friends etc doing things that are not going to
[47:00.840 --> 47:04.120]  put them in a positive light they can discredit a company they can leak
[47:04.120 --> 47:07.840]  confidential information they can post negative information on appropriate
[47:07.840 --> 47:12.920]  forums they can stop deals and they can ruin business relationships and again
[47:12.920 --> 47:18.520]  the bottom line here is the 4d's this is what government today is about deny
[47:18.520 --> 47:24.200]  disrupt degrade deceive now Glenn Greenwald points out in this article he
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.640]  says no matter what your views are on anonymous activists or just criminals he
[47:29.640 --> 47:33.680]  says it's not difficult to see how dangerous it is to have secret government
[47:33.680 --> 47:37.720]  agents being able to target any individuals that they want who have
[47:37.720 --> 47:43.320]  never been charged with any crimes let alone convicted of any crimes this is the
[47:43.320 --> 47:49.880]  war on drugs on steroids this is what we saw happen with the war on drugs decades
[47:49.880 --> 47:54.560]  ago where they would confiscate people's property that's become a major source of
[47:54.560 --> 48:00.120]  funding for all these militarized police forces it's the confiscation of what
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.640]  they call civil asset forfeiture they never charge you with a crime they
[48:04.640 --> 48:10.000]  charge your property the inanimate object with a crime and merely take it
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.760]  from you you have to sue them in court and he goes on I'm gonna read one more
[48:13.760 --> 48:17.560]  quote from him the broader point is that far beyond hacktivist these
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.240]  surveillance agencies have vested themselves with the power to deliberately
[48:22.240 --> 48:27.240]  ruin people's reputations to disrupt their online political activity even
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.160]  though they've been charged with no crimes and even though their activities
[48:31.160 --> 48:36.600]  have no conceivable connection to terrorism or even national security
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.720]  threats now as I mentioned this all started with the war on drugs and it's
[48:41.720 --> 48:46.360]  interesting to see that Obama is now looking to put in a new civil rights
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.520]  division head who wants to decriminalize possession of all drugs we'll talk about
[48:51.520 --> 48:55.920]  that but first I want to play a little bit of Rob do as much time we've got for
[48:55.920 --> 49:01.440]  the for the segment let's play Rob's report this is about what your children
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.360]  are being given in the toy stores
[49:13.840 --> 49:19.640]  hey guys Rob do from info wars.com and I saw this story last night on dailymail.com
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.080]  and I wanted to bring it to your attention has to do with the show
[49:23.080 --> 49:27.160]  Breaking Bad and the action figure that they're selling and what's really weird
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.040]  is that they're selling this at a kid's toy store Toys R Us. Florida mom demands
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.600]  Toys R Us remove Breaking Bad action figure that comes complete with Toy
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.160]  Meth. Florida mom is campaigning to have the show's action figures pulled from
[49:39.160 --> 49:43.000]  the store's racks and website saying its adult themes and depiction of violence
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.680]  and drug abuse aren't suitable for children now if you go to the actual
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.960]  website for Toys R Us and you look up the breaking bag six inch action figure
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.040]  Heisenberg shows a picture of him selling it for $13.99 you go to the
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.360]  product description and it says this unforgettable variant edition figure
[50:00.360 --> 50:03.800]  features Walter as his ultra ego of Heisenberg he comes complete with
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.200]  removable hat removable glasses a sack of cash and a bag of blue crystals
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.360]  here's a close-up of the bag of blue crystals and you can see this is what
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.480]  the meth that he was so famous for dealing during the entire series of the
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.440]  show incidentally he was using this to pay for his overpriced cancer treatment
[50:20.440 --> 50:24.600]  that was not covered under his insurance but that's a whole another side issue
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.160]  so there they are equating hey you sell drugs you get a sack of cash to go along
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.200]  with it but what happens if you get caught distributing these drugs well
[50:34.200 --> 50:38.600]  here it is off criminaldefenselawyer.com federal law mantains a prison term
[50:38.600 --> 50:41.880]  even for first convictions of at least five years for anyone convicted of
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.480]  possessing five grams of meth with the intent to distribute it and at least
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.160]  10 years for possessing 50 grams for distribution purposes

[54:23.320 --> 54:29.720]  a doll that has a bag of crystal meth for your kids to play with i guess
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.360]  can we distinguish between prohibition and promotion of drugs
[54:34.360 --> 54:37.720]  let's go back to that report that rob do had it's a very good report i want to
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.560]  finish that and i'm going to have a comment about obama's new civil rights
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.240]  division head wanting to decriminalize all drugs
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.840]  here's that report i went to our local toys are us and you can see they don't
[54:48.840 --> 54:51.800]  sell the eisenberg figures here anymore they were sold out of them but they do
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.720]  have the jesse one and it is on an end cap but it's right around the corner
[54:55.720 --> 55:00.920]  from other things like star wars gi joe uh transformers wwe
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.920]  wrestling guys so it's right on that end cap so any kid looking for those could
[55:04.920 --> 55:07.800]  go around see the heisenberg action figures say oh
[55:07.800 --> 55:10.920]  breaking bad this is a show you like dad here let's let's get in bring it home
[55:10.920 --> 55:13.720]  oh i've got my little bag of meth i'm going to go around and sell it
[55:13.720 --> 55:17.240]  teaching kids to almost become drug dealers i don't know if you see the
[55:17.240 --> 55:19.640]  connection here but this should not be a toys are us
[55:19.640 --> 55:22.600]  toys are us doesn't sell the cheech and chong action figures
[55:22.600 --> 55:25.640]  no so they shouldn't be selling action figures
[55:25.640 --> 55:30.760]  having to deal with harder drugs even than marijuana which is meth
[55:30.760 --> 55:34.760]  this is not meth here it is out of the telegraph
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.640]  parents outraged as toys are us sells crystal meth breaking bad dolls
[55:39.640 --> 55:44.280]  here's another one out of the inquisitor breaking bad doll spurs toys are us petition
[55:44.280 --> 55:47.720]  kids shouldn't play with meth the petition on change.org was started by
[55:47.720 --> 55:51.560]  susan mires who says that breaking bad sets have no place in toys are us or any
[55:51.560 --> 55:55.480]  other store that caters to children people get mad they put they put the
[55:55.480 --> 55:58.440]  word out on the blogs they start their petitions and now
[55:58.440 --> 56:02.040]  you can't even find this at any of the stores toys are us stores in the austin
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.360]  area and when i approached the girl at the front desk at toys are us the
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.200]  local one here in austin she said the product had been discontinued it had an
[56:10.200 --> 56:13.080]  x denoting it and so she said that means it's
[56:13.080 --> 56:15.880]  discontinued they're not going to sell it anymore so it looks like they are
[56:15.880 --> 56:19.160]  feeling the heat from this which is good so you need to get out there and speak
[56:19.160 --> 56:21.560]  your mind especially when you see things like this because you never know it
[56:21.560 --> 56:24.200]  could just be one person there that changed the tide
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.040]  of a giant toy company and toys are us once again this has been rob do with
[56:28.040 --> 56:30.280]  another report at info wars dot com
[56:30.280 --> 56:33.560]  uh put your comments below what do you think about all this that's a great
[56:33.560 --> 56:37.560]  report you know we have to distinguish between the promotion of drugs and
[56:37.560 --> 56:40.840]  prohibition think back to alcohol prohibition
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.360]  they passed a constitutional amendment in the first place to give the federal
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.080]  government even the power to do that because they
[56:47.080 --> 56:49.800]  don't have the power under the constitution
[56:49.800 --> 56:54.120]  where are the amendments to the constitution to prohibit
[56:54.120 --> 56:58.200]  marijuana or any of these things no they don't have it that was the beginning
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.360]  of lawlessness and what we've seen from that is civil asset forfeiture where
[57:02.360 --> 57:05.160]  they take property from people without even charging them with a crime let
[57:05.160 --> 57:07.080]  alone convicting them of a crime we've seen
[57:07.080 --> 57:11.320]  the militarization of police forces the corruption of police forces we've seen
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.640]  SWAT team raids explode now of course they don't need that anymore perhaps
[57:15.640 --> 57:19.240]  that's why they're looking at legalizing this
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.840]  i've talked many times to people from law enforcement
[57:22.840 --> 57:26.920]  against prohibition they understand how it has corrupted
[57:26.920 --> 57:30.920]  our entire system of government with this kind of prohibition but of course
[57:30.920 --> 57:33.960]  they've militarized this to the extent that now they have the department of
[57:33.960 --> 57:37.000]  education using SWAT teams on people who are late
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.640]  on their student loan fees we're arming all of our agencies turning them all
[57:41.640 --> 57:45.560]  into militarized SWAT teams it doesn't matter it's not just
[57:45.560 --> 57:48.760]  about the war on drugs so perhaps they don't need it anymore it's been very
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.400]  useful for them to fill up their prisons
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.760]  they have used mandatory minimums to put people
[57:54.760 --> 57:59.240]  who are just nonviolent users of marijuana away for a very long time
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.960]  without any discretion from the judge we just had a recent case that the
[58:03.960 --> 58:07.320]  Obama administration under Eric Holder tried to put a man
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.720]  away for 85 years who is growing medical marijuana in Montana
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.720]  doing it as a model for others according to state officials
[58:15.720 --> 58:19.160]  it was legal in that state but they tried to put him away for 85 years
[58:19.160 --> 58:22.680]  now they say they're going to legalize it i hope that they stop
[58:22.680 --> 58:26.520]  prohibition it is a medical issue it's a spiritual issue
[58:26.520 --> 58:30.360]  you can even say a psychological issue it is not a law enforcement issue
[58:30.360 --> 58:33.080]  everything doesn't have to be that we're going to be joined with Anthony

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show i'm david night your host on this
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.560]  wednesday october the 22nd 2014 i've just been given some
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.400]  news on this update on the shooting in canada
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.240]  the latest news is that one shooter is dead one still believed at large in
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.280]  downtown ottawa so this is not a lone person this is an actual conspiracy
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.760]  remains to be seen who is behind this looks like a terrorist attack
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.280]  report of additional shots fired near the chateau lawyer hotel
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.240]  east of parliament hill police are going door to door
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.760]  in the downtown core area downtown schools are in lockdown
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.640]  all three main party leaders are reported to be safe there you go so
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.640]  interesting as i was talking to jacari jackson at the bottom of the hour
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.800]  why didn't security inside the parliament building
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.000]  take care of this you know we saw the same thing happen
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.720]  at the white house it just underscores the fact
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.800]  that the government can't protect you they can't protect you in terms of
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.760]  violent attack they can't protect you with your health
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.600]  either we got a special report from alex jones it's coming up in this hour
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.360]  talking about what you need to do to protect yourself because ultimately
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.000]  we've seen that the government is not going to do anything to stop the spread
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.200]  of ebola they're not going to enact the kind of
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.680]  travel controls and quarantines that we believe should be
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.120]  enacted after an outbreak of this would be very easily
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.720]  contained in that area it's kind of like if somebody was
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.480]  sick with the plague in your neighborhood what if they allowed that
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.680]  person to walk around freely in your neighborhood but then they put
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.960]  all the other houses under some kind of martial law
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.160]  well that essentially looks like what they want to do
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.680]  to us looks like they want to get this out of control and of course
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.280]  the question that many of us have is what's going to be coming down the
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.960]  pipeline with these drugs that they are rushing through there's been a lot of
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.080]  talk about how they're going to rush vaccines and
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:27.400]  treatment drugs from big pharmaceutical from the military who's partnered with
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.920]  them they're going to rush those to market without doing safety and efficacy
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.280]  tests we have a lot of concerns about drugs
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.760]  that have passed their safety and efficacy tests because when they
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.160]  manufacture them they put a lot of preservatives in them a lot of
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.080]  chemicals that are there to actually irritate your immune system
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.680]  those in and of themselves are very dangerous i don't know that those are
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.360]  in there when they do the actual test but are we going to be
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.920]  mandated to take some untested vaccine and most of these vaccines
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:02.600]  are focusing on genetic manipulation it's not like the vaccines that you've
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.960]  seen before this is a new strain it raises a lot of
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.640]  interesting questions we're going to have Francis Boyle joining us in the third
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.240]  hour he's going to talk about the bio weapons labs that are in
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.080]  africa where these outbreaks took place he knows a great deal about this
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.000]  having written two treaties about bio weapon
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  research and control as well as a book on that so he's going to be joining us in
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.320]  the third hour we're also going to be joined in this hour with Anthony
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.400]  Gucciardi talking about some health victories and things of course that you
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.920]  can do to take control of your health just as you need to protect
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.560]  yourself with your own firearms because the government can't be there all the
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.360]  time to protect you with a policeman they can't even
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.440]  protect the white house or the canadian parliament as we're seeing
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.120]  now there's also some breaking news i saw this this is fundamentally this
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.880]  outbreak is fundamentally about open borders and of course the
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.560]  obama administration has made it clear that they are going to open up a
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.360]  massive amount of amnesty after the election they've put
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.280]  everything on hold until after the election they will not do the kind of
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.040]  protocols and containment that we need to see with something as dangerous as
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.800]  Ebola because it would push back against their open borders narrative
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.520]  and we saw just yesterday that a spokesperson
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.920]  Leon Rodriguez the head of the citizenship and immigration service
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.960]  when asked about the immigration policy the likelihood of executive action on
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.080]  immigration he said he was put on a waiting
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.120]  list and he was eventually denied admission
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.360]  into georgetown law school i want to take that analogy that he has and
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.000]  expand that a little bit further right after the break
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.040]  and anthony gutiarty is going to be joining us stay with us we'll be right
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:58.040]  back
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.800]  when you're out on the road

[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.360]  but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing

[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:15.320]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight i'm enjoying here this
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.640]  segment with anthony gucciardi but before we do i wanted to
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.000]  go back to what i was saying in the last segment
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.200]  you know this is fundamentally this Ebola outbreak and the
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.600]  lack of response in most cases to it fundamentally comes down to
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.280]  open borders the government is reluctant to do many things that they
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.280]  should because they don't want to push back against their open borders and we
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.720]  know that it's coming on steroids after the election
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.080]  the white house is punting on requests about the surge of immigrant ids
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.920]  they're ordering a tremendous number of immigrant ids as well as making other
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.160]  moves in terms of opening this up for people from other countries
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.240]  where the gentleman was mr duncan who got Ebola in that community they were
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.160]  speaking over 60 different languages that was one of the problems that they
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.840]  were faced with now when they asked leon rodriguez who's the
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.600]  new head of citizenship and immigration service this is a subdivision
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.680]  of the homeland security he said uh when they were talking about immigration he
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.120]  said he recalled how he was put on a waiting list
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.480]  and then eventually denied admission to georgetown law school
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.240]  and that was where he was speaking that day so he tried to persuade he said the
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.960]  school official to let him in and he was told
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.040]  that he was lucky to even be on the waiting list and so he said he thought
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.160]  that was a metaphor for immigration policy you know what i do too
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.240]  should he maybe have just admitted himself into georgetown regardless of
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.360]  whether he met the qualifications or whether or not they wanted him in the
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.840]  university or not should he have demanded free tuition
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.840]  well we know that out of state tuition
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.960]  rates are given to illegal immigrants under the dream act
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.560]  so matter they can go to any state that they want to no american citizen can do
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.600]  that in many cases they are in fact getting a free ride so
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.440]  yes should you have any control over the people who basically
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.960]  emigrate into your country who basically put themselves on
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.360]  your tab i think we should i think it's a very good analogy i don't think that
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.320]  he has any right to force himself on georgetown any more than someone who
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.480]  hasn't met the legal requirements gone through the processes that legal
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.920]  immigrants go through should be allowed to just self
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.320]  import themselves into the country maybe if he'd gone to georgetown maybe he
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.440]  could have just said you know what i'm now a student at georgetown
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.840]  and i demand a degree and i demand that you waive all the requirements of the
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.840]  degree just give me my degree right now now why not just do that
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.840]  listen the government can't protect you they won't protect you
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.360]  we've seen that they're going to leave the borders open anyone can bring this
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.880]  disease and they don't have to go through an airport into the united
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.080]  states they can go into a central american country and then just easily
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.440]  walk in so they won't protect you against it
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.560]  but you know what they can't even protect you against it
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.800]  here's alex jones's special report
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.560]  i'm alex jones this is a breaking abola news update in a moment i'm going to
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.600]  break down some very important developments for the world health
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.440]  organization itself is now saying that the incubation
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.480]  period is not just 21 days but can be up to 41 days
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.560]  this was announced today as it was also announced that they are
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.560]  releasing dozens and dozens of quarantine americans
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:43.880]  who are around patient zero in dallas only after 21 days of
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.960]  observation and as more flights come into the united states
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.960]  from west africa with people exhibiting signs of abola
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.480]  it's clear that there is an attempt to whitewash and cover up
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.480]  exactly what's happening but before we get into that i want to just point out
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.680]  that info wars dot com the nightly news and everything we do here
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.880]  is about us trying to find out what's really happening
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.240]  not coming at you with a preset agenda or view like the controlled left or
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.120]  controlled right and the state-run media does
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.040]  i want to know what's really happening with abola i want to know if there are
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.880]  things out there that could protect this country and protect my three children
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.360]  just as you do we're teleprompter free here ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.600]  this is about really doing the analysis really talking to a wide spectrum
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.920]  of experts and not trusting the system and that's the good news there are
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.560]  several polls out just this week public confidence in the cdc
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.520]  nosedives cbs news reports in a major poll another story
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:53.080]  64 believe america is out of control and yes ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.120]  america is getting more and more out of control
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.720]  but the good news is when african leaders come out and say that this abola
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.560]  could be weaponized people really aren't laughing anymore in fact we have an
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.080]  article on info wars dot com that has a bbc video in it
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:13.160]  secret project created weaponized abola in south africa in the 1980s
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.040]  to be used against blacks to reduce their population
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.480]  so the alternative media is now becoming the dominant media
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.280]  and we go out and source real facts and what's already admitted
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.640]  and the system calls us conspiracy theorists and attacks us
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.760]  in publications every day and has no effect
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.040]  other than boosting our credibility the arrogant dying dinosaur media
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.920]  still thinks that demonizing us is effective
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.520]  it's not ladies and gentlemen alex jones may sound crazy
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.000]  but still has 300 million youtube uh well he had 300 million people that have
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.960]  watched him on youtube and that sort of fringe arch
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.960]  conservative uh deeply i think racist strain is is being tapped into
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.960]  at at at crazy profit by people in the media well it is and i think that the
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.480]  the point you just made is the key thing at crazy profit these folks are getting
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.080]  paid to be racist now shifting to the potentially
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.840]  bad news the breaking info cnn today
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:19.640]  un staffer dies of abola monitoring ends for 43 in texas
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.520]  43 people who came in contact with abola patient
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.360]  thomas eric duncan are now officially cleared after not demonstrating
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.600]  any symptoms during a 21 day monitoring period
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.840]  here's the problem the un on its own world health organization website
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.040]  and other mainline virology sites state the same fact
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:45.080]  say that abola can easily live for 41 days in the body and 70 days in the
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.320]  semen in a man's testicles so they are releasing people
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.800]  who are around this abola patient and he's already infected two nurses
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.520]  who could not exhibit signs for another 21 days
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.800]  and this fits into the pattern of bringing in the west african flights
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.240]  when other nations ban it uh when they're putting
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.960]  abola patients in regular hospitals and the cdc told one of the nurses that
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.440]  matter between an abola patient and you've got fever go ahead and fly honey
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.640]  this is part of a pattern of trying to let
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.360]  abola get a foothold in this country so the cdc fema and north com
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.000]  can engage in a giant domestic power grab of medical tyranny
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.720]  the feds have been buying millions of firearms billions of bullets and other
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.440]  forms of ammunition they've been buying huge armored
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.200]  vehicles and deploying them in every city and digging in for biological
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.840]  catastrophe i don't know if this abola event is that
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.920]  what i do know is they're making preparations while telling us that we
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.200]  shouldn't be prepared just like they tell us we shouldn't own guns
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.400]  even though the highest crime rates are in chicago new york
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.200]  in dc where they have an abolition of the individual's right to keep their arms
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.600]  well i personally am getting prepared i saw them take the guns in katrina
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.640]  and raid the houses of people that had their own solar power
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.000]  and were high and dry i witnessed people a few years ago
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.760]  with the hurricane that hit the east coast begging for fema to help them
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.400]  and getting zero help for week after week after week
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.800]  and who could forget that famous sign that fema hung on their door
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.760]  saying we're closed because of bad weather
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.840]  i'm not sitting back waiting for the government to come protect me
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.800]  and take care of me they've shown time and time again
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.480]  they have very bad intent and bad will against the people not good will
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.800]  they want crises to get out of control so they can
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.280]  pose as the saviors and sell their toxic vaccines and other poisons
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.840]  as a solution well i'm personally getting my body ready with
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.360]  plenty of sunshine organic food purified water
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.280]  myself and my family are taking high quality colloidal
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.960]  silver from info wars life dot com the silver bullet
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.200]  i'm taking survival shield x2 true nascent iodine
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.320]  that i believe is even more important than things like loyal silver
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.320]  because if you don't have iodine in your body if you're deficient in it
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.920]  you will die it's something you've got to absolutely have
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.920]  so governments keep lowering and lowering the allowance they claim
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.120]  that we need this needs to be looked into ladies and gentlemen
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.040]  we've been investigating it it's why i'm doing everything i can to boost my
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.560]  body's natural defenses and why i'm trying to warn people
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.000]  that they can't have confidence in the system but at the same time we shouldn't
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.280]  just sit here and wait for things to spiral out of control
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.960]  none of this in the final equation is a silver bullet
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.560]  nothing is perfect but just laying there and being
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.960]  horrified and watching mainstream media deceive us and scare us
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.800]  is not going to do a damn thing we all need to get involved
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.720]  and do our own research so don't stand behind us stand
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.920]  right beside us looking at every angle of this
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:03.320]  researching what's really happening and understanding that there is clearly
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.720]  a cover-up going on with this Ebola situation now i've said many times
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.600]  i don't think this Ebola will probably really get out of hand here in the
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.640]  united states even if the feds try everything they
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.320]  can to let it spread but in africa the un is saying it could be up to
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.400]  1.4 million people or more that end up getting it
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.280]  that is just an incredible number what i'm really concerned about is the
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.440]  MRSA and the drug-resistant bacteria and the drug immune tv
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.680]  that is spreading across this country the flesh-eating bacteria
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.840]  that's why it's essential for all of us going into this flu season
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.840]  to do our own research and find out that the h1n1 shot
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.280]  five years ago lowered people's immune systems and
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.640]  doubled their chances of getting the regular flu
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.640]  that was the big killer that's why it's vital going into this winter
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:59.320]  that we all wash our hands and boost our immune systems however we can
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.320]  naturally well that's it for this emergency Ebola news

[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.080]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david knight and joining me in the studio
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.120]  is anthony gucciardi now just last weekend uh paul joseph
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.760]  was here from the uk and he and anthony went to dallas to do some research what
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.000]  you find there anthony well you know the most interesting
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.680]  interaction i went i had when i went there overall besides the fact that
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.160]  every time we would go to lunch or dinner or breakfast or whatever there
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.600]  would be a table of 15 20 people freaking out about abola
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.560]  was actually have a doctor friend up there who runs an emergency center
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.520]  emergency care center which is a booming thing in texas now
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:46.440]  and one of the nurses he was friends with i was talking to was telling me
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.720]  that she's totally freaking out because the medical community on the inside the
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.760]  doctors you know when they're they're cooler talk as you would say
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.080]  are freaking out because they're saying there's over 20 cases of probable abola
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.600]  in the united states every single day and they're reporting it to the cdc and
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.880]  the cdc is either ignoring it or discounting it
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:09.400]  and now that's not huge news until you tied in to what dr group told us when
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.920]  he came on the show a couple weeks ago he had gone to one of the largest medical
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.600]  conferences in the united states it was held in los vegas talked to a number
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.520]  of mds actually border patrol agents everything like that as we talked about
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.600]  it on air when he was here but as a pressure
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.360]  he said that there was 40 cases according to these mds
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.280]  every single day of probable abola being reported to the cdc
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.160]  and they were discounting it and not even hardly looking into it or not
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.120]  returning calls well look at what they did in the hospital we
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.680]  we subsequently learned i mean everybody was outraged
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.360]  that the guy when he first went to the the emergency room was sent home for
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.760]  two days but then we found out that when he came back
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.280]  two days later and they set him aside and they did preliminary tests i thought
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.120]  he had a bowl and everything for two days they were allowing these nurses who
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.800]  subsequently two of them have caught it to essentially treat him
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.520]  without any protective clothing well it gets a lot worse than that when you
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.440]  think about what alex's report talked about
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.720]  they're letting people out after 21 days of monitoring
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.640]  when they admit that some people can hold the virus from the 56 days
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.080]  or even the people that are cured of it they can transmit it sexually
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.120]  they can transmit it through other body fluids and they're just letting them out
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.840]  and they're just i guess you know what we're doing we're trusting them
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.280]  that they're responsible adults they would never do anything like that they
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.880]  can control themselves 100% he'll never go and be with his wife
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.000]  sexually everything will be perfectly fine abola will never spread
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.760]  but we're dealing with people that obviously are completely out of control
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.360]  but what's important here is that these doctors think it's all some
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.480]  kind of freaky joke like they don't understand that they're saying hey you
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.720]  know there's 20 cases doctor group said his md friend said 40 cases a day
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.120]  of probable abola and they're just conspiracy theorists you know that's
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.760]  what the washington post is telling us and whether it's a weekly basis or a
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:53.000]  monthly basis whatever that's unacceptable and
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.600]  there's not an adequate response and then some of the other nurses were
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.640]  charming and there was a group of people there they were saying well the cdc is
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.320]  doing all they can you know they they've given us masks and said what kind of
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.440]  masks have you been given well we have the standard cut
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.880]  paper masks and blah blah blah and they've been doing all they can
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.680]  and some of the doctors were arguing most of the doctors were agreeing that it's
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.320]  completely out of control and the cdc has no idea what they're doing or at
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.800]  least inadequately responding for whatever reason
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.080]  but there was a debate saying oh but the cdc is good
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.000]  and everything is kind of okay well you know you had these situations where
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.760]  dr freedon was telling everybody all you need is a mask and gloves or whatever
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.160]  but then they had pictures of him wearing double gloves wearing full
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.920]  hazmat suit and everything and now they have changed their rules as of monday
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.640]  and i thought the most interesting rule change that they had was
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.200]  they're telling people use a respirator at all times
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.760]  either an n95 respirator or a powdered air purifying respirator so do they
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.880]  think that it's airborne exactly and now they're saying that oh we'll
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.400]  screen some people coming from west africa we won't actually shut down
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.280]  travel but we'll screen some people it's actually
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.400]  incrementally building but what's the most concerning because when the
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:04.760]  mainstream media is freaking out about something it actually calms me down
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.360]  when the mainstream media is totally going crazy oh my god
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.800]  you know for example this shooter had a weapon
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.400]  oh my lord you know then it calms me down okay it's not a big deal
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.960]  they're just going after something but now they're saying it's almost like
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.440]  they're quelling it's like no it's okay Ebola's fine
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.640]  nothing's ever going to happen again everyone's safe everything's okay
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.680]  when this they're just letting people out they could transmit Ebola
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.560]  they're just flying all over the nation just letting them go home to their
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.480]  families without monitoring everything's fine and they don't even want to talk
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.000]  about and we talked about this i think it was me and you
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.040]  several weeks ago about some ways to naturally protect yourself
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.680]  well back then it was kind of new and i was just getting into it some of the
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.320]  research that i knew say genestine and stuff like that you know
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.320]  silver all these types of things but now we've actually broken it down
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:53.080]  further and could go to harvard research and we're going to talk about it we're
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  going to talk about how mice were given complete immunity to the virus
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.680]  not only mice but other animal trials as well complete immunity to the virus
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.800]  to the Ebola virus and instead was it some kind of a GMO
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.720]  miracle drug from big pharmaceutical on DARPA it was not a merc vaccine
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.080]  it was not a Pfizer drug we're going to talk specifically what it is and how
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.600]  you can produce it naturally in your body if you turn on the right gene
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.200]  sequences because it's been for whatever reason whether it's
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.400]  environmental factors or not there is a gene that's been suppressed that
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:25.160]  produces these compounds that have been found according to the study to give
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.800]  mice complete immunity to the virus all right great we're going to be right
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.520]  back we're going to have that and as i mentioned earlier there's been six
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.800]  separate monkey outbreaks and labs and in some of those they found
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.440]  antibodies in the humans so we know that their immune system basically
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.240]  stopped this and it's tracked stay with us we'll be right back with
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.920]  Anthony Gutiarty and your calls
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:10.360]  government is the problem from time to time we've been tempted to believe that

[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.480]  self-rule that government by an elite group is superior

[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.920]  made that happen you've grown up hearing voices that
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:46.360]  incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.920]  separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.360]  they'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:01.000]  you should reject these voices
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:10.920]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the

[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:23.720]  that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.600]  for your mind welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i'm joined
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.560]  in studio with anthony gucciardi we're going to continue
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:40.360]  and he's got some interesting news some breaking news about some compounds
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:44.040]  that in some research have given mice immunity as i was pointing out
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.560]  just before we went to break and some of these Ebola outbreaks that have been
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.600]  limited to laboratories to animals they have determined that even the people
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.360]  who didn't get Ebola in some cases developed antibodies after being
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:59.880]  exposed to it so that raises a question was it transferred
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.240]  via the air and of course there are scientists who are at that rest in
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.680]  virginia outbreak with the monkeys eventually they had to put all the
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.680]  monkeys down they couldn't contain the disease a transmission of it
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:14.200]  they clearly believed that it was being transferred
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.960]  by air there the workers picked it up and they developed antibodies so you can
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.560]  develop antibodies if your immune system is in good shape but
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.600]  anthony's got some information about some compounds
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.360]  and results that they've seen in mice but before we go to that

[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.240]  now anthony we were talking about how essentially it's kind of a game of
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.880]  russian roulette that we see the cdc playing with
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  it really is an education game and at the beginning of the hour we had a
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.920]  report from alex jones why the government can't save you from ebola
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:38.120]  but as we have victories in the info war we ought to set back and celebrate that
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.800]  and i think we've had a real victory in terms of educating people about the
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.960]  dangers of fast food and soft drinks not by
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.080]  prohibition not like they're doing it in new york not like the current head of
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.480]  the cdc did when he was michael bloomberg's
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.480]  medical director in new york you don't have to go through rigid
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.360]  prohibition but you do need to educate people
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:13.640]  here's alex with the victory that we've seen in the fall of mcdonald's
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.160]  and finally tonight here at info wars nightly news
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:23.240]  we have some incredibly good news for you it was a decade ago that the film
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.640]  supersized me came out and it changed the way the world
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.720]  not just the united states saw fast food because it was a catalyst telling us
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.280]  what we already knew that this garbage was full of addictive
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.320]  additives and was basically nothing but
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.480]  chemical biological weapons being deployed against the people
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.120]  of this planet the msg the gmo's the aspartame
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:55.160]  you name it linked to all sorts of brain tumors and health problems
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.000]  is now something that most americans are aware of
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.840]  and the numbers show it and it's a great example
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.920]  of how voting with our dollars or voting with our decisions
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:09.640]  can change the world let's go over some of the news
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.040]  out today mcdonald's profits this quarter
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.280]  are down over 30 on sales slumps and they were down
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.680]  the last few quarters as well showing basically a collapse
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:27.000]  is taking place but it's not just mcdonald's the cdc is reporting that
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.800]  americans are changing the way they eat trying to avoid fast food
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  preparing their own meals and getting healthier and healthier
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.800]  that's a story uh with the headline americans eating habits take a healthier
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.240]  turn study finds working age adults consume fewer
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.240]  calories and eat less fast food and these
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.680]  headlines don't come to you from places like info wars.com
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.040]  that have been exposing this for decades it comes to you from
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.240]  Forbes and the wall street journal and the new york times
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.440]  there is a collapse not just in confidence in the government
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.640]  but in major corporations and don't forget who's on the board of mcdonald's
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:11.080]  bill gates the eugenicist and monsanto these are people literally
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.000]  weaponizing food but the rebellion against gmo
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.320]  and all of these additives has now reached an explosive level
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.600]  and it doesn't help mcdonald's one of the biggest heads
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.520]  on this gmo hydra that a few months ago
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.720]  they got caught in china with their biggest supplier
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.760]  shipping in chickens that had been rotten for 15 days
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:39.320]  and chemically treating them that's why they lobbied to radiate all the meat
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.720]  that's why they lobbied to allow things like silicone in their nuggets
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.400]  because they need to feed you something that's basically rotten
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.520]  so that they need to spray chemicals and radiation on it
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:54.680]  show that the bacteria themselves die but you're still getting
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.160]  all of those toxins and if we can wake up to mcdonald's
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.360]  and coca-cola who's also collapsing in their profits
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.440]  then the entire globalist pyramid of weaponized food
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.880]  will implode when supersize me came out a decade ago
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.480]  and then four years ago films like fat sick and nearly dead
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:18.280]  the industries attack them but it only added credibility to them
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.880]  and that's the good news the establishment demonizes alternative
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.720]  media they demonize true consumer advocates
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:30.440]  like the folks that produce supersize me they attack that whole system
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.680]  and it only backfires on them and when the nanny state comes in and wants to
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.200]  tax fast food or ban how big a soft drink can be
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.800]  people reject that as well knowing that it's government only trying to
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.800]  capitalize on a wave of awakening and to use it
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.560]  as a system of more control michelle obama doesn't say
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:53.400]  don't eat gmo she doesn't say don't eat aspartame
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  or msg she just says eat basically prison style food that's deployed down
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:03.320]  from other major corporations so that itself is another scam
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.360]  and it's not just films like supersize me that have exposed this
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.040]  we have interviewed hundreds of guests and had tens of millions of views on
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.800]  youtube where we break down the secret history of food
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.760]  and how it's been weaponized and what's going on
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  and countless others like dr mercola have exposed it as well
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.040]  and you have exposed it on your facebook and your twitter
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.760]  and to your friends and family and we're winning 15 years ago you couldn't find
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.280]  organic food on store shelves and if you could it was incredibly expensive
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.440]  but as more people began to buy it more people got into the industry
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:40.120]  more quality and more choice came in and the price is lowering
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.720]  until now it's hard to find in major supermarkets
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.640]  stuff that isn't organic and of course there's some problems with it and some
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.280]  fraud but people are now researching that
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:53.880]  this is all part of a process of when people start to care
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.320]  and start to research it raises the quality of living
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:02.520]  it raises the quality in the society and it's an issue that transcends left
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:07.000]  and right and of course the fact that these grassroots films
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.800]  could have such a huge effect and change the world
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:15.640]  shows the power of modern paul reveres whether it's in food safety and quality
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.480]  or whether it's in the second amendment or national sovereignty issues
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.000]  or the military saying no to backing al-qaeda
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.360]  and isis against Assad last year we are seeing the conscience of the world
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:33.000]  really awaken finally though you've got to beware the empire
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  because they're going to strike back and when i go see a movie or i listen to
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.360]  the radio or watch television i am seeing mcdonald's
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:44.760]  in what i believe is it's death rows come out and say be a millionaire be a
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:50.040]  billionaire why we've got the greatest deal ever
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.120]  people in top hats are powerful and cool you know all you poor people that come
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.520]  in to get our food well guess what you could be a
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.000]  millionaire and look at all these hollywood stars
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.360]  they're eating mcdonald's and you know you could make millions
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.760]  in this monopoly game come get involved well the consumerists and others have
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.600]  broken it down and you have a very very low chance of
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.360]  actually even winning any money and they say basically nobody will ever end up
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.400]  being a millionaire so they've gone into what max
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.840]  keiser calls the casino gulag model where you've got to go in
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:28.120]  there and buy their garbage food made up of rotten chicken and gmo's and you
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.600]  name it while bill gates gets rich off of it
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:36.280]  and monsanto laughs at you and you're there like a gambler
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:39.640]  hoping that when you buy this garbage that you've got a chance to win some
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:44.040]  money so it's just like lottery tickets target the poorest
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:47.320]  people the most ignorant people mcdonald's is now
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:52.520]  moving in to targeting the welfare moms and the get rich quick people that
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.240]  have absolutely no hope of the future and are now
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:58.760]  looking to mcdonald's as a giant casino in the sky
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:02.200]  this is so dystopic that i don't think the mind of kurt
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.040]  vonnegut could have even come up with it so the good news is
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.800]  people are leaving these facilities in mass
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.120]  we're creating a new healthier culture governments trying to hijack it with the
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.920]  nanny state but that's failing the bad news is they're weaponizing
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.240]  their agenda and as far as i'm concerned mcdonald's is even worse than payday
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.360]  loan operations and loan sharks they are
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:31.160]  the bottom of the barrel and so be sure to spread this video to everybody out
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.360]  there and speak up against mcdonald's and others
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.280]  and tell people that what mcdonald's is doing is despicable
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.400]  and it's important for people that work inside mcdonald's
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.880]  that is the model of this this corporate dictatorship this
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.480]  this scientific dictatorship this weaponized food and
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.800]  weaponized culture that they need to decide which side they're on
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.960]  and not serve this evil and continue to leak information out
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:01.720]  so we know exactly what is in this so-called food
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.560]  because in my opinion in my view stuff in a porta potty is better for you
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.320]  than the stuff you get at mcdonald's all right well that's the analysis and
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.760]  breakdown tonight we're teleprompter free news we go off
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.240]  real research and real history uh if mcdonald's wants to reform itself that
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.280]  would be great but offering grapes you know with the happy
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.440]  meals isn't gonna do it not as long as bill gates
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.360]  is at the head of their board as long as monsanto is involved the bill gates
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.800]  that are involved they work for satan as far as i can tell
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.480]  all right i'm alex jones signing off for info wars nightly news and don't forget
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.240]  if you're watching this transmission you are the resistance
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.080]  okay that was alex jones from last night's nightly news and of course
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.960]  that's a victory based on education not on prohibition and it was the cdc head
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:51.560]  friedan who as bloomberg's head medical director was
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.480]  putting prohibition on all kinds of foods and substances in new york but of
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.920]  course he's not going to do anything to control the spread of ebola
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.280]  is the uh anthony oh absolutely not now we're
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.120]  going to go to our callers uh james and missouri url in florida but before we
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.160]  do i wanted to finish up with what you were telling us just before we went
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:12.360]  to break about this new research about some
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.720]  compounds that have given mice immunity to ebola
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.160]  just like the cdc isn't going to tell you how to protect yourself they're not
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.600]  going to tell you about the studies that date back from 2003
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.880]  2010 some recent ones about natural compounds that your body produces by
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:31.160]  itself antibodies so if you look back to
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.000]  gabon africa at the outbreak of 1996
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.880]  there was a 70 percent mortality rate of those who became infected right well
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.680]  they wanted to look into it and researchers from the international
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.960]  cynical center of medical research in that area
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.480]  were saying why are 30 percent of people perfectly fine why are they not
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.840]  getting well dying from this virus some some not even getting it
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.080]  they obviously found as we know now that they're antibodies that are produced by
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.800]  certain people that resist the virus and how it works is actually breaks down
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:06.040]  the cellular walls of the virus and defeats it and it produces its own
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.920]  antibodies that can then detract from the virus and stop
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.200]  it spread so they were freaking out about this and
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.640]  this was back in 1996 and there was still a lot of information on
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.200]  virology and how it works but they couldn't figure it out
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.480]  so they were saying you know why were so many asymptomatic people developing
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.720]  immune response antibodies and igm and igb to the ebola virus they also
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:29.160]  exhibited fewer inflammatory responses in general so they were
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:33.480]  getting less sick overall there was less inflammation in their bodies
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.840]  and for some reason they were beating this catastrophic virus that was
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.080]  killing 70 percent of people so harvard looked into it some
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:44.520]  medical centers some national the Kent national cancer institute looked into
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.480]  it in maryland and they found that it all came down to mannows binding
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.040]  lectins that's what this these compounds are
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.200]  mannows binding lectins and they found that it not only attacked the ebola
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.320]  virus but it was attacking infections like hiv hcv and sars
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.360]  here's what's really interesting and if alex was here right now he'd get excited
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.640]  and you know be really concerned at the same time and upset the medical
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:12.280]  establishment it's really correlated to ebola and hiv but it also has to do with
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.000]  pneumonia deeply and some of alex's family members died last year of pneumonia
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  if you don't have these mannows binding lectins you cannot conquer pneumonia
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.480]  it is the frontline defense against all of this and they've known this
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:30.040]  for years now since it came out in 2003 they looked into all this but
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.480]  real proof came out in 2010 from harvard and we're going to get into that
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.320]  but there's ways because what happens is if your body's not producing
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.360]  these mannows binding lectins there's something wrong
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.560]  your gene that is responsible for this is being suppressed
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:47.000]  and there's no real research to tell us why that is the mainstream medical
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.720]  establishment will just say it's genealogical and
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.400]  wipe it off but even harvard's interested in finding out it definitely has to
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.880]  come down to environmental factors because as it's been said basically
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.720]  the your genealogy is a loaded gun but you have to pull the trigger
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.640]  so if you have a susceptibility let's say to breast cancer you if you're
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.320]  living in the jungle eating 100% organic fruits and raw food diet
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.840]  cleanest purest water mountain springs you're probably not going to get breast
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:16.040]  cancer but if you're eating mcdonald's every day as he was talking about in
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.920]  that video and you're drinking tap water and you're going out and just
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:23.960]  drinking alcohol every night you're probably going to get breast cancer
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.840]  just because you're genealogically susceptible to it doesn't mean you're
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:30.280]  going to get it doesn't mean you have to chop off your breasts like angeline
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.080]  agility and others so specifically here though
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.560]  the key the key that they found is if you activate your immune system
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.480]  you will make these antibodies no matter if you're susceptible to this
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.720]  gene issue or not so specifically mannows binding lectins they found
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.920]  attacked the Ebola virus hiv hcv and SARS they are produced by the human body
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:55.640]  via a dna sequence called the mbl2 when our genes are working properly these
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.600]  lectins flood the bloodstream and scourge
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.000]  disease they also inhibit virus growth which is
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.840]  insane so if we all of us sitting in this room right now had enough of these
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.520]  mannows binding lectins we would have antibodies to defeat Ebola we
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.840]  wouldn't die and we wouldn't even get it in the first
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:15.080]  place if we had enough of these and that's one of the things that really
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.560]  concerns me because almost all these drugs
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:21.000]  that we see the research being pushed by the cdc and the american government
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.520]  they're all focusing at the genetic level
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.680]  and so are these things going to actually help us or in the long run
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.600]  are they going to hurt our ability to function as an immune system exactly
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.720]  our genes are being turned off in every way from the genetically modified
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.080]  organisms to the radiation Fukushima devastating us on a

[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:11.560]  we've been talking to Anthony Gucciardi and he had some breaking news about a
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:14.600]  harvard study that was very impressive about my
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:17.640]  immunity but we can come back to that but i want to get to this physician
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.840]  James in Missouri he says gear is being pulled and
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.320]  he's on a cell phone with a low battery james they're still there
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.920]  yeah hi i appreciate you taking my call i was unable to listen live i usually
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:34.440]  listen to podcasts i had no idea what you guys were talking about but
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:38.920]  a couple things i wanted to discuss i'm a family medicine physician just south
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.200]  of Kansas City in in uh cast county
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.600]  um and there's the HTA is a company that owns
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.360]  hospitals all around the country and they own um i think four of the
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.600]  the big hospitals in the Kansas City area and there was a nurse
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.240]  that is a friend of mine that uh told me called me today and told me that the
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.120]  HCA had pulled all of their hazmat gear out of all the
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.040]  hospitals that she's verified she called the other hospitals in the area pulled
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.960]  all of their gear that would be able to protect
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.400]  potentially protect people from Ebola uh flu or or um
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.120]  tuberculosis or any other illnesses they pulled everything out of uh their
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.920]  storage they have not replaced it with anything
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:28.200]  yet did they give you a reason yeah was there any reason
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.480]  was this equipment that they had before was this equipment they had before the
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.160]  Ebola outbreak or is this something that was added after the Ebola outbreak or
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.080]  well they did it what what the individual uh departments had done was
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:42.920]  sent out these uh little kits were in my opinion or work list
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:48.360]  the N95 mask and goggles uh the booties the gloves you know
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.640]  the which is inadequate but at least it was something but they
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.800]  uh it includes everything that was there before plus anything that may have
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.320]  been added since this Ebola outbreak they have not replaced it there has been
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:03.640]  no communication i specifically asked her they give a reason
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.640]  um and the department manager of her department in the ICU at one of the
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.800]  hospitals here told her that they they assume that they're going to try to
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.160]  standardize care and make sure everybody has the same thing but they
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.480]  pulled everything up well they care about you they're going to
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.760]  standardize care by taking everything you have to protect against actually
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.600]  infecting everyone the hospital with Ebola or actually tuberculosis
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.320]  they obviously care about you well and a couple other things i did
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.680]  last week um i'm out of residency i'm out of
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:36.440]  practicing position but a friend of mine who's in residency at uh
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.000]  i'll go ahead and say the hospital research medical center in Kansas City
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.600]  had a potential this is not the KU case there's a KU meds
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.560]  near here but this was another case that they
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:51.400]  potentially had Ebola and they came out and uh the patient
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:56.280]  basically disappeared after this is what we've been told over and over again
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.880]  can you confirm have you heard other stories about this i've talked to
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:02.440]  nurses and doctors and dr group told us they're
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.800]  disappearing people with apparent Ebola cases
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.560]  two weeks ago before this really started getting actually three weeks ago
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.320]  at Truman Medical Center there was a patient that disappeared
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.520]  and it wasn't even they didn't even turn into a John Doe which is a patient
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:19.160]  which is the name they give to people that don't have names that they don't
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.120]  you know that may come in unconscious or whatever
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.600]  and the patient and i came in that was in septic shot bleeding
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.720]  typically Ebola symptoms and they isolated them
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.640]  moved them to uh to whether the the ICU out of the
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.640]  ER patient disappeared they had a meeting with all the residents or whoever
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:41.000]  had contact with that patient and told them that
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.160]  he had malaria did not have Ebola which malaria is not a hemorrhagic disease
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.520]  it's totally over and then i started hearing i thought well maybe he was
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:51.320]  my friend was exaggerating but then you heard about all these other cases around
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.120]  the country where every single time i said no they
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:58.120]  didn't have Ebola they had malaria but the patient disappeared and
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.600]  my friend did a little bit of research they could not find that patient in the
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.000]  hospital he was gone and they don't even do a test
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.440]  James uh James right after we're done could you hold on we want to get your

[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:27.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night joined in studio with
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:29.880]  anthony gucciardi we just took a phone call from a
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:34.520]  physician in missouri essentially verifying what you found anthony
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.800]  uh when you were in dalas you came across medical professionals that were
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:41.080]  up there that were saying that they're hearing that there are a lot of people
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.840]  that are being diagnosed with ebola that are just disappearing out of the
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.720]  system and nobody's talking about it and that's what he was saying
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.880]  he had some firsthand knowledge of that happening in missouri as well
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:55.080]  no absolutely and they ignore it and they get calls from these doctors these
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.560]  aren't these aren't just idiots these are md's
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:01.400]  that know how to diagnose ebola and as he was saying they just claim it's
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:04.520]  malaria without actually doing a test even though we're in a
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:09.080]  potential pandemic zone right now and then just qualify it and they even
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.200]  sometimes will call the cdc and say hey we don't know if this is malaria
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.960]  what should we do and cdc says it's okay everything's fine
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.320]  and then we have heard reports of people especially on the border being
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:22.920]  disappeared with ebola like symptoms someone comes in a van
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.360]  oh we're going to come treat you takes them away md's don't hear anything they
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.480]  have access to their medical records to see what happened and they're not even
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.120]  in the records anymore and then we've got a couple of
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:36.280]  breaking uh reports today on the news uh to sick passengers on flights from
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.520]  library being monitored at chicago hospitals a similar situation in new
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.120]  work now we've seen this happen many times and they come back and they say
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.520]  well never mind they didn't have it of course we don't have the person's name
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:49.400]  or anything that's the very thing that the washington post was pushing back
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:53.000]  against that librarian paper saying that uh well they didn't get the guy's
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.880]  name so the reports of him doing things with
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.400]  formaldehyde and people's water supply that really doesn't apply but you know
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.520]  how do you how do you verify this you know how do you verify whether these
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.920]  people really didn't have it or whether they were just
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:08.040]  disappeared into the system here's the way hard to do that you don't really need
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:11.480]  to to verify the fact that we're facing a major threat when you think about the
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.360]  fact that these nurses are basically going in treating patients with trash
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.520]  bags on their heads yes yeah and you don't have to
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.680]  really verify the fact that we're bad have an Ebola outbreak when we don't
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.320]  even screen until apparently now we are doing some
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.480]  minor screening people with Ebola coming into the United States or when we
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:31.400]  don't shut down travel to Ebola infected countries where millions are
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.720]  going to have Ebola you don't have to you know it's it's it's pretty safe to
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:39.960]  assume or infer because to assume is bad to infer is to use evidence to
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.760]  reach a logical conclusion yeah i'm going to infer
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.320]  that shipping people in with Ebola into the United States so we're tolerant
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.960]  enough to spread Ebola into the United States into
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.760]  US citizens is going to lead to some type of outbreak
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:56.600]  and we're also protect ourselves we're also shipping thousands of soldiers in
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.640]  without protective equipment without really any training they get four hours
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.720]  of training and everything but they're they're going to be fine because
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.000]  they're not going to be in direct contact with anyone we're told they had
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.520]  how do you control that when you go into the hot zone let's go to some of our
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.600]  callers who've been waiting for a long time we got
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:17.400]  Earl in Florida you want to call in with your take on Ebola go ahead
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.080]  yeah i don't have to be a long-time listener of alex show
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.600]  i was just kind of curious everyone you know every time i go on the internet or
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.560]  you know look around on tv everyone seems to be sensationalizing the Ebola thing
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.120]  but i'm curious to know is how come nobody has gone
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:37.480]  into the the realm of testing certain things certain ways
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:41.880]  certain products like the uv like the overviolet machine they used to
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:46.520]  clear up you know urgency rooms why can't they put some on dialysis and run
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.440]  along tubing system going through it and subject the blood to the ultraviolet to
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:53.640]  see what happens about some some colloidal
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:57.320]  silver tests with patients that already have it now you're 100 right now
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.800]  that's an exact same question i'm asking you're asking
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:03.000]  why aren't they looking at the research from harvard in 2010
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.880]  from the national cancer institute in maryland 2003
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.800]  where we say hey there's ways to inhibit Ebola the mice are completely immune to
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.000]  Ebola when they're given proper amounts of mannus binding
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.120]  lectins or hey look at colloidal silver let's look at all these things
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:19.640]  let's not go on go out and immediately say it cures everything but let's look at
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.920]  it instead they're ignoring it completely and as David was saying
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:25.880]  over the break they're just saying you're either going to get a ball and die or
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.760]  you're not it's just a magic thing that's going to happen and we can't protect
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.400]  ourselves in any way and our immune systems don't exist so
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:34.440]  we should just listen to the government and fly over we should you know we
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.240]  should go to Liberia that's right we should go to the library with a trash
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:40.200]  bag on our head and run around and say we won't get it it'll be okay it's russian
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.160]  roulette and so the question is are you going to play russian roulette with
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.080]  one bullet in the chamber or you with six bullets in the chamber that's the
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:49.400]  question uh thanks we're going to be right back
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.960]  after the break we're going to talk about uh
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:56.120]  Ebola with Francis Boyle at the bottom of the hour he's

[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:05.960]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:09.160]  each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:12.920]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:16.600]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:19.640]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:23.000]  there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.280]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:33.800]  allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:37.000]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.120]  order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape

[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:25.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we're just uh had anthony
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.440]  gutier already here talking about health issues and of course he was talking
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:33.160]  about a 10-year-old study out of harvard talking about how the
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.400]  mechanisms of compounds that they were seeing analyzing to
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.680]  know that they noticed that certain people had an immunity not only
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:45.160]  against Ebola but against a wide range of viruses
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:48.040]  what's going on with that why are we hearing more about that research that's
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.400]  what one of our callers was asking us he said we don't hear about that we don't
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.720]  hear about the ultraviolet uh machine that goes in i think it's like 25
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:00.200]  thousand times the intensity of regular sunlight they put it into
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.800]  a room uh turned it on for like five minutes on either side of the bed and
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.720]  it basically kills all germs all viruses because you know it's not just
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.400]  Ebola that's not the major killer at this point everybody's concerned
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:15.080]  about it because it has been spreading so rapidly throughout
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:19.000]  Africa this is a different strain by the way of Ebola than they've ever
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.480]  seen before and all the previous outbreaks all of them combined they've
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:26.920]  had 2400 people come down with it we're approaching
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:30.680]  10 000 it's about the 90 700 now at this point
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.760]  last i saw a couple of days ago so we're already in this one outbreak four
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.800]  times as many as we've seen in the last couple of decades of Ebola so
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:42.600]  this is a different strain and we're going to be talking at the bottom of the
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.840]  hour to Francis Boyle he's someone who knows a great deal
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:51.400]  about bio weapons and about the bio weapon labs that are in that part of
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.320]  Africa he has some interesting questions about what's going on there
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:58.840]  but you know there's also a question we raised this as well and an article i
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:01.800]  wrote on info wars dot com and of course we were attacked for
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.840]  asking the rhetorical question if convalescent serum is not an effective
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.880]  treatment then why is the u.s military and pharmaceutical companies and big
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:16.520]  tobacco why are they spending millions of dollars and waiting months to roll
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.640]  out a synthetic imitation of that the who and the cdc says well it's
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.400]  unproven no actually they've had a lot of success with that going back
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:30.040]  with a lot of different diseases diphtheria was the first one i had
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:35.080]  someone win the Nobel prize a german scientist back in 1901 for using that
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.960]  this is something's been around for about 125 years
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:41.240]  it's very well known we've seen that the people who have received blood
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.560]  transfusions from kent brantley have largely recovered we've
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:49.880]  now got news that nina fam who's the most recent one to get it
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.720]  is improving rapidly and the mbc cameraman who received
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:57.000]  blood from kent brantley has now been said that he has
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.880]  recovered that there's no sign of Ebola in his blood so
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:03.160]  why don't we see those things being covered well of course there's a money
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:07.320]  trail involved in that but if you point that out if you point out that
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:11.400]  pharmaceutical companies and have have done this in the past with things like
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  medical marijuana being prohibited yet their synthetic versions of it
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:20.680]  are allowed and sold we see this over and over again but if we point that out
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:24.360]  we're simply conspiracy theorists but i want to take a couple more calls because
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:28.200]  you know as we see these things not being done we don't see the uv
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:30.840]  machines being sent with the troops going in we had a
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:34.040]  caller here ironhead in washington he wanted to talk about the
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.560]  5000 troops that are being sent and of course they're not getting
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.560]  the upgraded protection suits they're not getting
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:45.240]  any instructions really they're getting like four hours of instructions
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:48.440]  and some face masks and gloves that is not
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.920]  what the cdc says is safe they've upped the protocol including
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.840]  respirators just this last monday so they're walking back
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:00.120]  their comments saying oh don't worry about that you don't need to have anything
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.400]  other than just a face mask uh ironhead what did you want to say about the
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.400]  troops that are being injected into the Ebola outbreak in Liberia
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:10.600]  well you just hit it right on the on the head there
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.320]  put note do you remember dr mary's monkey ed haslam and what he showed us
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.120]  with the sd-40 cancer virus being basically introduced to the entire
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.560]  uh smallpox vaccination personally i think which
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:28.040]  possibly potentially coming down to the exact same scenario you put 5000 troops
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.760]  over there they become a vector metric
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.480]  metric to bring that back in and you know spread it throughout
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.920]  first of all the military and then throughout the civilian population
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.040]  yes absolutely and and dr frances boil that we're gonna have at the bottom of
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.200]  the hour raised that exact question said why are we sending in
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:49.400]  this unit that is is known for being a special
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.320]  ops unit and and yet they don't have any specific medical skills that they're
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.320]  doing here i mean do we need to send uh that kind of a combat unit an elite
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.360]  combat unit into that area in order to build
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.840]  buildings how do we keep them secure can't they get contractors to go into
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:07.720]  that area i mean that's the concern that everybody
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.680]  has about that and again as i said we're going to be talking to him at the
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:13.320]  bottom of the hour makes us to get his comments on that
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.680]  um i want to move from Ebola now to the shooting
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.360]  that uh happened this morning in Canada we've got a couple of can uh
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.040]  Canadian callers who've been on hold and i'd like to get an update on that
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.520]  information uh Eric in Canada you want to talk about the Ottawa shooting
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.960]  uh yeah um i'm uh i've been in the military for a year now right and i've
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:38.360]  been concerned about like what do you think the safety on our troops and also
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:41.160]  do you think this could also be a good excuse for them to get rid of the guns
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.080]  and like to see what you guys can say on that
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.440]  you to get rid of the guns well you've already got pretty heavy uh gun control
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:51.880]  there don't you it's kind of like um kind of like Connecticut where they had a
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.080]  lot of gun control but it didn't stop the school from getting shot up and
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:59.000]  what do you make of the idea that uh this could happen at the parliament
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.120]  building i mean obviously they would have some armed guards at the parliament
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:05.080]  building wouldn't they uh yeah you think so i've
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.920]  probably seen an article a couple years ago saying that um they had no security
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:12.040]  but i think in 2006 they decided to enhance the
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:15.720]  security with mp5 sub machine guns and the c9
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:21.160]  rifles but as far as i'm concerned i think uh
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:24.200]  yeah gun control simply doesn't work like if you can see in a place that has
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:28.600]  heightened gun control gets more chaos like this i
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:32.520]  hey anything can happen right well you know what you can see is is that
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  even with all the secret service agents around Obama they can't protect him
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.240]  from somebody just running across the white house
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.320]  lawn and into the white house uh we see now the same thing happening
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:47.160]  in in parliament are you hearing anything on the news about this uh being
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.560]  an organized terrorist event last i heard they had uh killed one gunman but
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.320]  there was at least one more that was still at large
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:58.600]  uh i haven't heard anything about that but i'm thinking it might be a strain of
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.960]  a copycat because of what happened a couple days ago here in Quebec
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.800]  okay was a um yeah you're i think you're aware of it the um
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.560]  that guy in a car who ran over a couple soldiers all right
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.840]  yes yes and they were talking about that so they said yeah they uh they thought
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.920]  it might be some kind of a terrorist related event based on that thanks
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.000]  eric let's go to ron in canada ron do you have any information about uh
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.160]  the shooting in canada uh how you doing go good
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.160]  okay yeah i do actually um what you were just mentioning uh
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:34.920]  there is another suspect at large okay here on tv are they saying just one
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.520]  one or more than one supposed to be a third event that happened somewhere
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.680]  else and then they took it back and said no
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.760]  that didn't happen and then the the lockdown was lifted at that place
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.720]  so i don't know if there's a third but uh from i do i do want to say a few things
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:55.400]  about what i think this is okay sure uh basically i think this is ices
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:01.160]  um one of the cb cbc mentioned that a couple days ago there was there was
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.440]  increased activity on twitter about some of these
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.720]  syrian jihadi uh going out uh calling for attacks against the canadian
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.920]  government um you know so i think that's what it is
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.440]  yeah and it's it's unfortunate isn't it that we just keep arming them whether
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.040]  it's intentional or whether it is accidentally and we just
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:26.920]  dropped a load of weapons uh by parachute to supposedly help
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:31.080]  their opponents the courage and then we see on social media that ices
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.360]  brags about the fact that all of those weapons basically
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:38.600]  fell into their hands uh we we've seen this for a long time we've been
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.720]  telling people going back years that our government is arming and
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.520]  training al-qaeda we've been telling people that
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:52.280]  ices and the terrorists that were in syria were actually uh not good guys
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:57.480]  and yet our government was arming them and training them to fight the syrian
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.720]  government so now we have ices and i'm sure that there will be people you
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.160]  know this is it's not just a false flag i mean that
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.720]  even if our government identifies radical people in other countries
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:13.320]  and arms and equips them that doesn't mean that they aren't going to then
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:16.760]  use those things domestically against us of course those people
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.040]  are crazy and it only makes it more dangerous when our government gives
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:22.680]  them arms and trains them what what's your take on that
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.840]  you're exactly right um well i i knew about that
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:32.120]  and you know what i thought about it was ridiculous uh arming these you know
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.800]  nsa or what were the uh the pre-sharing army the fsa
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:40.200]  to go ahead and you know to try to take out assaults forces
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.720]  apparently i heard that the fsa wasn't able to take out a sod
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.720]  and that it only took like a hand a small handful of ices fighters to take out a
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:52.440]  sod government like the it's ridiculous i just want to say
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.000]  one more thing before we go because i know you have a lot of colors you want
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.480]  to get to um basically i want to figure out like i know
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.200]  all this is going to come out in detail i want to know what kind of gun this guy
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:05.960]  was using where it was made what his name was who is he
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:09.720]  i want to know all the identities of these people i just have a bad feeling
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:13.480]  that this is these guys are muslim and i'm in canada
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.320]  there's a lot of mosques around here i went to a mosque the other day i was
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.440]  looking at some of these characters and man they look pretty shady like a lot
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.840]  of these guys had woods on their heads and everything
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:26.680]  and in canada we we accept uh the muslim religion as
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:31.720]  you know it's a multicultural uh country and we just let everybody operate you
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:35.640]  know with impunity because we allow everyone to do what they basically want
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.920]  to do if we have completely open borders we don't know if uh convicted
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:42.280]  criminals are coming into our country we don't know if we've got
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.160]  terrorists coming into our country thanks for the call let's go to chance in

[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:14.920]  joined in next segment with francis boil an expert on bio terrorism and he's
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:18.600]  going to talk to us about some weird things going on
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:23.160]  in africa around the ebola outbreak now in the last segment we were just
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:28.600]  talking to some callers from canada and one of the callers said all the people
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:30.840]  that he's hearing on talk radio there they're all
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.560]  being scared about isis and they're willing to give up their civil liberties
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:39.960]  i would just remind you that it wasn't that long ago it was just a few weeks
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:44.360]  ago that we had the candidate for senate scott brown in new hampshire saying
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:47.560]  that he thought that we ought to
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:51.080]  take the citizenship away of anybody that we accuse
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.560]  of being on isis's side in syria of course that's really
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.640]  easy to just move from there to just accusing somebody with being
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:03.640]  with isis and taking away their rights or their citizenship here
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.520]  because then that makes it a little bit more easier to
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.360]  deny their other due process and of course we were told that
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:14.520]  we've heard that there's up to 300 americans who are fighting with isis and
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.320]  if we take away their citizenship they won't be able to get back in the
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.680]  country really do you need citizenship or permission
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:24.200]  to get into this country through our open borders that's nonsense besides the
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.280]  fbi then came in and said no uh it's probably more like about
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:31.800]  12 12 but we had ted cruise jump on that bandwagon
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:37.720]  too we don't want to give up our liberties by being scared
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:41.640]  into this isis thing remember that it was our government who
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:45.080]  funded and trained these people who set them up
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.400]  in a way to that they could then have a justification to go back into syria which
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:53.720]  is what they've been trying to do for two years let's not get scared into this
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.680]  but speaking of scott brown the centerfold
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:00.760]  senator as he was using that ridiculous analogy saying we need to
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.880]  just be able to arbitrarily strip them of their citizenship
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.800]  to keep them from coming back into the country listen to why his opponent
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.640]  had to say in that race do you approve of the job president obama is doing now
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:16.520]  there'll be a chance to follow up but this is a yes or no answer
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:23.640]  do you approve yes or no in some ways i approve and some things i don't approve
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.560]  so you know check on the like like most questions
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:31.880]  that we deal with as policymakers there aren't simple answers
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:36.120]  yeah she was for him before she was against him but maybe she's not
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.120]  you know we're seeing over and over again how the republicans
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.000]  and the democrats are really the fringe candidates
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.440]  look at the situation in florida we've got a libertarian running their
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:49.560]  adrian wiley he's really a serious candidate unlike
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.800]  charlie christ and donnell scott the only thing serious about them is that the
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:57.720]  media is taking them seriously he's polling the libertarian candidate third
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:01.480]  party candidate is polling around 10 percent in the polls and yet
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.720]  of course they won't let him in the debates we see that over and over again
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.200]  that's a reminder that we are going to be doing an election coverage here as part
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.920]  of the info war is nightly news and if you're not a subscriber
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:16.280]  please consider subscribing it's one way that you can support our operation you
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.640]  can share it with other people you can see alex's documentaries but we're
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.760]  going to have a special election coverage the night before the election the
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:25.880]  monday night before the election we're gonna have live coverage for a couple
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:29.080]  of hours for our subscribers and we're also going to have
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.200]  a about a four-hour live coverage on election night and we're not going to
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:39.080]  be just covering the horse race aspects of it or the republican versus
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.960]  democrat aspect of it we're also going to look at some of the issues you know
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:44.920]  they're going to be looking at whether or not they're going to get rid of the
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:49.000]  income tax in tennessee that's going to be interesting we're going to be
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.160]  looking at some ballot initiatives for a lot of different things so we're going
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.760]  to be looking at the freedom aspect of things not just the left
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:00.920]  right paradigm and the really the serious candidates so we see over and
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:04.760]  over again there's a lot of people who are giving a serious look to
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:08.360]  people outside the republicans democrats they keep voting for the same thing
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.800]  and getting the same results or looking for something different
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.480]  i think it's very interesting that this guy in florida is talking about
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:19.000]  essentially ending property taxes for people who
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.240]  live in their home and adjusting the tax burden around
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.640]  sharing doing revenue sharing with the state and the county but also basically
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.240]  cutting back government have you seen even the republicans cutting back
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.400]  government no you can go back just a few years and you can get rid of something
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:38.040]  like the property tax for people who are living in their homes
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.320]  it's also interesting the way some of this is coming into play and i he's at
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:44.120]  10 in the polls and that's going to be a tight race in
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.880]  florida so you know he could basically throw that into a runoff we see the same
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:51.000]  thing happening in chicago an interesting thing there
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.240]  is that a union has already donated thirty thousand dollars to the libertarian
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:57.480]  candidate and it looks like they're going to give them
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:02.360]  six figures in in that state so there's some interesting dynamics here but it
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:06.600]  really is fundamentally about where people are going to fall on the
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.200]  freedom spectrum it's not a left right thing if you think it's a left right
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:14.920]  thing you really need to look up the nolan chart search that on google
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.680]  that gives you a much better picture of where people are
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:23.240]  on a spectrum it's actually it's not just left or right as ronald reagan
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:28.200]  said it's up or down are we going to go down towards authoritarianism towards
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:32.360]  taking away our freedoms are we going to move up towards liberty to greater
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.040]  freedom are we going to have people that are really going to move
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:39.000]  against the nsa that's something we're going to be covering in our special
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.600]  election report and look at our newsletter we've got a new newsletter

[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:36.520]  absolutely david i've been here at the home office getting ready for some big
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:41.320]  stories we're about to break uh also i'll be on coast to coast
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.960]  a him tonight for several hours with george
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:49.400]  summary on over 500 radio stations uh nationwide so i'll have all the
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:54.520]  latest intel this evening midnight central one a.m. eastern
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:34:01.160]  p.m. pacific 11 p.m. of course uh mountain so
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:04.040]  that's all coming up as well on coast to coast a.m.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:08.040]  with george nory tonight i'll be hosting our guest for several
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.640]  hours with george when i saw fall watch this article this morning on that
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.480]  my heart just shunned and then when i saw the police come out
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:22.680]  and say to everybody uh that uh social media was somehow bad and
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:26.920]  people shouldn't communicate about what was happening uh it
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:30.760]  really reminded me of what unfolded
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.840]  oh many many years ago back with the seven seven bombings in london
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:38.680]  that were clearly a false flag were bare minimum they had faxing
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.440]  uh with backpack bombs who were set up as part of a drill
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:46.520]  we later confirmed that uh and then it turned out the mi6
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:51.320]  agency was the leader of the group was protected and was basically al-qaeda
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:55.800]  what we call ices today so just like criminal elements of western
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:35:00.040]  governments are funding radicals london uh i would say they're the prime
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:04.120]  suspects in this will probably allow to do it if they aren't and they claim it's
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:07.320]  some right wing patriot group or french separatist group
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:11.720]  you can believe it's a setup and the way they're saying don't care social media
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:14.920]  don't take photos don't document what's happening
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:18.840]  to me is the big tip-off because in old-fashioned police work the people are
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:21.480]  the eyes of the years and cops when they're doing real
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:25.480]  investigations and use social media and use the public
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:29.320]  and use the human human open force intelligence
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:32.760]  to find out what's happening so i would call somebody like david steel or
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:35.960]  steve latinic i'll be back tomorrow live we're doing a great job
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.640]  not filling in but hosting the show david doing an amazing job with the whole
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:43.960]  crew there and Anthony Gucciardi and just everybody that's coming in
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:48.520]  uh but but here's here's the takeaway from the story in Canada
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:52.760]  it it might be real because they're not hyping it's super big right now
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:56.120]  because when something stays they're really hyping like that of it
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:01.000]  have a narrative very quickly now uh it could be some type of threat from
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.880]  saudi arabia that the west but are getting line of the long least real
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:07.400]  heritage or it could be stayed or could be some
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:11.080]  sleeper cells that have been activated by ices because they're being double
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:14.360]  crossed by the west right now because they got out of control quite
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:19.000]  frankly things are so complex right now i don't think we know exactly what's
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.560]  happening but it's a very bad sign that the police
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:25.480]  are trying to restrict media independent media and social media
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:29.080]  and are implying it's connected to mass shootings and terrorism it's all part of
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:33.000]  this where we see protesters attacking police they don't arrest them
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.680]  they attack the gerry jackson and joe bigs and al-jazeera
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:40.760]  so it's part of that dangerous pattern i'm looking at all the intel right now
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  it's cutting it all day get daniel's as an article going up the next few minutes
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:47.960]  on info wars dot com and president planet dot com
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:51.880]  and we will be focused like a laser beam with our whole investigative team
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:55.640]  joe bigs just follow the video report that'll be up on info wars dot com very
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:58.920]  soon leon macadoo jacari jackson
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:04.200]  john bound uh adan salazar uh course mcgill salem
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:08.920]  Anthony gucciardi uh curt demo and just so many others i haven't listed
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:14.360]  our names here are ferreting out every point but here's what's most important
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:17.960]  q-mat human intelligence you are huge listeners
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:24.440]  in toronto in ottawa in new york in rochester we need citizen reporters
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:28.440]  to be on the ground tracking everything because they don't want that
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:31.800]  and if they didn't have something to hide or they weren't trying to manage a
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:35.480]  narrative the police wouldn't be aiming gun to innocent reporters
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:39.320]  and interested people and the fact that they haven't caught one of these guys
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.160]  still very very thick so catch the ground
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.720]  folks get out there people are the resisted find out what's happened but
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.960]  let's just be with the camera on the ground go through the video footage for
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:56.440]  the mainstream media pour over their statements record all their
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:59.320]  press conference track everything just like we taught the
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:03.400]  underwear bomb uh being uh put on the plane and it was
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:06.440]  confirmed in congress two months after we broke it or a month and a half
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:09.560]  just like we suppose seven seven just like we suppose the boss in bombing
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:14.120]  just like we suppose to haven't with the blue screens and all the fake actors
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.560]  we are going to find out what happens here but if it is real
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:22.040]  Islamist that's what you could be in fact i've looked at the numbers
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:25.800]  everything that they claim is right wing okay if they claim it's french
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:28.920]  chevrolet you can believe it's paying the two dollar or three dollar bill
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.480]  still aren't built against the real the prayers here if they go with a narrative
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:36.440]  that it's ices so i would say now we got to have votes on the ground
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.520]  that could be a false flag move as well uh but then they're going to say well
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.200]  why is canada sold for the medley why is the u.s open
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:47.960]  we don't know but i've been predicting hundreds of times
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:51.480]  Islamist al-qaeda affiliated mass shootings
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:58.280]  at capitol shopping mall colleges and public schools
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:02.200]  because they want to put dsa on the streets and checkpoints randomly on the
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:05.400]  streets and marshal law basically but never control the border
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:10.600]  so none of it holds water canada is wide open the medley
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:14.040]  but if you're a u.s doesn't treat you like trash i've experienced so
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.320]  we're looking at every angle we're throwing up a point david night
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:23.800]  the rest of the team are on the job right now they are on the job
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:29.240]  taking action and uh this is just part of the course that and of all the
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:32.680]  takeaways i'm laid out here here's the final government whether it's
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:36.840]  standing in the west coast or east coast whether it's katrina hit the coast
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:40.760]  or whether it's oboe whatever it is government can't and won't
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:45.480]  help you show all the police take all these laws of liberty all the spine
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:49.880]  all the checkpoints all the trillions all the wars and al-qaeda and ices are
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:52.520]  bigger than ever we've lost more freedoms than ever
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.560]  and the government's saying about more liberties you'll be protected
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:59.800]  it is totally and completely bogus i'm going to throw it back to david night
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:04.280]  hosting info wars worldwide and i'll be back with a special report
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.640]  on info wars dot com the madly news tonight with the rest of the team
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.480]  and george dory coast to coast a m i was already going on the show tonight
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.320]  you can read on coast to coast a m dot com i was already going on tonight about
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:19.160]  ices and what's really behind it and terrorism looming
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:24.040]  in the united states and more so we'll be covering all that tonight on coast to
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.480]  coast a m all right public gentlemen and ladies
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:32.280]  let's continue on with the human analysis of our host and listeners
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:35.480]  thank you alex says alex jones on the line and of course the article he is
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.400]  talking about censorship uh rcmp asked the public
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:44.840]  not to post photos or videos of the ottawa shooting that's up on info wars
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.560]  dot com that's kit daniel's got a story there with a tweet
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:50.440]  and analysis now on the line we have with us
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:56.440]  professor francis boil uh dr boil is a leading american expert in international
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:41:00.280]  law he's responsible for drafting the biological weapons anti-terrorism
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:05.800]  act of 1989 the american implementing legislation for the 1972 biological
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:09.800]  weapons convention and he's the author of a lot of books but
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:14.600]  the one that we're interested in today is bio warfare and terrorism
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:18.200]  we have him on the line and uh welcome dr boil
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:22.840]  well thank you uh david uh and my best to your viewing audience
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.520]  thank you thank you for waiting and we had that breaking news that's very
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:29.400]  important that's going on there but i wanted to ask you
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:34.600]  about the bio weapons labs that are in these african countries because you
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:38.200]  know uh very well what's going on with the bio
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:42.120]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act that you drafted there why are they
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.560]  putting these labs in those countries
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:51.720]  well it's very simple uh in try to uh circumvent the biological weapons
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:57.320]  convention and my uh biological weapons anti-terrorism act of
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:03.720]  1989 that provides for uh life in prison we have a bsl
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:08.520]  four in guinea we have one at the capital there one in
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:15.560]  Liberia, Monrovia and another one at Kenema in Sierra Leone
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:22.920]  and they all do this dual use offensive defensive biological warfare work
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:28.680]  guinea is uh never been a party to the uh biological weapons convention uh
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:32.760]  Liberia has never been a party uh Sierra Leone
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:37.880]  is a party but you know given the disturbances over there i'm sure no one's
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:42.120]  been paying attention to what's been going on in these labs however i will
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:48.440]  point out i drafted the uh my my biological weapons anti-terrorism act
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:52.920]  to make it extraterritorial by name in Hague Verba
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:57.560]  so that these uh illegal criminal uh types of
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:03.320]  bio warfare work done in these labs by us citizens uh can be uh can be
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:07.800]  prosecuted that's interesting now as you pointed out the cdc is there to
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:12.200]  Lane University anybody knows about the notorious Tuskegee
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:15.960]  uh test that ran for decades on uh black people syphilis
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:19.960]  not telling them that uh uh well not not giving them treatment and just
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:25.000]  watching uh this develop for decades to Lane University is there as well as the
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:28.280]  cdc so what is your take on this do you think this is
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:32.440]  something that was perhaps accidentally leaked out is this deliberate
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:35.160]  because it's interesting that this is a different strain
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:40.280]  and it is thousands of miles away from where these are typically happening in
[02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:43.720]  central africa this is now over in western africa they want to say that
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:46.920]  it transmitted by uh passing through animals i mean why
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:50.600]  didn't we have any outbreaks in between those two different areas
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:55.080]  that's right the uh uh uh standard explanation is completely
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:59.560]  uh nonsensical i have here uh in front of me
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:06.680]  the uh biological defense research program of 1988 page appendix 3-4
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:10.280]  clearly says that the center for disease control
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:14.840]  has been doing biological warfare work in Sierra Leone
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:22.360]  since 1988 and also uh Columbia University was doing biological warfare
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:26.440]  work in Liberia uh and as i said Liberia has never
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:31.800]  been a party to the uh uh bwc of course this uh
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:37.960]  bat theory makes no sense at all right it's clear that um in my opinion
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:43.400]  uh the um the agent we're dealing with here of ebola
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:51.160]  uh is um 70 fatality whereas all previous ebola outbreaks had been
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:58.200]  uh 50 percent and also it appears that uh it has
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:03.080]  perhaps somehow been uh genetically modified to
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:09.000]  make it airborne to some extent uh i recently sent to your assistant there
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.480]  uh a press release the national institutes of health
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:22.520]  uh uh mated uh live ebola uh with uh the virus for the common cold
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:28.840]  and well might have been this type of uh vaccine
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:34.920]  that they were testing out over there uh at these bsl4 facilities we know that
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:40.360]  the uh Sierra Leone uh government shut down Kenamon
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:47.320]  and accusing them of starting the uh pandemic with shots
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.520]  uh under the supervision of Tulane and we know for a fact Tulane has been
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.760]  involved in um uh bio warfare work for quite some time
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.600]  we also know that uh Fort Dietrich uh is over there
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.720]  the center for disease control is over there uh these three labs were set up
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:11.000]  by uh USAID which is a front organization for the CIA
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.600]  so i i think it's pretty clear uh these these three labs
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:21.480]  i suspect were the uh origins of this pandemic
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.480]  which has now um come here to the united states um
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:31.960]  the cdc just that's just said uh 21 day uh quarantine
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.840]  but the who recommends 42 day quarantine
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:43.400]  the even the 42 day quarantine uh only gets 98 percent of the people
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:49.240]  um so uh my guess is uh you know we we should really be talking about a
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:53.960]  50 days or more uh quarantine and the question then is
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:58.360]  you know why do they allow the 4 000 people on that cruise ship
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.880]  off and according to yesterday's new york times
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:05.960]  there's no monitoring on any of them every other uh contact
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.680]  going back to uh mr duncan is somehow being traced
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:16.040]  contacted what quarantine whatever but the 4 000 people on that ship
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.320]  no and they could have easily um just quarantine everyone on the ship right
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:25.880]  there so uh i don't know uh exactly what to
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:29.320]  say about this but uh it doesn't look good
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:33.480]  well we saw that in nigeria they've gone now the 42 days
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:36.600]  and they haven't had another outbreak there but they
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:40.760]  went through contact tracing they had 900 people that they were looking at
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:44.520]  based on one person who flew into their country on an airplane was very
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:47.720]  sick 20 people caught it eight people died
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:51.400]  and they had 900 people that they were looking at we haven't seen
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:54.360]  anything like that as you pointed out you know we've got a situation where
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:58.680]  you've got this new strain of Ebola that they've never seen before
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:04.120]  that travels from an area where they've typically had it in central africa
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.240]  a thousand to two thousand miles and they want to tell us that it's been
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.320]  traveled you know that's that they got there by bats i mean that's just not
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.560]  that's that's not very credible is it well even the new york times reported
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:21.640]  that in 1976 that when uh Ebola was first discovered
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:26.760]  the world health organization ordered it to be sent to port and down in the
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:30.520]  uk that's their equivalent of a fourth detrick
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:34.040]  so uh you can figure out what happened with it from there
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:38.360]  and Sierra Leone is uh a former colony of britain
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:44.200]  Liberia has always functioned as a de facto colony of america
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:48.040]  and now we see uh us troops uh in
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:51.720]  Liberia british troops in Sierra Leone and
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:58.520]  france the former colonial power of in guinea sending troops in there
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:01.720]  you talk about them finding it isolating it and then immediately sending it back
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:04.360]  to their equivalent of fourth detrick in the uk
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:07.800]  is very much like the movie aliens you know that one guy finds that alien he
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:10.920]  says you know don't kill it i got to get it back to the military industrial
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.040]  complex that's what they do there was an article that came out today i think is
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:17.320]  very interesting as we look at this this is a new strain they were talking
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:20.440]  about it being a new strain was first identified first broke out in
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:23.560]  april and if you look at all the previous outbreaks
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  it's about 2,500 uh people's 2478 i totaled it up
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.800]  already in this one we've had about 9,700 people so it's about four times
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:35.240]  all the previous outbreaks combined this is a new strain
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:37.800]  it looks like it's a weaponized strain you're talking about them bringing
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.640]  something back and working on it we just have a report that came out
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.160]  last friday basically kind of buried in the friday
[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:48.840]  news cycle this is from the new york times and we haven't seen very much
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:52.040]  reporting about this the white house said they were going to cut funding
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.680]  for risky biological studies now this is them saying that they're not going to
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:59.560]  do any more weaponizing what do you make of that
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:04.040]  well that's the smoking gun that's right in the new york times you see
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.640]  they de facto admitted that this is exactly what they were doing
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:16.120]  at those bsl four labs uh in the three bsl four labs in
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:21.880]  uh west africa and they're basically sort of retroactively
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:27.320]  trying to uh cover their rear ends there yes that statement that came out
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:31.000]  friday is a pretty good indication that they know
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.360]  that those three labs uh and other researchers here in america like
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:43.160]  two-lane cdc national institutes of health uh galveston down there university
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:46.680]  of texas uh have been up to their eyeballs uh in
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.760]  this uh uh i i would only know what to say
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:56.280]  weaponization of uh of ebola it is it does not appear it
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:51:01.720]  is as uh uh contagious as the flu but it looks
[02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:05.400]  like it could be as contagious as the common cold
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:09.880]  which is what um the national institutes of health has been working on now for
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:13.880]  quite some time so it could be that they
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:20.200]  uh ship that agent over there uh uh put it into some type of vaccine
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:24.280]  and then uh tested it out on these people yeah and you know we should always
[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:28.120]  remember that the influenza epidemic right at the end of world war one that
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:31.960]  killed 21 million people that was from soldiers
[02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:35.960]  returning bringing back that epidemic to their country now we've put
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:39.880]  5 000 soldiers into the heart of the heaviest
[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:43.880]  outbreak of ebola not with much training not with
[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:47.880]  basically any effective equipment to protect them uh we're putting them at
[02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:51.800]  risk that to me is a huge deal but going back to this
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:56.440]  new york times thing we know for a fact that this uh
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:52:02.280]  dr. Mengele a professor at the university of wisconsin resurrected the spanish
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:07.000]  flu virus brought about life uh on behalf of the
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.760]  pentagon we know that for a fact we also know that the same uh dr. Mengele at
[02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:18.520]  the university of wisconsin uh genetically engineered ebola
[02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:23.560]  to make it more dangerous and we also know this uh uh same dr. Mengele at the
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:29.240]  university of wisconsin uh does uh uh gmo uh
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:36.120]  flu work which with h5 and one and some of the others and that's exactly what
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:39.480]  they're saying they're they're stopping they're only saying that uh
[02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:42.680]  they're they're stopping not ebola research they're not mentioning that
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:46.680]  they say the moratorium is only on research on the influenza virus
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:52.040]  and the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS it made no mention of ebola or
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:55.880]  any related phyllo virus ebola is already extremely lethal they say but
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:53:00.200]  it's not easily transmissible that's the new york times take on that
[02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:04.120]  so in other words they've admitted they were doing it yes
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:10.680]  and then second uh the word ebola wasn't in there because if they had put
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:15.160]  ebola in there on the list everyone would have said well
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:19.880]  what were they really doing with ebola right and that's why ebola is not on the
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:23.800]  list it should be on the list but they're gonna say that
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:26.600]  because everyone would then ask the next question
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:30.440]  sure it was censored out of there but we know
[02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:35.240]  they have done that type of dr. Mengele uh by a warfare work
[02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:38.760]  with ebola as well as those other agents
[02:53:38.760 --> 02:53:43.240]  which they admitted they were doing as recently as last friday
[02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:46.840]  now this first release that you sent to us you talked about it being gmo'd
[02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:50.920]  into a flu bola and they do actually mention in the new york times
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:56.040]  what you just talked about the h5n1 avian influenza they say that
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:53:59.240]  opponents of this type of research and listen to this the euphemism that hey
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:02.920]  you probably know this we're talking to dr. Francis Boyle who
[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:09.320]  wrote treaties against bio weapon research in 1989 and 1972 so i'm sure
[02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:13.400]  you've heard them use this euphemism a gain of function
[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:17.160]  that's what they call it a gain of function when they weaponize
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:21.880]  something like the h5n1 avian bird the bird flu i mean
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:24.600]  they get much more deadly it's a gain of function
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:29.960]  this same dr. Mengele at u wisconsin kawakow who's uh on the press release
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:33.480]  also is involved in so-called gain of function
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.240]  yeah which means species jumping and indeed
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:43.320]  he tested out this h5n1 on ferrets to see if they could
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:48.440]  jump from one to the other because for these purposes of flu
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:51.880]  ferrets are akin to human beings so it's very clear
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:56.760]  what what he was doing there yes so what what do you make of this i mean we've
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:01.080]  have the uh it's not just the the bio weapons labs that are there but we've
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:05.480]  also created african just back in 2007 there's
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:08.920]  something that the american government never had before a
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:12.520]  tremendous number of military bases there of course we know that africa is
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:16.760]  very very rich in mental resources even though the countries are poor
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:20.840]  uh we had the belterberg group in 2013 and
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.000]  in uh the uk were saying that the big item on their list
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:29.160]  was africa i mean is this some kind of a neocolonialism that they're looking for
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:32.920]  in that area as we see them moving in there with research with military bases
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:37.080]  focusing now on africa yes of course
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.120]  the troops being sent over there have no training
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:46.520]  uh in uh medical treatment of anyone uh the 101st airborne
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:53.320]  uh is an elite uh invasion force and so uh is the case for the marines there
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:57.320]  are now 250 marines over there and they've already moved the
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:02.600]  headquarters the 101st airborne over there so i think what we are seeing is
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  african finally moving into africa as you know
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:11.080]  their headquarters had uh only been in germany because they couldn't find
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:15.720]  anywhere in africa although liberia had offered to serve as their
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:19.800]  headquarters so i think this is uh being used as uh as a
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:25.320]  pretext to uh for african to establish a base there in
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.080]  liberia and you know we could see the whole 101st airborne
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.120]  division in there soon enough i think that's why they uh
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.600]  move the uh the division headquarters there to liberia right and that's the
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:42.280]  point that you made why send in the 101st they're not known for
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:47.240]  being a medical relief or a construction uh division why why would
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:51.160]  they move them in the same way with the marines you know
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:54.920]  101st airborne of the marines are are not trained to
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:57:01.800]  uh heal people uh they are uh elite invaders yes they go in they invade
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:06.040]  land kill anyone that gets in the way and then they hold that land
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.000]  my dad was in the marine corps in world war two
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:14.840]  he invaded saipan tinien and okinawa and that's what the marines do they go in
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:20.360]  there they kill anyone in their way and then they continue marching on
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:26.120]  well give us some uh hopeful uh words here i mean you you wrote the uh
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:29.480]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:32.920]  it was passed unanimously by both houses of congress
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:36.920]  and yet we see still weapons development and
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:40.360]  bio weapons development very very active within the u.s government and of
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  course it's been there from the very creation of the cia anybody that
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:47.880]  doesn't know the history of that of operation paperclip you need to go
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:51.240]  back and take a look at uh a terrible mistake it's about the
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:56.040]  death of a cia scientist and that will give you a very good background of the
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:00.280]  kind of heinous war criminals that were brought in at the beginning of the cia
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:03.880]  as they transferred from the os s to the cia this is something that's been going
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:08.120]  on for a long time dr boil how do we get control of this
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:11.960]  well david i think first of all we have to get control of the
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:16.760]  immediate emergency uh facing the american people
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:20.360]  because even the people in dalas have admitted there will be more
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:24.120]  uh Ebola infections and i think they know what they're talking about
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:27.960]  yes the only way we're going to do this
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:34.040]  is to break through this wall of silence about what really happened here
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:37.400]  we're going to leave it there thank you so much dr boil for joining us join us
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:40.920]  tonight at seven for the nightly news tomorrow alex jones will be back in
[02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:56.840]  11 central visit gcnlive.com today
