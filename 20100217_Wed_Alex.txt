[00:00.000 --> 00:14.060]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.060 --> 00:36.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen news is
[00:36.400 --> 00:43.680]  breaking so fast on so many fronts this is a radio broadcast that you do not want
[00:43.680 --> 00:50.860]  to miss today I have been more excited coming into work for the radio broadcast and I have been
[00:50.860 --> 01:00.540]  in months since climategate it is Wednesday the 17th day of February 2010 and we're going
[01:00.540 --> 01:11.820]  to be live here today for the next four hours 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time there is so
[01:11.820 --> 01:22.140]  much going on number one breaking Sarah Palin 9-11 truther controversy makes hypocrite of
[01:22.140 --> 01:28.580]  Glenn Beck up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com why is this so important you've got
[01:28.580 --> 01:32.980]  the Democrat candidate going further saying no one knows it really happened it's a very dangerous
[01:32.980 --> 01:38.220]  subject we don't even know who killed Kennedy basically saying the government they ignore that
[01:38.220 --> 01:44.380]  you have Beck turning off Deborah Medina's audio so she couldn't even hear what he was saying and
[01:44.380 --> 01:50.540]  she said well people have a right to their opinions KLF radio Dallas morning news you name
[01:50.540 --> 01:59.900]  it our reporting what we told you last week that was an inside job a setup run by Carl Rove
[01:59.900 --> 02:06.460]  whose apprentice is George W. Bush and Rick Perry that's that's the guy calling the shots here
[02:06.460 --> 02:13.500]  because if Deborah Medina can get elected that will mean that all the other states on that are
[02:13.500 --> 02:18.220]  declaring 10th Amendment states rights will get other governors and legislators elected and the
[02:18.220 --> 02:23.820]  New World Order is stopped dead we have the people we have the Constitution on our side the
[02:23.820 --> 02:32.220]  Republican Party is trying to manage the constitutionalist rebellion against the globalist
[02:32.220 --> 02:39.580]  time magazine calls them the 10thers and we are the 10thers the 10th amendment is what we stand on
[02:39.580 --> 02:45.820]  that in the 1st and 2nd amendment as well the 4th the 5th they're all gold that's who we are we're
[02:45.820 --> 02:53.100]  the real Americans and so I told you two weeks ago on the day of the Super Bowl when they sent
[02:53.100 --> 03:02.780]  Palin and others to town to push for people to elect Rick Perry that the RNC was in here ensuring
[03:05.420 --> 03:08.540]  that Deborah Medina couldn't get elected because she was gaining five points a week
[03:11.180 --> 03:19.020]  I'm going to break it all down today but if we get this on local tv and radio and newspapers
[03:19.020 --> 03:25.100]  and point out that Palin said more and called for a new 9-11 investigation said more than even
[03:25.100 --> 03:32.140]  Deborah Medina did it will blow up in their face massively and she has a even better shot of winning
[03:32.140 --> 03:36.300]  in this primary or at least getting into the runoff and the Democrats are there's no way they're
[03:36.300 --> 03:43.420]  going to win whoever gets this Republican nomination whoever wins the primary for the
[03:43.420 --> 03:51.340]  Republican governorship in the primary early voting starts tomorrow election coming up early
[03:51.340 --> 03:56.860]  next month they will be the governor of Texas and if Deborah Medina can get elected that will
[03:56.860 --> 04:02.940]  send the message nationwide already her getting 25 points in the poll in a three-way race now
[04:02.940 --> 04:08.940]  overtaking Kay Bailey Bilderberg group Hutchinson and on the heels of Perry is already sending

[09:05.980 --> 09:13.820]  here by every mainline economic indicator but the media tells you the economy is great the people
[09:13.820 --> 09:20.780]  know they're being looted and so the tea parties form libertarians constitutionalist anti-war activists
[09:20.780 --> 09:28.860]  ron paul type individuals the republicans with the lowest approval rating in their history
[09:28.860 --> 09:35.900]  leave office obama comes in people find out he's a fraud overnight now people are protesting and
[09:35.900 --> 09:42.220]  demonstrating everywhere they're taking back their state houses incumbents whether the republican
[09:42.220 --> 09:48.140]  or democrat are being rounded and the republican party the neocon globalist the triple the size
[09:48.140 --> 09:52.460]  of government launched all these wars past the patriot act they handed the ball off to obama
[09:52.460 --> 09:58.140]  he's continuing their whole agenda they hope they can have these fake fights with obama
[09:58.140 --> 10:02.140]  to make you think there's a real choice between the two when they're part of the same power structure
[10:03.340 --> 10:07.740]  now i know that's elementary for our general listeners but i now want to break down
[10:07.740 --> 10:10.860]  the latest developments and what is happening here
[10:10.860 --> 10:20.380]  here they know you are awake they know at tea parties 13 months ago in texas and other parts
[10:20.380 --> 10:26.140]  of the country republican governors senators and congressmen and women were booed off the stage
[10:27.100 --> 10:35.020]  so the media ran a hoax msnbc and others saying that the tea parties were republican
[10:35.020 --> 10:42.860]  then the republicans launched their fake tea party nation and tried to absorb it but now
[10:43.500 --> 10:49.020]  inside the tea parties it's a great way to reach out to good conservative constitutional
[10:49.020 --> 10:54.380]  libertarian americans who didn't know the whole story we're waking them up instead of them co-opting
[10:54.380 --> 10:59.900]  us simultaneously last night i told you the battle lines are drawn that's why i've been
[10:59.900 --> 11:04.700]  identifying beckon others and o'reilly and hannity is key operatives and sir appellant
[11:08.620 --> 11:14.460]  they're here to sabotage the state's rights revolution that is constitutional under the
[11:14.460 --> 11:18.700]  declaration of independence constitution bill of rights ninth and tenth amendment
[11:18.700 --> 11:32.060]  they understand what is happening and so they're coming in in utah in texas in new york
[11:32.060 --> 11:39.340]  in florida in nevada in arizona in california in michigan in indiana every state and they
[11:39.340 --> 11:48.620]  are running tea party twisted clones neocons pro patriot act pro torture pro war pro big government
[11:48.620 --> 11:54.220]  people against all the real patriots against deborah medina against ron paul he's not even
[11:54.220 --> 12:02.060]  being challenged by the democrats the republican party is running three different fake tea partiers
[12:02.060 --> 12:10.460]  against ron paul and tv and radios giving him all this airtime in texas not gonna work though
[12:11.420 --> 12:17.980]  and it's the same thing with deborah medina now for those that don't know the history of this carl
[12:17.980 --> 12:26.700]  rove made the big time by handling george w bush the adult former son of the president of the
[12:26.700 --> 12:34.060]  president had no hopes for he also was grooming another male cheerleader all these guys whether
[12:34.060 --> 12:40.220]  it's trint lot bush perry their male cheerleaders and they like to hang out with the old men and
[12:40.220 --> 12:46.700]  it's just that's that's the the stable they get them from always ninnying prissy fancy dress twits
[12:48.380 --> 12:54.940]  carl rove a consummate hardcore criminal on record i mean it's now been admitted and come out in court
[12:54.940 --> 13:05.900]  that carl rove set up the alabama governor a few years ago totally lied used a con artist from inside
[13:05.900 --> 13:11.900]  the capital that they had already secretly begun to indict to go set the governor up send him to
[13:11.900 --> 13:18.300]  prison just so he'd lose the election i mean they'll send governors to prison to win elections
[13:18.300 --> 13:29.020]  these people are even nastier than carvel and he's bad i mean this is dirty politics this is big
[13:31.180 --> 13:40.300]  dirty trick machine central and so in 2000 when bush got elected president perry came into the
[13:40.300 --> 13:45.260]  governorship then he got elected he's been in nine and a half years the longest serving texas governor
[13:45.260 --> 13:49.900]  he's about to get four more that'll be 14 years total when he serves out this term and gets the
[13:49.900 --> 13:59.100]  next one if he does this is a anti gun pro open border guy that passed three new taxes including
[13:59.100 --> 14:04.780]  the franchise tax the business tax is really a state income tax and they admit that this is a guy
[14:04.780 --> 14:10.700]  who seized 8000 miles of roads to give it to the center of spain over 100 billion dollars in the
[14:10.700 --> 14:16.380]  next 10 years alone is the money they'll make they talk about 300 billion the next 20 he's
[14:16.380 --> 14:22.140]  seizing the power plants giving it this is in major newspapers giving it to indicted crooks
[14:22.140 --> 14:27.180]  in europe that are members of the bill de berg group he bragged and told the dallas morning news
[14:27.180 --> 14:30.860]  he was going to bill de berg which violates the logan act he wanted everybody to know he was an
[14:30.860 --> 14:40.140]  insider now these are dangerous dangerous dangerous people texas is the only viable
[14:40.140 --> 14:45.900]  state now in every major study they've done everything else is going down texas
[14:49.100 --> 14:53.500]  because we got looted in the 80s worse than anybody people pulled in their horns real estate
[14:53.500 --> 14:57.420]  didn't go up as much as other areas of the country people didn't go into as much debt it's still in
[14:57.420 --> 15:05.260]  deep trouble and this state has 25 million it's online in the next seven years it's a past california
[15:05.260 --> 15:09.980]  everybody's fleeing california and coming here fleeing new york and coming here fleeing big government
[15:09.980 --> 15:21.180]  coming here and they need texas to go down to be sucked under like greece and so many other
[15:21.180 --> 15:26.700]  countries and sub states like california was the seventh biggest economy in the world texas is
[15:26.700 --> 15:36.060]  about to surpass it they want to loot us and so they need a fancy talk in west texan least hidden
[15:36.060 --> 15:42.140]  from kenny bunkport main i'm not saying manors are bad it's just it's sick to watch texas to
[15:42.140 --> 15:46.700]  watch bush with that fake texas accent at least perry's the fifth generation i'm an eighth generation
[15:46.700 --> 15:59.180]  pal the whole point here is is that we have this scumbag on the ropes and so they pulled this inside
[15:59.180 --> 16:05.500]  job on medina even the dallas morning news admitted they've got perry people on the same ip's in their
[16:05.500 --> 16:10.460]  posting crazy stuff posing like they support medina they're doing it all over our message boards
[16:10.460 --> 16:17.020]  all over youtube it's disgusting it's carl rove dirty tricks they've got thousands of people
[16:17.020 --> 16:29.020]  online with this info and whisper campaigns right now this battle in texas is absolutely essential
[16:29.020 --> 16:33.500]  now i will say this
[16:35.980 --> 16:42.060]  when loser draw we've already won because people seen what a true constitutionalist tea party
[16:42.060 --> 16:46.780]  in the fed that's really what she is candidate can do that's already got people filing all over
[16:46.780 --> 16:56.540]  the country to run for state office multiple states today including utah voted to declare
[16:56.540 --> 17:02.300]  tenth amendment powers which they already had but to tell the feds it's over 30 what is it seven
[17:02.300 --> 17:08.060]  states now are moving to do it was like 34 a few weeks ago it's happening
[17:10.460 --> 17:16.940]  so it's the republican party job to suppress the populist conservative libertarian constitutionalist
[17:16.940 --> 17:23.740]  base to target anybody bona fide and real if you see republican mouthpieces like fox news
[17:23.740 --> 17:29.660]  or local neocon syndicated programming attacking someone you better believe they're good
[17:32.620 --> 17:36.540]  if they're a constitutionalist that's the seal of approval now
[17:39.180 --> 17:40.140]  this video
[17:43.020 --> 17:47.980]  in october of 2008 we are change ohio shot it they talked to sarah patel and they said

[26:58.860 --> 27:07.580]  i will say that this individual is a household name for anyone who watches the news or is
[27:07.580 --> 27:18.940]  involved in politics a household name contacted us to warn us after the debor medina situation
[27:18.940 --> 27:24.780]  saying they feared the worst i'll just say more than two weeks ago right around that time frame
[27:24.780 --> 27:28.700]  we know the date the place everything
[27:31.580 --> 27:38.060]  this individual was in the green room with rick perry and rick perry was upset
[27:39.180 --> 27:45.100]  and thought this person could be in their confidence and said the republican party
[27:45.100 --> 27:52.540]  is worried about what's happening in texas they understand all the heat being put on obama
[27:52.540 --> 27:57.900]  through the tea parties but they know that the tea parties are awake to the republican agenda
[27:57.900 --> 28:09.420]  and that it's all bought and paid for by the banks and that from washington the three main enemies
[28:10.380 --> 28:14.380]  and let me tell you this is pleasing at one level to know i've been effective but at another
[28:14.380 --> 28:19.100]  it's creepy because carl roe puts governors in prison for no reason i mean these people don't
[28:19.100 --> 28:23.820]  and ignores congressional subpoenas it's a felony i mean he just is a lawless criminal
[28:29.820 --> 28:33.420]  and he ran perry he ran bush he's running the whole show right now
[28:33.980 --> 28:38.460]  and it's in texas monthly last month's issue that rick perry's being positioned with sarah
[28:38.460 --> 28:45.340]  palin to run in 2012 they're gonna launch their campaign the next year and a half
[28:45.340 --> 28:53.660]  this is a woman who believes in global warming this is perry who passes all these new taxes you've

[29:10.620 --> 29:15.660]  kill obama i mean they're openly saying we are seditious enemies of america she's not even a
[29:15.660 --> 29:21.980]  9 11 truth or and they're saying she's in with van jones it must be stopped they are in red level

[33:18.060 --> 33:28.460]  their operations for the neocons they launched a attempt at a howard dean yell moment a non-event
[33:28.460 --> 33:35.980]  to make people think that oh well she's gaining momentum but she can't win now it's over for her
[33:35.980 --> 33:41.100]  it's like announcing mark twain had died 20 something years before he actually died rumors
[33:41.100 --> 33:46.300]  of her demise have been greatly exaggerated but still has an effect as a jedi mind trick
[33:46.300 --> 33:54.300]  on the weak minded so we simply take sarah palin video of her 16 months ago in ohio
[33:55.900 --> 34:00.220]  campaigning with big government anti-gun north america union loving
[34:02.540 --> 34:03.340]  john mccain
[34:03.340 --> 34:11.740]  and we show the clip of her saying yes i i want a new 911 investigation and it will
[34:11.740 --> 34:16.860]  explode in their face if you can get the media to cover it you go get the article breaking
[34:16.860 --> 34:22.140]  sarah palin 911 through their controversy makes hypocritical and back it breaks it all down
[34:22.140 --> 34:27.260]  in a short and sweet article with all the proof the media will definitely buy and if they bite
[34:27.260 --> 34:36.220]  and it gets picked up big this will give medina five points going in to the early voting around
[34:36.220 --> 34:40.940]  a third of texas early vote and then early next month the election she could win hands down and
[34:40.940 --> 34:49.660]  not even need to be in a runoff but at least we get her into the runoff and then time is on our side
[34:49.660 --> 34:56.540]  here's the problem i was already calling paul watson last night saying we need to do a report
[34:56.540 --> 35:04.140]  in the next few days on how the carl roe criminal machine is behind this he literally created perry
[35:04.140 --> 35:09.180]  and bush and he is involved now and and that more dirty tricks will be brought out on medina
[35:09.180 --> 35:14.140]  they'll put plant drugs on her they'll arrest her they'll do anything i mean you have any idea
[35:14.140 --> 35:23.180]  of the type of stuff these people do they are ruthless so it was chilling this morning i got
[35:23.180 --> 35:33.340]  up at four a.m. and went to work it was chilling to get a phone call from an incredibly high level
[35:33.340 --> 35:46.460]  public figure and i have talked to the public figure before they know me i i know them and i
[35:46.460 --> 35:52.140]  recognize their voice but i still didn't have the cell phone number they called me from i called
[35:52.140 --> 35:56.540]  someone i knew that knew them this morning and confirmed it was their cell phone there on my
[35:56.540 --> 36:11.980]  caller ID it it was them and they told me in the future they may be able to talk more about this
[36:13.500 --> 36:19.420]  again i'm leaving it vague because you have to protect sources just like people say we don't
[36:19.420 --> 36:23.980]  believe that my act and homeland security reports you got a real we don't believe state police in
[36:23.980 --> 36:28.460]  california and missouri gave you this we don't believe a federal marshal gave you the homeland
[36:28.460 --> 36:34.380]  security master document they were saying that for a week until the media finally investigated and
[36:35.260 --> 36:42.300]  the feds and the states admitted it they said tell us your source tell us oh yes i mean and i
[36:42.300 --> 36:46.220]  think the public's so gullible and some of the public bought it and said yeah tell us who gave
[36:46.220 --> 36:56.300]  it to you it's not real tell us no i'm not going to tell you
[37:01.340 --> 37:07.020]  just like when the fbi visited here because of an idiot on the message board threatening to kill a
[37:07.020 --> 37:11.820]  police officer by name and posting his address and in the subpoena i couldn't talk about it so i
[37:11.820 --> 37:17.420]  said the fbi was here they were asking about the obama deception i didn't even know what it was about
[37:17.420 --> 37:25.820]  it was just with subpoenas for records limited records but they kept asking about the obama
[37:25.820 --> 37:30.300]  deception so in early march i released the film four days early they show up here up before i'm
[37:30.300 --> 37:34.300]  about to launch it it was at all that's not real they didn't visit you then the associated press
[37:34.300 --> 37:45.500]  wired magazine reuters all about the case and the guy went to prison the point is this is directly
[37:45.500 --> 37:53.180]  from someone inside their camp glenbeck's got one thing right and all these tv cast he's doing
[37:53.180 --> 37:56.140]  where he says oh my gosh they've infiltrated us they're everywhere well you're right back
[37:56.780 --> 38:00.540]  people that actually love america and are against the patriot act in the new world order and all
[38:00.540 --> 38:05.340]  these wars and the fraud and the big government and they know that both parties are bought and
[38:05.340 --> 38:12.060]  paid for by foreign offshore banks you bet back we've got people everywhere because people are
[38:12.060 --> 38:15.740]  deciding do they want to join the new world order in the dark side now that the choice is clear
[38:15.740 --> 38:19.580]  or do they want to stand up for the republic do they want to be with george washington
[38:21.340 --> 38:25.420]  and andrew jackson in history or do they want to be with a person like you
[38:25.420 --> 38:34.700]  you and carl rove with a jowl so big it looks like it's full of 300 gallons of pus
[38:43.020 --> 38:47.740]  but this story is so important on so many facets the story i'm about to cover because
[38:47.740 --> 38:58.140]  we know we're hurting them all their hoaxes their government health care republican lobbyists are
[38:58.140 --> 39:03.100]  involved in that as well the global greenhouse gas taxes top republicans newt genrich
[39:05.340 --> 39:08.300]  sarah palin's darling john mccain they're all behind it
[39:10.380 --> 39:14.300]  they were endorsing it till climate gate blew up they were saying it's a foregone conclusion pat
[39:14.300 --> 39:19.500]  robertson says obama's of god socialism is good it is the will of the lord that he will
[39:20.220 --> 39:26.780]  get everything done he wants these are operatives now that you've turned against them and didn't
[39:26.780 --> 39:34.220]  buy their jedi mind trick of resistance is futile their borg trick their mind game they're going oh
[39:34.220 --> 39:38.860]  yes we're against obama now except when he wants a bailout we're for it or wants to reauthorize the
[39:38.860 --> 39:44.940]  patriot act we're for it or but we love the troops so much we talk about how we love the troops all
[39:44.940 --> 39:49.100]  day but we won't do shows on du killing them or the nerve gas they've been exposed to and how
[39:49.100 --> 39:52.780]  they're dying how they're thrown out on the street no we just talk about how we love the troops all
[39:52.780 --> 40:01.260]  day and this shows and confirms just how scared they are just how vulnerable they are you see
[40:01.980 --> 40:07.820]  as long as they can keep you passive and feeling weak and broken and dejected and
[40:07.820 --> 40:15.900]  buffalode and cowed as long as you have a spirit of capitulation and weakness they win
[40:17.740 --> 40:22.140]  but as their global carbon tax fails their swine flu hoax fails their government takeover
[40:22.140 --> 40:28.060]  of health care fails is everything they're pushing fails they're desperate to get control of the
[40:28.060 --> 40:35.740]  awakening populist constitutional movement it's the 1776 movement it's the answer to 1984
[40:35.740 --> 40:43.900]  is 1776 coffee party movement the great awakening and they tried to label it and make it republican
[40:43.900 --> 40:52.700]  knowing republicanism is discredited that didn't work and this information directly out of the
[40:52.700 --> 41:02.780]  mouth of rick perry in a closed door meeting with only a couple of insiders he was freaked out
[41:02.780 --> 41:09.980]  he was sweating bullets he is upset he is worried because if the polls show she's 25 k bailey's 26
[41:09.980 --> 41:20.860]  and perry's 32 and she's gaining five points a week they had to do this they didn't want to
[41:20.860 --> 41:26.460]  give her the attention this was a dangerous gamble to give her even more attention to elevate her more
[41:26.460 --> 41:33.260]  with this attempted howard dean moment but they went ahead and rolled the dice
[41:34.300 --> 41:39.980]  not knowing that there was always an ace in the hole there's always something that they're not aware
[41:39.980 --> 41:47.660]  of and that's palan repeatedly calling for a new 9 11 investigation what hypocrites what
[41:47.660 --> 41:52.300]  jokes it's up to you though folks i may have a few million listeners and four million people
[41:52.300 --> 41:57.340]  that visit the sites every week but that isn't enough you've got to move the ball the power of
[41:57.340 --> 42:03.580]  this broadcast the power of info wars dot com the power of prison planet dot com the power of my films
[42:04.300 --> 42:11.260]  is you the patriot you who have the blood and the spirit of the founding fathers flowing through
[42:11.260 --> 42:22.620]  your veins you who love liberty you who refuse the chains of tyranny you are what we have you're
[42:22.620 --> 42:29.820]  all we've gotten that's a whole lot and sure they could fool us in the past but people are
[42:29.820 --> 42:39.100]  getting wise to it now it doesn't work anymore and the fact that rick perry was shaking saying quote
[42:39.100 --> 42:48.940]  quote the number one enemies of the republican establishment are deborah medina because of
[42:48.940 --> 42:55.180]  what she symbolizes a revolt at the state level alex jones because i represent the true spirit
[42:55.180 --> 43:04.140]  of 1776 in the alternative media and we're number one and growing exponentially what a responsibility
[43:04.140 --> 43:14.780]  god thank you for the responsibility but oh it's chilling and ron paul because he represents the
[43:14.780 --> 43:19.660]  elder statement statesman who's been right about everything on the national international stage
[43:19.660 --> 43:25.260]  they tried to shoot him down it didn't work that tried to shoot him down hannity did all the other
[43:25.260 --> 43:32.220]  tv networks did off those same talking points two years ago two and a half years ago 2007 into 2009
[43:32.220 --> 43:39.660]  so now they embracing when they failed but only embraced him to try to spin it because they found
[43:39.660 --> 43:43.420]  that when they attacked him it blew up bigger in their face on the same things happening with me
[43:43.420 --> 43:55.580]  and deborah medina so here is the key article they're hurting folks it's like the champ the pretty boy
[43:55.580 --> 44:02.540]  big government nap the superhighway new world order champ is in the corner and he's telling
[44:03.180 --> 44:08.460]  his ring manager he's telling his trainer oh man he's hurting me they're hurting me bad she's hurting
[44:08.460 --> 44:14.860]  me i i gotta go back out a couple more rounds it's bad it's bad because if she's 25 points in the
[44:14.860 --> 44:20.620]  polls and those are guaranteed cooked polls she's probably beating them in the real internal polls
[44:20.620 --> 44:25.500]  they're doing so now their electronic machines are going to come in but they don't have them
[44:25.500 --> 44:32.780]  everywhere they don't have them nationwide and they are in trouble insider republican dirty
[44:32.780 --> 44:40.060]  tricks machine targeting grassroots constitutionalist exclusive establishment neocons have resolved
[44:40.060 --> 44:46.140]  to attack deborah medina alex jones and ron paul because they are terrified of losing control
[44:46.140 --> 44:55.580]  of the tea party movement and i'm not afraid of carl rove i'm not saying bring it on i don't
[44:55.580 --> 45:00.060]  want you to send hit men or plant drugs or do whatever but just do whatever you got to do
[45:01.020 --> 45:07.100]  okay i know i'm standing with god and goodness and my ancestors and people of honor and people
[45:07.100 --> 45:12.700]  that are decent and love the truth and you stand over there with your devilish system i'm not afraid

[45:22.460 --> 45:23.740]  i know it's in god's hands
[45:26.860 --> 45:31.260]  exclusive establishment neocons have resolved to attack deborah medina alex jones ron paul
[45:31.260 --> 45:36.300]  because they are terrified of losing control of the tea party movement a prominent insider has
[45:36.300 --> 45:41.740]  told info wars that texas governor rick perry and other establishment neocons have decided to
[45:41.740 --> 45:48.380]  deliberately target grassroots constitutionalist with dirty tricks campaigns in an effort to derail
[45:48.380 --> 45:52.220]  and hijack the growing liberty movement whose influence is threatening to blow the texas
[45:52.220 --> 45:59.980]  gubernatorial race wide open our office was contacted by a national personality a household name
[45:59.980 --> 46:04.700]  who told us that they were in a green room at a national public event a few weeks ago with rick
[46:04.700 --> 46:10.220]  perry the individual was shocked when perry said directly that there were three people who got under
[46:10.220 --> 46:18.460]  his skin and had to be dealt with immediately one deborah medina two alex jones and three ron paul
[46:21.180 --> 46:28.300]  perry told i'm so proud that all three of those are texas send in the cavalry folks perry told
[46:28.300 --> 46:33.180]  the individual that these three people had to be targeted and stopped in order for the republican
[46:33.180 --> 46:37.340]  establishment to shut down any real voices of opposition that were threatening to have an
[46:37.340 --> 46:41.660]  influence on the tea party movement which has been blatantly hijacked by the neocons in recent
[46:41.660 --> 46:50.540]  months and beck goes on and i'm told handy but i haven't seen it yet but i've seen beck o'reilly
[46:50.540 --> 46:56.940]  and watson's working another article on this right now limited resources we have great people here
[46:56.940 --> 47:04.860]  i praise them they couldn't do it without them and christ matthew's the same talking points
[47:04.860 --> 47:09.660]  she's like the same talking points going after ron paul the establishment republicans and democrats
[47:09.660 --> 47:13.260]  may fight over the power sometimes but they always circle the wagons against the people
[47:17.980 --> 47:23.820]  and they all went on last night and said the tea party movements being hijacked by 9 11 truthers
[47:23.820 --> 47:27.980]  they're dangerous they may hurt the president with no evidence of that and they went further
[47:27.980 --> 47:34.540]  national polls are between 36 and 84 depending on the poll all of them supposedly scientific
[47:35.580 --> 47:43.900]  some say 36 some say 84 some 83 some 56 some 64 you've all seen the polls are in my films
[47:45.980 --> 47:55.260]  the zogby mason dixon scripts howard news service gallup angus and read was the 84 angus and read
[47:55.260 --> 48:01.820]  new york times that was four years ago don't believe the official story on a new investigation
[48:02.940 --> 48:06.460]  about the same number of the national polls don't believe the official story on kennedy
[48:06.460 --> 48:11.980]  believe the government did it about 84 of people are away that's the big illusion so they got to
[48:11.980 --> 48:17.980]  get up there on tv every day and say everybody knows these people are cooks and glenn beck said
[48:17.980 --> 48:24.060]  that the 9 11 truthers on the left only make up 5 of the population and then on the right they're
[48:24.060 --> 48:33.100]  5 for a grand total of 10 the lowest polls are 36% and then he said only 5% he said total 10%
[48:33.100 --> 48:39.420]  nationwide half of them birthers half of them truthers when 9 11 truth itself is at least
[48:39.420 --> 48:43.900]  36% and in most polls more than half of republicans question his birth certificate is of all the
[48:43.900 --> 48:50.220]  cover up so the real number is more than half of the american people or either 9 11 truthers
[48:50.220 --> 48:57.420]  or birthers that's very conservative that's a dead reckoning paired down lowest number i could
[48:58.140 --> 49:05.660]  come up with may have polls on all this no shocker 67% of rewriters republicans question
[49:05.660 --> 49:11.820]  obama's birth certificate you've seen those polls you've seen whole crowd shout down republicans
[49:11.820 --> 49:19.660]  and shout down mccain when he says oh there's no question that gets up and says no only 5% of
[49:19.660 --> 49:25.900]  the population are birthers and only 5% are truthers and this 10% are enemies of america
[49:25.900 --> 49:29.660]  see that's psi ops he plays birthers and truthers off against each other
[49:32.860 --> 49:36.460]  tonight minute clip it's it's it's in the article about pale and being a 9 11 truther
[49:37.980 --> 49:40.620]  we'll play in the last hour if we have time lord montan's coming up and

[50:06.460 --> 50:12.620]  and malcon and others and people now know about gin rich being a globalist and pro global warming
[50:12.620 --> 50:17.900]  and all the anti-gun the rest of it so they've moved on to a new crop and they'll be discredited
[50:17.900 --> 50:22.620]  and they'll bring a new group in like shark teeth see i never go anywhere i just get more popular
[50:22.620 --> 50:28.860]  because everything i say is evergreen it's the truth it gets stronger they always have to replace
[50:28.860 --> 50:32.540]  their people when they get worn down and discredited with new personalities to fool people
[50:33.580 --> 50:39.260]  so rick perry's scared to death the republican party is scared to death of who ron paul alex

[54:30.060 --> 54:38.700]  national publications texas monthly hitting new stands today with a piece that i've seen a lot of
[54:38.700 --> 54:43.580]  and i would characterize it as a piece that makes me look like an extremist well i am extreme for
[54:43.580 --> 54:48.380]  liberty we're fighting extreme tyranny so i guess compared to all the general madness i am extreme
[54:49.260 --> 54:52.860]  if you were in the astech kingdom a thousand years ago and said child sacrifice was bad you'd
[54:52.860 --> 54:57.420]  be extreme if you were in hitlers germany 70 years ago you'd be seen as extreme
[55:02.300 --> 55:06.540]  but as cast sunsteen said they will also use their operatives who pose as the alternative
[55:07.260 --> 55:11.260]  just like they've caught perry's people that alice morning news reported posting ridiculous and
[55:11.260 --> 55:16.140]  racist and other comments posing as medina supporters i told you that howl turner was a
[55:16.140 --> 55:20.620]  government operative it turned out he was the highest level fbi agent in federal and state

[55:53.900 --> 55:59.500]  this is guaranteed carl rove in the pentagon and we have it directly out of perry's mouth
[56:01.260 --> 56:09.580]  that they are scared they are concerned republican dirty tricks machine targeting grassroots
[56:09.580 --> 56:15.020]  constitutionalist establishment neo cons have resolved to attack ever medina alex jones ron paul
[56:15.020 --> 56:19.580]  because they are terrified of losing control of the tea party movement our office was contacted
[56:19.580 --> 56:23.980]  by national personality a household name who told us that they were in a green room at a national
[56:23.980 --> 56:28.860]  public event a few weeks ago with rick perry the individual was shocked when perry said directly
[56:28.860 --> 56:33.420]  without being asked that there were three people who got under his skin that's a quote a new had to
[56:33.420 --> 56:38.780]  be dealt with immediately one never medina to alex jones three ron paul perry told the individual
[56:38.780 --> 56:44.140]  that these three people had to be targeted and stopped in order for the republican establishment
[56:44.140 --> 56:47.980]  to shut down any real voices opposition that were threatening to have an influence on the tea party
[56:47.980 --> 56:52.140]  movement which has been blatantly hijacked by the neo cons in recent months perry made it clear that
[56:52.140 --> 56:56.540]  these individuals and their supporters were the number one target of the neo con hierarchy because
[56:56.540 --> 57:00.540]  the grassroots was threatening to regain control of the tea party movement that was first created
[57:00.540 --> 57:06.780]  by ron paul supporters in 2007 but has since been hijacked by the republicans the insider expressed
[57:06.780 --> 57:11.580]  that a shock that perry would be so open with his comments suspecting that perry must have
[57:11.580 --> 57:18.620]  have considered the individual to be a fellow neo con the insider's deep concern about what was said
[57:18.620 --> 57:23.580]  prompted him to contact our office perry made the comments just a couple of weeks before
[57:23.580 --> 57:26.940]  gubernatorial challenger deba madina the only true constitutionalist running for the governorship of
[57:26.940 --> 57:32.780]  texas was set up by fox news glenn beck after the dubious talk show host smeared madina and
[57:32.780 --> 57:36.940]  generated a fake controversy merely for saying that people should be free to question the official
[57:36.940 --> 57:41.420]  911 story of you shared with a vast majority of americans and six of the 10 911 commission members
[57:42.140 --> 57:46.540]  perry who was subsequently celebrated by beck is the only remaining credible candidate after the
[57:46.540 --> 57:51.500]  smear attack on madina must have been on an ploy within an hour of her appearance on the glenn
[57:51.500 --> 57:55.500]  beck radio show texas residents told the austin american statesman that they had received robo
[57:55.500 --> 58:01.500]  calls on behalf of perry campaign and hutchinson against madina as an unstable 911 truther echoing
[58:01.500 --> 58:07.740]  becks manufactured talking points just an hour earlier there can no longer be any doubt that the
[58:07.740 --> 58:12.060]  rnc establishment is running a targeted smear campaign against real grassroots conservatives
[58:12.060 --> 58:16.140]  and libertarians because they are terrified that such individuals will be able to steer the tea party
[58:16.140 --> 58:20.940]  booba in a genuine national revolt against big government thereby massively diminishing the
[58:20.940 --> 58:27.580]  power of the establishment republicans i've got lord mongton coming up we're gonna cover this

[1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:18.540]  more than 30 climate gait level scandals that have come out each overshadowing the next or the last
[1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:23.580]  we're also going to cover their counter strike plans the schwarzenegger another set of copenhagen

[1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:33.100]  2.6 billion in the next three years in taxes on energy alone according to austin energy in the mayor

[1:01:56.140 --> 1:02:03.740]  lord christopher montan uh to chronicle and and break down as no one else can the leading expert
[1:02:03.740 --> 1:02:10.700]  in my educated opinion on the full scope of this attempted revolution to bring society under neo
[1:02:10.700 --> 1:02:15.980]  feudalistic serfdom sir thank you for joining us well alex what a wonderful introduction i just
[1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:22.060]  can't wait to hear what i'm going to say we've got about two and a half minutes before we go to
[1:02:22.060 --> 1:02:26.540]  break just give us a brief overview of what you're going to be covering well i think the first thing
[1:02:26.540 --> 1:02:32.300]  we've got to do is to say that the intergovernmental panel on climate change that the un climate panel
[1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:39.100]  which produced four major reports on the climate thing we're all doomed is now effectively dead
[1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:45.980]  there have been so many revelations over recent weeks of its failure to do the science properly
[1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:53.580]  of it deliberately including false and alarming data uh with the intention as a declared intention
[1:02:53.580 --> 1:03:00.540]  of influencing government it's all over for the ipcc nobody is going to take it seriously
[1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:04.940]  ever again i think that's the main point but then you're quite right as you said in your
[1:03:04.940 --> 1:03:10.460]  introduction the problem we've now got is that even though national government are now beginning
[1:03:10.460 --> 1:03:18.060]  to realize they can't go on getting away with this because it isn't a vote winner local administration
[1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:25.340]  still uh bullied by the hugely well funded environmental lobby groups like greenpeace
[1:03:25.340 --> 1:03:30.060]  which as far as i know has a fleet of ships larger than the british navy goodness knows
[1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:34.940]  where it gets the money from to run them but i thought one of their huge ships parked up in
[1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:41.740]  copenhagen with propaganda slogan painted all over it um these organizations are very active at
[1:03:41.740 --> 1:03:46.940]  local and state level and what we're going to need to do eventually is at government level
[1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:54.700]  simply ban any spending on global warming related matters because this care is now officially dead
[1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:02.380]  i want you again today to address the criminal activities criminal investigations
[1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:08.540]  uh your continued challenge for al gore to debate you i have it out of the dallas morning news today
[1:04:08.540 --> 1:04:14.780]  the state of texas is moving to block austin and other cities that have literally been paid off
[1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:22.540]  by these organizations to seize the infrastructure and levy taxes i mean the 2.6 billion
[1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:28.060]  and then that's austin energy is bigger per year over the three years in the entire
[1:04:28.060 --> 1:04:34.700]  year current taxing system i mean talk about a power grab that's right it is outrageous what's
[1:04:34.700 --> 1:04:41.980]  going on and the only way to do that is to stop it from the top down uh so that eventually everybody
[1:04:41.980 --> 1:04:49.020]  realizes that this money making game at the expense chiefly of the working taxpayer it's your blue

[1:08:57.180 --> 1:09:03.420]  of your trip in australia i every day tuned in to video clips of you on radio and tv in debates
[1:09:03.980 --> 1:09:12.380]  packed houses everywhere hands down trouncing uh the opposition and you could see in their eyes
[1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:21.900]  no longer that arrogant false aplomb that hootspot now they look like beaten men they are in galloping
[1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:27.660]  retreat it was very interesting i mean i arrived in australia nobody there had heard of me but there
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:32.460]  was a really good pr guy who came to see me the day i landed he said right we've laid on a program
[1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:38.780]  for you to start going into studios the moment that began then i was rushing from studio to studio
[1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:43.340]  got massive coverage on all the major channels all the major newspapers even the left-wing
[1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:49.820]  ones couldn't resist having a go at me as it were then on our first speaker meeting which was in the
[1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:56.700]  largest ballroom in sydney uh which which speaks a thousand people we were absolutely full people
[1:09:56.700 --> 1:10:03.340]  have began queuing at ten in the morning for a meeting that began at five thirty in the afternoon
[1:10:03.340 --> 1:10:08.380]  and they were queuing down three floors of the hotel right around the grand staircase and out
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:13.980]  into the street outside we had to turn several hundred people away unfortunately um absolutely
[1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:20.220]  extraordinary interest and this happened all over australia we went to the working class district of
[1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:26.300]  new castles in the hunter valley which is the coal mining area and we had a small room booked in the
[1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:31.900]  town hall we had to abandon that and go into the main town hall building itself which seats a thousand
[1:10:31.900 --> 1:10:35.900]  then we had to open the gallery which seats another few hundreds and even then we had to
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:41.420]  turn people away same thing happened in brisbane we had a debate there which i think the other
[1:10:41.420 --> 1:10:46.460]  side reckon we won it by a country mile uh then we had a meeting at the irish club there they had
[1:10:46.460 --> 1:10:52.140]  never seen so many people in that club as they saw that day seven hundred of them jammed into the room
[1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:57.100]  then we went up to new sir where the deputy leader of the opposition in parliament turned
[1:10:57.100 --> 1:11:02.540]  up to hear me and he ended up outside not being able to get in along with 250 people because
[1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:07.260]  that too was packed out so i had an impromptu meeting in the car park to cope with them
[1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:13.260]  then we went down to melbourne same thing absolutely packed out a ballroom seating a thousand
[1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:19.340]  absolutely full then we went up to canberra and the press club could only seat 300 and we turned
[1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:24.700]  at least as many as that away then we went down to adelaide same thing happened there we had an
[1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:30.780]  overflow room that was full of well we had to go speak in both rooms then we went up to um
[1:11:30.780 --> 1:11:36.460]  per where they had to lay on that only an overflow room but an overflow meeting the following day
[1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:41.980]  because two thousand people wanted to hear me speak and as we went around australia the crowds
[1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:47.580]  got bigger and also got younger more and more younger people beginning to come to hear the truth
[1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:52.780]  about the climate so a quite extraordinary overwhelming response as a result of which i got
[1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:58.940]  to meet the leader of the opposition tony abbott who if you remember uh one office as leader of the
[1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:04.780]  opposition over malcolm turnbull his rival who had previously supported australia's attempt
[1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:11.180]  to have a carbon trading sort of cap and tax scheme like that which the democrat in america want
[1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:17.580]  and um turnbull was defeated by his own party and tony abbott who is skeptical about climate chain
[1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:24.060]  has taken over the first politician to win office because he doesn't believe this not so it was a
[1:12:24.060 --> 1:12:32.060]  very good time we had in australia um very very receptive audiences 500 mentions of the tour in
[1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:38.060]  the media both print and electronic uh and uh according to the people who invited me there
[1:12:38.060 --> 1:12:42.700]  two retired engineers from from nusa who organized the whole thing and paid for it out of their own
[1:12:42.700 --> 1:12:48.220]  pockets fortunately the we made the money backed by the huge crowd that turned up all paying their
[1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:54.780]  20 to hear me talk but it was an astonishing event they said that this has actually changed
[1:12:54.780 --> 1:13:01.580]  the opinion in australia now why has it done that not because i'm a brilliant speaker but because
[1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:08.460]  people were absolutely desperate to hear the other side of the story which they couldn't get in the
[1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:13.980]  mainstream news media because the mainstream news media won't even give you the fact they won't even
[1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:21.180]  tell you that global warming over the last 15 years hasn't been happening in any statistically
[1:13:21.180 --> 1:13:27.820]  significant sense that has now at last been publicly admitted by phil jones who's the
[1:13:28.380 --> 1:13:33.420]  head of the now been posed and disgraced head of the climate research unit at the university of
[1:13:33.420 --> 1:13:39.980]  east anglia he's been chucked out because he was caught trying to suppress and tamper with and hide
[1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:46.460]  and even destroy scientific data and the the climate date emails that got released by a whistleblower
[1:13:46.460 --> 1:13:51.900]  that had been all around the web uh did for him but he was then interviewed by a sympathetic bbc
[1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:57.500]  interviewer who nevertheless got in touch with me first and said what questions should i ask and i
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:01.980]  feel one thing you could ask is asking whether there has been any statistically significant
[1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:08.060]  global warming for the last 15 years and phil jones albeit through british team had to admit what he
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:14.940]  had never before ever publicly said that yes that i've been right all along there hasn't been any
[1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:23.100]  statistically global warming for 15 long years a decade and a half i mean that is the most extraordinary
[1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:29.020]  admission by somebody who had been pushing out the official line of the rest of his recent decade
[1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:34.940]  has been the warmest on the record yes it has but we still haven't had any significant warming for
[1:14:34.940 --> 1:14:41.260]  15 years more modern now they're beginning to have to tell us the truth and the media are beginning
[1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:47.180]  to have to print the truth having concealed it from their own readers for a long time and i think
[1:14:47.180 --> 1:14:52.540]  that's the value of the australian tour but it made the australian media and many others around the
[1:14:52.540 --> 1:15:00.220]  world realize that by deliberately suppressing the fact that don't happen to fit their chosen story
[1:15:00.220 --> 1:15:05.180]  line about the alarming dreadful supposed global warming problem they are not doing their readers
[1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:09.580]  any favor they've now got to start at least giving the fact whatever the opinions they may like to
[1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:16.620]  have is another matter but they must now do their job and give us the proper unbiased scientific
[1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:21.580]  facts because if they don't then as i said many times because everywhere i went i was asked this
[1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:26.700]  question what about the mainstream media i said it's quite simple if they go on refusing to give
[1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:33.660]  you the fact and you have to turn to alex jones and the the electronic um you know the radio
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:38.940]  shock jock and the internet to get your news because the mainstream television and newspapers
[1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:43.740]  won't give you the fact then the mainstream television and newspapers will lose audiences
[1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:50.860]  and they will go bust one by one and deserve it and they are going bust i was cheered to the echo
[1:15:50.860 --> 1:15:58.220]  and they are going bust i mean the the points you make raised so many other issues but the
[1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:03.100]  bottom line is you are a brilliant speaker because you've done the research you've been right for 20
[1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:11.100]  years you recognize more than 20 years ago the danger of this criminal enterprise this criminal
[1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:16.300]  cult you know we have the head climatologist for nasa saying destroy industrialized society we have
[1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:22.780]  morris strong saying destroy industrialized society and just like in russia or in nazi germany
[1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:29.340]  when you suppress the truth it explodes with even more force but expanding on that
[1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:38.140]  we see the global battle against this fraud uh every time we do stand up and take action we
[1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:46.540]  have success and and and nothing succeeds like success and so now that we have lost uh this
[1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:53.900]  feeling of helplessness and we now have the true spirit of empowerment the route is uh
[1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:59.740]  intensifying and they've recognized that their bald face denying and stonewalling and ignoring
[1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:04.780]  climate gait for two weeks entirely and newsweek saying it's a conspiracy theory climate gait
[1:17:04.780 --> 1:17:12.140]  didn't even happen this is only further destroying them lord montan as you know so how do you see
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:18.700]  this shaking out now how do you see them counter striking they haven't spent as you know hundreds
[1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:25.820]  of billions of dollars financing this takeover to go quietly in to the night no i think that's
[1:17:25.820 --> 1:17:30.940]  very well put uh they're they're going to want to make sure that having invested all this time
[1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:35.180]  an effort and of course it's not their money they've spent it your money they've spent um it's
[1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:40.380]  the taxpayer's money they've spent on on furthering this scare of course they're going to want to get
[1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:46.380]  their dividend in in the way of closing down the western economies but i don't think that's now
[1:17:46.380 --> 1:17:51.980]  going to happen i think that uh financial recession hasn't helped them it began really
[1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:56.540]  the rot when the financial recession set in and people began thinking you know do we really
[1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:01.980]  believe this climate stuff but it's going to be very expensive if we do um and and then came
[1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:08.940]  climate gait then came the cold norman hemisphere winter in fact interestingly uh the um january
[1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:16.220]  temperatures worldwide were the highest since satellite records began 32 years ago because
[1:18:16.220 --> 1:18:20.380]  there's an El Nino going on at their sea temperatures are very much higher than they would normally be
[1:18:20.940 --> 1:18:25.820]  um and interestingly we think that that may be caused by undersea volcanic activity in the
[1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:32.220]  in the eastern pacific nothing whatever to do with global warming caused by us um so gradually all
[1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:38.460]  these facts about how the climate really works are beginning to come out and and the media can no
[1:18:38.460 --> 1:18:44.620]  longer suppress them and so what i think the the um the usual suspects are going to do now
[1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:51.740]  is they're going to realize that trying to maintain these endless scare stories about the climate
[1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:57.500]  when the climate simply isn't warming as they had predicted that it would is not going to work
[1:18:58.060 --> 1:19:04.540]  so what they're going to do instead i think is to uh go quiet for a bit and they'll be
[1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:11.340]  aware at local level rather than at national level because at national level we are watching
[1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:16.220]  and we will stop them and you've got wonderful organizations like fox news now how has that
[1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:21.340]  done so well it's done well because it does give you on this and on so many other subjects
[1:19:21.340 --> 1:19:27.580]  the fact that the mainstream news media otherwise wouldn't give because they've become so politicized
[1:19:27.580 --> 1:19:33.420]  they're all effectively Marxist or totalitarian anyway in the way they love the thing and fox
[1:19:33.420 --> 1:19:39.100]  news is simply saying well we will get the fact and so half or just about half now of the entire
[1:19:39.100 --> 1:19:46.060]  television news audience what is fox news because otherwise it won't get the fact and so and and
[1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:52.060]  and lord montan they've just been reading for instance a uh a remarkably stupid piece in the
[1:19:52.060 --> 1:19:59.500]  salt lake tribute which is an extreme left-wing paper which absolutely hates the conservative
[1:19:59.500 --> 1:20:04.620]  republican administration there which has as you may know past the resolution saying global warming
[1:20:04.620 --> 1:20:10.220]  is nonsense i'm not going to spend any more money on it um that's the the utah state legislature
[1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:15.260]  has has been the first to break ranks and say we're not having any more of this not and the
[1:20:15.260 --> 1:20:22.460]  local newspaper is absolutely furious and so it rang up a scientist and got a quote every single
[1:20:22.460 --> 1:20:27.420]  point of which was a lie so i wrote to the reporter concerned and said what on earth do you think
[1:20:27.420 --> 1:20:33.420]  you're doing why don't you ask this this this so-called scientist whether he has qualifications
[1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:41.660]  in climatology paleo climatology physics chemistry mathematics and various other subjects
[1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:45.820]  on which he was claiming to be an authority because the statement he made every single one of which
[1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:51.500]  was wrong it turned out he wasn't any kind of climate scientist at all and this is the trouble
[1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:56.540]  they just go to the people they know will sing the song they want to hear rather than going to the
[1:20:56.540 --> 1:21:03.340]  people who actually know what the truth is and these local news media and these local um administration
[1:21:03.340 --> 1:21:07.420]  are definitely a pain and they're going to have to be dealt with and dealt with very firmly
[1:21:07.420 --> 1:21:12.540]  the way we've done this in the past in the united kingdom where you get a tough-minded
[1:21:12.540 --> 1:21:18.140]  conservatively minded government in office is actually to circumscribe their powers so that
[1:21:18.140 --> 1:21:23.500]  they are forbidden to spend money on things like global ones actually just tell them that is out
[1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:29.260]  with their powers to do that and if you do that it i know it's harder in the state to do that than it
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:34.780]  is in the uk but you can nevertheless constrain quite a bit what they spend the money on and the
[1:21:34.780 --> 1:21:41.820]  other thing is that now that the people are beginning to realize what rubbish this all is and how much
[1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:46.620]  it's going to cost them and in particular that it's going to cost working people because they
[1:21:46.620 --> 1:21:52.380]  spend a bigger proportion of electricity and gasoline than everybody else they are the ones
[1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:58.380]  that are going to get hurt by this it doesn't matter what hemi waxman or ed market say about how
[1:21:58.380 --> 1:22:02.700]  they're going to compensate them the fact is if they compensate them then their bill won't make
[1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:07.020]  any difference to carbon emissions if they don't compensate them then it's their own voters that
[1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:12.380]  are going to lose either way an ets is just madness any kind of emissions trading scheme
[1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:17.580]  camp and trade call it what you like is now do and i think there's no way they'll get that through
[1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:22.860]  the senate and i don't think the likes of schwarz and egger and all those characters in california
[1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:27.740]  are going to get away with doing what they're doing which say we're going to impose uh at state
[1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:34.300]  level taxes that are no longer going to be imposed at federal level if they try that then people will
[1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:39.820]  leave and already there's a kind of wagon train no longer heading west heading east back out of
[1:22:39.820 --> 1:22:47.740]  california with businesses getting out of california because california hates business and in the end
[1:22:47.740 --> 1:22:52.300]  the governor is going to run out of money because he'd have driven all the businesses away that used
[1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:57.740]  to pay the taxes that kept him in clover now lord montan will learn in the end that they can't get away
[1:22:57.740 --> 1:23:03.340]  with this that the people will vote with their feet and get out of local administration or state
[1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:09.500]  administration that try to impose extra global warming taxes now that we know that global warming
[1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:17.900]  at henry ford bite of put it is bunk yes and continuing along that line and understanding
[1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:23.820]  that they're going to come back at us uh the state of texas has announced they are moving
[1:23:23.820 --> 1:23:29.500]  to pass laws against cities because you can't have cities operating outside state laws the
[1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:37.420]  cities and counties are are chartered uh by the state and under its constitution and we have
[1:23:37.420 --> 1:23:43.420]  everybody literally millions moving every few years out of california mainly to texas that's
[1:23:43.420 --> 1:23:50.220]  why the un lobbyist are here in austin this is the big battleground they're trying to hurry and
[1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:54.540]  pass it this month or next month they were going to pass it in about six months they're in a hurry
[1:23:55.260 --> 1:24:01.740]  and i agree with you they're now saying okay you win it's not real go back to sleep you won
[1:24:01.740 --> 1:24:06.460]  because they know now that when they give us a fight back that we know we're winning so that
[1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:11.660]  only energizes the people to take action so they're going to play possum and they're going to call it
[1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:17.100]  green jobs now they've always done that to a certain extent but they now have almost a hundred
[1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:22.380]  percent shifted out of saying global warming we've got to save you sky is falling to the economy
[1:24:22.940 --> 1:24:30.060]  is dead only a green job will save you but in australia in canada in spain as you know
[1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:35.340]  police are i'd like you to break it down and give people the actual numbers green jobs cost on
[1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:40.140]  average two jobs for every job you create it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund
[1:24:40.140 --> 1:24:47.260]  each low paying green job and it doesn't work it's a boondoggle to their friends and al gore and others
[1:24:47.260 --> 1:24:54.540]  that own large stakes in the select green companies that the county cities and states
[1:24:54.540 --> 1:24:59.980]  are forced with the federal money to purchase these systems from that's exactly right and of course
[1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:04.700]  what you're talking about there that two jobs destroyed for everyone created that's what's
[1:25:04.700 --> 1:25:11.980]  known as the freedman factor he won the Nobel prize for economics for pointing out that if the state
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:18.620]  the taxpayer is made to pay to create a job every job that's created will destroy two jobs in the
[1:25:18.620 --> 1:25:24.940]  private sector and that's why you have to keep the public sector small and of course the this green
[1:25:24.940 --> 1:25:31.980]  jobs argument is just another socialistic or communistic or totalitarian way of expanding
[1:25:31.980 --> 1:25:39.660]  the state funded publicly funded job and destroying the private sector as they go and of course
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:46.380]  democrats are always willing to do that because they know that most corporations don't vote democrat
[1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:53.260]  they don't like to contribute to the democrat and therefore they would rather shut down corporate
[1:25:53.260 --> 1:25:58.300]  america because they think they will gain political advantage by doing it they don't care if they drive
[1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:03.020]  your nation's bankrupt and of course green jobs as i said in front of the energy and commerce
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:07.900]  committee of of congress and the ways of being committed the same both of them green jobs are
[1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:13.340]  the new unemployment if you want to create unemployment the fastest way to do it is the
[1:26:13.340 --> 1:26:19.340]  taxpayer to be made to subsidize the boom goggles as you have so rightly called them
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:26.620]  there is no economic basis for wind farm nor is there an environment but it gives incredible
[1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:32.380]  power to the government to give their friends and families and others the money and we have obama
[1:26:32.380 --> 1:26:37.980]  we have a patchari for those that don't know that former current head of the ipcc and others
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:45.500]  all openly making al gore masses of money off of this and specifically not only that nobel prize
[1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:51.500]  winning paper on the fact that government destroys jobs for every job it creates it kills at least
[1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:58.540]  two we know in spain this is in bloomberg their own government admits every green job destroyed
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:06.060]  two jobs and cost additional money on top of that and we have england shutting down at steelworks
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:13.900]  paying to move it to patchari's own steelworks that he owns i mean this is criminal on its face
[1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:20.140]  this is as criminal as a mugger bashing an old woman's head in with a with a hammer and robbing
[1:27:20.140 --> 1:27:25.660]  her this is as illegal as a serial killer kidnapping children i mean this is if you take
[1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:31.580]  that red car steelworks that thing there was a report about that at last on bbc television
[1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:37.340]  today they've been almost publicly silent about it and they mentioned it today and did they mention
[1:27:37.340 --> 1:27:42.940]  that this was because europe has an emissions trading scheme and carbon cap and trade and india
[1:27:42.940 --> 1:27:49.820]  doesn't and that's why the indian steelworks that owns the red car steelworks is moving it to india
[1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:55.900]  and that india and that indian steelworks is the one that employs patchari um none of that was made
[1:27:55.900 --> 1:28:00.940]  play they just said it was world economic factors that were causing you know world economic load
[1:28:00.940 --> 1:28:07.340]  up was causing that steelworks to shut it wasn't it was that we've got cap and trade and india
[1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:13.340]  hasn't and our jobs are being exported to india where precisely the same steelwork is going to be
[1:28:13.340 --> 1:28:18.700]  built employing precisely the same number of people so there will be absolutely no benefit to the
[1:28:18.700 --> 1:28:27.260]  planet whatsoever but quite unnecessarily we will have destroyed 1700 british job and none of the
[1:28:27.260 --> 1:28:35.100]  major political parties has said sorry to these hardworking steelworkers in red car who have lost
[1:28:35.100 --> 1:28:42.380]  their job not one they have fat on their hands and said nothing as these people have thrown out of work
[1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:53.420]  but the good news is all over the country people are recognizing what this is of course the
[1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:57.340]  provision they've now passed in utah we have him coming up in the next hour
[1:28:58.060 --> 1:29:03.180]  the state rep that actually introduced the bill and he has rightfully said this is a eugenics
[1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:11.180]  operation this is a population reduction move this is a plan to deindustrialize the west
[1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:18.780]  all he's doing is quoting from the u n quoting from the very people that set this up quoting
[1:29:18.780 --> 1:29:24.140]  from morris strong who's said 25 years ago that he was setting up the intergovernmental
[1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:30.060]  panel on climate change as an intergovernmental rather than a scientific panel precisely so
[1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:36.700]  that it could be transmogrified into a world government one day that's what he said jack
[1:29:36.700 --> 1:29:43.740]  here act said some years ago that he wanted the world government to come out of the u n
[1:29:44.300 --> 1:29:48.220]  lord montan stay there we got a break let's come back and cover world government and all the other
[1:29:48.220 --> 1:29:57.580]  scandals with climate gain we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[1:29:57.580 --> 1:30:05.020]  network this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:09.340]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:30:09.340 --> 1:30:14.380]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:30:14.380 --> 1:30:19.980]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:25.100]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:30:25.100 --> 1:30:30.380]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:35.020]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:30:35.020 --> 1:30:40.380]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:30:40.380 --> 1:30:44.860]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[1:33:55.020 --> 1:34:03.100]  of this is the phony environmental movement continue yes that's right these people have
[1:34:04.220 --> 1:34:10.700]  been using the environmental movement as a way of advancing political objective
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:16.220]  that has nothing whatsoever to do with the environment we're dealing with
[1:34:17.020 --> 1:34:22.140]  marxist who piled out of the berlin war and into the environmental movement and a very
[1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:28.460]  great friend of ours eric ellington who was one of the founders of greenpeace who sadly died just
[1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:35.180]  two days ago um he left greenpeace shortly after he founded it because so many of these people had
[1:34:35.180 --> 1:34:41.180]  come in and taken the organization over for purposes that had nothing whatever to do with
[1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:47.500]  protecting the environment and were all about achieving political objective that were bitterly
[1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:56.540]  and wickedly hostile to the interest of the wet so this has really been a very very sad business
[1:34:57.100 --> 1:35:03.340]  that the genuine environmental movement has been almost entirely captured now by people
[1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:11.420]  who hate the wet and who hate success who hate industry who hate humanity who rightly said before
[1:35:11.420 --> 1:35:18.380]  the break they are there to try to get humanity to um to be killed in its in its billions they
[1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:22.620]  would like to reduce the population some of them have said to just one billion if there's a seven
[1:35:22.620 --> 1:35:26.380]  billion it's coming up to at the moment they say there any more than that and we're we're
[1:35:26.380 --> 1:35:31.580]  encroaching too much on the planet and they're prepared to use the most draconian methods
[1:35:31.580 --> 1:35:38.700]  including starvation to achieve their end and that of course is what has happened as a direct result
[1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:45.180]  of the global warming scare because there are millions starving in the third world now millions
[1:35:45.180 --> 1:35:50.860]  more than would otherwise have been starving because the biofuel scan into which all the foolish
[1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:56.300]  government the world galloped in the name of saving the planet has taken millions of acres
[1:35:56.300 --> 1:36:01.740]  of agricultural land out of growing food for people who needed it and now it's growing biofuels
[1:36:01.740 --> 1:36:09.260]  for clunkers that don't making al gore and various absolute bankers very very rich and making the
[1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:15.660]  rest of us very poor and more importantly putting food prices up by double in the in the last couple
[1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:21.740]  and by the way this is not rhetoric i mean these are admitted facts they want to starve people they
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:30.300]  want to control the wealth they want to set up a planetary tyranny expanding on that you of course
[1:36:30.300 --> 1:36:35.260]  have called out al gore many times i i would like you to do that again today you've called for
[1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:40.860]  criminal investigations these guys years ago in major papers called for your arrest called for
[1:36:40.860 --> 1:36:46.780]  the death penalty for people that are climate deniers cast sunsteen at the white house says he
[1:36:46.780 --> 1:36:52.380]  wants to make it illegal i don't know if you've seen that paper it only came out in the last month
[1:36:52.380 --> 1:36:58.620]  that he wrote a year and a half ago for the chicago law school i mean we they have truly
[1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:04.780]  committed the crimes to carry out this fraud so can you speak to that area and then secondarily
[1:37:06.620 --> 1:37:15.020]  giant events have taken place each one bigger than the last of new frauds new cooking the books
[1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:20.140]  and the thermostat uh records i know you know about that but can you chronicle some of the
[1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:25.820]  glacier gates and other things that are coming out now on a daily basis the met office is an
[1:37:25.820 --> 1:37:32.220]  absolutely extraordinary story what we're getting and let's just look at the latest of them which
[1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:37.900]  you probably haven't even heard of yourself because it's so new um the un's climate panel
[1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:46.140]  has underestimated the growth in Antarctic sea ice over the last 30 years by 50 percent
[1:37:47.020 --> 1:37:52.380]  they've been concentrating on saying oh but look how the Arctic sea ice has been diminishing
[1:37:52.380 --> 1:37:58.380]  well it has but the Antarctic sea ice has been increasing almost as much and yet you'd never
[1:37:58.380 --> 1:38:04.380]  know it hold on hold on hold your horses i don't mean to interrupt this is new the police are tell
[1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:11.020]  us where we find this the admission this is huge yes i mean this this is yet another
[1:38:11.020 --> 1:38:18.140]  error that's been found uh and it you'll find a very good detailed explanation of this at
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:22.220]  what's up with that dot com which i expect you know quite well it's a very good website by
[1:38:22.220 --> 1:38:28.700]  Anthony what w a tts up with that or one word dot com and his lead story at the moment is on
[1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:35.500]  what he calls IPCC gate du jour Antarctic sea ice increase underestimated by 50 percent
[1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:40.300]  he's got the graph he's shown you how they've bent it he's got a detailed description of
[1:38:40.300 --> 1:38:45.820]  what they did and how they went about it and how dishonest it is because of course as Arctic sea ice
[1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:52.140]  extent has declined Antarctic sea ice has increased to match it and so global sea ice extent hasn't
[1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:57.820]  changed at all you'd not know that if you read the media but let's just go through some of the other
[1:38:57.820 --> 1:39:03.820]  errors that have come to light we'll start with the one that i spotted when the 2007
[1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:08.860]  fourth assessment report of the u.s. climate panel the IPCC came out now that they've done
[1:39:08.860 --> 1:39:13.820]  four of these big assessment reports that's the most recent one on the day it came out
[1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:21.100]  i saw that they the bureaucrat had put in a graph a table of figures rather that hadn't been in the
[1:39:21.100 --> 1:39:27.420]  original document and so i protested it said by the way this doesn't even add up to within
[1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:33.420]  a factor of two of the total you put at the bottom of this new table and also you've multiplied by 10
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:40.780]  the observed contributions to sea level rise of not only the green land but also the Antarctic
[1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:47.020]  land-based ice sheet and i said that i've raised it you have no basis putting it as bureaucrat
[1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:51.900]  tables of figures like this which the scientists haven't seen haven't signed off on and on the
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:59.340]  piece of paper it's all wrong and on the piece of paper it's all wrong a 10 year old in math class
[1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:05.740]  could tell it was a fraud i mean that they're so shoddy i mean take a glacier gate from the Himalayas
[1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:12.220]  where they used a mountaineering students photos and a cell phone call saying looks like the ice
[1:40:12.220 --> 1:40:17.580]  is disappearing as their scientific proof that's right and they didn't bother to talk to it to
[1:40:17.580 --> 1:40:22.540]  professor pat of the indian geological survey who's kept me briefed on the Himalayan glaciers
[1:40:22.540 --> 1:40:27.980]  for years and he has said all along and he's now been proven right but there's absolutely no basis
[1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:32.220]  for the idea that all that ice would be gone in 25 years he says there's no danger of it going
[1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:38.300]  anywhere and we also know that the lead author of the chapter of the IPCC's report that said this
[1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:44.620]  was going to disappear in 25 years this Himalayan ice he said that he he knew that figure was wrong
[1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:50.540]  but he left it in there because he wanted to influence government in other words it's yet
[1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:56.780]  another deliberate lie it's like al gore saying sea level is going to rise imminently by 20 feet
[1:40:56.780 --> 1:41:02.860]  and we know he knows that the lie because he buys himself a condo feet from the ocean at
[1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:08.220]  fisherman's wall the same year he's making the film in which he tells the lie it's that kind of thing
[1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:13.420]  where we're now catching them out not only telling the lies but pretty much admitting
[1:41:13.420 --> 1:41:19.100]  that they're lying deliberately for the sake of exerting a political influence on government
[1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:25.580]  rather than just reporting the science correctly and that's key to be doing and that's not all
[1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:30.700]  i mean if you look at the the other ones we've had african agriculture was going to be destroyed
[1:41:30.700 --> 1:41:36.060]  by climate change they've now had to admit that in fact uh even two or three Celsius of warming
[1:41:36.060 --> 1:41:41.100]  which we aren't going to see but even if we did it would be highly beneficial to african agriculture
[1:41:41.100 --> 1:41:46.700]  it would lead to a further swartzenegger says they're going to lose swartzenegger says they're
[1:41:46.700 --> 1:41:53.020]  going to lose all the grapes for wine in california just asinine lies well actually they are because
[1:41:53.020 --> 1:41:57.820]  they've lost them to frost a couple of years running they've had exceptional frost in california
[1:41:57.820 --> 1:42:02.140]  it's been very bad for all the grapes and the fruit crops generally down there the orange crops
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:06.140]  have been damaged as well he's had a bit of a citrus crop had a hard time there but that's
[1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:11.260]  because of global cooling not because of global warming then we had the story about the amazon
[1:42:11.260 --> 1:42:15.900]  rainforest 40 they said we're going to disappear because of global warming that turned out to be
[1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:23.180]  made up by a campaigner for the worldwide fund for nature another of these wretched environmental
[1:42:23.180 --> 1:42:28.940]  groups run by communists are funded by communist governments overseas they have sovereign wealth
[1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:36.300]  the like of which you and i will never see then we had them saying that 66 percent of holland would
[1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:42.460]  be underwater when in fact only 26 percent of it is below sea level then they said that there was
[1:42:42.460 --> 1:42:47.100]  going to be damage from extreme weather events now they've had to admit that there's no basis for
[1:42:47.100 --> 1:42:51.500]  that whatsoever then they said there were going to be more hurricanes because of global warming
[1:42:51.500 --> 1:42:56.620]  and they were warned by the resignation of the one of the lead authors of that chapter that they
[1:42:56.620 --> 1:43:02.140]  mustn't go on saying that they went on saying it anyway now that's been turned out to have been
[1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:08.860]  written by a journalist from a marxist newspaper in britain not by a scientist and day after day
[1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:15.100]  new revelations come out i confronted pachari with another one of these in copenhagen because the
[1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:22.460]  headline graph in the entire 2007 assessment report of the u.s was a graph showing that the rate of
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:29.580]  increase in temperatures has itself been accelerating over the last 150 years with the implication
[1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:34.140]  stated in the report in three different places that it was we who has caused this acceleration
[1:43:34.140 --> 1:43:40.460]  in warming in fact there hasn't been an acceleration warming rate that whole thing is entirely
[1:43:40.460 --> 1:43:48.140]  bogus they used a statistical technique that i was taught not to use in statistic 101 they had no
[1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:55.420]  basis for using this cheap trick which um conceals the fact that there's been no significant increase
[1:43:55.420 --> 1:44:01.180]  in temperature whatsoever but the rate of warming that we saw over the last 30 years is exactly
[1:44:01.180 --> 1:44:06.300]  consistent with rates of warming received in 1860 1880 and again through 1910 so we know it's a
[1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:11.340]  natural cycle we couldn't have had any effect on temperature i confronted pachari with this
[1:44:11.340 --> 1:44:18.140]  and i gave him two day to withdraw that graph apologize these views in his own lectures get it
[1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:23.660]  taken out of the ipvc document otherwise i said i would report him for fraud he didn't get in touch
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:28.380]  i've reported him for fraud he is now being investigated all right now that brings me to my
[1:44:28.380 --> 1:44:36.780]  next question the fraud goes on forever and the the u n the media the spammers that come on our
[1:44:36.780 --> 1:44:44.220]  websites they repeat the same thing you are liars we have thousands appear reviewed studies but then
[1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:50.140]  all those studies are based on u n collected and private environmental group collected data
[1:44:51.020 --> 1:44:57.820]  that every time you spot check it is a premeditated fraud not an error and they've spent hundreds
[1:44:57.820 --> 1:45:05.580]  of billions globally as you know pushing this lord moctin and so my question to you is doesn't
[1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:10.460]  doesn't there need to be criminal charges on thousands of people and hundreds of organizations
[1:45:10.460 --> 1:45:16.220]  if we're truly going to route these people justice i'd be done may the heavens fall to pick on one
[1:45:16.220 --> 1:45:22.940]  or two who have plainly overstepped the line because remember that fraud like any serious
[1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:30.620]  imprisonable criminal offense is one which has quite rightly a very high standard of proof
[1:45:30.620 --> 1:45:38.140]  so you have to be able to prove that a person committing the fraud was either grossly negligent
[1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:43.980]  of therefore look the other way when he was cheating people or was deliberately cheating them
[1:45:43.980 --> 1:45:49.340]  and unless you can prove one of those two things and prove that what he did involved other people
[1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:54.860]  in losses and prove that what he did involves him in gaining at their expense if you can't
[1:45:54.860 --> 1:45:59.100]  prove all that you can't prove a fraud so what i would do is i would pick out for instance
[1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:06.460]  tata let's take let's take him as an example now he is a trustee of a charity in the united kingdom
[1:46:06.460 --> 1:46:13.180]  called teri hyphen europe that's the tata industry's energy research institute for Europe that's
[1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:20.140]  tata industries doesn't get this clear they are the people who closed down the steel works at
[1:46:20.140 --> 1:46:27.580]  red car costing 1700 of our workers their jobs over the next three months that's that's who tata
[1:46:27.580 --> 1:46:34.460]  industries are they have a charity in the united kingdom called teri hyphen europe it is registered
[1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:40.620]  with our charity commission which requires it to file accurate accounts every year now for the last
[1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:46.060]  three years it hasn't filed any account because it has made declarations for the charity commission
[1:46:46.060 --> 1:46:53.500]  that it received in each of those years less than 10 000 sterling in income however i found
[1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:58.940]  on a government website a statement saying that that particular charity had been paid
[1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:05.740]  30 000 pound in just one of those three years uh or in income to do a particular job for the
[1:47:05.740 --> 1:47:11.340]  government and that income was not disclosed to the charity commission and on further investigation
[1:47:11.340 --> 1:47:17.580]  it turns out that several hundred thousand pounds of income each year has not been declared and
[1:47:17.580 --> 1:47:22.060]  they've therefore got away with hiding for the charity commission where it is that they're getting
[1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:26.540]  their money from they're getting it in fact largely from british government taxpayer sources
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:32.220]  so sir you're saying you're saying then it's like getting al capone on tax evasion let me
[1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:38.780]  throw out a few other names then phil Jones first of all that means for charity whose job as a
[1:47:38.780 --> 1:47:45.740]  trustee is to file accurate account is now going to face criminal prosecution in the united kingdom
[1:47:45.740 --> 1:47:53.020]  for false accounting which is a serious imprisonable criminal offense he has been dodging his obligation
[1:47:53.020 --> 1:47:59.580]  as a trustee and two english trustees have now got themselves reclassified as not being trustee
[1:47:59.580 --> 1:48:05.020]  so as to leave him alone in the fray and they the police are now going to go after them too
[1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:10.060]  for trying to get themselves reclassified as not being trustee it's a very very murky business
[1:48:10.060 --> 1:48:16.620]  this and what we're now doing we're looking at the financial vested interest of several of the
[1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:22.940]  scientists and al gore types and businessmen and politicians who are advocating this stuff
[1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:30.460]  and we're finding wherever we look that they have financial links with organized crime financial
[1:48:30.460 --> 1:48:36.460]  links with huge corporations that are making money out of carbon trading and banks and so forth
[1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:42.460]  al gore was on the board of leeman brothers they were trying to corner the market in in carbon
[1:48:42.460 --> 1:48:46.380]  trading they were so busy doing that they didn't look to their main business that they deservedly
[1:48:46.380 --> 1:48:54.220]  went bust but these people there are links everywhere to huge financial vested interest
[1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.820]  and a great deal of criminal activity if you look for instance at the european carbon trading
[1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:05.820]  deal that's been running for several years a recent report by the european court of auditors shows
[1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:13.260]  that 90 percent of all transactions on the european carbon market are fraudulent transactions now i
[1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:19.020]  knew this would happen because it it's blindingly obvious if you set up a carbon trading scheme
[1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:25.980]  then not only both parties to any carbon trading transaction but also the regulators have a joint
[1:49:25.980 --> 1:49:31.980]  vested interest in exaggerating the scale and quantity of the transaction incredible so you
[1:49:31.980 --> 1:49:38.860]  have the people the whole thing from top to bottom is a serious financial fraud okay so we go after
[1:49:38.860 --> 1:49:45.020]  bachari we go after gore what about somebody like phil jones who gets all these millions of dollars
[1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:50.460]  or pounds in research funding the head facility and we have the emails where he's hiding the decline
[1:49:50.460 --> 1:49:55.180]  i mean that's the first thing that happened there is that the information commission of office
[1:49:55.180 --> 1:50:01.020]  which i asked to look into jones activity uh... first of all failed to reply to my letter at all
[1:50:01.020 --> 1:50:06.140]  i'm going to have to do them to make them do their job and answer my letter um but they then issued a
[1:50:06.140 --> 1:50:12.220]  public statement saying that the law prevented them from prosecuting jones because uh he would
[1:50:12.220 --> 1:50:16.460]  have had to have been done within six months of the offense first being drawn to their attention
[1:50:16.460 --> 1:50:21.820]  well in fact they got the law wrong but they still decided they're not going to do anything about it
[1:50:21.820 --> 1:50:26.620]  and i think what we're going to find is that the prosecuting authorities which are of course
[1:50:26.620 --> 1:50:32.300]  directed by exactly the same government that are themselves profiting by this fraud are going to be
[1:50:32.300 --> 1:50:38.620]  told by those governments to look the other way however in england and wales and i think in some
[1:50:38.620 --> 1:50:44.860]  states of the u.s. too the individual citizen has the right to prosecute if the state fails to do

[1:54:00.060 --> 1:54:09.260]  well it's our final segment with lord christopher montan we have a state representative who just
[1:54:09.260 --> 1:54:15.100]  got a law rammed through saying no to the global warming takeover texas is doing the same thing
[1:54:15.100 --> 1:54:21.900]  that's all coming up lord montan let's talk about how this is going to end how this plays out but
[1:54:21.900 --> 1:54:27.100]  but first i want to throw the caveat out i know a lot of your tories in england are still going
[1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:32.540]  along with the environmental fraud the nfl is pushing in here in the us we see newt genrich
[1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:38.300]  doing it rupert murdoch other than fox on his on his entertainment shows brags that they implant
[1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:44.940]  messages about the green economy and global warming being real so you say you say that we're
[1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:51.020]  winning this and i agree with you my problem is if we don't keep the battle hot and real and focused
[1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:56.220]  it'll just kind of fade away and they'll just regroup and come back but how do you see this
[1:54:56.220 --> 1:55:01.580]  successfully ending there's always a danger of that but i think we can now hope that because
[1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:09.020]  their activities have actually been criminal we can just land one or two prosecutions
[1:55:09.020 --> 1:55:15.740]  pachara for instance is going to be prosecuted because the accounts were plainly not correctly
[1:55:15.740 --> 1:55:20.780]  filed he plainly knew as a trustee that he had a job to make sure the accounts were right he
[1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:26.620]  didn't do that job he was at best negligent at worst deliberately fraudulent either way
[1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:31.580]  it's a serious imprisonment for criminal offense and he is going to be prosecuted even if i have
[1:55:31.580 --> 1:55:37.100]  to prosecute him myself and i know the public authorities here because there's so much in
[1:55:37.100 --> 1:55:41.900]  the pockets of the governing class won't lift a finger against any of these people however much
[1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:47.020]  they commit fraud but i am not going to tolerate it there are many others here who are not going
[1:55:47.020 --> 1:55:53.180]  to tolerate it so whether they like it or not these people who have lauded it over and have
[1:55:53.180 --> 1:55:59.740]  corruptly taken money from the pockets of the poor to pay for their own thousand dollar suits which
[1:55:59.740 --> 1:56:06.460]  is what pachara usually wears and their lavish lifestyles in the smartest suburbs of deli that
[1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:12.140]  is now going to come to an end and the lifestyle of pachara is going to be for a very long time
[1:56:12.140 --> 1:56:22.540]  behind bars in a smelly indian jail for the fraud in three successive years of deliberately filing
[1:56:23.100 --> 1:56:29.980]  false account in his charity in the uk so that we couldn't tell just how much money the british
[1:56:29.980 --> 1:56:36.300]  taxpayer was paying to keep him and his crony in clover and to interrupt everything you've
[1:56:36.300 --> 1:56:40.620]  predicted has come true so far i i mean i really hope this is going to happen how do we make sure
[1:56:40.620 --> 1:56:47.020]  this happens we make sure it happens by looking out for any other activities that are fraudulent
[1:56:47.020 --> 1:56:52.940]  by environmental groups telling lies about the climate and and profiting by doing so all of
[1:56:52.940 --> 1:56:58.140]  that is fraudulent all of that is prosecutable indeed under the rico statutes of the united
[1:56:58.140 --> 1:57:02.860]  state some of these environmental groups could be shut down because they've been lying systematically
[1:57:02.860 --> 1:57:08.220]  for years and years and years and destroying people's businesses for doing that they've been
[1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:15.180]  hurting people too they have indeed and they've been in danger in people by stopping new co-fired
[1:57:15.180 --> 1:57:20.460]  power stations from being built by stopping new nuclear power stations from being built by protesting
[1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:26.300]  every time uh... people wanted a new power station jobs already being lost they're a mafia you've
[1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:31.100]  got to buy protection from they also get to choose who they're going to mess with who they're not
[1:57:31.100 --> 1:57:36.780]  exactly and i think that one or two of those people taken to court and prosecuted for criminal
[1:57:36.780 --> 1:57:41.820]  fraud by workers who've lost their jobs in that aluminum smelter that closed down recently in
[1:57:41.820 --> 1:57:47.340]  the state because it could no longer buy electricity because the grid is running out um those people
[1:57:47.340 --> 1:57:52.780]  have a good case to take these greenies to court and all you've got to do is land a couple of them
[1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:58.780]  in prison and the rest will run for cover and more importantly the people who are now credulously
[1:57:58.780 --> 1:58:04.700]  paying the money will stop paying the money because they are just fraud so you're saying lord
[1:58:04.700 --> 1:58:10.700]  mongton we haven't even begun to see the routing of these people and because they were so bold
[1:58:10.700 --> 1:58:16.860]  they've committed so many crimes that this could this could discredit collectivism even worse than
[1:58:16.860 --> 1:58:21.340]  it did in the soviet union i think that's exactly what's going to happen i think the left by nailing
[1:58:21.340 --> 1:58:27.420]  their colors to the master this particular rapidly thinking ship are going to find themselves very
[1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:31.900]  uh they're not going to find it easy to free themselves from their entanglement with the
[1:58:31.900 --> 1:58:36.300]  top hamper of this delvis thinking ship lord mongton we're out of time we're out of time
[1:58:38.940 --> 1:58:48.220]  god bless you you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:50.620 --> 1:58:55.180]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:58:55.180 --> 1:58:59.500]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:04.540]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:59:04.540 --> 1:59:10.140]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:59:10.140 --> 1:59:15.260]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:59:15.260 --> 1:59:20.540]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:59:20.540 --> 1:59:25.180]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:30.540]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:59:30.540 --> 1:59:34.940]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:40.540]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[1:59:40.540 --> 1:59:45.580]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[2:00:40.140 --> 2:00:44.060]  federal bill and obama says he can't get it passed he's gonna do it through executive order
[2:00:44.860 --> 2:00:49.900]  it's in the federal bill that if they do a home inspection and you don't make the changes they want
[2:00:49.900 --> 2:00:55.820]  and they recommend and tell you the company's a list that you've got to use they then under federal

[2:01:47.180 --> 2:01:52.380]  this stuff up no he's quoting what the head climatologist for nasa said in a book that they
[2:01:52.380 --> 2:01:58.220]  want to destroy industrial society what morris strong head of the un program said what ted turner
[2:01:58.220 --> 2:02:02.860]  jacuzzo what they all say this is about this isn't just about controlling industry and
[2:02:02.860 --> 2:02:09.420]  and insider fat cats getting rich it's about that but a lot more so we're going to go to break in a
[2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:16.380]  moment and uh come back uh with our guest mike noel utah state representatives 73rd district
[2:02:16.380 --> 2:02:23.740]  this is a great guy and the fight is going to be at the state level all over the country even in
[2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:28.780]  unlikely places like new york and california people at the state level people in the state
[2:02:28.780 --> 2:02:36.540]  houses are saying no no no china india mexico and hundreds it's over 160 other third world
[2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:45.100]  in developing nations they don't have to make any cuts on their emissions even if you believe
[2:02:45.100 --> 2:02:49.260]  these emissions are deadly how moving them from the u.s. where they're a lot cleaner
[2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:57.260]  to china and india when it's all one planet and all the studies show boosting the amount
[2:02:57.260 --> 2:03:02.380]  how does that save the earth well we know from all the scientific evidence and the inside un
[2:03:02.380 --> 2:03:08.860]  emails and the 30 plus scandals the last two months it's more than 30 now it's all systematic
[2:03:08.860 --> 2:03:15.740]  fraud as you just heard lord christopher moctin in the last hour cover in detail
[2:03:17.740 --> 2:03:24.300]  this is so important ladies and gentlemen this is the number one fight we've got because
[2:03:24.300 --> 2:03:28.220]  yeah the government wants to seize health care and run your life and tax you and cut your medicare
[2:03:28.220 --> 2:03:32.300]  and medicaid and raise taxes that's in the bill and yeah they want to give you flu shots that
[2:03:32.300 --> 2:03:36.140]  are known to be dangerous don't even help you with the flu that's a government study today
[2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:41.180]  and yeah they uh you know want to try to seize the highways and give them to foreign corporations
[2:03:41.180 --> 2:03:48.220]  to run toll roads yes all that's going on but the center of their agenda the the jewel in the crown
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:52.940]  is this phony environmentalism so we're going to be talking about that coming up
[2:03:52.940 --> 2:03:59.020]  then in about 40 minutes when our guest leaves us which is again a microcosm example of what you
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:06.140]  can do at your state level and what is happening we'll look to the tea parties in texas with ron paul
[2:04:06.140 --> 2:04:16.220]  and deba madina and myself at high level republican meetings at the rnc we have an insider a national
[2:04:16.220 --> 2:04:23.660]  figure but i can't tell you who it is saying that the rnc what we already knew hates real

[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:36.300]  global tax and the global warming that the arizona senator john mccain they are coming after the
[2:04:36.300 --> 2:04:42.300]  real patreons they're gonna use the phony right because nobody trusts the fake left
[2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:49.020]  the establishment left to try to come in and corral us at the state level but with representatives

[2:09:20.780 --> 2:09:28.940]  all based on a fraud by internationalist going now to representative noel sir thank you so much
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:36.380]  for spending time with us today hey thank you alex for having me appreciate it you know reading text
[2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:41.100]  of what you said in the house and statements you've given sounds like you're a pretty informed guy
[2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:48.060]  how did you find out about what was really behind the fake green movement well you know my background
[2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:54.300]  i do have a biology background of masters in the zoology but i raised cows and i farm hay and i'm
[2:09:54.300 --> 2:10:00.060]  very very familiar with the photosynthetic process and the fact that carbon dioxide is absolutely
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:06.460]  needed for uh being able to grow my hay and then that we are actually in a carbon deficit right now
[2:10:06.460 --> 2:10:12.060]  we we could uh with more carbon we're at about 380 parts per million we could actually produce
[2:10:12.060 --> 2:10:17.260]  more food and a few more people in the world so it just didn't make sense and as i looked into it
[2:10:17.260 --> 2:10:22.300]  and wore the issues and saw some of the players alex uh i got very concerned one of them being
[2:10:22.300 --> 2:10:29.020]  the president's science advisor john holgren uh believe it or not i went to berkeley and
[2:10:29.740 --> 2:10:35.740]  got a good education there uh but really came out of there with a strong conviction that conservative
[2:10:35.740 --> 2:10:41.100]  values is what we need in this country to bring us back to reality to just have the government
[2:10:41.100 --> 2:10:46.940]  leave people alone and go back to the tenth amendment and have the states be more responsible
[2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:50.460]  for what happens within our states and whatever we give to the federal government
[2:10:50.460 --> 2:10:55.820]  uh they seem to want to control more and more and more so that's kind of where i came on to it
[2:10:55.820 --> 2:11:00.860]  but well let's talk about go ahead go ahead yeah i mean let's talk about holgren i happened to have
[2:11:00.860 --> 2:11:07.340]  ecoscience right here he says a planetary police state to carry out massive population reduction
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:14.140]  the forced drugging of water to reduce fertility and to sterilize i mean this is a monstrous uh
[2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:19.580]  control freak and so you're saying you were aware of holgren uh early on please continue
[2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:25.740]  him yeah i was uh i went to berkeley uh paul erick uh and and erick were teachers at uh
[2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:31.660]  stanford and holgren was a co-author of that book population resources and environment along with
[2:11:31.660 --> 2:11:36.140]  you know you remember the population bomb it was a big issue back in the 60s and many of the
[2:11:36.140 --> 2:11:42.220]  statements that holgren has made throughout his life have been uh absolutely preposterous uh
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:47.340]  you know the the left wing and the drive by media will tell you well he discounted all of that
[2:11:47.340 --> 2:11:53.020]  and his final statement is to be better to do this voluntarily well i don't believe that's the case
[2:11:53.020 --> 2:11:57.980]  and i believe that some of those statements that you made really uh show the real intent of this
[2:11:57.980 --> 2:12:03.260]  man and many in this administration from the top level down all of these zars that are put in from
[2:12:03.260 --> 2:12:08.860]  van jones to to the individual that runs the education department in his background uh it's
[2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:14.140]  almost unbelievable that these are the people running our country i forget who it was that said
[2:12:14.140 --> 2:12:19.420]  that when an individual comes face to face with such a monstrous conspiracy they have trouble
[2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:24.540]  even believing it even when these individuals write books about what they plan but you have
[2:12:24.540 --> 2:12:29.900]  eric peonka ut saying killed 90 of the population you have ted turner saying you have the un saying
[2:12:29.900 --> 2:12:35.980]  reduced by 80 uh you have literally thousands of these individuals un biological diversity
[2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:44.220]  assessment henry kissinger's pd d um and his uh different uh programs state department random 200
[2:12:44.220 --> 2:12:49.980]  i mean this is their religion and you say you went to school in and around these people so you
[2:12:49.980 --> 2:12:55.340]  certainly had a front row seat to it i did and you know it is their religion it's the it's the
[2:12:55.340 --> 2:13:01.500]  religion of environmentalism it's a worship of the of the creations rather than the creator it's
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:06.540]  like the druads of old uh they do believe in that and you know if you look at it alex they actually
[2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:13.420]  have already allowed some of these policies to be implemented the whole issue with dbt uh back
[2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:19.580]  in the sixties with uh rachel karsten has killed more people on this planet hundreds of millions
[2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:26.140]  of people than any other supposed uh environmental pollutants out there and by the way representative
[2:13:26.140 --> 2:13:32.940]  noel you're not just saying that these are the real numbers from malaria well removing the dbt
[2:13:33.660 --> 2:13:38.620]  yeah absolutely they and and even you know they'll try to back this up but i remember as a young
[2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:43.340]  kid my dad was a military officer we live in virginia i used to run behind the trucks when
[2:13:43.340 --> 2:13:49.020]  they sprayed the dbt uh it was and and to get rid of the mosquitoes and it's not harmful it's not
[2:13:49.020 --> 2:13:54.860]  something that would kill you and it did it was a it was used to control one of the worst diseases
[2:13:54.860 --> 2:13:59.900]  out there on the planet it does hitler turn on hitler but uh shakespeare talked about it as the
[2:14:00.540 --> 2:14:06.060]  ague in his plays and it talked about how many people died from this thing and and that it
[2:14:06.060 --> 2:14:09.580]  went all throughout the united states people think it was a probably good disease but it was
[2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:15.420]  actually in in up into boston and massachusetts in those areas so you know we we've been able to
[2:14:15.420 --> 2:14:19.980]  through man's technology through man's genius we've been able to make a better planet for ourselves
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:24.300]  right here in this country we have and yet the environmental community wants us to go back in
[2:14:24.300 --> 2:14:30.060]  the dark ages that's what this whole movement about blacksmith cap and trade it's a shift of wealth
[2:14:30.060 --> 2:14:35.180]  it's a movement from liberty as mark levin said the tyranny it's absolutely a taking of your
[2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:40.380]  rights or individual rights it's allowing the government to get in every single facet of your life
[2:14:42.860 --> 2:14:48.700]  and they admit that's their plan while pachari and gore and obama and newt genrich gets stinking
[2:14:48.700 --> 2:14:52.060]  rich and that leads me to another problem we face here then i'm going to talk about the
[2:14:52.060 --> 2:14:58.460]  actual resolutions uh and what the senate's doing for states rights the resolution you helped
[2:14:58.460 --> 2:15:04.140]  author and get through saying we're aware of this fraud the state says no how this is really our
[2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:10.380]  frontline battle against these people uh climate gate how they're now being routed and and where
[2:15:10.380 --> 2:15:17.100]  you see these weasels going next but before we get into that we have the owner of fox news
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:22.300]  ripper murdoch i don't know if you've seen this put out an eight minute video bragging showing all
[2:15:22.300 --> 2:15:27.900]  the stuff they put in their their fiction entertainment shows pushing manmade global warming
[2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:32.220]  and how we're all going to die if we don't do this we've got the nfl pushing in all the big
[2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:38.700]  corporations uh we've got john mccain uh i mean this even two years ago sarah palin and now she
[2:15:38.700 --> 2:15:46.460]  isn't was saying oh i think it's real uh we've had uh uh you know all these top republicans involved
[2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:51.020]  i mean i'm glad now they're backing off of it somewhat but we've gone from the fact that they
[2:15:51.020 --> 2:15:56.780]  bullied basically most people into accepting this to it blowing up in their face uh my only problem
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:01.420]  is we need criminal prosecutions we need to route this whole thing and put it to bed once and for
[2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:07.820]  all or like cancer you know if you've got metastasized cancer in 10 or 12 areas and you only remove
[2:16:07.820 --> 2:16:13.740]  eight or nine you're still gonna die we've got to remove all of this cancer and hunt these criminals
[2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:19.660]  down through the law and bring them to justice well how many how many yeah how many billions and
[2:16:19.660 --> 2:16:25.580]  billions of dollars of the taxpayers money have we wasted on this pseudoscience how much money
[2:16:25.580 --> 2:16:31.340]  you know it's in order to get a grant uh at any major university all you have to do is find some
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:37.340]  kind of a nexus to the global warming climate issue i don't care if it's mating habits of stingrays
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:43.660]  off the coast of australia or frogs in in south america you're going to get a grant for it so
[2:16:43.660 --> 2:16:49.180]  there has been billions of dollars and like you said alex uh those people have positioned themselves
[2:16:49.180 --> 2:16:53.740]  i noticed this morning that some of the groups caterpillars backing off of some of their places
[2:16:53.740 --> 2:16:58.300]  people were positioning themselves for the market in some ways i don't blame uh some of the enter
[2:16:58.300 --> 2:17:04.780]  of the companies but they have in fact by uh by buying into this i'm not wanting to take the heat
[2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:09.340]  you can't believe the heat that i've taken over the last five years on this issue of a
[2:17:09.340 --> 2:17:16.700]  denier as of a total uh idiot cowboy down in southern utah that wouldn't know a carbon dioxide
[2:17:16.700 --> 2:17:21.580]  molecule if he saw one those types of statements have been made about me so it takes courage and
[2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:27.100]  determination to stand up and to say no and unfortunately we did not have the leadership
[2:17:27.100 --> 2:17:31.740]  the republican party to make this an issue the majority the public stands with us i believe
[2:17:31.740 --> 2:17:37.180]  and when the facts come out and when you don't leak link co2 to traditional pollution that creates
[2:17:37.180 --> 2:17:41.820]  smog and you talk about it as something you put in your uh in your soda pop and something
[2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:46.220]  that plants need people start to realize the debate we just had a debate this morning just
[2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:51.020]  an hour ago alex on the house floor where someone was bringing a bill to talk about air pollution
[2:17:51.020 --> 2:17:55.260]  one of the democrats the other side it was a feel-good type resolution that we need to stop
[2:17:55.260 --> 2:17:59.340]  idling in our cars because of the danger and the problems were smog and we got a lot here in
[2:17:59.340 --> 2:18:05.500]  salt lake valley i got up and i meant the bill to take out the words greenhouse gases and co2
[2:18:05.500 --> 2:18:11.260]  and again try to educate the body that these are not pollutants in a in a sense like the epa
[2:18:11.260 --> 2:18:15.500]  said that the endangerment findings and what you mentioned earlier that many of these states are
[2:18:15.500 --> 2:18:21.820]  now suing the epa to take that off the list of a pollutant so it takes a long time to educate people
[2:18:21.820 --> 2:18:27.180]  both republicans and both democrats and both independents and tea tea party people they need
[2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:32.540]  to be educated as to what the real issues are the real issues go down to one thing it's how much
[2:18:32.540 --> 2:18:37.580]  government control you want in your life what's really an issue let the state solve these problems
[2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:46.300]  but local government solve them not federal government absolutely and when i get up here
[2:18:46.300 --> 2:18:52.860]  on the air representative noel and i say we're winning and people are really waking up well
[2:18:52.860 --> 2:18:56.540]  that's not hype and i want to get your take on if you're seeing the same thing but i want to be
[2:18:56.540 --> 2:19:01.740]  clear this isn't business as usual this doesn't mean phony republicans go into congress and give
[2:19:01.740 --> 2:19:08.780]  us more big government and a lighter version of what obama's doing this is the spirit of 1776
[2:19:08.780 --> 2:19:15.740]  we have had enough of big government control freaks all the taxes the police state america is
[2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:23.020]  truly having a realignment back to the basics i absolutely agree with that we're seeing in
[2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:27.820]  what better state than you thought one of the most conservative states in the country even our
[2:19:28.460 --> 2:19:32.780]  even our democratic side the aisle are very very conservative and support me on many of these
[2:19:32.780 --> 2:19:38.060]  issues and and we are seeing a resurgence you know it's not that the public is unintelligent
[2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:42.940]  it's that the public is uninformed when you inform the public when you give them the facts
[2:19:42.940 --> 2:19:49.580]  when they see how these things affect their everyday lives just like with uh with the president obama
[2:19:49.580 --> 2:19:53.820]  what he promised and what we got were two different things he promised change
[2:19:53.820 --> 2:19:58.300]  and he promised hope and all the things that we thought that people thought that he was going
[2:19:58.300 --> 2:20:06.300]  to give but when you root for it stay there stay there our economy is in great distress the financial

[2:24:49.660 --> 2:24:54.700]  perry told a super high powered public figure that called me to warn me yesterday or this morning
[2:24:54.700 --> 2:24:59.020]  actually try to get old me yesterday talked in this morning talked to the person this morning
[2:24:59.020 --> 2:25:03.660]  excuse me uh didn't say it was a man or woman that the republicans are going to come after me
[2:25:03.660 --> 2:25:10.060]  i mean carl roe they they don't like it they don't want to really get america back obama
[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:14.620]  that came out in the newspaper six months ago i'm in the top 25 enemies less now i'm on the
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:20.380]  republican enemy less why because i i've had enough of big government and this texas monthly thing i
[2:25:20.380 --> 2:25:28.300]  mean it is a cover story look at this cover story i mean this is insane man they are really coming
[2:25:28.300 --> 2:25:33.900]  after us and i've scanned over it it's got a lot of distortions in it already uh it's not the worst
[2:25:33.900 --> 2:25:39.260]  hit piece i've seen though okay i don't want to talk about myself it's just this thing is but again
[2:25:39.260 --> 2:25:45.020]  this is only an indicator of how far we've all come the fact that people don't believe the
[2:25:45.020 --> 2:25:51.020]  mainstream media anymore and alternative media is just on fire continuing representative noel
[2:25:51.020 --> 2:25:57.660]  on that subject of just the incredible awakening well i that that it is absolutely amazing i mean
[2:25:57.660 --> 2:26:02.860]  that's probably the greatest thing that's happened in america in the last 10 years is the ability
[2:26:02.860 --> 2:26:08.300]  of the everyday citizen to be able to access the news without the filtering through the uh
[2:26:08.300 --> 2:26:14.300]  the mainstream or the drive-by media or the lame stream media those types of uh media that for some
[2:26:14.300 --> 2:26:19.820]  reason they have an agenda we have the same situation here in uh in utah with our two main
[2:26:19.820 --> 2:26:26.620]  newspapers the one thing that's all like tribute that's very very uh uh anti conservatism anti uh
[2:26:26.620 --> 2:26:32.540]  they're pro global warming and have just gone out of their way to discredit me and others and in all
[2:26:32.540 --> 2:26:37.820]  all areas the desert news is a little bit better but uh what's happening is alex is
[2:26:37.820 --> 2:26:44.620]  they're losing readership too they're losing it because the public is no longer uh duped by
[2:26:44.620 --> 2:26:50.860]  what they put out with the with their actions that they put out but i think it's more representative
[2:26:50.860 --> 2:26:57.340]  noel when you get attacked by corporate mainline big government media that is then a seal of
[2:26:57.340 --> 2:27:07.100]  approval on you i appreciate that uh i have uh i do have a lot of friends uh that are in the and in
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:14.060]  manufacturing and that recognize how critical it is to to not pass a cap and trade bill because
[2:27:14.060 --> 2:27:19.260]  they recognize it's going to be a cost of jobs in utah so maybe utah we're somewhat isolated here i
[2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:26.380]  still talk to to a lot of people in the industry there uh we are a very very conservative state
[2:27:26.380 --> 2:27:33.340]  we are we did not really support uh john mccain because john mccain's a lot of this philosophy
[2:27:33.340 --> 2:27:37.980]  but one of them was really this global warming issue he got it completely wrong on that and so
[2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:43.740]  it just doesn't make any sense to to support people make it wrong and i agree with you the people
[2:27:43.740 --> 2:27:48.380]  are the ones that need to speak the people the ones that need to step up and there is absolutely
[2:27:48.380 --> 2:27:53.020]  a revolution because they can get the facts themselves because they can go to the media
[2:27:53.020 --> 2:27:57.260]  because because they can go to the internet and they can get different information and they can
[2:27:57.260 --> 2:28:03.660]  get the truth out we're seeing this resurgence and we see there's fear out there that they're losing
[2:28:03.660 --> 2:28:09.900]  their freedoms that they are losing their freedoms and this contrives so-called uh health issue and
[2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:15.740]  the more uh the more of emergency it becomes the more or widespread that the government says that
[2:28:15.740 --> 2:28:21.900]  it is they then they act aggressively to address the crisis even though uh it takes away some of
[2:28:21.900 --> 2:28:26.060]  the limitations that government have people they say it's an emergency outgore said that you know
[2:28:26.060 --> 2:28:31.820]  the planet is ending uh uh in in 35 years and the land glaciers are going to melt these types of
[2:28:31.820 --> 2:28:37.420]  things are to stoke up the fear so that they can then take uh freedoms that you have and you take
[2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:42.460]  the granted uh and people are sometimes willing to surrender they think it's an emergency a national
[2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:46.940]  crisis and so they they step back and agree with it but now we've uncovered it i understand you had
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:52.460]  ron mocked it on there i i talked with him on a regular basis he's actually coming to utah on the
[2:28:52.460 --> 2:28:58.540]  23rd of march and we'll be speaking to a group of legislators in an all day forum so i appreciate
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:04.620]  that ron mocked in those the issue absolutely i may even come to utah to interview him and
[2:29:04.620 --> 2:29:07.980]  try to videotape some of that maybe i can work with you on that we're figuring out
[2:29:07.980 --> 2:29:12.460]  exactly where i'm going to hook up with him when he's in the us but again to be clear about what
[2:29:12.460 --> 2:29:18.300]  i was saying earlier when the mainstream media attacks someone now they don't realize how discredited
[2:29:18.300 --> 2:29:23.740]  they are they're starting to get an idea they don't understand that when they attack somebody
[2:29:23.740 --> 2:29:29.820]  then the public automatically whether it's right or not tends to support whoever's being attacked
[2:29:29.820 --> 2:29:34.380]  because the system is so discredited i mean of all these newspapers are attacking mike noel
[2:29:34.380 --> 2:29:40.780]  or ron paul or alex jones or deborah medina or other people like that then we must be on to
[2:29:40.780 --> 2:29:45.100]  something i want to talk about the resolution itself and a lot more straight ahead with our
[2:29:45.100 --> 2:29:54.380]  guests on the front lines and the fight for liberty we're on the march the empires on the

[2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:38.780]  and momentum is shifting towards free humanity and shattering the political false paradigms
[2:33:39.580 --> 2:33:45.100]  we have representative mike noelle 73rd district of utah sir i've been asking my questions i mean i
[2:33:45.100 --> 2:33:49.580]  want to get into the state's rights resolution there as well and how that's happening other parts
[2:33:49.580 --> 2:33:56.620]  of the country and the uh resolution that you've helped get through and tell us exactly i mean
[2:33:56.620 --> 2:34:02.060]  i've got a copy of it but break down why you felt this was necessary and what this resolution means
[2:34:02.780 --> 2:34:07.340]  well i ran that resolution actually in a different format last year uh with getting us out of the
[2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:13.100]  western climate initiative which is a group of states and and some canadian provinces that
[2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:17.900]  are pushing towards mandatory controls of co2 i tried to get our governor to uh
[2:34:17.900 --> 2:34:22.300]  back out that being observer he wouldn't do it so i'm running that again but this one specifically
[2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:28.060]  talks about the issues that are coming out some of the information you put on your program with
[2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:32.140]  phil jones and michael man the hockey stick the fact that there was no accountability for the
[2:34:32.140 --> 2:34:37.020]  medieval warming period a lot of those things that we have now come to find out the the data
[2:34:37.020 --> 2:34:44.860]  that's been suppressed the the work by phil jones and others to suppress peer review information
[2:34:44.860 --> 2:34:50.700]  a normal thing that a normal process and scientific research to be able to have individuals come out
[2:34:50.700 --> 2:34:57.500]  and challenge the data you know my mind nothing is nothing is absolutely cast in concrete and any
[2:34:57.500 --> 2:35:03.260]  hypotheses out there is subject to individuals researching it in order to be able to research
[2:35:03.260 --> 2:35:07.420]  that they have to have the data if you look at lord mockton what he's done he's taken the actual
[2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:12.220]  data the temperatures and and and their models and shown that their models are incorrect that the
[2:35:12.220 --> 2:35:16.700]  warming is going to be minimal i don't think there's a one of us hold on let me stop you let me stop
[2:35:16.700 --> 2:35:23.340]  you uh but i mean but but it's not that their errors are they're incorrect they knew uh it was
[2:35:23.340 --> 2:35:27.900]  a lot warmer in the medieval period there were graves in northern england they knew 9 000 years
[2:35:27.900 --> 2:35:32.300]  ago at the start of the bronze age that the earth's temperature on average was eight degrees higher
[2:35:32.300 --> 2:35:37.660]  they know all this this is pre meditated fraud the climate gate emails show us that
[2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:43.900]  yes that that's true that's those that control the data but what's happened unfortunately because
[2:35:43.900 --> 2:35:48.460]  of the billions of dollars that has gone at the university and scientists across the country
[2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:54.300]  in government grants individuals that wanted to tap in that money supply have taken for granted
[2:35:54.300 --> 2:36:00.700]  the information that phil jones the ipcc the ar4 reports and all those reports taken as pat scientists
[2:36:00.700 --> 2:36:06.940]  and come up these numbers 97 percent of all scientists agree that global warming anthropogenic
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:12.940]  man-caused global warming is occurring 97 percent and that's how that's how you get the public uh to
[2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:17.500]  then buy into this is by saying well hey all the scientists agrees how could you're coming out against
[2:36:17.500 --> 2:36:21.660]  it this is where they attack me how in the world can you come in they call the people like roya
[2:36:21.660 --> 2:36:27.020]  simons and and others that come out against this and uh they say they're fringe scientists they're
[2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:31.100]  basically wackos they don't know what they're talking about those are the ones that have had
[2:36:31.100 --> 2:36:36.140]  the courage and the integrity to research it out on their own take the information and come up with
[2:36:36.140 --> 2:36:41.500]  the information that is correct so for the public so it's a scary thing that a group of individuals
[2:36:41.500 --> 2:36:47.580]  can work together and to control this data and then have all these scientists buy into it mainly
[2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:56.860]  because of the money alex that's why they're doing it the funding that's there you're absolutely
[2:36:56.860 --> 2:37:01.900]  right now the reason i have you on the main reason is because your courage to get this resolution in
[2:37:01.900 --> 2:37:07.260]  to get it passed but also because the battle is the state level obama was in the new york times for
[2:37:07.260 --> 2:37:12.700]  those that missed it last friday has announced he will do signing statements executive orders
[2:37:12.700 --> 2:37:17.900]  and he'll even just order bureaucracies to levy the carbon taxes the cap and trade the home
[2:37:17.900 --> 2:37:22.620]  inspections everything that's in the senate bill that passed the house that he now can't get through
[2:37:22.620 --> 2:37:27.420]  and that's in the new york times today they say basically it's dead now they may be playing possum
[2:37:27.420 --> 2:37:31.500]  as lord montan said and they are meeting again later this year in mexico to try to get it at a
[2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:37.020]  treaty level but the third world found out it was basically doubling the taxes on them so they pulled
[2:37:37.020 --> 2:37:44.220]  out so as people realize this fraud is so diabolical it's it's it's it's basically a dead dog but
[2:37:44.220 --> 2:37:49.500]  they're not stopping schwarzenegger has said and i'm witnessing in here in austin where i live
[2:37:49.500 --> 2:37:54.140]  that they're getting the governors and city councils together with this international money
[2:37:54.140 --> 2:38:04.060]  and austin energy announced two weeks ago a 2.6 they said this 2.6 billion dollar tax in over the
[2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:09.740]  next three years on energy each year that's bigger than than the entire budget of the city i mean
[2:38:09.740 --> 2:38:16.940]  they just calmly announced the biggest tax increase dwarfing everything and it looks like
[2:38:16.940 --> 2:38:21.580]  austin's gonna do it i mean they're that criminal what do we do oh well i guess the answer is the
[2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:26.700]  state legislature all the all the cities and all the municipalities are an instrumentality
[2:38:26.700 --> 2:38:31.340]  of the state legislature the state legislature needs to act and not allow them to implement those
[2:38:31.340 --> 2:38:36.940]  taxes that would never happen in utah we would not allow the cities to do that we would we control
[2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:41.980]  what their taxing authority is and to put that kind of a tax on would not be allowed by that by
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:47.420]  the state legislature in utah a strong conservative state so we got to fight back in that direction
[2:38:47.420 --> 2:38:52.220]  remember now this alex there's going to be winner states and there's going to be loser states some
[2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:57.020]  of the winner states are going to be california and massachusetts is interesting uh boxer and
[2:38:57.020 --> 2:39:02.140]  carry are supporting the bill in the senate the wax from marquis bill and marquis and wax from marquis
[2:39:02.140 --> 2:39:07.820]  from from massachusetts and wax from from california both those states will gain because they have
[2:39:07.820 --> 2:39:13.180]  carbon offsets that they can sell so it's a transfer of wealth not only uh within the united
[2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:18.220]  states there then would be a transfer of wealth as we know internationally to third world countries
[2:39:18.220 --> 2:39:23.340]  massive transfer of wealth so there are some things here that are absolutely every citizen needs to
[2:39:23.340 --> 2:39:30.860]  look into the people really know that by 2014 the incandescent light bulb is going to be outlawed
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:34.940]  in the united states that they know that laws on the books is going to come to play at that time
[2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:38.540]  we want what's that what are people going to wake up to that you can wake up in the morning and
[2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:42.380]  hey you're light bulb your band you can't go down the store and buy an incandescent light bulb you've
[2:39:42.380 --> 2:39:47.660]  got to buy a mercury light bulb i mean let's stop crazy things people don't know about and again it
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:52.140]  starts with something reasonable on the surface like dbt then it's the toilet you can have the
[2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:57.420]  washing machine you can have and now they're talking about criminal penalties for selling old
[2:39:57.420 --> 2:40:02.700]  fashioned light bulbs they admit the new ones have mercury in them they're toxic they give you
[2:40:02.700 --> 2:40:08.540]  headaches in major studies they're total crud and if they can set the precedent to say what kind of
[2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:13.420]  light bulb you can have they can do anything you're absolutely right what can we call the
[2:40:13.420 --> 2:40:19.820]  of the administrative state that we're in and i think we need to sunset every single independent
[2:40:19.820 --> 2:40:24.860]  federal agencies every single year subject to congress approving them i think that's what
[2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:32.380]  us needs to happen uh there's uh we need to educate the public we need to have more of a uh the
[2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:38.700]  limit to the supreme court's review power we need to limit these tax exemptions to the environmental
[2:40:38.700 --> 2:40:43.580]  organizations that are not uh non-partisan charitable foundations haven't these guys are
[2:40:43.580 --> 2:40:48.780]  pushing the agenda all over the board they got statutory authority to go in and get free
[2:40:48.780 --> 2:40:53.420]  money from the government we're paying the environmentalists to sue the federal government
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:40:58.460]  and they use that money to sue us to shut down regulatory authority with the threatened danger
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:03.020]  species act with the clean air act with all the acts that they have if you want to know what it's
[2:41:03.020 --> 2:41:08.300]  like living in a totalitarian regime with the federal government involved utah is two-thirds
[2:41:08.300 --> 2:41:13.340]  federally controlled in our state that's why we have some of the lowest per capita expenditures
[2:41:13.340 --> 2:41:17.580]  on our school children because we don't get tax based off these federal lands we should have had
[2:41:17.580 --> 2:41:22.220]  those lands turned over to the states at inception during the enabling act but we didn't that's another
[2:41:22.220 --> 2:41:27.180]  bill that we're trying to push is get back control of our state so that we can pay our bills i'm a
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:33.180]  big supporter of repealing the 17th amendment get these senators this elite club of 100 senators
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:37.980]  back there in dc the most powerful 100 men essentially in the world and get those men to
[2:41:37.980 --> 2:41:43.420]  come back and be accountable to a state legislature and the local body of elected people representative
[2:41:43.420 --> 2:41:48.220]  in utah that's not taught in school so explain to people the same year we got the private
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:52.380]  fellow reserve dictatorship they had to have their new funding mechanism the income tax
[2:41:52.380 --> 2:41:56.940]  the bankers just buffaloed us again with that whole stage deal they want a new value added
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:42:01.420]  or sales tax that beckon or riley are pushing because they're the conservatives we can trust
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:07.980]  stacked on top so so the next phase of these people and that same year they gave us the 17th
[2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:12.540]  amendment and i've had scholars on the show it wasn't ratified many of the states they claim
[2:42:12.540 --> 2:42:19.420]  and so expanding from that folks don't know that states previous to 1913 the 17th amendment
[2:42:19.420 --> 2:42:26.620]  the elected legislature talk about your state reps haven't power they then selected voted for
[2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:32.540]  the two senators who were creatures of the state because it was all about separation of powers
[2:42:33.260 --> 2:42:37.980]  right it exactly was and it goes through the whole concept of federalism people don't understand
[2:42:37.980 --> 2:42:41.180]  that doesn't mean the federal government is in control that means the federal government has
[2:42:41.180 --> 2:42:45.500]  certain duties and responsibilities the state government has certain duties the local governments
[2:42:45.500 --> 2:42:50.300]  have duties if when we took away that authority for the legislature to have direct control of the
[2:42:50.300 --> 2:42:56.220]  election of senators we took away a huge power block from the states in direct control of one
[2:42:56.220 --> 2:43:01.980]  branch of the government the legislative branch of the government that was where our representation
[2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:08.140]  in the state came from and you wouldn't have this long term of senators serving for 30 and 40
[2:43:08.140 --> 2:43:12.540]  years because they would be coming back on a regular basis we would be monitoring what their
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:17.580]  votes are we'd be talking from a regular basis and all it would take is a majority of the senators
[2:43:17.580 --> 2:43:24.220]  or or the representatives in the in the houses in this state uh legislatures to get rid of them so
[2:43:24.220 --> 2:43:30.460]  that to me is a way to get back to more to control more of a state sovereignty issues to just to
[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:36.780]  repeal the 17th amendment and put the the senators at the at the response to the citizens
[2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:40.700]  in the community as well as our own legislators which are responsive i have to start call for
[2:43:40.700 --> 2:43:45.980]  election every two years i'm i'm accountable to my constituents i have a small only have 45
[2:43:45.980 --> 2:43:51.180]  thousand people in eight different counties that i'm uh that i have to talk to i'm i'm i'm a what
[2:43:51.180 --> 2:43:57.900]  we call a a a uh rural legislator that is uh a people's legislator because i don't get paid to
[2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:03.420]  do my job i get a very a minimal amount of money to be here for 45 days we are required to balance
[2:44:03.420 --> 2:44:08.060]  our budget which we do every single year we can't go out of here with an under balanced budget we
[2:44:08.060 --> 2:44:12.220]  can't be in a structural deficit we got to make sure that the ongoing revenues are going to be
[2:44:12.220 --> 2:44:17.500]  that if they're not we have to cut revenue we have to cut tax or cut uh programs or we have to
[2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:22.220]  increase revenue and we don't want to increase taxes so we cut programs and that's the federal
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:28.620]  government won't do that we are in a serious situation in this country my 16 grandkids are
[2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:34.140]  going to have a very very tough time when they try to make a living with having this huge burden
[2:44:34.140 --> 2:44:38.860]  of social security and the taxation that we put upon us with this debt it really it really
[2:44:38.860 --> 2:44:42.940]  sickens me what we've done to our kids and our grandkids it's almost like we don't care about
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:47.740]  the next generation you talk about environmentalists what about this huge debt economic debt we're

[2:46:36.140 --> 2:46:41.660]  too bad back in dc we couldn't see that it's it's well that's what's crazy is the only the only real
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:47.340]  jobs getting created are government jobs or government funded jobs and every study shows
[2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:53.980]  every government job costs two jobs in the real world i mean this country's going into a depression
[2:46:53.980 --> 2:46:58.940]  and government's growing like a case of lymph lymphoma cancer yeah and that's why the people in

[2:47:37.340 --> 2:47:42.380]  he converted it and ran his armies on it we can convert coal to gasoline we could get we've got
[2:47:42.380 --> 2:47:47.820]  tar sands we've got a process to hydro gasification that we can take any carbon based material
[2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:53.820]  and make fuel out of it but the bankers like a monopoly so that's why they shut down all the
[2:47:53.820 --> 2:47:59.740]  oil and gas well clinton shut down all that clean burning coal mainly in utah thus doubling the

[2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:34.220]  platform which is so popular with the left and the right as we shadow the paradigm here are the
[2:55:34.220 --> 2:55:40.620]  two top stories breaking sarah palin 911 truth or controversy makes hypocrite of glenn back
[2:55:41.260 --> 2:55:48.220]  she said she supports in october 2008 a new investigation we have a video up there explaining
[2:55:48.220 --> 2:55:55.260]  why this is so important and i reach out to listeners and viewers i say look it's up to you
[2:55:55.260 --> 2:56:01.340]  if you contact national local media especially texas tv and radio and print and get them to go
[2:56:01.340 --> 2:56:05.980]  wait a minute you attack medina when beck said what do you think a 911 truth would you get rid
[2:56:05.980 --> 2:56:09.180]  of somebody in your campaign if you found out they were part of it she said well people have a
[2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:13.180]  right to their own opinion in america that's nothing compared to the democrat candidate who said it
[2:56:13.180 --> 2:56:18.940]  could be an inside job that's his right to say and i agree with him but meanwhile palin saying oh
[2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:25.260]  yes i want a new investigation of it and this is the darling of these people i mean he says palin
[2:56:25.980 --> 2:56:30.380]  according to beck shouldn't be allowed to be near the president she might try to kill obama
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:36.540]  because he says it on last night's show that a week ago and on his tv program that 911 truthers
[2:56:36.540 --> 2:56:42.380]  want to kill obama with no evidence i mean this is insane and they're setting that false flag up i
[2:56:42.380 --> 2:56:47.180]  saw more articles today where biden's worried about terrorist attacking and all this stuff
[2:56:48.460 --> 2:56:54.060]  breaking sarah palin 911 truth or controversy makes hypocritical in beck if you get this out

[2:57:14.540 --> 2:57:19.980]  saying they were with medina this is a carl rove operation i was already telling my writers this
[2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:24.540]  yesterday i was sure of it i saw beck getting positioned the last month to go after they're
[2:57:24.540 --> 2:57:31.420]  running three neocons s t party people against ron paul and then i get the incredible high powered
[2:57:31.420 --> 2:57:36.780]  phone call last night missed it connected this morning i won't say they're a media pundit i won't
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:41.980]  say they're a high powered politician i won't say who they are i won't say they're male or female
[2:57:42.540 --> 2:57:47.100]  but they were at an event with perry in the green room with several high powered people
[2:57:47.660 --> 2:57:52.220]  and he talked directly to perry and who did perry talk about as the big enemy and who's
[2:57:52.220 --> 2:58:01.420]  quote under his skin three names in this order deborah medina alex jones ron paul why because

[2:58:55.580 --> 2:58:59.900]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:58:59.900 --> 2:59:04.940]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:10.540]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:59:10.540 --> 2:59:15.660]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.660 --> 2:59:20.940]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[2:59:20.940 --> 2:59:25.580]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:59:25.580 --> 2:59:30.940]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[2:59:30.940 --> 2:59:35.340]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[3:00:17.900 --> 3:00:25.500]  i made a video last night it was posted in the early morning hours titled sarah palin 9-1-1
[3:00:25.500 --> 3:00:30.380]  truther controversy explodes that erin dykes put together stayed up from 2 30 in the morning
[3:00:30.380 --> 3:00:37.740]  to get it done it is going viral right now it is posted at the alex jones youtube channel
[3:00:38.940 --> 3:00:44.860]  it is posted in the article titled sarah palin 9-11 truther controversy makes hypocrite of glenn
[3:00:44.860 --> 3:00:51.900]  beck we need this to have 100 000 views by tomorrow we need you to send it out to everyone you know
[3:00:51.900 --> 3:00:56.540]  now a few of the troll commenters in there are saying why is alex saying this potentially could
[3:00:56.540 --> 3:01:02.380]  be one of the most important stories he's ever covered well let me see i said back in january
[3:01:02.380 --> 3:01:09.900]  when we got secret government documents from the bureau of cemeteries in new york state
[3:01:09.900 --> 3:01:15.740]  and had emergency manager on from indiana and other key witnesses that the feds were saying
[3:01:15.740 --> 3:01:21.660]  the flu is coming millions will die get ready for martial law now i came on air and i said i
[3:01:21.660 --> 3:01:25.260]  don't know if martial law is going to happen but they're certainly gearing up for it and saying
[3:01:25.260 --> 3:01:30.860]  they're going to use flu to do it and then it came out we discredited it they backed off they
[3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:37.820]  tried forced inoculation in new york and massachusetts that's martial law you know texas monthly
[3:01:37.820 --> 3:01:43.260]  had has an article saying jones said we'd be under martial law no i didn't no i didn't
[3:01:45.260 --> 3:01:50.140]  i said that they were going to try it and i said months before they launched that operation
[3:01:52.140 --> 3:01:56.540]  that's why i said that could be one of the most important stories we only have a few of these a
[3:01:56.540 --> 3:02:04.220]  year i told you when climate gate broke we were the first to slam it out there that this could
[3:02:04.220 --> 3:02:09.100]  devastate them that this could bring them down that this could expose their entire agenda because
[3:02:09.100 --> 3:02:15.100]  it's the heart of their takeover now look what it's done and look it doesn't take a rocket scientist
[3:02:15.100 --> 3:02:20.700]  to know this but these disinfo operatives don't want people reading these articles and watching
[3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:26.220]  these videos to know that when i tell you something has the potential to annihilate the new world
[3:02:26.220 --> 3:02:33.500]  order or to bring us a big step closer to that point that i don't just say that for hype now in
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:39.100]  case you don't understand some of you out there why this sarah palin 911 truther comments are so big
[3:02:40.780 --> 3:02:45.660]  glenn beck has spent the last two nights tacking deborah medina as the number one enemy and
[3:02:45.660 --> 3:02:50.460]  saying she's a dangerous infiltrator and must be stopped he spent all last week doing it too
[3:02:51.500 --> 3:02:56.620]  chris mathews did it following the exact same talking points last night guess what bill o'reilly
[3:02:56.620 --> 3:03:05.340]  bill o'reilly led his show with this this this is big you don't understand political strategy
[3:03:05.340 --> 3:03:12.460]  you don't know how these people work they know it's key rick perry's talking about how i am in
[3:03:12.460 --> 3:03:19.340]  his top three enemies i'm on the white house enemies list because i've studied this i know how it works
[3:03:19.340 --> 3:03:27.740]  works okay this is important but if the trolls and people have their way it won't be important
[3:03:27.740 --> 3:03:34.780]  it'll get glazed over we've got 48 hours before they clamp down on this story to get it out there
[3:03:34.780 --> 3:03:40.940]  we're sneak attacking them right now if deborah medina gets elected if she wins the primary she'll
[3:03:40.940 --> 3:03:45.820]  beat the democrats hand down just her getting this many percentage points is already making
[3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:51.340]  everybody file around the country on a ron paul true constitutional type bandwagon it's already
[3:03:51.340 --> 3:03:55.340]  devastating them it'll take time though these things don't happen in five minutes like you
[3:03:55.340 --> 3:04:01.020]  pull up and get a mcdonald's happy meal instantly it's like force 10 from navarone when they blow
[3:04:01.020 --> 3:04:08.780]  up the dam it takes 10 minutes for it to start cracking okay now you see climate gate the whole
[3:04:08.780 --> 3:04:14.860]  dam's collapsing we got other dams to blow here i'm in there with the explosives in the info war
[3:04:14.860 --> 3:04:22.220]  i know it'll bring them down you understand that i know what i'm talking about now
[3:04:24.460 --> 3:04:30.300]  the reason it's so important is not just that sarah palin made some 911 truth comments
[3:04:30.300 --> 3:04:35.820]  but that they are demonizing medina with that and if we go away a minute sarah palin saying it
[3:04:35.820 --> 3:04:42.140]  it will reverse itself and make people pile on even more to deborah medina while hurting the fake
[3:04:42.140 --> 3:04:50.700]  neocon glenbeck sean hannity sarah palin bill o'reilly bill o'reilly that says raising taxes is good
[3:04:51.420 --> 3:05:00.300]  nafta and gatter good um global warming is real i mean if these are conservatives i mean
[3:05:00.300 --> 3:05:06.860]  i guess stalin was then i guess mal i guess shea guavara is i mean why don't you conservatives
[3:05:06.860 --> 3:05:10.940]  out there you mainline idiot i've seen the glenbeck crowds at his little theater events
[3:05:10.940 --> 3:05:16.140]  talk about a soft group of ninny cowards those aren't conservatives those are idiots glenbeck's
[3:05:16.140 --> 3:05:22.460]  designed for soft weak pathetic people to follow him everything he does folks i i saw his tv show

[3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:24.140]  i was ranting so hard they forgot to go to break hey put that texas monthly cover story back up
[3:08:24.140 --> 3:08:31.500]  look at this it says the swine flu vaccines will lead to marshal law that's coming out
[3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:36.860]  of a speaker in the city ceiling no if it was accurate it would say jones three months before
[3:08:36.860 --> 3:08:42.540]  the flu showed up in mexico in the wrong season in the wrong hemisphere and then top scientist
[3:08:42.540 --> 3:08:47.260]  said it was manufactured said the government is telling police departments there's going to be
[3:08:47.260 --> 3:08:54.620]  marshal law and cemeteries that are under state regulations in major states and i gave you and
[3:08:54.620 --> 3:09:01.340]  posted the actual interviews with the emergency managers and people and what was erin dykes
[3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:06.300]  article uh preparation for mass graves confirmed pull it up for people erin dykes
[3:09:08.220 --> 3:09:14.780]  i mean pull that article up bureau of cemeteries with the names and phone numbers and i said i
[3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:21.180]  don't know if they're going to kill millions but they've killed millions of iraqis who knows what
[3:09:21.180 --> 3:09:28.380]  they'll do and so we were ahead of it that's why they hate us because when the police are being
[3:09:28.380 --> 3:09:34.620]  told get ready for marshal law for flu we take it serious but no texas monthly says that i said
[3:09:34.620 --> 3:09:38.540]  we were going to have marshal law this is the predictable stuff i haven't read the whole article
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:44.540]  yet it's flattering in some ways it doesn't say i'm an evil person they admit that i really believe
[3:09:44.540 --> 3:09:51.180]  this and i'm right about some things but you know they try to go on and say but alex jones saying uh
[3:09:51.180 --> 3:09:59.980]  that the eugenics movement today or the environmental movement today or planned parenthood of today
[3:10:02.300 --> 3:10:07.180]  even though you know they were involved in eugenics 50 60 years ago that's like saying the democratic
[3:10:07.180 --> 3:10:12.140]  party today is involved with the kuklux klan because the kuklux klan with the leaders of the
[3:10:12.140 --> 3:10:19.180]  democratic party in the 1860s well no actually robert bird was a grand dragon he's a democrat
[3:10:19.180 --> 3:10:26.380]  senator right now no i'm talking about books written by the white house science are calling
[3:10:26.380 --> 3:10:31.900]  for exterminating the population we just had a state rep on who was fully aware of it and went
[3:10:31.900 --> 3:10:38.380]  to school with these people we're talking about current statements like two months ago at copenhagen
[3:10:38.380 --> 3:10:43.260]  when the un called for a global one-child policy that was in the associated press
[3:10:46.220 --> 3:10:52.140]  it's just all baloney because they can't believe this is happening in fact the
[3:10:52.140 --> 3:10:55.740]  article opens up with alex jones says the whole global warming movements of fraud
[3:10:55.740 --> 3:11:05.740]  he did that interview before climate gate oh man look
[3:11:07.580 --> 3:11:11.740]  nate blakesley that wrote the texas monthly article
[3:11:13.740 --> 3:11:19.340]  really broke and drove the tulia story about police plant and drugs on folks and i interviewed him
[3:11:19.340 --> 3:11:24.300]  years ago and he uh he wrote positive articles about ron paul like the elephant in the room
[3:11:24.300 --> 3:11:29.020]  how he's the only real republican so he's not a bad guy he just he just doesn't know
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:34.620]  it's like his wife works for city of austin water supply at least according to i never asked him
[3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:41.260]  about it but i saw it on our own blog um i saw a newspaper interview he did actually talking about
[3:11:41.260 --> 3:11:50.220]  her and he didn't believe me that 90 plus percent of the epa scientist had written an open letter
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:55.420]  twice to from their union saying we didn't know fluoride was hundreds of deadly chemicals they
[3:11:55.420 --> 3:11:59.500]  just call fluoride and the type of fluoride you're putting in precipitates out in the body and
[3:11:59.500 --> 3:12:04.060]  causes cancer he didn't believe all that so actually sent it to him and he called up and said wow this
[3:12:04.060 --> 3:12:10.540]  is actually true i didn't know that i i guess his water treatment wastewater wife doesn't know that
[3:12:11.260 --> 3:12:16.460]  maybe she's the 10 percent of you know people in this business that don't know about it
[3:12:16.460 --> 3:12:24.220]  that they just don't know they they just don't understand how real all this is all right i'm
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:30.060]  digressing i said i was going to go to your phone calls i was ranting intensely let me
[3:12:30.060 --> 3:12:34.620]  spell it out to people at a third grade level not not that my audience is done the general
[3:12:34.620 --> 3:12:38.860]  listeners smarter than i am i've really found that i don't have some high and mighty view of
[3:12:38.860 --> 3:12:47.420]  myself but studying this i have gotten a few uh understandings that people don't have
[3:12:47.420 --> 3:12:52.620]  if they're trying to kill the deborah medina campaign for her saying i support people's
[3:12:52.620 --> 3:12:58.380]  right to have whatever view they want about 9 11 the average poll in the us over 50 percent
[3:12:58.380 --> 3:13:05.660]  believe it's an inside job six of the 10 9 11 commissioners say it's a cover up one
[3:13:05.660 --> 3:13:10.540]  new investigation i mean and then oh my god this woman last night we have a video clip
[3:13:10.540 --> 3:13:15.420]  up in the article about this sarah pale and 911 truth or controversy makes hypocritical and back
[3:13:15.420 --> 3:13:19.260]  we have the clip it's eight and a half minutes long i may play part of it later by of time
[3:13:19.260 --> 3:13:23.740]  i just have to i i can't play back without stopping and countering him because everything
[3:13:23.740 --> 3:13:27.660]  is a distortion or lie i've never seen someone that lies this much it's like everything that
[3:13:27.660 --> 3:13:34.060]  comes out of his mouth is a distortion the first thing he does is says the new york times
[3:13:34.060 --> 3:13:37.340]  has written a vicious hit piece against the tea parties saying they're violent
[3:13:39.580 --> 3:13:44.060]  and he goes oh i thought you said they were a bunch of pathetic geriatrics on walkers
[3:13:45.100 --> 3:13:48.540]  and he makes the point of they have hundreds of thousands of people at some of these rallies and
[3:13:48.540 --> 3:13:53.660]  not one window gets busted out so he endears the tea party i'm defending you against the new york
[3:13:53.660 --> 3:14:00.860]  times and then he goes there's only 10 of people in the country that believe in 9 11 truth that's
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:06.220]  five percent half the 10 percent the other five percent are birthers these 10 percent the right
[3:14:06.220 --> 3:14:15.740]  and left are dangerous and bad and infiltrators and want to kill the president he knows that in
[3:14:15.740 --> 3:14:20.860]  major polls over 60 percent of registered republicans question the birth certificate issue he knows
[3:14:20.860 --> 3:14:27.740]  in polls it's well over 50 percent on average summer 84 summer 36 but over 50 on average he knows
[3:14:27.740 --> 3:14:32.940]  that he lies and says five percent of the country or 9 11 truthers and five percent are birthers
[3:14:33.500 --> 3:14:39.500]  and he does this left right paradigm thing again well and then he says what we need to do is stop
[3:14:39.500 --> 3:14:45.340]  the birthers we need to stop the truthers we need to stop the dnc and the rnc and he does this
[3:14:45.340 --> 3:14:50.860]  criminal tell where he kind of when he says rnc the guy's completely run by roger ailes the former
[3:14:50.860 --> 3:14:58.540]  head rnc strategist that run i mean it's just ridiculous let it's all lies i i was watching
[3:14:58.540 --> 3:15:03.820]  it last night the youtube and i was stopping at every five seconds just digesting it was
[3:15:04.380 --> 3:15:08.780]  everything was lies except for the very first thing he said about the new york times it was all
[3:15:08.780 --> 3:15:17.500]  true he spent 30 seconds maybe a minute on truth that's a worm on a hook you know that's a real
[3:15:17.500 --> 3:15:23.500]  worm a bass could live off that that's good for the bass's tummy we're the bass he threads the hook
[3:15:24.060 --> 3:15:32.780]  gets that plump nightcrawler on there drops it into us but 90 percent of it was lies after that
[3:15:32.780 --> 3:15:38.940]  that's the hook and the string and the rod and the reel and the new world order on the other end of
[3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:53.500]  it bringing in old glen back bringing in glen back bringing in all the slaves bringing them in glen
[3:15:53.500 --> 3:16:08.540]  back and usually by the fourth hour i get kind of scatter braid it's just how can bill o'reilly be
[3:16:08.540 --> 3:16:14.540]  calling for value added taxes and sales taxes to pay the bankers how can they be saying global
[3:16:14.540 --> 3:16:24.940]  warming is real palin o'reilly mccain how can bec be supporting all the different bailouts
[3:16:26.220 --> 3:16:31.900]  he'll have ron paul on and 10 minutes after make fun of him and call him a kook over and over again
[3:16:33.340 --> 3:16:38.940]  i hate chris matthews he's a scumbag a poverty pimp he creates racism he creates division
[3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:43.900]  but at least that scumbag is consistent no he lies a lot
[3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:51.420]  but beck well but but but now matthews is so scared the establishment so scared
[3:16:51.420 --> 3:16:57.020]  matthews was word for word watson has a new article out on this what beck said last night
[3:16:58.540 --> 3:17:03.020]  doesn't matthews come on at the same time as beck look that up i mean they're on the same time
[3:17:03.020 --> 3:17:09.020]  they're on the same time with the same attack on deborah medina
[3:17:12.140 --> 3:17:16.780]  a rally in matthews come on at the same time so you've got all three of these guys the same night
[3:17:17.420 --> 3:17:25.820]  leading with attacks on deborah medina what else don't you people need to get we're in a fight
[3:17:25.820 --> 3:17:33.100]  with these people over the states over one of our best most positive avenues for a solution
[3:17:35.740 --> 3:17:41.580]  we can take our state houses back it's already starting to happen we've got to take them back
[3:17:41.580 --> 3:17:50.940]  even faster and so if we can show that they're hypocrites and that they only made a big deal
[3:17:50.940 --> 3:17:57.900]  out of deborah medina's mild 9 11 truth statement mild compared to sarah palin mild compared to the
[3:17:57.900 --> 3:18:04.060]  democrat candidate what's his name i've trouble pronounce i have to have it in front of me
[3:18:05.340 --> 3:18:11.100]  the palestinian american running as the democrat the bit for rukh shami the democrat seems like a
[3:18:11.100 --> 3:18:16.220]  pretty nice guy the point is is he's a gun grabber and for big governments but he may be a nice guy
[3:18:16.220 --> 3:18:21.020]  but stay the hell away from me pal stay away from my guns my land not your property but
[3:18:21.980 --> 3:18:24.140]  i'm gonna be a little bit nicer here i just can't handle anymore
[3:18:26.940 --> 3:18:31.820]  you have a jewel like deborah medina she's just a figurehead though a great lady smart
[3:18:31.820 --> 3:18:36.140]  but a figurehead for all of us just like ron paul said he's a figurehead or a focal point
[3:18:36.140 --> 3:18:43.580]  for our anger and what we understand and what's going on so if you can point out that sarah
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:49.740]  palin said more 9 11 truth and she's beck and perry's darling and throw that back in their
[3:18:49.740 --> 3:18:54.380]  face the media though it's somewhat controlled they won't get their orders quick enough if it
[3:18:54.380 --> 3:18:59.900]  gets out in the next two days if they don't get their orders to not cover it this will blow up
[3:18:59.900 --> 3:19:06.620]  do we have the power to counter the disinfo of beck to throw this back in his face can we do that
[3:19:06.620 --> 3:19:12.380]  and then leave the charge for states rights if we lose this round we get smarter each time
[3:19:12.380 --> 3:19:16.380]  she got a lot of points a lot of people are running now because of her success around the
[3:19:16.380 --> 3:19:21.820]  country it's still a win but it's just like i told you back in november with the climate

[3:27:53.900 --> 3:28:01.340]  already losing this will be a major victory they are running scared that's why it's so important
[3:28:01.340 --> 3:28:08.940]  to show that sarah palin said more nine eleven truth than madina because they're using the attack on
[3:28:08.940 --> 3:28:15.260]  nine eleven truth to get at her i mean i mean do you agree with me that this is devastating

[3:33:22.300 --> 3:33:30.780]  specifically do people realize the magnitude of all of the major talk show host not just on fox
[3:33:30.780 --> 3:33:36.220]  but on msnbc we're getting more videos sent to us by the hour of the other shows all attacking
[3:33:36.220 --> 3:33:42.060]  never madina saying do not vote for she can't win she's a coke she's bad she was asked will you
[3:33:42.060 --> 3:33:46.060]  fire an employee of their 911 truther she said well people have a right to their own opinion
[3:33:46.940 --> 3:33:52.380]  but you know uh i don't think it was an inside job she doesn't have to totally agree with me
[3:33:52.380 --> 3:33:57.020]  she wants to cut taxes she wants to control our border she wants to get rid of the unconstitutional
[3:33:57.020 --> 3:34:04.940]  gun laws and nullify federal laws she has the most mild statement compared to sarah palin
[3:34:04.940 --> 3:34:09.580]  or the democrat governor candidate and they go crazy and make a big deal out of nothing
[3:34:09.580 --> 3:34:16.300]  like howard dean's roar not that i'm saying howard dean was good but he was kind of the
[3:34:16.300 --> 3:34:22.060]  outside of candidates so they made a big much do about nothing thing about him so that the ringer
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:30.140]  or george w bush's cousin john carrey could take a dive and he clearly did win so did al gore i'm
[3:34:30.140 --> 3:34:33.820]  not saying it would be good if they got elected the point is who the establishment wants gets
[3:34:33.820 --> 3:34:38.140]  elected john mccain and sarah palin were ringers so i'm going to go to your calls here in just a
[3:34:38.140 --> 3:34:42.860]  moment one eight hundred two five at nine ninety two thirty one do you realize how important all
[3:34:42.860 --> 3:34:48.940]  of this is and the fact that they're now saying that oh we better not vote for ever madina because
[3:34:48.940 --> 3:34:53.900]  the nine eleven truth statement how this will blow up in their face if you get it out to everyone
[3:34:53.900 --> 3:34:59.420]  it's at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right now and so are the videos breaking it down get it
[3:34:59.420 --> 3:35:03.900]  out to everyone i could do it right now i could call the statesman on air i could call ki and
[3:35:03.900 --> 3:35:08.220]  austin for you and show you how it's i mean it's easy call them say i want your email did you know
[3:35:08.220 --> 3:35:12.540]  that sarah palin made nine eleven truth comments and it was no big deal that people are demonizing
[3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:18.220]  madina isn't that a big story that the big advisor and big supporter of perry is supposedly a nine
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:27.900]  eleven truther by the yardstick that glenn beck uses they will run with it i'll be surprised if it
[3:35:27.900 --> 3:35:34.780]  isn't in the news by tomorrow if you do your job i've done mine please take action i'm going to your
[3:35:34.780 --> 3:35:39.340]  calls in t minus five minutes i wanted to bring ted anderson up because gold is run up again today
[3:35:40.220 --> 3:35:44.780]  it was one thousand fifty a week ago it's one thousand twenty something one thousand one hundred
[3:35:44.780 --> 3:35:50.380]  and twenty so it's up over seventy dollars right now and ted has a deal his deals just get better
[3:35:50.380 --> 3:35:55.900]  and better he's so competitive he's never offered this before until about a month ago here you get
[3:35:55.900 --> 3:36:02.380]  a frank at the one thousand fifty level when it's at one thousand one hundred and one thousand one
[3:36:02.380 --> 3:36:08.940]  hundred and twenty right now announced and then you get a hundred and fifty nine dollar free yearly
[3:36:08.940 --> 3:36:13.900]  newsletter either digital twice a week or hard copy what is it twice a month mail to your door
[3:36:13.900 --> 3:36:19.660]  the international forecaster it's 20 30 40 50 60 70 pages thick it's always different but it's always
[3:36:19.660 --> 3:36:25.740]  beefy you may know all about the new world order but bob Chapman's got some key info on the economy
[3:36:25.740 --> 3:36:32.700]  and it's a great way to wake people up you can get that free ordering one frank the deal on the
[3:36:32.700 --> 3:36:37.260]  frank is already insanely good but but ted before we get people the number and tell them how
[3:36:37.260 --> 3:36:41.100]  they can get that some of the golden silver offers today that also support this network
[3:36:41.100 --> 3:36:45.740]  on the tiny profit you make on these type of deals yes there's really no profit in this one
[3:36:46.780 --> 3:36:53.340]  it's a lost leader what do you think about the medina situation and the sarah palan situation
[3:36:53.340 --> 3:37:02.140]  and the neocons internally ted actually knows who the source is um saying that i am the number one
[3:37:02.140 --> 3:37:09.020]  enemy in texas along with ron paul and medina i can tell you right now alex what beck did the
[3:37:09.020 --> 3:37:15.340]  medina you know looks like child's play as far as i'm concerned i mean uh medina is a
[3:37:16.140 --> 3:37:21.660]  credible source and i think that's where the fear is here is that medina has a real shot at knocking
[3:37:21.660 --> 3:37:27.100]  parry off you know i i don't know if parry is going to have a lot of uh you know what kind of
[3:37:27.100 --> 3:37:32.540]  fight he's going to have with the democrat candidate but medina actually is offering the people the
[3:37:32.540 --> 3:37:37.900]  state of texas what they want and and they've been wanting this for so long they're so they're so
[3:37:37.900 --> 3:37:42.540]  thirsty for it that they're willing to go just about anywhere for it and it's your listening
[3:37:42.540 --> 3:37:49.900]  audience and you alex jones who happens to be the one they the the the uh uh cry in the foot of
[3:37:49.900 --> 3:37:56.300]  parry he is being hammered by your listeners and when you say something people follow it and do
[3:37:56.300 --> 3:38:03.500]  and thank god they do because the state of texas has the uh you know that the the option of possibly
[3:38:03.500 --> 3:38:08.780]  having some real politicians i mean thank god you have ron paul down there if you get deba
[3:38:08.780 --> 3:38:14.300]  medina ron paul in the same state man that's a power to reckon with as ted ted i don't know
[3:38:14.300 --> 3:38:18.300]  how much you want to say but this high powered not going to say government official not going to say
[3:38:18.300 --> 3:38:23.820]  media but it's a household name they tried to get ahold of me yesterday they got ahold of you
[3:38:24.860 --> 3:38:31.580]  and then i've made the connection today but i mean when i have the story written by watson
[3:38:31.580 --> 3:38:39.260]  about this super high powered person in a private meeting with with perry and he's worried he's
[3:38:39.260 --> 3:38:46.380]  saying alex jones deba medina ron paul i mean the rnc neo cons are scared to death of us because
[3:38:46.380 --> 3:38:52.380]  this has a national import i mean we are the main enemies on their radar you sure are you're you
[3:38:52.380 --> 3:38:59.340]  were named specifically as being one of the influences that could lose perry his seat as the
[3:38:59.340 --> 3:39:06.540]  governor of texas and i don't know how or how much better of a compliment that you could have
[3:39:06.540 --> 3:39:12.700]  but then to have perry himself out of his own lips say this and that's where it came from this is
[3:39:12.700 --> 3:39:19.420]  perry's words and i can tell you right now alex they're keeping a close eye on you and uh and i
[3:39:19.420 --> 3:39:24.220]  supposedly darn well should be because you're speaking the truth and you're giving the people
[3:39:24.220 --> 3:39:32.060]  what they want and that's let me add something here um my well i'm not going to tell the whole
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:36.860]  story but there's a lot of high power political people here in austin and i talked to one of
[3:39:36.860 --> 3:39:42.860]  these old ladies who's a family friend of my dad who it was actually in the paper they were having
[3:39:42.860 --> 3:39:47.900]  this little impromptu meeting with less than 30 women with bill clinton three years ago in austin
[3:39:47.900 --> 3:39:53.980]  spends a lot of time here he actually ran some campaigns in texas before he was governor and
[3:39:53.980 --> 3:40:00.380]  they said what do you think of alex jones of info wars and bill clinton said he's one of the most
[3:40:00.380 --> 3:40:06.860]  important people in the media in the world specifically about alex jones the conspiracy
[3:40:06.860 --> 3:40:11.340]  theorist now why is bill clinton privately to high power democrats saying i'm one of the most
[3:40:11.340 --> 3:40:15.980]  important people in the media in the world three years ago why is rick perry saying republicans
[3:40:15.980 --> 3:40:20.460]  are worried we got to get these people deborah medina ron paul alex jones not just about his
[3:40:20.460 --> 3:40:27.980]  campaign but overall because and again i'm not bragging about this folks it's scary and i'm not
[3:40:27.980 --> 3:40:35.260]  perfect the point is we are real people resonate with it and i don't think listeners understand
[3:40:35.260 --> 3:40:41.580]  we don't hype up how many people we really reach i mean ted it's scary i can get off a plane in
[3:40:41.580 --> 3:40:50.300]  england in canada uh in uh roatan central america and i can't walk 30 feet now without people running
[3:40:50.300 --> 3:40:57.420]  out of shops up to me i mean we're much bigger than glenn bett globally not in the us but it's
[3:40:57.420 --> 3:41:03.100]  all grassroots because ted it's incredible what we've built here and i hope they don't kill me
[3:41:03.100 --> 3:41:07.500]  or set me up because carl rove is a dangerous person well you're you're right about that
[3:41:08.060 --> 3:41:12.060]  and and and so you're gonna have to watch your back and so is you know we're all gonna have to
[3:41:12.060 --> 3:41:17.020]  watch your back but i mean that's the main thing alex is that we are reaching a lot of people
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:22.460]  and you look at the traffic of info wars dot com or prison planet dot com and you compare it to
[3:41:22.460 --> 3:41:29.020]  even rush limbaugh dot com and and they're dwarfed by you i mean i was trying to get you on oh boy i
[3:41:29.020 --> 3:41:35.900]  tell you salem radio network they have a lot of 50 000 watt stations and here i am trying to pay
[3:41:35.900 --> 3:41:41.980]  them money so they pick up your sunday show so we can get into more markets and have a bigger effect
[3:41:41.980 --> 3:41:49.020]  and the response to me from them was as they said well we don't like alex's position on 9 11
[3:41:49.020 --> 3:41:55.020]  and i just i wrote him back i said you have got to be kidding me you know that is something that
[3:41:55.020 --> 3:42:01.260]  happened way back then and all you're doing is questioning the findings of the 9 11 commission
[3:42:01.260 --> 3:42:06.060]  and that's enough for them to keep them to keep you off of their station well i've been called
[3:42:06.060 --> 3:42:12.540]  over the years and had meetings with many of the top radio executives in the country and they all
[3:42:12.540 --> 3:42:16.780]  i mean they told me 10 years ago they said you'll be bigger than limbaugh they wanted to groom me
[3:42:17.340 --> 3:42:22.940]  to be the new glen back and i said no way and they said no more fellow reserve no more new
[3:42:22.940 --> 3:42:27.900]  world order no more black helicopters now it's no more 9 11 look i've been told and it's done in
[3:42:27.900 --> 3:42:32.780]  confidence so i don't talk about it that's how you keep sources i've been told recant on this
[3:42:32.780 --> 3:42:38.620]  and i'll get a 50 million dollar contract no i will do it my way until the truth but then it's bad
[3:42:38.620 --> 3:42:46.380]  if i drive a you know a a a decent dodge car or live in a house that's safe you know again again
[3:42:46.940 --> 3:42:52.540]  again i own things things don't own me and i'm doing it my way telling the truth just like you
[3:42:52.540 --> 3:42:55.500]  are teb but i want to go to the calls i'm not going to keep any more ted tell people the
[3:42:55.500 --> 3:43:01.500]  gold offer given the number well like you said the frank is the very best thing at 249 61 because
[3:43:01.500 --> 3:43:07.340]  i'm buying a full year subscription to bob's newsletter the international forecaster education
[3:43:07.340 --> 3:43:12.300]  is a the key factor here and that's why i'm doing it so i would suggest that you give us a call for
[3:43:12.300 --> 3:43:16.300]  that but we do have the british sovereign we have walking liberty halves we have the coordination
[3:43:16.300 --> 3:43:23.340]  rounds montana silver rounds we have a whole long line of stuff that i bought when gold was at $1,050
[3:43:23.340 --> 3:43:29.740]  an ounce and we've seen 1,125 today to give you an example of what's going on so if you're already

[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:50.700]  because that's what's making the difference it's not necessarily you it's not necessarily me
[3:43:50.700 --> 3:43:58.700]  it's the people behind us that make this work absolutely 800-686-2237 get the frank and then

[3:44:16.300 --> 3:44:19.100]  i based on some of the stuff i'm seeing i think they may need to

[3:45:02.460 --> 3:45:08.460]  benedict arnold if you go if you if you listen to his radio show that's all i mean everyone calling
[3:45:08.460 --> 3:45:12.380]  in is just going glenn beck you're a coward you know we know what you are we know what you did to
[3:45:12.380 --> 3:45:18.220]  medina uh i think that they're i think that their first little attack their first strike didn't work
[3:45:18.220 --> 3:45:24.780]  well well yeah yeah yeah i don't know i mean it it didn't work completely it's kind of like a glancing
[3:45:24.780 --> 3:45:30.780]  blow somebody with a sword tries to chop your head off and you kind of block with your shield but
[3:45:30.780 --> 3:45:35.180]  the sword hacks through the wood the shield and cuts into your arm i mean it wasn't good
[3:45:35.180 --> 3:45:41.100]  but if we point out that he's a hypocrite and that he set it up and spun it and that palin said even
[3:45:41.100 --> 3:45:47.180]  more it will destroy this goliath but the point about beck is yes i know he's in deep trouble
[3:45:47.180 --> 3:45:51.740]  that's because the power of this show and the power of ron paul and the power of texas and the
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:58.540]  rest of the country that's why they even brought in christ matthew's as their backup saying he was
[3:45:58.540 --> 3:46:05.340]  right see they're they're in panic mode not because if she gets elected as governor that's not even
[3:46:05.340 --> 3:46:11.020]  that powerful of a position in texas because we had some civil war corrupt governors that were in
[3:46:11.020 --> 3:46:15.580]  installs of the state week and the governorship but as a bully pulpit she'll be able to lead things
[3:46:15.580 --> 3:46:21.820]  through the legislature it's the message it sends to states rights people nationwide and getting ron
[3:46:21.820 --> 3:46:28.940]  paul type people to run and like george washington winning a battle at trinton it buoys morale uh
[3:46:28.940 --> 3:46:32.940]  but when you say they may have to come out you know that's like people saying give me your
[3:46:32.940 --> 3:46:39.820]  source on this or that ted got a call i got the call famous well-known person inside this whole
[3:46:39.820 --> 3:46:46.860]  thing and they told us what we already knew that as the manifestation uh but if our source is able
[3:46:46.860 --> 3:46:54.700]  to come out then you know someday they will and you know you lose sources if you tell people who
[3:46:54.700 --> 3:47:01.180]  your sources are but anything else uh blake no that's it thank you god bless you yeah we need
[3:47:01.180 --> 3:47:07.100]  a headline on that beck loses 500 000 viewers i mean i can't keep track of all this he's got

[3:48:10.220 --> 3:48:14.380]  lease and i just watched him and i was finding anything to help me understand what was going
[3:48:14.380 --> 3:48:19.340]  on and then i saw the obama deception and that changed pretty much everything for me and that's
[3:48:19.340 --> 3:48:25.980]  what we're here for to expose puppets obama beck any of them well here's the deal i noticed you

[3:49:20.620 --> 3:49:30.140]  which i am one the best sources of news is uh joel scousen ken bauer and jack bennett but glenn
[3:49:30.140 --> 3:49:36.060]  beck's got and and scousen uh who's a relative of the guy that wrote the what the naked capitalist
[3:49:36.060 --> 3:49:41.260]  or the naked communist uh you know he he's spoken out against beck as a wolf in sheep's clothing
[3:49:41.260 --> 3:49:47.740]  yes definitely he was here in um he lives in oram utah i live in spanish forks south of him
[3:49:47.740 --> 3:49:53.980]  but the situation is that he was trying to get the uh the campaign of ron paul up here in utah
[3:49:53.980 --> 3:49:59.020]  and it was quite hard with the desert news and all of our media but i just want to tell him

[3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:24.140]  go ahead i think at this at this point um uh there should be some coordination between
[3:50:24.140 --> 3:50:30.300]  that you depth dr stanley monti and others to uh do interviews as much as you can with uh
[3:50:30.300 --> 3:50:35.500]  medina uh pale and those people that well i mean i mean i mean medina loves me and
[3:50:36.140 --> 3:50:39.660]  thinks i'm great i would have her on more her campaign people rather put her on an internet
[3:50:39.660 --> 3:50:44.300]  show with five listeners and maybe that's a good strategy but she is going to be on sunday
[3:50:44.300 --> 3:50:48.380]  in between some things she's doing we we would have her on more we're we're here supporting her as
[3:50:48.380 --> 3:50:55.660]  much as we can believe me uh but uh i'll come back let you finish up your statement on the other side
