[00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:06.235]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:08.016]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.777]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:11.357]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:12.258]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:17.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.141]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:40.117]  Ladies and gentlemen, news is breaking so fast on so many fronts.
[00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:47.059]  This is a radio broadcast that you do not want to miss today.
[00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.861]  I have been more excited coming into work for the radio broadcast than I have been in months since ClimateGate.
[00:00:55.669 --> 00:01:05.959]  It is Wednesday, the 17th day of February 2010, and we're going to be live here today for the next four hours, 11 a.m.
[00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.140]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.323]  Central Standard Time.
[00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.767]  There is so much going on.
[00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.349]  Number one, breaking, Sarah Palin, 9-11 truther.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.641]  Controversy makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.783]  Up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:28.363]  Why is this so important?
[00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:32.245]  You've got the Democrat candidate going further saying no one knows what really happened.
[00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.725]  It's a very dangerous subject.
[00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:35.406]  We don't even know who killed Kennedy.
[00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:37.566]  Basically saying the government.
[00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.327]  They ignore that.
[00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:46.630]  You have Beck turning off Debra Medina's audio so she couldn't hear what he was saying and she said, well people have a right to their opinions.
[00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:52.902]  KLF Radio, Dallas Morning News, you name it, are reporting what we told you last week.
[00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:57.426]  That was an inside job.
[00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:03.531]  A setup run by Karl Rove, whose apprentice is George W. Bush and Rick Perry.
[00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.454]  That's the guy calling the shots here.
[00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:19.823]  Because if Debra Medina can get elected, that will mean that all the other states that are declaring Tenth Amendment states' rights will get other governors and legislators elected, and the New World Order is stopped dead.
[00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:22.826]  We have the people, we have the Constitution on our side.
[00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:28.952]  The Republican Party is trying to manage the constitutionalist rebellion
[00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.343]  Against the globalists.
[00:02:32.343 --> 00:02:35.204]  Time Magazine calls them the Tenthers.
[00:02:35.204 --> 00:02:36.505]  And we are the Tenthers.
[00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.766]  The Tenth Amendment is what we stand on.
[00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.827]  That and the First and Second Amendment as well.
[00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.808]  The Fourth, the Fifth, they're all gold.
[00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:45.728]  That's who we are.
[00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:48.329]  We're the real Americans.
[00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:57.712]  And so, I told you two weeks ago, on the day of the Super Bowl, when they sent Palin and others to town to push for people to elect Rick Perry,
[00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:11.431]  That the RNC was in here ensuring that Debra Medina couldn't get elected because she was gaining five points a week.
[00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:15.173]  I'm gonna break it all down today.
[00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:28.280]  But if we get this on local TV and radio and newspapers and point out that Palin said more and called for a new 9-11 investigation, said more than even Debra Medina did, it will blow up in their face massively.
[00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:34.617]  And she has an even better shot of winning in this primary or at least getting into the runoff.
[00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:37.318]  And the Democrats, there's no way they're going to win.
[00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:51.946]  Whoever gets this Republican nomination, whoever wins the primary for the Republican governorship in the primary, early voting starts tomorrow, election coming up early next month,
[00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:58.800]  They will be the governor of Texas, and if Debra Medina can get elected, that will send the message nationwide.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.762]  Already her getting 25 points in the poll in a three-way race.
[00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:09.645]  Now overtaking Kay Bailey, Bilderberg, Graeme Hutchinson, and on the heels of Perry, is already sending shockwaves.
[00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.386]  They're panicking now.
[00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:19.749]  Even more incredible, and this is the top story on PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.652]  This comes directly from the ultimate insider.
[00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:32.436]  I can't say if it's a he or a she, but in the future we'll be able to disclose it.
[00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:37.879]  The ultimate insider.
[00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:49.686]  In the green room with Rick Perry, what he had to say about the three number one enemies of the neocons trying to control the constitutionalist revolution in America through the Republican Party.
[00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:56.872]  The three main enemies are listed right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:56.872 --> 00:04:58.618]  Not just in Texas, nationwide.
[00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:05.969]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:14.832]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:19.453]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:30.276]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:40.419]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.861]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:53.344]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:56.085]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.056]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:09.301]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:10.704]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:14.108]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:20.494]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:25.558]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:35.668]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.129]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.710]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.171]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.292]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.292 --> 00:06:49.455]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:58.579]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:01.272]  Hello.
[00:07:01.272 --> 00:07:06.035]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:10.837]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:15.860]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.023]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.263]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:25.245]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:29.288]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:32.511]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:33.031]  Wow!
[00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:34.573]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:07:34.573 --> 00:07:35.794]  I was awestruck.
[00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:37.475]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:40.017]  This information can bless many people.
[00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:40.978]  Thank you again.
[00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:41.959]  Thanks again.
[00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:45.082]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:45.682]  Thank you.
[00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:49.105]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:52.688]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:07:52.688 --> 00:08:01.636]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:07.221]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:26.732]  There are so many angles, so many facets.
[00:08:26.732 --> 00:08:28.534]  What's happening is so exciting.
[00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:33.296]  Patriots for decades did their job.
[00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:40.501]  They exposed the true architecture of global power, the true power structure globally, the private central banks.
[00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:46.506]  The In the Fed bill has passed the House and is gaining more co-sponsors every few days in the Senate.
[00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:53.404]  Newspapers all over the world are admitting world government is here, run by criminal bankers.
[00:08:53.404 --> 00:09:02.446]  It's in mainstream news that Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of England are engineering the financial collapse right now in Europe, just a further feeding.
[00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:13.409]  The American people know we're going into a depression, that it's already here by every mainline economic indicator, but the media tells you the economy's great.
[00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:14.949]  The people know they're being looted.
[00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:17.760]  And so the Tea Parties form.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:25.885]  Libertarians, Constitutionalists, anti-war activists, Ron Paul type individuals.
[00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:32.749]  The Republicans with the lowest approval rating in their history leave office, Obama comes in, people find out he's a fraud overnight.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.742]  Now people are protesting and demonstrating everywhere.
[00:09:37.742 --> 00:09:40.885]  They're taking back their state houses.
[00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:44.127]  Incumbents, whether they're Republican or Democrat, are being routed.
[00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:51.112]  And the Republican Party, the neocon globalists that tripled the size of government, launched all these wars, passed the Patriot Act.
[00:09:51.112 --> 00:09:52.573]  They handed the ball off to Obama.
[00:09:52.573 --> 00:09:54.354]  He's continuing their whole agenda.
[00:09:54.354 --> 00:10:02.180]  They hope they can have these fake fights with Obama to make you think there's a real choice between the two when they're part of the same power structure.
[00:10:03.564 --> 00:10:14.007]  Now I know that's elementary for our general listeners, but I now want to break down the latest developments and what is happening here.
[00:10:14.007 --> 00:10:16.708]  They know you are awake.
[00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:27.310]  They know at Tea Parties 13 months ago in Texas and other parts of the country, Republican governors, senators, and congressmen and women were booed off the stage.
[00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.811]  So the media ran a hoax.
[00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:35.178]  MSNBC and others saying that the Tea Parties were Republican.
[00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:40.243]  Then the Republicans launched their fake Tea Party nation and tried to absorb it.
[00:10:42.352 --> 00:10:51.758]  But now, inside the Tea Parties, it's a great way to reach out to good, conservative, constitutional, libertarian Americans who didn't know the whole story.
[00:10:51.758 --> 00:10:55.800]  We're waking them up instead of them co-opting us.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.363]  Simultaneously last night, I told you the battle lines are drawn.
[00:10:59.363 --> 00:11:04.746]  That's why I've been identifying Beck and others, and O'Reilly and Hannity as key operatives and Sarah Palin.
[00:11:08.723 --> 00:11:21.597]  They're here to sabotage the states' rights revolution that is constitutional under the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:24.700]  They understand what is happening.
[00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:40.091]  And so they're coming in, in Utah, in Texas, in New York, in Florida, in Nevada, in Arizona, in California, in Michigan, in Indiana, every state, and they are running
[00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:51.482]  Tea Party twisted clones, neocons, pro-Patriot Act, pro-torture, pro-war, pro-big government, people against all the real patriots.
[00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:53.863]  Against Debra Medina, against Ron Paul.
[00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:55.864]  He's not even being challenged by the Democrats.
[00:11:55.864 --> 00:12:07.129]  The Republican Party is running three different fake Tea Partiers against Ron Paul and TV and radio is giving him all this airtime in Texas.
[00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:07.889]  Not gonna work though.
[00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:14.439]  And it's the same thing with Debra Medina.
[00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:30.568]  Now, for those that don't know the history of this, Karl Rove made the big time by handling George W. Bush, the addled former son of the President, who the President had no hopes for.
[00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:33.249]  He also was grooming another male cheerleader.
[00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:37.031]  All these guys, whether it's Trent Lott, Bush, Perry, they're male cheerleaders.
[00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.852]  They like to hang out with the old men and that's the stable they get them from.
[00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:48.495]  Always ninnying, prissy, fancy-dressed twits.
[00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:52.456]  Karl Rove, a consummate hardcore criminal on record.
[00:12:52.456 --> 00:13:04.162]  I mean, it's now been admitted and come out in court that Karl Rove set up the Alabama governor a few years ago, totally lied, used a con artist
[00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:14.877]  From inside the Capitol that they had already secretly begun to indict to go set the governor up, send him to prison just so he'd lose the election.
[00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:20.021]  I mean, they'll send governors to prison to win elections.
[00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:26.627]  These people are even nastier than Carville and he's bad.
[00:13:26.627 --> 00:13:28.288]  I mean, this is dirty politics.
[00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:33.452]  This is big, dirty trick machine central.
[00:13:35.925 --> 00:13:42.086]  And so, in 2000, when Bush got elected president, Perry came into the governorship, then he got elected.
[00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:45.447]  He's been in nine and a half years, the longest-serving Texas governor.
[00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:46.587]  He's about to get four more.
[00:13:46.587 --> 00:13:52.848]  That'll be 14 years total, when he serves out this term and gets the next one, if he does.
[00:13:52.848 --> 00:14:00.249]  This is a anti-gun, pro-open border guy that passed three new taxes, including the franchise tax.
[00:14:00.249 --> 00:14:03.130]  The business tax is really a state income tax, and they admit that.
[00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:09.662]  This is a guy who seized 8,000 miles of roads to give it to the Centra of Spain.
[00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:13.024]  Over $100 billion in the next 10 years alone is the money they'll make.
[00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:16.287]  They talk about $300 billion in the next 20.
[00:14:16.287 --> 00:14:25.013]  He's seizing the power plants, giving it, this is in major newspapers, giving it to indicted crooks in Europe that are members of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:29.516]  He bragged and told the Dallas Morning News he was going to Bilderberg, which violates the Logan Act.
[00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:31.358]  He wanted everybody to know he was an insider.
[00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.934]  Now these are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous people.
[00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:42.797]  Texas is the only viable state now, in every major study they've done.
[00:14:42.797 --> 00:14:45.460]  Everything else is going down.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:57.991]  Texas, because we got looted in the 80s worse than anybody, people pulled in their horns, real estate didn't go up as much as other areas of the country, people didn't go into as much debt, it's still in deep trouble.
[00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:02.332]  And this state has $25 million.
[00:15:02.332 --> 00:15:05.373]  It's on line in the next 7 years to surpass California.
[00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:07.534]  Everybody's fleeing California and coming here.
[00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:09.114]  Fleeing New York and coming here.
[00:15:09.114 --> 00:15:13.116]  Fleeing big government and coming here.
[00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:17.137]  And they need Texas to go down.
[00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:18.778]  To be sucked under.
[00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:20.478]  Like Greece.
[00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:26.280]  And so many other countries and sub-states like California was the 7th biggest economy in the world.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.621]  Texas is about to surpass it.
[00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:31.677]  They want to loot us!
[00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:34.459]  And so they need a fancy-talkin' West Texan.
[00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:37.401]  At least he isn't from Kennebunkport, Maine.
[00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:38.843]  I'm not saying Mainers are bad.
[00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:44.007]  It's just it's sick to watch Bush with that fake Texas accent.
[00:15:44.007 --> 00:15:45.668]  At least Perry's a fifth generation.
[00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:47.590]  I'm an eighth generation, pal.
[00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:55.857]  The whole point here is, is that we have this scumbag on the ropes.
[00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:00.636]  And so they pulled this inside job on Medina.
[00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:09.039]  Even the Dallas Morning News admitted they've got Perry people on the same IPs in there posting crazy stuff, posing like they support Medina.
[00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:12.080]  They're doing it all over our message boards, all over YouTube.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.240]  It's disgusting.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.541]  It's Karl Rove dirty tricks.
[00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:21.003]  They've got thousands of people online with this info and whisper campaigns right now.
[00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:32.614]  This battle in Texas is absolutely essential.
[00:16:32.614 --> 00:16:36.075]  Now, I will say this.
[00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:45.318]  Win, lose, or draw, we've already won because people have seen what a true Constitutionalist Tea Party in the Fed, that's really what she as a candidate can do.
[00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:51.100]  That's already got people filing all over the country to run for state office.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.661]  Multiple states today, including Utah, voted
[00:16:55.649 --> 00:17:00.656]  To declare 10th Amendment powers, which they already had, but to tell the feds it's over.
[00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:04.301]  Thirty, what is it, seven states now are moving to do it.
[00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:07.545]  It was like 34 a few weeks ago.
[00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:08.086]  It's happening.
[00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:20.511]  So it's the Republican Party job to suppress the populist, conservative, libertarian, constitutionalist base to target anybody bonafide and real.
[00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:32.817]  If you see Republican mouthpieces like Fox News or local neocon syndicated programming attacking someone, you better believe they're good.
[00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:34.438]  If they're a constitutionalist.
[00:17:34.438 --> 00:17:36.379]  That's the seal of approval.
[00:17:36.379 --> 00:17:40.121]  Now, this video
[00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:46.728]  In October of 2008, We Are Change Ohio shot it.
[00:17:46.728 --> 00:17:47.808]  They talked to Sarah Palin.
[00:17:47.808 --> 00:17:51.410]  They said, do you support the 9-11 victims' families calling for a new investigation of 9-11?
[00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.571]  And she said, yes, I do.
[00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:55.032]  Yes, we need a new investigation.
[00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.553]  Now, that's more than Deborah Medina said.
[00:17:57.553 --> 00:18:00.975]  So, imagine the point we've got them at.
[00:18:00.975 --> 00:18:08.119]  And listeners called me yesterday and pointed out that we had written a big article about this and We Are Change had posted this a year and a half ago.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.881]  16 months ago you want to be technical at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:26.345]  So I did a presentation video that is in the article breaking Sarah Palin 9-1-1 truth or controversy makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:26.845]  I posted.
[00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:35.667]  This video this morning, Aaron Dyche said it appeared until two in the morning to do it, I shot it last night, posted it this morning, the article's been written, it's up there.
[00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:52.052]  And it explains how you contact newspapers, TV, you name it, and say, you demonize Medina, you better address the darling of Rick Perry, the lady campaigning for him, propping him up, and propping up in Arizona, John McCain.
[00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:53.553]  Now, she said more than
[00:18:55.216 --> 00:18:56.237]  Debra Medina did.
[00:18:56.237 --> 00:19:00.479]  Are we going to see the campaign with robocalls against her in less than an hour?
[00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:01.419]  The people's houses?
[00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:04.021]  Are we going to see Republican voters?
[00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:04.921]  Homes?
[00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:10.484]  Are we going to see letters demonizing and saying, you want to hurt the families and the troops and the police?
[00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.205]  How dare you destroy their memory?
[00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:15.367]  Just totally made up and now it's admitted it was all staged with Beck.
[00:19:15.367 --> 00:19:19.469]  Of course, he's Roger Ailes, Karl Rove operative.
[00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:20.930]  But it's worse!
[00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.911]  I now know... I can't even say it.
[00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:34.940]  I know so much more that I can't talk about that is inside the next article that just went up 20 minutes ago at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.101]  Insider.
[00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:44.168]  Republican dirty trick machine targeting grassroots constitutionalists.
[00:19:44.168 --> 00:19:44.769]  Exclusive.
[00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:55.968]  Establishment neocons have resolved to attack Debra Medina, Alex Jones, and Ron Paul in that order because they are terrified of losing control of the Tea Party movement.
[00:19:55.968 --> 00:19:59.153]  This comes directly out of Rick Perry's mouth!
[00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:06.010]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.412]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:39.475]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.475 --> 00:20:40.276]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:46.540]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.421]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.421 --> 00:20:50.683]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:51.503]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:53.024]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:53.024 --> 00:20:53.204]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.204 --> 00:20:53.485]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.291]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:07.817]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:07.817 --> 00:21:08.377]  I get it.
[00:21:08.377 --> 00:21:17.707]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:17.987 --> 00:21:19.388]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.388 --> 00:21:27.851]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:31.252]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:35.514]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.514 --> 00:21:37.135]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:41.076]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:41.076 --> 00:21:44.698]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.898 --> 00:21:45.799]  You should, too.
[00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:46.940]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.263]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:50.263 --> 00:21:50.323]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.323 --> 00:21:50.563]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.563 --> 00:21:50.804]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.804 --> 00:21:53.406]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:53.406 --> 00:21:54.907]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:54.907 --> 00:21:56.569]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:11.323 --> 00:22:13.984]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.984 --> 00:22:20.365]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.365 --> 00:22:25.426]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.426 --> 00:22:28.827]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:22:28.827 --> 00:22:35.549]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:38.010]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.611]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.071]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:44.192]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:44.192 --> 00:22:49.354]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.354 --> 00:22:58.438]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:00.595 --> 00:23:06.418]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:11.640]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.501]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:20.264]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:23:20.484 --> 00:23:29.631]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:23:29.631 --> 00:23:37.116]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:37.496]  I think so.
[00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:07.533]  Federal agents!
[00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:08.994]  We are armed!
[00:24:08.994 --> 00:24:11.677]  What would you do if you knew all the things we know?
[00:24:11.677 --> 00:24:14.840]  Would you lay down or would you stand up?
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.865]  Yeah, I got a message to the government.
[00:24:19.865 --> 00:24:21.106]  I know what they're doing.
[00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.327]  I know who they are.
[00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.088]  I know they're criminal.
[00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:24.469]  I know they're illegitimate.
[00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:32.153]  We come with a message of liberty and the spirit of 1776 to restore this republic.
[00:24:32.153 --> 00:24:36.654]  To crash through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:36.654 --> 00:24:40.976]  Infowars.com comes to wage war on corruption.
[00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:43.217]  Prison Planet comes to resist the tyranny.
[00:24:44.418 --> 00:24:58.849]  I see a message from the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers they wanted me about Osama or whatever picture me behind the scam I said never you in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting I stay committed
[00:24:59.389 --> 00:25:03.311]  Ron Paul's the real deal coming out and saying we've had a CIA coup in America that they ship in the narcotics.
[00:25:27.486 --> 00:25:28.487]  They're scared of us.
[00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:32.811]  They're scared of the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:45.143]  Do you realize what you can do if you contact every TV and radio station and send them this article that breaks it all down for them with the video of Sarah Palin saying she wants a new 9-11 investigation?
[00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:48.125]  She's more of a truther from this statement than Deborah Medina.
[00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.407]  And all's fair in love and war.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.264]  You know, they took something Medina said out of context and twisted it and used it as a black op.
[00:25:56.264 --> 00:26:01.207]  Well, we're going to throw this right back in their face.
[00:26:01.207 --> 00:26:02.208]  So start your engines.
[00:26:02.208 --> 00:26:02.948]  Get the article.
[00:26:02.948 --> 00:26:04.069]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:07.011]  Prisonplanet.com.
[00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:07.551]  Breaking!
[00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:11.494]  Sarah Palin 9-1-1 truth or controversy makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[00:26:12.642 --> 00:26:14.203]  And a lot more.
[00:26:14.203 --> 00:26:16.704]  Sarah Palin, 9-11 truth or controversy explodes.
[00:26:16.704 --> 00:26:26.070]  Days after Texas gubernatorial hopeful Deborah Medina outcast as pariah candidate for 9-11 comments.
[00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.231]  Can you imagine?
[00:26:28.231 --> 00:26:31.073]  Get it in the newspapers, get it on radio, get it on TV.
[00:26:31.073 --> 00:26:39.378]  The neocons in Texas that have fingers into all these outlets right now are trying to suppress this.
[00:26:39.378 --> 00:26:40.559]  Now, I can't
[00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:48.951]  I can't give you any specifics other than what was said and I can't even give you most of that because it will identify who we're talking about.
[00:26:48.951 --> 00:26:51.591]  I can't say if it's female or male.
[00:26:51.591 --> 00:26:59.033]  I can't say if they are a media personality or an elected representative.
[00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:08.876]  I will say that this individual is a household name for anyone who watches the news or is involved in politics.
[00:27:09.998 --> 00:27:26.752]  A household name contacted us to warn us after the Debra Medina situation, saying they feared the worst, I'll just say more than two weeks ago, right around that time frame.
[00:27:26.752 --> 00:27:31.696]  We know the date, the place, everything.
[00:27:31.696 --> 00:27:38.102]  This individual was in the green room with Rick Perry, and Rick Perry was upset.
[00:27:39.284 --> 00:27:49.489]  And thought this person could be in their confidence and said the Republican Party is worried about what's happening in Texas.
[00:27:49.489 --> 00:27:59.814]  They understand all the heat being put on Obama through the Tea Parties, but they know that the Tea Parties are awake to the Republican agenda and that it's all bought and paid for by the banks.
[00:28:04.426 --> 00:28:18.291]  And that from Washington, the three main enemies, and let me tell you, this is pleasing at one level to know I've been effective, but at another, it's creepy, because Karl Rove puts governors in prison for no reason.
[00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:21.092]  I mean, these people don't, and ignores congressional subpoenas.
[00:28:21.092 --> 00:28:21.892]  It's a felony.
[00:28:21.892 --> 00:28:23.793]  I mean, he just is a lawless criminal.
[00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:34.170]  And he ran Perry, he ran Bush, he's running the whole show right now.
[00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:40.712]  And it's in Texas Monthly, last month's issue, that Rick Perry's being positioned with Sarah Palin to run in 2012.
[00:28:40.712 --> 00:28:48.554]  They're going to launch their campaign in the next year and a half.
[00:28:48.554 --> 00:28:51.654]  This is a woman who believes in global warming.
[00:28:51.654 --> 00:28:53.655]  This is Perry who passes all these new taxes.
[00:28:53.655 --> 00:28:57.956]  You've got Glenn Beck calling for value-added taxes and sales taxes on top of the income tax.
[00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:12.182]  You had Chris Matthews, O'Reilly, and Beck all in the same evening on two different networks say Deborah Medina is a secret 9-11 truther trying to infiltrate the government and they may want to kill Obama.
[00:29:12.182 --> 00:29:15.225]  I mean, they're openly saying we are seditious enemies of America.
[00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:17.527]  She's not even a 9-11 truther.
[00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:20.549]  And they're saying she's in with Van Jones and must be stopped.
[00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:23.492]  They are in red-level panic!
[00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:24.393]  Chris Matthews!
[00:29:26.428 --> 00:29:37.717]  Bill O'Reilly, they all work for the same people, playing the fake left-right paradigm, like Mary Madeline and Carvel are married to each other.
[00:29:37.717 --> 00:29:40.239]  One covers the right, one covers the fake left.
[00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:48.566]  Now, when we get back, I'm gonna give you the inside, direct from the mouth of Rick Perry about their attack plans.
[00:29:48.566 --> 00:29:51.188]  This is huge!
[00:29:51.188 --> 00:29:52.610]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.111]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.103 --> 00:30:01.548]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.548 --> 00:30:05.571]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:08.814]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.814 --> 00:30:13.618]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.618 --> 00:30:20.003]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.745 --> 00:30:23.085]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.085 --> 00:30:23.565]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:23.926]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:23.926 --> 00:30:24.706]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:26.347]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:44.094]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:44.094 --> 00:30:46.595]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:48.256]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.613 --> 00:31:14.274]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.274 --> 00:31:20.675]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.675 --> 00:31:26.217]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:35.839]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:38.321]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:39.922]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.922 --> 00:31:42.364]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.364 --> 00:31:44.485]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:49.649]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:32:10.758 --> 00:32:13.260]  Then you think to yourself, I don't drink tea!
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.341]  Now for the truth.
[00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:21.649]  Many people don't drink tea, but they drink energy drinks, colas, juices from concentrates, which all carry high levels of sugar and caffeine.
[00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:23.630]  Sugar is a toxin.
[00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.131]  Sugar does not help you, nor does caffeine.
[00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:29.712]  Your colon could be clogged, causing dangerous consequences.

[00:32:49.981 --> 00:32:57.644]  Desperate to keep control over the American people, while the Republicans play the part of the revolutionaries who are out of power.
[00:33:16.482 --> 00:33:27.735]  While Obama, their minion, carries out their operations for the neocons, they launched an attempt at a Howard Dean yell moment.
[00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:29.257]  A non-event to make people think
[00:33:31.482 --> 00:33:34.723]  That, oh, well, she's gaining momentum, but she can't win now.
[00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:36.204]  It's over for her.
[00:33:36.204 --> 00:33:40.705]  It's like announcing Mark Twain had died 20-something years before he actually died.
[00:33:40.705 --> 00:33:48.428]  Rumors of her demise have been greatly exaggerated, but it still has an effect as a Jedi mind trick on the weak-minded.
[00:33:48.428 --> 00:34:00.252]  So, we simply take Sarah Palin video of her, 16 months ago, in Ohio, campaigning with big government, anti-gun, North America Union-loving
[00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:15.414]  John McCain, and we show the clip of her saying, yes, I want a new 9-11 investigation, and it will explode in their face if you can get the media to cover it.
[00:34:15.414 --> 00:34:20.078]  You go get the article, Breaking Sarah Palin, 911 Truth or Controversy Makes Hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[00:34:21.198 --> 00:34:24.581]  It breaks it all down in a short and sweet article with all the proof.
[00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:26.642]  The media will definitely bite.
[00:34:26.642 --> 00:34:36.069]  And if they bite and it gets picked up big, this will give Medina five points going into the early voting.
[00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:37.950]  Around a third of Texas' early vote.
[00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.271]  And then early next month, the election.
[00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:46.757]  She could win, hands down, and not even need to be in a runoff.
[00:34:46.757 --> 00:34:49.739]  But at least we get her into the runoff and then time is on our side.
[00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:52.438]  Here's the problem.
[00:34:52.438 --> 00:35:03.442]  I was already calling Paul Watson last night, saying we need to do a report in the next few days on how the Karl Rove criminal machine is behind this.
[00:35:03.442 --> 00:35:09.924]  He literally created Perry and Bush, and he is involved now, and that more dirty tricks will be brought out on Medina.
[00:35:09.924 --> 00:35:11.485]  They'll plant drugs on her!
[00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:12.865]  They'll arrest her!
[00:35:12.865 --> 00:35:13.806]  They'll do anything!
[00:35:13.806 --> 00:35:17.887]  I mean, do you have any idea the type of stuff these people do?
[00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:19.108]  They are ruthless!
[00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:23.614]  So, it was chilling this morning.
[00:35:23.614 --> 00:35:24.754]  I got up at 4 a.m.
[00:35:24.754 --> 00:35:25.994]  and went to work.
[00:35:25.994 --> 00:35:40.138]  It was chilling to get a phone call from an incredibly high-level public figure.
[00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.379]  And I have talked to the public figure before.
[00:35:43.379 --> 00:35:43.899]  They know me.
[00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:44.939]  I know them.
[00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:48.300]  And I recognize their voice, but I still
[00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:51.937]  Didn't have the cell phone number they called me from.
[00:35:51.937 --> 00:35:57.838]  I called someone I knew that knew them this morning and confirmed it was their cell phone there on my caller ID.
[00:35:57.838 --> 00:36:07.040]  It was them.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.101]  And they told me in the future they may be able to talk more about this.
[00:36:12.101 --> 00:36:15.182]  Again, I'm leaving it vague because
[00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:17.989]  You have to protect sources.
[00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:22.370]  Just like people say, we don't believe that MYAC and Homeland Security reports you got are real.
[00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.591]  We don't believe state police in California and Missouri gave you this.
[00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:29.852]  We don't believe a federal marshal gave you the Homeland Security master document.
[00:36:29.852 --> 00:36:32.772]  They were saying that for a week.
[00:36:32.772 --> 00:36:37.833]  Until the media finally investigated and the feds and the states admitted it.
[00:36:37.833 --> 00:36:39.974]  They said, tell us your source!
[00:36:39.974 --> 00:36:41.274]  Tell us, oh yes!
[00:36:42.253 --> 00:36:52.305]  And I think the public's so gullible and some of the public bought it and said, yeah, tell us who gave it to you or it's not real.
[00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:55.048]  Tell us.
[00:36:55.048 --> 00:36:56.310]  No, I'm not going to tell you.
[00:37:01.479 --> 00:37:17.689]  Just like when the FBI visited here, because of an idiot on the message board, threatening to kill a police officer by name and posting his address, and in the subpoena I couldn't talk about it, so I said the FBI was here, they were asking about the Obama deception, I didn't even know what it was about.
[00:37:17.689 --> 00:37:21.411]  It was just with subpoenas for records.
[00:37:21.411 --> 00:37:22.112]  Limited records.
[00:37:24.565 --> 00:37:29.228]  But they kept asking about the Obama deception, so in early March, I released the film four days early.
[00:37:29.228 --> 00:37:33.230]  They show up here right before I'm about to launch it, people said, oh, that's not real, they didn't visit you.
[00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:42.816]  Then the Associated Press, Wired Magazine, Reuters, all about the case, and the guy went to prison.
[00:37:42.816 --> 00:37:48.380]  The point is, this is directly from someone inside their camp.
[00:37:50.472 --> 00:37:55.495]  Glenn Beck's got one thing right in all these TV casts he's doing where he says, oh my gosh, they've infiltrated us, they're everywhere.
[00:37:55.495 --> 00:37:56.916]  Well, you're right, Beck.
[00:37:56.916 --> 00:38:07.942]  People that actually love America and are against the Patriot Act and the New World Order and all these wars and the fraud and the big government and they know that both parties are bought and paid for by foreign offshore banks.
[00:38:07.942 --> 00:38:09.423]  You bet, Beck!
[00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:11.484]  We've got people everywhere.
[00:38:11.484 --> 00:38:15.987]  Because people are deciding, do they want to join the New World Order and the dark side now that the choice is clear?
[00:38:15.987 --> 00:38:18.108]  Or do they want to stand up for the Republic?
[00:38:18.108 --> 00:38:19.649]  Do they want to be with George Washington?
[00:38:21.542 --> 00:38:29.245]  And Andrew Jackson in history or do they want to be with a person like you?
[00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:43.169]  And Karl Rove with a jowl so big it looks like it's full of 300 gallons of pus.
[00:38:43.169 --> 00:38:46.410]  But this story is so important on so many facets.
[00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.811]  The story I'm about to cover because
[00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:54.495]  We know we're hurting them.
[00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:59.842]  All their hoaxes, their government healthcare, Republican lobbyists are involved in that as well.
[00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:08.353]  The global greenhouse gas taxes, top Republicans Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin's darling John McCain, they're all behind it.
[00:39:10.592 --> 00:39:12.713]  They were endorsing it until ClimateGate blew up.
[00:39:12.713 --> 00:39:14.214]  They were saying it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:39:14.214 --> 00:39:22.738]  Pat Robertson says Obama's of God, socialism is good, it is the will of the Lord that he will get everything done he wants.
[00:39:22.738 --> 00:39:25.399]  These are operatives.
[00:39:25.399 --> 00:39:40.047]  Now that you've turned against them and didn't buy their Jedi mind trick of resistance is futile, their Borg trick, their mind game, they're going, oh yes, we're against Obama now, except when he wants a bailout, we're for it, or wants to reauthorize the Patriot Act, we're for it, or
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.181]  But we love the troops so much.
[00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:51.065]  We talk about how we love the troops all day, but we won't do shows on DU killing them or the nerve gas they've been exposed to and how they're dying, how they're thrown out on the street.
[00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:56.088]  No, we just talk about how we love the troops all day.
[00:39:56.088 --> 00:40:01.071]  And this shows and confirms just how scared they are, just how vulnerable they are.
[00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:09.876]  You see, as long as they can keep you passive and feeling weak and broken and jejected and buffaloed and cowed,
[00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:17.967]  As long as you have a spirit of capitulation and weakness, they win.
[00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:31.217]  But as their global carbon tax fails, their swine flu hoax fails, their government takeover of healthcare fails, as everything they're pushing fails, they're desperate to get control of the awakening populist constitutional movement.
[00:40:31.217 --> 00:40:31.838]  It's the 1776 movement.
[00:40:31.838 --> 00:40:33.900]  It's the answer to 1984 is 1776 coffee party movement.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.520]  The Great Awakening!
[00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:46.021]  And they tried to label it and make it Republican knowing Republicanism is discredited.
[00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:50.825]  That didn't work.
[00:40:50.825 --> 00:41:01.373]  And this information directly out of the mouth of Rick Perry in a closed door meeting with only a couple of insiders.
[00:41:01.373 --> 00:41:02.914]  He was freaked out.
[00:41:02.914 --> 00:41:04.796]  He was sweating bullets.
[00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:06.197]  He is upset.
[00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:09.539]  He is worried because if the polls show she's 25, Kay Bailey's 26, and Perry's 32,
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.581]  And she's gaining five points a week.
[00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:20.422]  They had to do this.
[00:41:20.422 --> 00:41:21.923]  They didn't want to give her the attention.
[00:41:21.923 --> 00:41:23.364]  This was a dangerous gamble.
[00:41:23.364 --> 00:41:25.225]  To give her even more attention.
[00:41:25.225 --> 00:41:31.769]  To elevate her more with this attempted Howard Dean moment.
[00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:34.450]  But they went ahead and rolled the dice.
[00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.672]  Not knowing that there was always an ace in the hole.
[00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:40.214]  There's always something that they're not aware of.
[00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:46.051]  And that's Palin repeatedly calling for a new 9-11 investigation.
[00:41:46.051 --> 00:41:47.232]  What hypocrites!
[00:41:47.232 --> 00:41:48.754]  What jokes!
[00:41:48.754 --> 00:41:49.975]  It's up to you, though, folks.
[00:41:49.975 --> 00:41:55.560]  I may have a few million listeners and four million people that visit the sites every week, but that isn't enough.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.842]  You've got to move the ball.
[00:41:56.842 --> 00:42:03.608]  The power of this broadcast, the power of InfoWars.com, the power of PrisonPlanet.com, the power of my films,
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.462]  Is you the patriot.
[00:42:06.462 --> 00:42:12.166]  You who have the blood and the spirit of the founding fathers flowing through your veins.
[00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:17.390]  You who love liberty.
[00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.033]  You who refuse the chains of tyranny.
[00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:22.474]  You are what we have.
[00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:27.699]  You're all we've got, and that's a whole lot.
[00:42:27.699 --> 00:42:31.722]  And sure, they could fool us in the past, but people are getting wise to it now.
[00:42:31.722 --> 00:42:32.883]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:42:34.332 --> 00:43:01.768]  And the fact that Rick Perry was shaking, saying, quote, the number one enemies of the Republican establishment are Deborah Medina, because of what she symbolizes, a revolt at the state level, Alex Jones, because I represent the true spirit of 1776 in the alternative media, and we're number one, and growing exponentially,
[00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:07.453]  What a responsibility, God.
[00:43:07.453 --> 00:43:10.755]  Thank you for the responsibility, but oh!
[00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.515]  It's chilling.
[00:43:12.515 --> 00:43:19.839]  And Ron Paul, because he represents the elder statesman who's been right about everything on the national, international stage.
[00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:22.900]  They tried to shoot him down, it didn't work.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:28.163]  Beck tried to shoot him down, Hannity did, all the other TV networks did off those same talking points two years ago.
[00:43:29.335 --> 00:43:30.836]  Two and a half years ago, 2007 into 2009.
[00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:36.260]  So now they embrace him when they failed!
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.182]  But only embraced him to try to spin it.
[00:43:39.182 --> 00:43:41.804]  Because they found that when they attacked him, it blew up bigger in their face.
[00:43:41.804 --> 00:43:46.148]  And the same thing's happening with me and Debra Medina.
[00:43:46.148 --> 00:43:50.791]  So here is the key article.
[00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:53.133]  They're hurting, folks.
[00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:54.934]  It's like the champ.
[00:43:54.934 --> 00:43:55.635]  The pretty boy.
[00:43:56.724 --> 00:44:07.351]  Big government, Napa Superhighway, New World Order champ is in the corner and he's telling his ring manager, he's telling his trainer, oh man, he's hurting me.
[00:44:07.351 --> 00:44:08.131]  They're hurting me bad.
[00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:10.073]  She's hurting me.
[00:44:10.073 --> 00:44:11.534]  I gotta go back out a couple more rounds.
[00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:12.574]  It's bad.
[00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:21.060]  It's bad because if she's 25 points in the polls, and those are guaranteed cook polls, she's probably beating him in the real internal polls they're doing.
[00:44:22.386 --> 00:44:24.868]  So now their electronic machines are going to come in.
[00:44:24.868 --> 00:44:26.229]  But they don't have them everywhere.
[00:44:26.229 --> 00:44:28.070]  They don't have them nationwide.
[00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:31.513]  And they are in trouble.
[00:44:31.513 --> 00:44:37.718]  Insider Republican dirty tricks machine targeting grassroots constitutionalists.
[00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:47.425]  Exclusive establishment neocons have resolved to attack Debra Medina, Alex Jones, and Ron Paul because they are terrified of losing control of the Tea Party movement.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.361]  And I'm not afraid of Karl Rove.
[00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:55.522]  I'm not saying bring it on.
[00:44:55.522 --> 00:45:01.145]  I don't want you to send hitmen or plant drugs or do whatever, but just do whatever you gotta do.
[00:45:01.145 --> 00:45:02.006]  Okay?
[00:45:02.006 --> 00:45:08.890]  I know I'm standing with God and goodness and my ancestors and people of honor and people that are decent and love the truth.
[00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.731]  And you stand over there with your devilish system.
[00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:12.872]  I'm not afraid.
[00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:14.493]  I'm committed and I feel good.
[00:45:14.493 --> 00:45:19.936]  And I'm ready for a fight in the Infowar.
[00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:26.986]  I know it's in God's hands.
[00:45:26.986 --> 00:45:28.147]  Exclusive!
[00:45:28.147 --> 00:45:33.956]  Establishment neocons have resolved to attack Deborah Medina, Alex Jones, Ron Paul because they are terrified of losing control of the Tea Party movement.
[00:45:35.228 --> 00:45:53.751]  A prominent insider has told InfoWars that Texas Governor Rick Perry and other establishment neocons have decided to deliberately target grassroots constitutionalists with dirty tricks, campaigns in an effort to derail and hijack the growing liberty movement whose influence is threatening to blow the Texas gubernatorial race wide open.
[00:45:56.218 --> 00:46:05.526]  Our office was contacted by a national personality, a household name, who told us that they were in a green room at a national public event a few weeks ago with Rick Perry.
[00:46:05.526 --> 00:46:13.092]  The individual was shocked when Perry said directly that there were three people who got under his skin and had to be dealt with immediately.
[00:46:13.092 --> 00:46:14.994]  One, Deborah Medina.
[00:46:14.994 --> 00:46:17.156]  Two, Alex Jones.
[00:46:17.156 --> 00:46:18.577]  And three, Ron Paul.
[00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:25.775]  Perry told, I'm so proud that all three of those are Texans.
[00:46:25.775 --> 00:46:27.616]  Send in the cavalry, folks.
[00:46:27.616 --> 00:46:42.428]  Perry told the individual that these three people had to be targeted and stopped in order for the Republican establishment to shut down any real voices of opposition that were threatening to have an influence on the Tea Party movement, which has been blatantly hijacked by the neocons in recent months.
[00:46:42.428 --> 00:46:43.428]  And Beck goes on and
[00:46:46.772 --> 00:46:48.393]  I'm told Hannity, but I haven't seen it yet.
[00:46:48.393 --> 00:46:55.077]  But I've seen Beck, O'Reilly, and... Watson's working on another article on this right now.
[00:46:55.077 --> 00:46:57.138]  Limited resources, we have great people here.
[00:46:57.138 --> 00:46:58.238]  I praise them.
[00:46:58.238 --> 00:47:00.240]  Couldn't do it without them.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.461]  And... Chris Matthews!
[00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:05.002]  The same talking points!
[00:47:05.002 --> 00:47:08.144]  She's like the same talking points going after Ron Paul.
[00:47:08.144 --> 00:47:13.307]  The establishment Republicans and Democrats may fight over the power sometimes, but they always circle the wagons against the people.
[00:47:18.171 --> 00:47:23.993]  And they all went on last night and said, the Tea Party movement's being hijacked by 9-11 truthers!
[00:47:23.993 --> 00:47:26.053]  They're dangerous, they may hurt the President!
[00:47:26.053 --> 00:47:27.373]  With no evidence of that.
[00:47:27.373 --> 00:47:29.294]  And they went further.
[00:47:29.294 --> 00:47:33.215]  National polls are between 36 and 84, depending on the poll.
[00:47:33.215 --> 00:47:35.756]  All of them supposedly scientific.
[00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:36.496]  Some say 36, some say 84.
[00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:37.156]  Some 83, some 56, some 64.
[00:47:37.156 --> 00:47:40.777]  You've all seen the polls, they're in my films.
[00:47:46.326 --> 00:47:56.455]  Zogby, Mason Dixon, Scripps Howard News Service, Gallup, Angus and Reed was the 84, Angus and Reed, New York Times.
[00:47:56.455 --> 00:48:00.038]  That was four years ago.
[00:48:00.038 --> 00:48:03.161]  Don't believe the official story on a new investigation.
[00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:06.644]  About the same number of the national polls don't believe the official story on Kennedy.
[00:48:06.644 --> 00:48:07.285]  Believe the government did it.
[00:48:08.134 --> 00:48:10.455]  About 84% of people are white.
[00:48:10.455 --> 00:48:11.675]  That's the big illusion.
[00:48:11.675 --> 00:48:17.157]  So they gotta get up there on TV every day and say, everybody knows these people are kooks.
[00:48:17.157 --> 00:48:23.298]  And Glenn Beck said that the 9-11 truthers on the left only make up 5% of the population.
[00:48:23.298 --> 00:48:25.999]  And then on the right they're 5% for a grand total of 10.
[00:48:25.999 --> 00:48:28.300]  The lowest polls are 36%.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.600]  And then he said only 5%.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.662]  He said total 10% nationwide, half of them birthers, half of them truthers.
[00:48:37.827 --> 00:48:44.452]  When 9-11 truth itself is at least 36% and in most polls more than half of Republicans question his birth certificate because of all the cover-ups.
[00:48:44.452 --> 00:48:51.418]  So, the real number is more than half of the American people are either 9-11 truthers or birthers.
[00:48:51.418 --> 00:48:53.339]  That's very conservative.
[00:48:53.339 --> 00:49:00.104]  That's a dead reckoning, pared down, lowest number I could come up with.
[00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:02.266]  They have polls on all this.
[00:49:02.266 --> 00:49:07.030]  No shocker, 67% of registered Republicans question Obama's birth certificate.
[00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.462]  You've seen those polls.
[00:49:09.462 --> 00:49:16.247]  You've seen a whole crowd shout down Republicans and shout down McCain when he says, oh, there's no question.
[00:49:16.247 --> 00:49:18.649]  Beck gets up and says, no!
[00:49:18.649 --> 00:49:26.115]  Only 5% of the population are birthers and only 5% are truthers and this 10% are enemies of America.
[00:49:26.115 --> 00:49:27.115]  See, that's Psyops.
[00:49:27.115 --> 00:49:29.778]  He plays birthers and truthers off against each other.
[00:49:29.778 --> 00:49:34.421]  It's an 8-minute clip.
[00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:36.483]  It's in the article about Palin being a 9-11 truther.
[00:49:38.148 --> 00:49:39.569]  We'll play it in the last hour if we have time.
[00:49:39.569 --> 00:49:43.333]  Lord Monckton's coming up and some other guests.
[00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:52.721]  We're going to go live to prisonplanet.tv right at the start of the next hour, high noon central.
[00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:54.042]  But there's so many issues here.
[00:49:54.042 --> 00:49:54.843]  They're scared.
[00:49:54.843 --> 00:49:55.583]  They're in trouble.
[00:49:55.583 --> 00:49:57.165]  They're trying to suppress the people.
[00:49:57.165 --> 00:50:00.368]  Obama covers the left and sandbags and manipulates his people.
[00:50:01.397 --> 00:50:15.421]  The neocon gaggle and all these little personalities, the new wave that kind of gotten rid of culture and Malkin and others, and people now know about Gingrich being a globalist and pro-global warming and all the anti-gun, the rest of it.
[00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:16.842]  So they've moved on to a new crop.
[00:50:17.142 --> 00:50:19.924]  And they'll be discredited, and they'll bring a new group in, like Shark Teeth.
[00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:21.405]  See, I never go anywhere.
[00:50:21.405 --> 00:50:22.805]  I just get more popular.
[00:50:22.805 --> 00:50:25.227]  Because everything I say is evergreen.
[00:50:25.227 --> 00:50:26.267]  It's the truth.
[00:50:26.267 --> 00:50:27.388]  It gets stronger.
[00:50:27.388 --> 00:50:33.712]  They always have to replace their people when they get worn down and discredited with new personalities to fool people.
[00:50:33.712 --> 00:50:35.553]  So Rick Perry's scared to death.
[00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:37.474]  The Republican Party is scared to death.
[00:50:37.474 --> 00:50:38.374]  Of who?
[00:50:38.374 --> 00:50:46.139]  Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and what Deborah Medina symbolizes, the state's rights-tenther rebellion.
[00:50:47.637 --> 00:50:48.859]  We'll finish up with this article.
[00:50:48.859 --> 00:50:55.768]  Go to Lord Moncton with the total implosion of the greenhouse gas tax fraud and how we stop them at the state level.
[00:50:55.768 --> 00:50:59.253]  We've got another guest coming up on states' rights as well.
[00:50:59.253 --> 00:50:59.834]  Key info.
[00:51:01.474 --> 00:51:03.655]  Is your computer running slowly?

[00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:14.622]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[00:52:02.165 --> 00:52:06.191]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.191 --> 00:52:09.436]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.436 --> 00:52:10.858]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.562 --> 00:52:14.243]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.243 --> 00:52:20.625]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.625 --> 00:52:25.807]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.807 --> 00:52:35.791]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.911 --> 00:52:38.253]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.253 --> 00:52:39.855]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.855 --> 00:52:42.317]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.317 --> 00:52:44.440]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.585]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.585 --> 00:52:58.714]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.828 --> 00:53:06.535]  Lose one to two pounds a day the healthy way and keep it off with the help of the entire real HCG diet.
[00:53:06.535 --> 00:53:11.420]  With an average weight loss of one half to two pounds a day, you can be in that bikini or swimming suit in no time.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.585]  You've heard of people spending over $700 for this exact same diet at doctor's offices?
[00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:19.626]  Now you can start the entire HCG diet for under $100.

[00:53:37.432 --> 00:53:38.032]  We're good.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:18.585]  We're only six minutes away from Lord Christopher Monckton with the devastating victories against the phony environmentalists.
[00:54:18.585 --> 00:54:22.188]  This is ultra-massive.
[00:54:22.188 --> 00:54:25.290]  We are marching against the tyranny together.
[00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:38.859]  You will notice that I've had the New York Times, Newsweek twice, scores of other national publications, Texas Monthly hitting newsstands today with a piece that I've seen a lot of and
[00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:42.759]  I would characterize it as a piece that makes me look like an extremist.
[00:54:42.759 --> 00:54:44.199]  Well, I am extreme for liberty.
[00:54:44.199 --> 00:54:45.760]  We're fighting extreme tyranny.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.441]  So I guess compared to all the general madness, I am extreme.
[00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:53.483]  If you were in the Aztec Kingdom a thousand years ago and said child sacrifice was bad, you'd be extreme.
[00:54:53.483 --> 00:55:02.485]  If you were in Hitler's Germany 70 years ago, you'd be seen as extreme.
[00:55:02.485 --> 00:55:06.607]  But as Cass Sunstein said, they will also use their operatives who pose as the alternative
[00:55:07.438 --> 00:55:14.400]  Just like they've caught Perry's people, the Dallas Morning News reported, posting ridiculous and racist and other comments, posing as Medina supporters.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.040]  I told you that Hal Turner was a government operative.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.921]  It turned out he was the highest level FBI agent in federal and state court.
[00:55:20.921 --> 00:55:21.701]  This has come out.
[00:55:21.701 --> 00:55:22.842]  Mainstream news.
[00:55:22.842 --> 00:55:25.802]  An FBI agent for national security.
[00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:26.822]  Always attacking me.
[00:55:26.822 --> 00:55:32.724]  Notice all the white supremacist groups run by feds are attacking me right now.
[00:55:32.724 --> 00:55:33.384]  And Ron Paul.
[00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.763]  And death-threatening and everything else you can imagine.
[00:55:40.763 --> 00:55:47.828]  Because they are humping mad and they've got mentally retarded goons who are the type of people they'll send to try to kill you.
[00:55:47.828 --> 00:55:51.511]  Notice how the heavens have opened up with attacks on me.
[00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:54.053]  And that means I'm on the right track.
[00:55:54.053 --> 00:55:56.875]  This is guaranteed Karl Rove and the Pentagon.
[00:55:56.875 --> 00:56:01.358]  And we have it directly out of Perry's mouth!
[00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:02.699]  That they are scared.
[00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:04.140]  They are concerned.
[00:56:06.846 --> 00:56:18.711]  Republican, dirty tricks machine targeting grassroots, constitutionalist, establishment neocons have resolved to attack Deborah Medina, Alex Jones, Ron Paul because they are terrified of losing control of the Tea Party movement.
[00:56:18.711 --> 00:56:26.434]  Our office was contacted by a national personality, a household name, who told us that they were in a green room at a national public event a few weeks ago with Rick Perry.
[00:56:26.434 --> 00:56:34.338]  The individual was shocked when Perry said directly, without being asked, that there were three people who got under his skin, that's a quote, and who had to be dealt with immediately.
[00:56:35.544 --> 00:56:36.324]  One, Debra Medina.
[00:56:36.324 --> 00:56:37.024]  Two, Alex Jones.
[00:56:37.024 --> 00:56:38.045]  Three, Ron Paul.
[00:56:38.045 --> 00:56:51.488]  Perry told the individual that these three people had to be targeted and stopped in order for the Republican establishment to shut down any real voices of opposition that were threatening to have an influence on the Tea Party movement, which has been blatantly hijacked by the neocons in recent months.
[00:56:51.488 --> 00:57:01.750]  Perry made it clear that these individuals and their supporters were the number one target of the neocon hierarchy because the grassroots was threatening to regain control of the Tea Party movement that was first created by Ron Paul supporters in 2007.
[00:57:03.493 --> 00:57:06.016]  But has since been hijacked by the Republicans.
[00:57:06.016 --> 00:57:10.483]  The insider expressed a shock that Perry would be so open with his comments.
[00:57:10.483 --> 00:57:15.329]  Suspecting that Perry must have considered the individual to be a fellow neocon.
[00:57:15.329 --> 00:57:20.076]  The insider's deep concern about what was said prompted him to contact our office.
[00:57:21.616 --> 00:57:42.309]  Perry made the comments just a couple of weeks before gubernatorial challenger Deborah Medina, the only true constitutionalist running for the governorship of Texas, was set up by Fox News' Glenn Beck after the dubious talk show host smeared Medina and generated a fake controversy merely for saying that people should be free to question the official 9-11 story of you shared by the vast majority of Americans and six of the ten 9-11 Commission members.
[00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:47.512]  Perry, who was subsequently celebrated by Beck as the only remaining credible candidate after the smear attack on Medina,
[00:57:48.803 --> 00:57:50.184]  Must have been on a ploy.
[00:57:50.184 --> 00:58:04.450]  Within an hour of her appearance on the Glenn Beck Radio Show, Texas residents told the Austin American Statesman that they had received robocalls on behalf of Perry Campaign and Hutchinson against Medina as an unstable 9-11 truther, echoing Beck's manufactured talking points just an hour earlier.
[00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:25.187]  There can no longer be any doubt that the RNC establishment is running a targeted smear campaign against real grassroots conservatives and libertarians because they are terrified that such individuals will be able to steer the Tea Party movement in a genuine national revolt against big government, thereby massively diminishing the power of the establishment Republicans.
[00:58:25.187 --> 00:58:26.808]  I've got Lord Monckton coming up.
[00:58:26.808 --> 00:58:29.251]  We're going to cover this coming up in the hour after that.
[00:58:30.663 --> 00:58:35.407]  But don't forget this article on Sarah Palin, ladies and gentlemen, showing their hypocrisy.
[00:58:35.407 --> 00:58:37.449]  You gotta get this out to everybody right now.

[01:00:05.296 --> 01:00:06.617]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:08.377]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.377 --> 01:00:10.138]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.138 --> 01:00:11.719]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:12.619]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:17.461]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:21.503]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:40.966]  We are live ladies and gentlemen one hour into this Wednesday 17th day of February 2010 Worldwide broadcast on the AM FM global shortwave satellite number one show on the internet according to Alexis Shoutcasts and other gauges.
[01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:44.667]  Thank you for joining us for the next hour Lord Christopher Moncton
[01:00:45.467 --> 01:00:56.317]  The third Viscount of Moncton and Brinchley, a journalist, a researcher, a scientist, a consultant, one of the top advisors to Margaret Thatcher.
[01:00:56.317 --> 01:00:57.257]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:00:57.257 --> 01:01:02.742]  He just got back from a whirlwind tour of Australia with devastating effect on the fraud there.
[01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:09.808]  Rudd collapsing as the global warming fraud continues to fall in on itself.
[01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:10.709]  Huge developments.
[01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:11.290]  We're going to cover
[01:01:13.132 --> 01:01:19.595]  More than 30 ClimateGate-level scandals that have come out, each overshadowing the next, or the last.
[01:01:19.595 --> 01:01:25.058]  We're also going to cover their counter-strike plans, as Schwarzenegger and others said at Copenhagen, when it was clear it was dead.
[01:01:25.058 --> 01:01:26.538]  They're going to take over the cities and states.
[01:01:26.538 --> 01:01:33.241]  Austin faces $2.6 billion in the next three years in taxes on energy alone, according to Austin Energy and the mayor.
[01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:37.043]  They're set, later this month or early next month, to vote it through.
[01:01:37.043 --> 01:01:38.544]  The UN is involved here locally.
[01:01:39.483 --> 01:01:40.864]  So we're going to look at it all today.
[01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:44.346]  Also, criminal prosecutions of these frauds.
[01:01:44.346 --> 01:01:50.869]  Phil Jones, one of the headmasters at collating the fraudulent data, admitting now that Lord Monckton is right.
[01:01:50.869 --> 01:01:53.350]  Since 1995, no warming.
[01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:57.893]  So we're going to go to break here in a moment, but for the next hour, Lord Christopher Monckton
[01:01:58.873 --> 01:02:12.020]  To chronicle and break down, as no one else can, the leading expert, in my educated opinion, on the full scope of this attempted revolution to bring society under neo-feudalistic serfdom.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.521]  Sir, thank you for joining us.
[01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.862]  Well, Alex, what a wonderful introduction.
[01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:20.885]  I just can't wait to hear what I'm going to say.
[01:02:20.885 --> 01:02:22.445]  We've got about two and a half minutes before we go to break.
[01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:25.147]  Just give us a brief overview of what you're going to be covering.
[01:02:25.865 --> 01:02:36.270]  Well, I think the first thing we've got to do is to say that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that's the UN's climate panel, which has produced four major reports on the climate saying we're all doomed.
[01:02:36.963 --> 01:02:39.265]  is now effectively dead.
[01:02:39.265 --> 01:02:55.796]  There have been so many revelations over recent weeks of its failure to do the science properly, of it deliberately including false and alarming data with the intention and the declared intention of influencing government.
[01:02:55.796 --> 01:02:58.298]  It's all over for the IPCC.
[01:02:58.298 --> 01:03:01.300]  Nobody is going to take it seriously ever again.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.641]  I think that's the main point.
[01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:05.858]  But then you're quite right, as you said in your introduction.
[01:03:05.858 --> 01:03:16.154]  The problem we've now got is that even though national governments are now beginning to realise they can't go on getting away with this because it isn't a vote winner,
[01:03:16.853 --> 01:03:29.577]  Local administrations still bullied by these hugely well-funded environmental lobby groups like Greenpeace, which, as far as I know, has a fleet of ships larger than the British Navy.
[01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:38.099]  Goodness knows where it gets the money from to run them, but I saw one of their huge ships parked up in Copenhagen with propaganda slogans painted all over it.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:54.800]  These organisations are very active at local and state level and what we're going to need to do eventually is at government level simply ban any spending on global warming related matters because this scare is now officially dead.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:06.045]  I want you again today to address the criminal activities, criminal investigations, your continued challenge for Al Gore to debate you.
[01:04:06.045 --> 01:04:08.726]  I have it out of the Dallas Morning News today.
[01:04:08.726 --> 01:04:14.850]  The state of Texas is moving to block Austin and other cities that have literally been paid off
[01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:20.634]  by these organizations to seize the infrastructure and levy taxes.
[01:04:20.634 --> 01:04:30.662]  I mean, the 2.6 billion, and that's Austin Energy, is bigger per year over the three years than the entire current taxing system.
[01:04:30.662 --> 01:04:32.063]  I mean, talk about a power grab!
[01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:58.774]  That's right, it is outrageous what's going on, and the only way to do that is to stop it from the top down, so that eventually everybody realizes that this money-making game, at the expense chiefly of the working taxpayer, it's your blue-collar guy, the guy on whose back, on whose sweater is brown, the rest of us live so comfortably, it's he who is going to get marmalized and clobbered.
[01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:00.094]  Stay there, Lord Monckton.
[01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:00.495]  Gotta break.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.281]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:09.624]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.624 --> 01:05:11.664]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.664 --> 01:05:16.667]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:17.587]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:18.968]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.968 --> 01:05:20.870]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:21.930]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:24.132]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:25.473]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.473 --> 01:05:26.995]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.995 --> 01:05:32.279]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:35.862]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:39.325]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.665 --> 01:05:40.886]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.886 --> 01:05:41.787]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.787 --> 01:05:42.888]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:43.829]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:44.930]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.973]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:06:00.629 --> 01:06:01.789]  What's your home worth?
[01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.910]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.951]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:07:04.183 --> 01:07:07.045]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:49.925]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.853 --> 01:08:08.636]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.636 --> 01:08:10.378]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.960]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.901]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:17.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:21.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.952 --> 01:08:23.793]  We are live.
[01:08:23.793 --> 01:08:26.975]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest.
[01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:36.441]  We'll put his website that is invaluable research to understand this criminal group internationally seeking to really bring in a form of slavery.
[01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:40.564]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:51.391]  We're going to cover a whole host of issues as Lord Monckton briefs us on the open collapse of the carbon tax area of the fake green movement.
[01:08:51.391 --> 01:08:52.572]  But first, sir,
[01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:55.973]  And of course they're regrouping, we'll talk about that.
[01:08:55.973 --> 01:08:58.614]  Tell us about the success of your trip in Australia.
[01:08:58.614 --> 01:09:19.742]  I, every day, tuned in to video clips of you on radio and TV, in debates, packed houses everywhere, hands down, trouncing the opposition, and you could see in their eyes, no longer that arrogant false aplomb, that chutzpah, now they look like beaten men.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.461]  They are in galloping retreat.
[01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:23.381]  It was very interesting.
[01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:30.983]  I mean, I arrived in Australia, nobody there had heard of me, but there was a really good PR guy who came to see me the day I landed.
[01:09:30.983 --> 01:09:34.864]  He said, right, we've laid on a program for you to start going into studios.
[01:09:34.864 --> 01:09:45.807]  The moment that began, then I was rushing from studio to studio, got massive coverage on all the major channels, all the major newspapers, even the left-wing ones couldn't resist having a go at me, as it were.
[01:09:46.374 --> 01:09:56.559]  Then, on our first speaker meeting, which was in the largest ballroom in Sydney, which seats a thousand people, we were absolutely full.
[01:09:56.559 --> 01:10:09.925]  People had began queuing at 10 in the morning for a meeting that began at 5.30 in the afternoon, and they were queuing down three floors of the hotel, right round the grand staircase and out into the street outside.
[01:10:09.925 --> 01:10:12.326]  We had to turn several hundred people away, unfortunately.
[01:10:13.603 --> 01:10:18.086]  Absolutely extraordinary interest, and this happened all over Australia.
[01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:27.232]  We went to the working class district of Newcastle in the Hunter Valley, which is a coal mining area, and we had a small room booked in the town hall.
[01:10:27.232 --> 01:10:32.076]  We had to abandon that and go into the main town hall building itself, which seats a thousand.
[01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:36.899]  Then we had to open the gallery, which seats another few hundred, and even then we had to turn people away.
[01:10:37.512 --> 01:10:39.013]  Same thing happened in Brisbane.
[01:10:39.013 --> 01:10:44.354]  We had a debate there, which I think the other side reckoned we won it by a country mile.
[01:10:44.354 --> 01:10:46.195]  Then we had a meeting at the Irish Club there.
[01:10:46.195 --> 01:10:49.596]  They had never seen so many people in that club as they saw that day.
[01:10:49.596 --> 01:10:52.257]  700 of them jammed into the room.
[01:10:52.257 --> 01:11:03.861]  Then we went up to Noosa, where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Parliament turned up to hear me, and he ended up outside not being able to get in, along with 250 people, because that too was packed out.
[01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:07.923]  So I had an impromptu meeting at the car park to cope with them.
[01:11:07.923 --> 01:11:14.608]  Then we went down to Melbourne, same thing, absolutely packed out, a ballroom seating a thousand, absolutely full.
[01:11:14.608 --> 01:11:21.432]  Then we went up to Canberra and the press club could only seat 300 and we turned at least as many of that away.
[01:11:21.432 --> 01:11:28.757]  Then we went down to Adelaide, same thing happened there, we had an overflow room, that was full as well, we had to go and speak in both rooms.
[01:11:28.757 --> 01:11:30.177]  Then we went up to, um,
[01:11:32.519 --> 01:11:40.143]  Well, they had to lay on not only an overflow room, but an overflow meeting the following day because 2,000 people wanted to hear me speak.
[01:11:40.143 --> 01:11:44.286]  And as we went around Australia, the crowds got bigger and also got younger.
[01:11:44.286 --> 01:11:48.788]  More and more younger people beginning to come to hear the truth about the climate.
[01:11:48.788 --> 01:11:57.073]  So a quite extraordinary, overwhelming response, as a result of which I got to meet the leader of the opposition, Tony Abbott, who, if you remember, won office
[01:11:58.544 --> 01:12:23.396]  As Leader of the Opposition, over Malcolm Turnbull, his rival, who had previously supported Australia's attempt to have a carbon trading sort of cap and tax scheme, like that which the Democrats in America want, and Turnbull was defeated by his own party, and Tony Abbott, who is sceptical about climate change, has taken over, the first politician to win office, because he doesn't believe this nonsense.
[01:12:23.396 --> 01:12:26.077]  So, it was a very good time we had in Australia,
[01:12:26.883 --> 01:12:43.805]  Um, very, very receptive audiences, 500 mentions of the tour in the media, both print and electronic, uh, and, uh, according to the people who invited me there, two retired engineers from, from NUSO who organized the whole thing and paid for it out of their own pockets, fortunately.
[01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:50.004]  We made the money back by the huge crowd that turned up all paying their $20 to hear me talk.
[01:12:50.004 --> 01:12:52.665]  But it was an astonishing event.
[01:12:52.665 --> 01:12:57.007]  They said that this has actually changed the opinion in Australia.
[01:12:57.007 --> 01:12:58.568]  Now why has it done that?
[01:12:58.568 --> 01:13:09.894]  Not because I'm a brilliant speaker, but because people were absolutely desperate to hear the other side of the story, which they couldn't get in the mainstream news media.
[01:13:09.894 --> 01:13:13.295]  Because the mainstream news media won't even give you the facts.
[01:13:13.295 --> 01:13:14.436]  They won't even tell you.
[01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:22.568]  That global warming over the last 15 years hasn't been happening in any statistically significant sense.
[01:13:22.568 --> 01:13:34.436]  That has now, at last, been publicly admitted by Phil Jones, who's the head of the now deposed and disgraced head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.
[01:13:34.436 --> 01:13:42.541]  He's been chucked out because he was caught trying to suppress and tamper with and hide and even destroy scientific data.
[01:13:43.101 --> 01:13:49.344]  And the Climategate emails that got released by a whistleblower that have been all around the web did for him.
[01:13:49.344 --> 01:13:57.428]  But he was then interviewed by a sympathetic BBC interviewer who nevertheless got in touch with me first and said, what questions should I ask?
[01:13:57.428 --> 01:14:04.651]  And I said, one thing you should ask is whether there has been any statistically significant global warming for the last 15 years.
[01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:10.974]  And Phil Jones, albeit through gritted teeth, had to admit what he had never before ever publicly said.
[01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:13.455]  Yes, I've been right all along.
[01:14:13.455 --> 01:14:19.138]  There hasn't been any significant global warming for 15 long years.
[01:14:19.138 --> 01:14:21.259]  A decade and a half.
[01:14:21.259 --> 01:14:30.824]  I mean, that is the most extraordinary admission by somebody who had been pushing out the official line of the rest of the most recent decade has been the warmest on the record.
[01:14:30.824 --> 01:14:32.025]  Yes, it has.
[01:14:32.025 --> 01:14:37.688]  But we still haven't had any significant warming for 15 years.
[01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:39.809]  Now they're beginning to have to tell us the truth.
[01:14:43.328 --> 01:14:46.931]  Having concealed it from their own readers for a long time.
[01:14:46.931 --> 01:14:49.774]  And I think that's the value of the Australian tour.
[01:14:49.774 --> 01:14:56.700]  It made the Australian media and many others around the world realize that by deliberately suppressing
[01:14:57.273 --> 01:15:06.017]  The facts that don't happen to fit their chosen storyline about the alarming dreadful supposed global warming problem, they are not doing their readers any favour.
[01:15:06.017 --> 01:15:10.719]  They've now got to start at least giving the facts, whatever opinions they may like to have, is another matter.
[01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:17.362]  But they must now do their job and give us the proper, unbiased, scientific facts.
[01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:18.122]  Because if they don't,
[01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:24.079]  Then, as I said many times, because everywhere I went I was asked this question, what about the mainstream media?
[01:15:24.079 --> 01:15:25.240]  I said it's quite simple.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:40.051]  If they go on refusing to give you the facts, and you have to turn to Alex Jones and the electronic, you know, the radio shock jock and the internet to get your news because the mainstream television and newspapers won't give you the facts,
[01:15:40.563 --> 01:15:48.189]  Then the mainstream television and newspapers will lose audiences, and they will go bust one by one, and deservedly so.
[01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:49.390]  And they are going bust.
[01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.032]  I was cheered to the echo.
[01:15:51.032 --> 01:15:52.012]  And they are going bust.
[01:15:52.012 --> 01:16:08.226]  I mean, the points you make raise so many other issues, but the bottom line is you are a brilliant speaker because you've done the research, you've been right for 20 years, you recognize more than 20 years ago the danger of this criminal
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:09.640]  I think?
[01:16:30.925 --> 01:16:36.087]  We see the global battle against this fraud.
[01:16:36.087 --> 01:16:42.690]  Every time we do stand up and take action, we have success, and nothing succeeds like success.
[01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:51.554]  And so now that we have lost this feeling of helplessness, and we now have the true spirit of empowerment,
[01:16:52.094 --> 01:17:06.083]  The route is intensifying, and they've recognized that they're bald-faced, denying, and stonewalling, and ignoring Climategate for two weeks entirely, and Newsweek saying it's a conspiracy theory, Climategate didn't even happen.
[01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.304]  This is only further
[01:17:07.944 --> 01:17:10.486]  Destroying them, Lord Monckton, as you know.
[01:17:10.486 --> 01:17:13.788]  So how do you see this shaking out now?
[01:17:13.788 --> 01:17:16.730]  How do you see them counter-striking?
[01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:24.376]  They haven't spent, as you know, hundreds of billions of dollars financing this takeover to go quietly into the night.
[01:17:24.821 --> 01:17:27.503]  No, I think that's very well put.
[01:17:27.503 --> 01:17:47.076]  They're going to want to make sure that having invested all this time and effort, and of course it's not their money they've spent, it's your money they've spent, it's the taxpayer's money they've spent on furthering this care, of course they're going to want to get their dividend in the way of closing down the Western economies, but I don't think that's now going to happen.
[01:17:47.842 --> 01:17:50.523]  I think that financial recession hasn't helped them.
[01:17:50.523 --> 01:18:01.027]  It began really, the rot, when the financial recession set in and people began thinking, you know, do we really believe this climate stuff because it's going to be very expensive if we do.
[01:18:01.027 --> 01:18:05.349]  And then came climate change, then came the cold northern hemisphere, winter.
[01:18:05.349 --> 01:18:12.172]  In fact, interestingly, the January temperatures worldwide were the highest
[01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:21.172]  Since satellite records began 32 years ago, because there's an El Nino going on, so sea temperatures are very much higher than they would normally be.
[01:18:21.172 --> 01:18:27.117]  And interestingly, we think that that may be caused by undersea volcanic activity in the East Pacific.
[01:18:27.117 --> 01:18:29.940]  Nothing whatever to do with global warming caused by us.
[01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:40.107]  So gradually all these facts about how the climate really works are beginning to come out and the media can no longer suppress them.
[01:18:40.107 --> 01:18:58.212]  And so what I think the usual suspects are going to do now is they're going to realise that trying to maintain these endless scare stories about the climate when the climate simply isn't warming as they had predicted that it would is not going to work.
[01:18:58.212 --> 01:19:00.153]  So what they're going to do instead, I think,
[01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:15.196]  is to go quiet for a bit and they'll beaver away at local level rather than at national level because at national level we are watching and we will stop them and you've got wonderful organisations like Fox News.
[01:19:15.196 --> 01:19:17.437]  Now how has that done so well?
[01:19:17.437 --> 01:19:21.899]  It's done well because it does give you on this and on so many other subjects the fact
[01:19:22.532 --> 01:19:27.678]  That the mainstream news media otherwise won't give because they've become so politicised.
[01:19:27.678 --> 01:19:33.103]  They're all effectively Marxist or totalitarian anyway in the way they look at things.
[01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:36.106]  And Fox News is simply saying, well, we will give the facts.
[01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:44.275]  And so half, just about half now, of the entire television news audience watches Fox News because otherwise it won't get the facts.
[01:19:45.192 --> 01:20:07.349]  They've just been reading, for instance, a remarkably stupid piece in the Salt Lake Tribute, which is an extreme left-wing paper, which absolutely hates the conservative Republican administration there, which has, as you may know, passed a resolution saying global warming is nonsense and we're not going to spend any more money on it.
[01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:14.675]  And that the Utah State Legislature has been the first to break ranks and say we're not having any more of this nonsense.
[01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:17.652]  And the local newspaper is absolutely furious.
[01:20:17.652 --> 01:20:24.694]  And so it rang up a scientist and got a quote, every single point of which was a lie.
[01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:28.255]  So I wrote to the reporter concerning him, what on earth do you think you're doing?
[01:20:28.255 --> 01:20:39.138]  Why don't you ask this so-called scientist whether he has qualifications in climatology, paleoclimatology, physics, chemistry, mathematics.
[01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:46.517]  And various other subjects on which he was claiming to be an authority because of the statements he made, every single one of which was wrong.
[01:20:46.517 --> 01:20:50.301]  It turns out he wasn't any kind of climate scientist at all.
[01:20:50.301 --> 01:20:58.369]  And this is the trouble, they just go to the people they know will sing the song they want to hear, rather than going to the people who actually know what the truth is.
[01:20:58.849 --> 01:21:07.593]  And these local news media and these local administrations are definitely a pain and they're going to have to be dealt with and dealt with very firmly.
[01:21:07.593 --> 01:21:22.099]  The way we've done this in the past in the United Kingdom, where you get a tough-minded, conservatively-minded government in office, is actually to circumscribe their powers so that they are forbidden to spend money on things like global warming.
[01:21:22.099 --> 01:21:24.780]  You actually just tell them that is outwith their powers to do that.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:34.665]  And if you do that, I know it's harder in the States to do that than it is in the UK, but you can nevertheless constrain quite a bit what they spend the money on.
[01:21:34.665 --> 01:21:51.114]  And the other thing is that now that the people are beginning to realise what rubbish this all is, and how much it's going to cost them, and in particular that it's going to cost working people because they spend a bigger proportion on electricity and gasoline than everybody else.
[01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.132]  They are the ones that are going to get hurt by this.
[01:21:54.132 --> 01:21:59.715]  It doesn't matter what Henry Waxman or Ed Markey say about how they're going to compensate them.
[01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:04.618]  The fact is, if they compensate them, then their bill won't make any difference to carbon emissions.
[01:22:04.618 --> 01:22:08.160]  If they don't compensate them, then it's their own voters that are going to lose.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.061]  Either way, an ETS is just madness.
[01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:15.124]  Any kind of emissions trading scheme, cap and trade, call it what you like, is now doomed.
[01:22:15.604 --> 01:22:16.025]  I don't think so.
[01:22:33.368 --> 01:22:47.354]  Then people will leave and already there's a kind of wagon train no longer heading west heading east back out of California with businesses getting out of California because California hates business and in the end
[01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:55.382]  The governor is going to run out of money, because he'd have driven all the businesses away that used to pay the taxes that kept him in Clover.
[01:22:55.382 --> 01:23:12.577]  Then we'll learn in the end that they can't get away with this, that the people will vote with their feet and get out of local administrations or state administrations that try to impose extra global warming taxes now that we know that global warming, as Henry Ford might have put it, is bunk.
[01:23:12.577 --> 01:23:13.298]  Yes, and
[01:23:15.134 --> 01:23:29.526]  Continuing along that line and understanding that they're going to come back at us, the state of Texas has announced they are moving to pass laws against cities because you can't have cities operating outside state laws.
[01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:35.331]  The cities and counties are chartered by the state and under its constitution.
[01:23:36.716 --> 01:23:43.203]  And we have everybody, literally millions, moving every few years out of California, mainly to Texas.
[01:23:43.203 --> 01:23:47.748]  That's why the UN lobbyists are here in Austin.
[01:23:47.748 --> 01:23:49.330]  This is the big battleground.
[01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:51.952]  They're trying to hurry and pass it this month or next month.
[01:23:51.952 --> 01:23:53.794]  They were going to pass it in about six months.
[01:23:53.794 --> 01:23:54.515]  They're in a hurry.
[01:23:55.456 --> 01:23:56.738]  And I agree with you.
[01:23:56.738 --> 01:23:58.780]  They're now saying, OK, you win.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.042]  It's not real.
[01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:00.883]  Go back to sleep.
[01:24:00.883 --> 01:24:06.330]  You won because they know now that when they give us a fight back that we know we're winning.
[01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:08.953]  So that only energizes the people to take action.
[01:24:08.953 --> 01:24:10.034]  So they're going to play possum.
[01:24:10.655 --> 01:24:13.397]  And they're going to call it green jobs.
[01:24:13.397 --> 01:24:19.461]  Now, they've always done that to a certain extent, but they now have almost 100% shifted out of saying global warming.
[01:24:19.461 --> 01:24:20.261]  We've got to save you.
[01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:21.742]  Sky is falling, too.
[01:24:21.742 --> 01:24:24.304]  The economy is dead.
[01:24:24.304 --> 01:24:26.085]  Only a green job will save you.
[01:24:26.085 --> 01:24:34.131]  But in Australia, in Canada, in Spain, as you know, police, sir, I'd like you to break it down and give people the actual numbers.
[01:24:34.131 --> 01:24:37.453]  Green jobs cost on average two jobs for every job you create.
[01:24:37.893 --> 01:24:43.536]  It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund each low-paying green job and it doesn't work.
[01:24:43.536 --> 01:24:58.144]  It's a boondoggle to their friends and Al Gore and others that own large stakes in the select green companies that the county, cities, and states are forced with the federal money to purchase these systems from.
[01:24:58.812 --> 01:25:06.518]  That's exactly right, and of course what you're talking about there, that two jobs destroyed for every one created, that's what's known as the Friedman Factor.
[01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:10.161]  He won the Nobel Prize for Economics for pointing out
[01:25:10.595 --> 01:25:19.703]  But if the state, the taxpayer, is made to pay to create a job, every job that's created will destroy two jobs in the private sector.
[01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:22.706]  And that's why you have to keep the public sector small.
[01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:35.257]  And of course, this green jobs argument is just another socialistic or communistic or totalitarian way of expanding the state-funded, publicly-funded jobs.
[01:25:36.457 --> 01:25:38.998]  And destroying the private sector as they go.
[01:25:38.998 --> 01:25:57.187]  And of course Democrats are always willing to do that, because they know that most corporations don't vote Democrat, they don't like to contribute to the Democrats, and therefore they would rather shut down corporate America, because they think they will gain political advantage by doing it.
[01:25:57.187 --> 01:25:59.428]  They don't care if they drive your nation bankrupt.
[01:26:00.074 --> 01:26:06.718]  And of course, green jobs, as I said in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee of Congress and the Ways and Means Committee, I said the same thing to both of them.
[01:26:06.718 --> 01:26:10.120]  I said green jobs are the new unemployment.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:19.486]  If you want to create unemployment, the fastest way to do it is for taxpayers to be made to subsidize these bulldoggles, as you have so rightly called them.
[01:26:19.486 --> 01:26:25.910]  There is no economic basis for wind farms, nor is there an environmental basis.
[01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:46.688]  It gives incredible power to the government to give their friends and families and others the money and we have Obama, we have Pachari for those that don't know, the former or current head of the IPCC and others all openly making Al Gore masses of money off of this and specifically not only that Nobel Prize winning paper
[01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:52.612]  On the fact that government destroys jobs for every job it creates, it kills at least two.
[01:26:52.612 --> 01:27:10.804]  We know in Spain, this is in Bloomberg, their own government admits every green job destroyed two jobs and cost additional money on top of that and we have England shutting down its steelworks paying to move it to Pachari's own steelworks that he owns.
[01:27:10.804 --> 01:27:11.625]  I mean this is
[01:27:12.385 --> 01:27:16.588]  I think if you take that Redcar Steelworks thing, there was a report about that at last.
[01:27:30.397 --> 01:27:35.040]  On BBC television today, they've been almost sullenly silent about it.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:54.972]  And they mentioned it today, and did they mention that this was because Europe has an emissions trading scheme and carbon cap and trade, and India doesn't, and that's why the Indian Steelworks that owns the Redcar Steelworks is moving it to India, and that Indian Steelworks is the one that employs Pachauri?
[01:27:54.972 --> 01:27:56.673]  None of that was made plain.
[01:27:56.673 --> 01:27:58.734]  They just said it was world economic factors.
[01:27:59.195 --> 01:28:01.980]  That we're causing, you know, world economic load-up was causing that.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:03.062]  It still works, the shut.
[01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:03.383]  It wasn't!
[01:28:04.119 --> 01:28:08.222]  It was that we've got cap-and-trade, and India hasn't.
[01:28:08.222 --> 01:28:16.508]  And our jobs are being exported to India, where precisely the same steel work is going to be built, employing precisely the same number of people.
[01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:25.874]  So there will be absolutely no benefit to the planet whatsoever, but quite unnecessarily, we will have destroyed 1,700 British jobs.
[01:28:25.874 --> 01:28:31.398]  And none of the major political parties has said sorry to these
[01:28:32.097 --> 01:28:33.778]  But the good news is, all over the country,
[01:28:51.035 --> 01:28:52.936]  People are recognizing what this is.
[01:28:52.936 --> 01:29:12.065]  Of course, the provision they've now passed in Utah, we have him coming up in the next hour, the state rep that actually introduced the bill, and he has rightfully said this is a eugenics operation, this is a population reduction move, this is a plan to de-industrialize the West.
[01:29:12.065 --> 01:29:17.348]  All he's doing is quoting from the UN, quoting from the very people that set this up.
[01:29:18.513 --> 01:29:35.049]  Quoting from Maurice Strong, who said 25 years ago that he was setting up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as an intergovernmental rather than a scientific panel, precisely so that it could be transmogrified into a world government one day.
[01:29:35.049 --> 01:29:36.450]  That's what he said.
[01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:37.251]  Jacques Chirac.
[01:29:37.811 --> 01:29:43.696]  He said some years ago that he wanted the world government to come out of the U.S.
[01:29:43.696 --> 01:29:44.396]  climate.
[01:29:44.396 --> 01:29:45.497]  Lord Monckton, stay there.
[01:29:45.497 --> 01:29:46.038]  We gotta break.
[01:29:46.038 --> 01:29:51.462]  Let's come back and cover world government and all the other scandals with Climategate.
[01:29:51.462 --> 01:29:52.843]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.843 --> 01:29:55.385]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:58.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:05.169]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.169 --> 01:30:06.090]  Number one.
[01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:09.512]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.512 --> 01:30:10.372]  Number two.
[01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:15.255]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.255 --> 01:30:16.016]  It's true.
[01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:20.559]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:21.700]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:25.283]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.283 --> 01:30:29.206]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:30.007]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:32.769]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.769 --> 01:30:36.452]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.452 --> 01:30:36.673]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.213 --> 01:30:41.376]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.376 --> 01:30:46.419]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.419 --> 01:30:50.601]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.601 --> 01:30:52.382]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.382 --> 01:30:56.985]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:04.092]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:09.417]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:11.459]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.459 --> 01:31:16.464]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.464 --> 01:31:17.385]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.645 --> 01:31:18.766]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:20.647]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.647 --> 01:31:21.728]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.728 --> 01:31:23.929]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.929 --> 01:31:25.270]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:26.791]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:32.055]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.055 --> 01:31:35.637]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.637 --> 01:31:39.120]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.681]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:41.582]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.582 --> 01:31:42.703]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.703 --> 01:31:43.624]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:44.725]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.725 --> 01:31:47.768]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:49.550]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:50.471]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.183]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:32:04.183 --> 01:32:07.065]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:07.065 --> 01:32:09.147]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:09.147 --> 01:32:11.389]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:11.389 --> 01:32:13.030]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:17.513]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:32:17.513 --> 01:32:19.795]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.055 --> 01:32:26.076]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:32:26.076 --> 01:32:30.877]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:32:30.877 --> 01:32:33.698]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:33.698 --> 01:32:36.418]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:43.580]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.603]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:47.603 --> 01:32:47.864]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:47.864 --> 01:32:49.785]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:33:07.466 --> 01:33:11.107]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org is his website.
[01:33:11.107 --> 01:33:16.049]  Our websites, of course, are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:22.672]  My film, Fall of the Republic, and The Obama Deception, detail, from their own documents, the UN's own admissions,
[01:33:23.732 --> 01:33:26.916]  White House officials, how they want to destroy our industrial base.
[01:33:26.916 --> 01:33:31.301]  They think we eat too much, we have swimming pools, too many cars, too many children.
[01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:32.582]  These are control freaks.
[01:33:32.582 --> 01:33:44.455]  Lord Monckton is a champion of freedom who's been fighting these people for more than two decades and now it is paying off big time because of his steadfastness, his dogged determination and many others.
[01:33:44.455 --> 01:33:44.615]  Now,
[01:33:45.656 --> 01:33:47.017]  Sir, you got cut off by the break.
[01:33:47.017 --> 01:33:59.405]  You were getting into all these world leaders calling for global governance and saying the keystone, the cornerstone of this is the phony environmental movement.
[01:33:59.405 --> 01:34:00.766]  Continue.
[01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:02.347]  Yes, that's right.
[01:34:02.347 --> 01:34:14.655]  These people have been using the environmental movement as a way of advancing political objectives that have nothing whatsoever to do with the environment.
[01:34:15.293 --> 01:34:30.408]  We're dealing with Marxists who piled out of the Berlin Wall and into the environmental movement, and a very great friend of ours, Eric Ellington, who was one of the founders of Greenpeace, who sadly died just two days ago.
[01:34:30.408 --> 01:34:38.136]  He left Greenpeace shortly after he founded it, because so many of these people had come in and taken the organization over.
[01:34:38.686 --> 01:34:52.972]  For purposes that had nothing whatever to do with protecting the environment, and were all about achieving political objectives that were bitterly and wickedly hostile to the interests of the West.
[01:34:52.972 --> 01:35:04.857]  So this has really been a very, very sad business, that the genuine environmental movement has been almost entirely captured now by people who hate the West,
[01:35:05.757 --> 01:35:18.365]  And who hate success, who hate industry, who hate humanity, who rightly said before the break, they are there to try to get humanity to be killed in its billions.
[01:35:18.365 --> 01:35:22.027]  They would like to reduce the population, some of them have said, to just one billion.
[01:35:22.027 --> 01:35:24.608]  There's a seven billion it's coming up to at the moment.
[01:35:24.608 --> 01:35:28.731]  They say that any more than that and we're encroaching too much on the planet.
[01:35:28.731 --> 01:35:34.274]  And they're prepared to use the most draconian methods, including starvation, to achieve their end.
[01:35:35.183 --> 01:35:40.928]  And that, of course, is what has happened as a direct result of the global warming scare.
[01:35:40.928 --> 01:35:44.791]  Because there are millions starving in the third world now.
[01:35:44.791 --> 01:35:47.413]  Millions more than would otherwise have been starving.
[01:35:47.413 --> 01:35:53.779]  Because the biofuel scam into which all the foolish governments of the world galloped in the name of saving the planet.
[01:35:54.477 --> 01:36:07.980]  Has taken millions of acres of agricultural land out of growing food for people who needed it, and now it's growing biofuels for clunkers that don't, making Al Gore and various absolute bankers very, very rich.
[01:36:09.044 --> 01:36:18.070]  And by the way, this is not rhetoric.
[01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:20.172]  I mean, these are admitted facts.
[01:36:20.172 --> 01:36:21.633]  They want to starve people.
[01:36:21.633 --> 01:36:23.774]  They want to control the wealth.
[01:36:23.774 --> 01:36:27.057]  They want to set up a planetary tyranny.
[01:36:27.057 --> 01:36:28.698]  Expanding on that,
[01:36:29.679 --> 01:36:32.663]  You, of course, have called out Al Gore many times.
[01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:34.325]  I would like you to do that again today.
[01:36:34.325 --> 01:36:37.369]  You've called for criminal investigations.
[01:36:37.369 --> 01:36:44.499]  These guys, years ago, in major papers, called for your arrest, called for the death penalty for people that are climate deniers.
[01:36:44.499 --> 01:36:45.861]  Cass Sunstein at the White House.
[01:36:46.562 --> 01:36:48.083]  Says he wants to make it illegal.
[01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:49.743]  I don't know if you've seen that paper.
[01:36:49.743 --> 01:36:56.706]  It only came out in the last month that he wrote a year and a half ago for the Chicago Law School.
[01:36:56.706 --> 01:37:01.368]  I mean, they have truly committed the crimes to carry out this fraud.
[01:37:01.368 --> 01:37:04.830]  So can you speak to that area and then secondarily,
[01:37:06.683 --> 01:37:13.605]  Giant events have taken place, each one bigger than the last, of new frauds.
[01:37:13.605 --> 01:37:17.106]  New cooking the books and the thermostat records.
[01:37:17.106 --> 01:37:24.609]  I know you know about that, but can you chronicle some of the Glacier Gates and other things that are coming out now on a daily basis?
[01:37:24.609 --> 01:37:25.269]  The Met Office?
[01:37:25.269 --> 01:37:29.810]  Well, it is an absolutely extraordinary story, what we're getting.
[01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:34.612]  And let's just look at the latest of them, which you probably haven't even heard of yourself because it's so new.
[01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:46.212]  The UN's climate panel has underestimated the growth in Antarctic sea ice over the last 30 years by 50%.
[01:37:46.212 --> 01:37:52.558]  They've been concentrating on saying, oh, but look how the Arctic sea ice has been diminishing.
[01:37:52.558 --> 01:37:56.842]  Well, it has, but the Antarctic sea ice has been increasing almost as much.
[01:37:57.631 --> 01:37:58.793]  And yet you'd never know it.
[01:38:08.982 --> 01:38:21.045]  Yes, I mean, this is yet another error that's been found, and you'll find a very good detailed explanation of this at whatsupwiththat.com, which I expect you know quite well.
[01:38:21.045 --> 01:38:23.506]  It's a very good website by Anthony Watt.
[01:38:23.506 --> 01:38:26.827]  W-A-T-T-S, up with that, or one word, dot com.
[01:38:26.827 --> 01:38:35.069]  And his lead story at the moment is on what he calls IPCC gate du jour, Antarctic sea ice increase underestimated by 50 percent.
[01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:36.649]  He's got the graph.
[01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:38.050]  He's shown you how they've bent it.
[01:38:38.050 --> 01:38:43.871]  He's got a detailed description of what they did and how they went about it and how dishonest it is.
[01:38:43.871 --> 01:38:50.213]  Because, of course, as Arctic sea ice extent has declined, Antarctic sea ice has increased to match it.
[01:38:50.213 --> 01:38:53.153]  And so global sea ice extent hasn't changed at all.
[01:38:53.153 --> 01:38:54.834]  You'd not know that if you read the media.
[01:38:54.834 --> 01:38:55.894]  But let's just go through
[01:38:56.494 --> 01:39:07.977]  Some of the other errors that have come to light will start with the one that I spotted when the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the UN Climate Panel, the IPCC, came out.
[01:39:07.977 --> 01:39:12.218]  Now that, that they've done four of these big assessment reports, that's the most recent one.
[01:39:12.218 --> 01:39:22.181]  On the day it came out, I saw that they, the bureaucrats, had put in a graph, a table of figures rather, that hadn't been in the original document.
[01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:31.417]  And so I protested and said, by the way, this doesn't even add up to within a factor of two of the total you've put at the bottom of this news table.
[01:39:31.417 --> 01:39:42.124]  And also, you've multiplied by ten the observed contributions to sea level rise of not only the Greenland, but also the Antarctic land-based ice sheets.
[01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:43.591]  Well, I said that.
[01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:44.011]  Racist!
[01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:51.533]  You have no basis putting in, as bureaucrats, tables of figures like this, which the scientists haven't signed off on.
[01:39:51.533 --> 01:39:54.514]  And on the piece of paper, it's all wrong!
[01:39:54.514 --> 01:39:57.674]  And on the piece of paper, it's all wrong!
[01:39:57.674 --> 01:40:00.595]  A 10-year-old in math class could tell it was a fraud!
[01:40:00.595 --> 01:40:02.555]  I mean, they're so shoddy!
[01:40:02.555 --> 01:40:05.356]  I mean, take Glacier Gate from the Himalayas.
[01:40:05.876 --> 01:40:15.382]  Where they used a mountaineering student's photos and a cell phone call saying, looks like the ice is disappearing as their scientific proof.
[01:40:15.382 --> 01:40:23.627]  That's right, and they didn't bother to talk to Professor Pat of the Indian Geological Survey, who's kept me briefed on the Himalayan glaciers for years.
[01:40:23.627 --> 01:40:30.791]  And he has said all along, and he's now been proven right, that there's absolutely no basis for the idea that all that ice will be gone in 25 years.
[01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.672]  He says there's no danger of it going anywhere.
[01:40:32.912 --> 01:40:49.138]  And we also know that the lead author of the chapter of the IPCC's report that said this was going to disappear in 25 years, Mr Marlion Knight, he said that he knew that figure was wrong but he left it in there because he wanted to influence government.
[01:40:49.138 --> 01:40:49.738]  In other words,
[01:40:50.285 --> 01:40:52.906]  It's yet another deliberate lie.
[01:40:52.906 --> 01:40:56.987]  It's like Al Gore saying sea levels are going to rise imminently by 20 feet.
[01:40:56.987 --> 01:41:07.229]  And we know he knows that's a lie because he buys himself a condo feet from the ocean at Fisherman's Wharf the same year he's making the film in which he tells the lie.
[01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:11.450]  It's that kind of thing where we're now catching them out not only telling the lies but
[01:41:11.817 --> 01:41:22.204]  They're pretty much admitting that they're lying deliberately for the sake of exerting a political influence on government rather than just reporting the science correctly.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.301]  And that's not all.
[01:41:25.301 --> 01:41:31.926]  I mean, if you look at the other ones, we've had African agriculture was going to be destroyed by climate change.
[01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:41.313]  They've now had to admit that, in fact, even two or three Celsius of warming, which we aren't going to see, but even if we did, it would be highly beneficial to African agriculture.
[01:41:41.313 --> 01:41:44.595]  It would lead to a further... Schwarzenegger says they're going to lose...
[01:41:45.696 --> 01:41:50.158]  Schwarzenegger says they're going to lose all the grapes for wine in California.
[01:41:50.158 --> 01:41:51.939]  Just asinine lies.
[01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:55.621]  Well actually they are because they've lost them to frost a couple of years running.
[01:41:55.621 --> 01:41:57.881]  They've had exceptional frost in California.
[01:41:57.881 --> 01:42:01.103]  It's been very bad for all the grapes and the fruit crops generally down there.
[01:42:01.563 --> 01:42:03.324]  The orange crops have been damaged as well.
[01:42:03.324 --> 01:42:05.925]  You know, the citrus crops had a hard time there.
[01:42:05.925 --> 01:42:09.387]  But that's because of global cooling, not because of global warming.
[01:42:09.387 --> 01:42:12.429]  Then we had the story about the Amazon rainforest.
[01:42:12.429 --> 01:42:14.990]  40% they said were going to disappear because of global warming.
[01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:27.157]  That turned out to be made up by a campaigner for the World Wide Fund for Nature, another of the wretched environmental groups run by communists, funded by communist governments overseas.
[01:42:27.778 --> 01:42:31.765]  They have sovereign wealth, the like of which you and I will never see.
[01:42:35.532 --> 01:42:41.455]  66% of Holland would be underwater, when in fact only 26% of it is below sea level.
[01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:45.077]  Then they said that there was going to be damage from extreme weather events.
[01:42:45.077 --> 01:42:48.499]  Now they've had to admit that there's no basis for that whatsoever.
[01:42:48.499 --> 01:42:58.305]  Then they said there were going to be more hurricanes because of global warming, and they were warned by the resignation of one of the lead authors of that chapter that they mustn't go on saying that.
[01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.866]  They went on saying it anyway.
[01:43:00.206 --> 01:43:06.899]  Now that's been turned out to have been written by a journalist from a Marxist newspaper in Britain, not by a scientist.
[01:43:07.398 --> 01:43:11.199]  And day after day, new revelations come out.
[01:43:11.199 --> 01:43:34.726]  I confronted Pachauri with another one of these in Copenhagen, because the headline graph in the entire 2007 assessment report of the UN was a graph showing that the rate of increase in temperatures has itself been accelerating over the last 150 years, with the implication stated in the report in three different places, that it was we who had caused this acceleration in warming.
[01:43:35.214 --> 01:43:38.138]  In fact, there hasn't been an acceleration of the warming rate.
[01:43:38.138 --> 01:43:41.442]  That whole thing is entirely bogus.
[01:43:41.442 --> 01:43:47.510]  They used a statistical technique that I was taught not to use in Statistics 101.
[01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:51.996]  They had no basis for using this cheap trick, which, um,
[01:43:52.682 --> 01:43:54.103]  So we know it's a natural cycle?
[01:44:13.755 --> 01:44:16.960]  Alright, now that brings me to my next question.
[01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:39.392]  The fraud goes on forever, and the UN, the media, the spammers that come on our websites, they repeat the same thing.
[01:44:39.392 --> 01:44:50.223]  You are liars, we have thousands of peer-reviewed studies, but then all those studies are based on UN-collected and private environmental group-collected data.
[01:44:51.181 --> 01:45:03.453]  That every time you spot check it is a premeditated fraud, not an error, and they've spent hundreds of billions globally, as you know, pushing this Lord Mocton, and so my question to you is,
[01:45:05.114 --> 01:45:12.758]  Doesn't there need to be criminal charges on thousands of people and hundreds of organizations if we're truly going to route these people?
[01:45:12.758 --> 01:45:15.039]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall!
[01:45:15.039 --> 01:45:19.802]  All you need to do is to pick on one or two who have plainly overstepped the line.
[01:45:19.802 --> 01:45:30.668]  Because remember that fraud, like any serious imprisonable criminal offense, is one which has, quite rightly, a very high standard of proof.
[01:45:31.437 --> 01:45:44.165]  You have to be able to prove that the person committing the fraud was either grossly negligent and therefore looked the other way when he was cheating people, or was deliberately cheating them.
[01:45:44.165 --> 01:45:54.492]  And unless you can prove one of those two things, and prove that what he did involved other people in losses, and prove that what he did involved him in gaining at their expense.
[01:45:54.492 --> 01:45:57.034]  If you can't prove all that, you can't prove a fraud.
[01:45:57.034 --> 01:45:59.175]  So what I would do is I would pick out, for instance,
[01:45:59.775 --> 01:46:02.398]  Let's take him as an example.
[01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:09.144]  Now, he is a trustee of a charity in the United Kingdom called TERI-Europe.
[01:46:09.144 --> 01:46:12.847]  That's the Tatar Industries Energy Research Institute for Europe.
[01:46:12.847 --> 01:46:17.251]  Now, Tatar Industries, just to get this clear, they are the people who
[01:46:18.203 --> 01:46:26.265]  closed down the steelworks at Redcar costing 1,700 of our workers their jobs over the next three months.
[01:46:26.265 --> 01:46:28.686]  That's who Tatar Industries are.
[01:46:28.686 --> 01:46:33.828]  They have a charity in the United Kingdom called TERI-Europe.
[01:46:33.828 --> 01:46:39.969]  It is registered with our Charity Commission, which requires it to file accurate accounts every year.
[01:46:39.969 --> 01:46:45.711]  Now, for the last three years, it hasn't filed any accounts because it has made declarations to the Charity Commission
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:51.703]  That it received in each of those years less than £10,000 in income.
[01:46:51.703 --> 01:47:09.294]  However, I found on a government website a statement saying that that particular charity had been paid £30,000 in just one of those three years in income to do a particular job for the government and that income was not disclosed to the charity commission.
[01:47:09.995 --> 01:47:17.581]  And on further investigation, it turns out that several hundred thousand pounds of income each year has not been declared.
[01:47:17.581 --> 01:47:23.225]  And they've therefore got away with hiding from the charity commission where it is that they're getting their money from.
[01:47:23.225 --> 01:47:26.708]  They're getting it, in fact, largely from British government taxpayer sources.
[01:47:26.708 --> 01:47:32.232]  So, sir, you're saying then it's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
[01:47:32.232 --> 01:47:33.373]  Let me throw out a few other names then.
[01:47:34.882 --> 01:47:51.346]  First of all, that means Pachauri, whose job as a trustee is to file accurate accounts, is now going to face criminal prosecution in the United Kingdom for false accounting, which is a serious, imprisonable criminal offence.
[01:47:51.346 --> 01:48:01.429]  He has been dodging his obligation as a trustee, and two English trustees have now got themselves reclassified as not being trustees, so as to leave him alone in the fray.
[01:48:02.165 --> 01:48:08.367]  And they, the police, are now going to go after them too for trying to get themselves reclassified as not being trustees.
[01:48:08.367 --> 01:48:10.808]  It's a very, very murky business, this.
[01:48:10.808 --> 01:48:23.133]  And what we're now doing, we're looking at the financial vested interest of several of the scientists and Al Gore types and businessmen and politicians who are advocating this stuff.
[01:48:23.133 --> 01:48:26.114]  And we're finding wherever we look that they have
[01:48:26.716 --> 01:48:37.102]  Um, financial links with organized crime, financial links with huge corporations that are making money out of carbon trading and banks and so forth.
[01:48:37.102 --> 01:48:39.683]  Al Gore was on the board of Lehman Brothers.
[01:48:39.683 --> 01:48:42.885]  They were trying to corner the market in carbon trading.
[01:48:42.885 --> 01:48:47.047]  They were so busy doing that they didn't look to their main business and they deservedly went bust.
[01:48:48.323 --> 01:48:57.050]  But these people, there are links everywhere to huge financial vested interests and a great deal of criminal activity.
[01:48:57.050 --> 01:49:08.659]  If you look, for instance, at the European carbon trading scheme that's been running for several years, a recent report by the European Court of Auditors shows that 90% of all transactions
[01:49:09.179 --> 01:49:09.519]  Incredible!
[01:49:09.519 --> 01:49:10.900]  So you have the people...
[01:49:37.998 --> 01:49:40.620]  Okay, so we go after Pachauri, we go after Gore.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:50.649]  What about somebody like Phil Jones, who gets all these millions of dollars or pounds in research funding, the head facility, and we have the emails where he's hiding the decline?
[01:49:50.649 --> 01:50:01.238]  I mean, that's... Well, the first thing that happened there is that the Information Commissioner's Office, which I asked to look into Jones' activities, first of all, failed to reply to my letter at all.
[01:50:01.238 --> 01:50:04.101]  I'm going to have to sue them to make them do their job and answer my letter.
[01:50:04.896 --> 01:50:16.659]  Um, but they then issued a public statement saying that the law prevented them from prosecuting Jones because he would have had to have been done within six months of the offense first being drawn to their attention.
[01:50:16.659 --> 01:50:22.041]  Well, in fact, they got the law wrong, but they still decided they're not going to do anything about it.
[01:50:22.041 --> 01:50:23.321]  And I think what we're going to find
[01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:24.522]  Incredible!
[01:50:53.809 --> 01:50:56.771]  Okay, Lord Monckton, we've got one more quick segment.
[01:50:56.771 --> 01:50:58.952]  An hour goes by so fast with you.
[01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:00.473]  I've got a bunch of other key questions.
[01:51:00.473 --> 01:51:01.354]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.655]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:08.239]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.239 --> 01:51:13.262]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.262 --> 01:51:13.742]  It's true.
[01:51:13.742 --> 01:51:18.846]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.846 --> 01:51:23.529]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.059 --> 01:51:31.163]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.163 --> 01:51:32.284]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.284 --> 01:51:38.988]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.988 --> 01:51:42.169]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:44.391]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.391 --> 01:51:45.331]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.331 --> 01:51:45.511]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:51.874 --> 01:52:05.758]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:52:05.758 --> 01:52:13.940]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.701]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most

[01:52:30.667 --> 01:52:31.987]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:31.987 --> 01:52:36.548]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:36.548 --> 01:52:42.370]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:45.691]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:52:45.991 --> 01:52:48.714]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:48.714 --> 01:52:53.780]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.080]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.422]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:01.008 --> 01:53:04.571]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:04.571 --> 01:53:06.873]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.873 --> 01:53:07.734]  Don't!
[01:53:07.734 --> 01:53:11.177]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:11.177 --> 01:53:18.304]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:53:18.284 --> 01:53:20.265]  's number one debt secret.
[01:53:20.265 --> 01:53:23.949]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:24.329 --> 01:53:27.471]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:34.854]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:34.854 --> 01:53:36.035]  Herb K. was right.
[01:53:36.035 --> 01:53:39.216]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:39.216 --> 01:53:40.577]  What have you got to lose?
[01:53:40.577 --> 01:53:44.279]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:53:44.279 --> 01:53:44.899]  Get Herb K.'

[01:53:53.663 --> 01:53:54.784]  888-352-7726.
[01:53:54.784 --> 01:54:07.407]  Well, it's our final segment with Lord Christopher Monkton.
[01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:13.849]  We have a state representative who just got a law rammed through saying no to the global warming takeover.
[01:54:13.849 --> 01:54:15.230]  Texas is doing the same thing.
[01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:16.090]  That's all coming up.
[01:54:17.895 --> 01:54:21.878]  Lord Monckton, let's talk about how this is going to end, how this plays out.
[01:54:21.878 --> 01:54:23.919]  But first I want to throw the caveat out.
[01:54:23.919 --> 01:54:28.923]  I know a lot of your Tories in England are still going along with the environmental fraud.
[01:54:28.923 --> 01:54:31.545]  The NFL is pushing it here in the US.
[01:54:31.545 --> 01:54:33.386]  We see Newt Gingrich doing it.
[01:54:33.386 --> 01:54:42.613]  Rupert Murdoch, other than Fox, on his entertainment shows, brags that they implant messages about the green economy and global warming being real.
[01:54:42.613 --> 01:54:43.254]  So you say,
[01:54:44.366 --> 01:54:46.787]  You say that we're winning this, and I agree with you.
[01:54:46.787 --> 01:54:55.032]  My problem is, if we don't keep the battle hot and real and focused, it'll just kind of fade away, and they'll just regroup and come back.
[01:54:55.032 --> 01:54:57.814]  But how do you see this successfully ending?
[01:54:57.814 --> 01:55:09.160]  There's always a danger of that, but I think we can now hope that because their activities have actually been criminal, we can just land one or two prosecutions.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.882]  Pachauri, for instance, is going to be prosecuted.
[01:55:12.375 --> 01:55:16.658]  Because the accounts were plainly not correctly filed.
[01:55:16.658 --> 01:55:20.801]  He plainly knew as a trustee that he had a job to make sure the accounts were right.
[01:55:20.801 --> 01:55:22.303]  He didn't do that job.
[01:55:22.303 --> 01:55:25.885]  He was, at best, negligent, at worst, deliberately fraudulent.
[01:55:25.885 --> 01:55:33.111]  Either way, it's a serious, imprisonable criminal offence, and he is going to be prosecuted, even if I have to prosecute him myself.
[01:55:33.974 --> 01:55:43.178]  And I know the public authorities here, because there's so much in the pockets of the governing class, won't lift a finger against any of these people, however much they commit fraud.
[01:55:43.178 --> 01:55:48.139]  But I am not going to tolerate it, and there are many others here who are not going to tolerate it.
[01:55:48.139 --> 01:55:52.101]  So whether they like it or not, these people who have lorded it over,
[01:55:52.885 --> 01:56:05.897]  And have corruptly taken money from the pockets of the poor to pay for their own thousand dollar suits, which is what Pachauri usually wears, and their lavish lifestyles in the smartest suburbs of Delhi.
[01:56:05.897 --> 01:56:18.348]  That is now going to come to an end and the lifestyle of Pachauri is going to be, for a very long time, behind bars in a smelly Indian jail for the fraud in three
[01:56:19.768 --> 01:56:25.150]  And to interrupt, everything you've predicted has come true so far.
[01:56:25.150 --> 01:56:28.071]  I really hope this is going to happen.
[01:56:28.071 --> 01:56:30.752]  How do we make sure this happens?
[01:56:30.752 --> 01:56:35.673]  We make sure it happens by looking out for any other activities that are fraudulent.
[01:56:47.137 --> 01:56:49.098]  And destroying people's businesses!
[01:56:49.098 --> 01:56:50.238]  They've been hurting people, too!
[01:57:10.683 --> 01:57:23.767]  They have indeed, and they've been endangering people by stopping new coal-fired power stations from being built, by stopping new nuclear power stations from being built, by protesting every time people wanted a new power station.
[01:57:23.767 --> 01:57:24.947]  Jobs are already being lost.
[01:57:24.947 --> 01:57:27.808]  They're a mafia you've got to buy protection from.
[01:57:27.808 --> 01:57:30.729]  They also get to choose who they're going to mess with, who they're not.
[01:57:31.209 --> 01:57:31.969]  Exactly.
[01:57:31.969 --> 01:57:46.575]  And I think just one or two of those people taken to court and prosecuted for criminal fraud by workers who've lost their jobs in that aluminum smelter that closed down recently in the States because it could no longer buy electricity because the grid is running out.
[01:57:46.575 --> 01:57:50.676]  Those people have a good case to take these greenies to court.
[01:57:50.676 --> 01:57:55.778]  And all you've got to do is land a couple of them in prison and the rest will run for cover.
[01:57:55.778 --> 01:57:59.680]  And more importantly, the people who are now credulously paying the money
[01:58:03.863 --> 01:58:18.453]  So you're saying, Lord Monckton, we haven't even begun to see the routing of these people, because they were so bold, they've committed so many crimes, that this could discredit collectivism even worse than it did in the Soviet Union?
[01:58:18.453 --> 01:58:20.014]  I think that's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:58:20.014 --> 01:58:25.158]  I think the left, by nailing their colors to the mast of this particular rapidly sinking ship,
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:27.221]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:27.221 --> 01:58:29.102]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.745 --> 01:58:55.308]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.308 --> 01:58:56.208]  Number one.
[01:58:56.208 --> 01:58:59.631]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.631 --> 01:59:00.491]  Number two.
[01:59:00.491 --> 01:59:05.394]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.394 --> 01:59:06.135]  It's true.
[01:59:06.135 --> 01:59:10.998]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.998 --> 01:59:11.458]  Number three.
[01:59:11.818 --> 01:59:15.401]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:20.124]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:20.124 --> 01:59:22.886]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.886 --> 01:59:27.349]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.349 --> 01:59:31.492]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.492 --> 01:59:36.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.556 --> 01:59:40.718]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.718 --> 01:59:42.499]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.499 --> 01:59:44.760]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:53.885]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:53.885 --> 01:59:56.266]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.266 --> 02:00:05.591]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.591 --> 02:00:06.171]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.881 --> 02:00:08.663]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.663 --> 02:00:10.405]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.405 --> 02:00:12.007]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.007 --> 02:00:13.549]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.549 --> 02:00:17.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.754 --> 02:00:21.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.485 --> 02:00:39.350]  Well, the state of Texas is saying they're going to move to block the federal government coming in with tens of billions of dollars a year in carbon taxes, home inspections.
[02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:45.053]  Folks, it's in the federal bill, and Obama says he can't get it passed, he's going to do it through executive order.
[02:00:45.053 --> 02:00:52.838]  It's in the federal bill that if they do a home inspection and you don't make the changes they want, and they recommend and tell you the company's a list that you've got to use,
[02:00:53.737 --> 02:00:58.238]  They then, under federal zoning, kick you out of your home and take it.
[02:00:58.238 --> 02:01:02.160]  I mean, this is all covered in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.701]  It's all covered.
[02:01:05.701 --> 02:01:10.042]  So we're going to be breaking that down in the next 30-40 minutes with our guest.
[02:01:10.042 --> 02:01:12.963]  Here it is, Salt Lake City Tribune.
[02:01:12.963 --> 02:01:15.864]  Utah Senate asserts states' rights.
[02:01:15.864 --> 02:01:20.345]  They've also passed a ruling.
[02:01:20.345 --> 02:01:22.626]  I mean, there's just so much happening.
[02:01:23.632 --> 02:01:23.872]  Here's
[02:01:46.047 --> 02:01:48.029]  You know, he's making all this stuff up.
[02:01:48.029 --> 02:01:53.835]  No, he's quoting what the head climatologist for NASA said in a book, that they want to destroy industrial society.
[02:01:53.835 --> 02:01:57.498]  What Maury Strong, head of the UN program said.
[02:01:57.498 --> 02:02:00.881]  What Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, what they all say this is about.
[02:02:00.881 --> 02:02:02.923]  This isn't just about controlling industry and
[02:02:03.864 --> 02:02:06.325]  Insider Fat Cat's getting rich.
[02:02:06.325 --> 02:02:07.706]  It's about that, but a lot more.
[02:02:07.706 --> 02:02:16.430]  So we're going to go to break in a moment and come back with our guest, Mike Noel, Utah State Representative, 73rd District.
[02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:18.351]  This is a great guy.
[02:02:18.351 --> 02:02:20.732]  And the fight is going to be at the state level.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:31.945]  All over the country, even in unlikely places like New York and California, people at the state level, people in the state houses are saying no, no, no.
[02:02:31.945 --> 02:02:44.492]  China, India, Mexico, and hundreds, it's over 160 other third world and developing nations, they don't have to make any cuts on their emissions.
[02:02:44.492 --> 02:02:49.275]  Even if you believe these emissions are deadly, how moving them from the U.S., where they're a lot cleaner,
[02:02:50.273 --> 02:02:59.599]  To China and India, when it's all one planet, and all the studies show, boosting the amount, how does that save the Earth?
[02:02:59.599 --> 02:03:15.749]  Well, we know from all the scientific evidence, and the inside UN emails, and the 30-plus scandals in the last two months, it's more than 30 now, it's all systematic fraud, as you just heard Lord Christopher Monckton in the last hour cover in detail.
[02:03:17.895 --> 02:03:21.678]  This is so important, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:21.678 --> 02:03:29.703]  This is the number one fight we've got because, yeah, the government wants to seize healthcare and run your life and tax you and cut your Medicare and Medicaid and raise taxes.
[02:03:29.703 --> 02:03:30.784]  That's in the bill.
[02:03:30.784 --> 02:03:35.167]  And, yeah, they want to give you flu shots that are known to be dangerous, don't even help you with the flu.
[02:03:35.167 --> 02:03:36.868]  That's a government study today.
[02:03:36.868 --> 02:03:42.292]  And, yeah, they want to try to seize the highways and give them to foreign corporations to run toll roads.
[02:03:42.292 --> 02:03:43.513]  Yes, all that's going on.
[02:03:44.053 --> 02:03:50.757]  But the center of their agenda, the jewel in the crown, is this phony environmentalism.
[02:03:50.757 --> 02:03:53.098]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[02:03:53.098 --> 02:04:07.046]  Then in about 40 minutes when our guest leaves us, which is again a microcosm example of what you can do at your state level and what is happening, we'll look to the tea parties in Texas with Ron Paul and Deborah Medina,
[02:04:09.033 --> 02:04:13.702]  And myself at high-level Republican meetings at the RNC.
[02:04:13.702 --> 02:04:17.630]  We have an insider, a national figure, but I can't tell you who it is.
[02:04:19.108 --> 02:04:26.992]  Saying that the RNC, what we already knew, hates real conservatives, hates real constitutionalists.
[02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.173]  They're big fat cats.
[02:04:28.173 --> 02:04:31.735]  Newt Gingrich wants the global tax and the global warming.
[02:04:31.735 --> 02:04:34.076]  The Arizona Senator John McCain.
[02:04:34.076 --> 02:04:38.058]  They are coming after the real patriots.
[02:04:38.058 --> 02:04:42.321]  They're going to use the phony right, because nobody trusts the fake left,
[02:04:43.376 --> 02:04:47.762]  The establishment left to try to come in and corral us at the state level.
[02:04:47.762 --> 02:04:52.790]  But with representatives like Mike Knoll, they're not going to get away with it.
[02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:55.434]  So it's all coming up with our guest straight ahead.
[02:04:55.434 --> 02:04:56.495]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:06.754]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.754 --> 02:05:15.615]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.615 --> 02:05:20.256]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.256 --> 02:05:31.078]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.698 --> 02:05:41.222]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.222 --> 02:05:46.644]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.644 --> 02:05:54.127]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.127 --> 02:05:56.868]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.703]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.703 --> 02:06:09.285]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.285 --> 02:06:14.089]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:20.493]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.493 --> 02:06:22.735]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.235 --> 02:06:23.555]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.555 --> 02:06:24.076]  Bernanke?
[02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:24.736]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.736 --> 02:06:26.037]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:26.037 --> 02:06:28.279]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.170 --> 02:06:44.012]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.012 --> 02:06:49.439]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:58.570]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:00.703 --> 02:07:06.030]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:08.774]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:07:08.774 --> 02:07:13.140]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:07:15.503 --> 02:07:18.565]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[02:07:18.565 --> 02:07:19.686]  We also have some specials.

[02:07:34.738 --> 02:07:36.600]  This film needs to be seen.
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:37.761]  Everybody needs to get it.

[02:08:02.472 --> 02:08:09.115]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.115 --> 02:08:12.097]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.718 --> 02:08:20.280]  Utah State Representative Mike Noel is our guest, representative for the 73rd District.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:30.404]  He led the charge to get the resolution passed, saying this state will not go along with the fraud of man-made global warming and all the crippling taxes.
[02:08:31.468 --> 02:08:33.069]  That they want to foist on us.
[02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:36.731]  Same things now moving along in Texas, Oklahoma.
[02:08:36.731 --> 02:08:39.473]  You've got a whole bunch of Attorney Generals lining up saying no.
[02:08:39.473 --> 02:08:40.854]  Here are some of the headlines.
[02:08:40.854 --> 02:08:45.897]  Lawmaker climate change just a ruse to control population.
[02:08:45.897 --> 02:08:46.537]  Here's another one.
[02:08:46.537 --> 02:08:48.559]  Utah Senate asserts states' rights.
[02:08:49.699 --> 02:08:55.000]  Senate president advises lawmakers to choose which measure can be best be defended in court.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.081]  I mean, liberty is on the march.
[02:08:57.081 --> 02:08:57.581]  Here's another one.
[02:08:57.581 --> 02:08:58.881]  Texas to challenge U.S.
[02:08:58.881 --> 02:09:00.702]  greenhouse gas rules.
[02:09:00.702 --> 02:09:02.522]  That's out of Reuters.
[02:09:02.522 --> 02:09:08.263]  Texas sues EPA to block tailpipe emissions limits.
[02:09:08.263 --> 02:09:11.764]  It just goes on and on and on.
[02:09:11.764 --> 02:09:14.825]  Texas joins Florida lawsuit challenging EPA carbon ruling.
[02:09:17.142 --> 02:09:18.883]  America is already in a depression.
[02:09:18.883 --> 02:09:20.543]  Do you know what this is going to do financially?
[02:09:20.543 --> 02:09:24.165]  And it's all based on a fraud by internationalists.
[02:09:24.165 --> 02:09:27.886]  Going now to Representative Noel.
[02:09:27.886 --> 02:09:30.267]  Sir, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[02:09:30.267 --> 02:09:32.748]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:09:32.748 --> 02:09:34.489]  I appreciate it.
[02:09:34.489 --> 02:09:41.252]  You know, reading text of what you said in the House and statements you've given, sounds like you're a pretty informed guy.
[02:09:41.252 --> 02:09:44.533]  How did you find out about what was really behind the fake green movement?
[02:09:47.057 --> 02:09:55.594]  You know, my background, I do have a biology background, a masters in zoology, but I raise cows and I farm hay, and I'm very, very familiar with the
[02:09:56.593 --> 02:10:06.583]  Photosynthetic process and the fact that carbon dioxide is absolutely needed for being able to grow my hay and that we are actually in a carbon deficit right now.
[02:10:06.583 --> 02:10:14.330]  With more carbon, we're at about 380 parts per million, we could actually produce more food and feed more people in the world.
[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:16.913]  So, it just didn't make sense and as I looked into it,
[02:10:17.353 --> 02:10:17.774]  We're good to go.
[02:10:32.712 --> 02:10:33.392]  Well, let's talk about...
[02:10:58.513 --> 02:10:59.774]  Yeah, I mean, let's talk about Holdren.
[02:10:59.774 --> 02:11:02.596]  I happen to have Ecoscience right here.
[02:11:02.596 --> 02:11:12.022]  He says a planetary police state to carry out massive population reduction, the forced drugging of water to reduce fertility and to sterilize.
[02:11:12.022 --> 02:11:15.625]  I mean, this is a monstrous control freak.
[02:11:15.625 --> 02:11:19.087]  And so you're saying you were aware of Holdren early on.
[02:11:19.087 --> 02:11:19.708]  Please continue.
[02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:21.560]  Yeah, I was.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:22.861]  I went to Berkeley.
[02:11:22.861 --> 02:11:33.430]  Paul Ehrlich and Ann Ehrlich were teachers at Stanford, and Holdren was a co-author of that book, Population, Resources, and Environment, along with, you know, you remember the population bomb.
[02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:37.754]  It was a big issue back in the 60s, and many of the statements that Holdren has made
[02:11:38.314 --> 02:11:42.338]  Throughout his life have been absolutely preposterous.
[02:11:42.338 --> 02:11:51.205]  You know, the left wing and the drive-by media will tell you, well, he discounted all of that, and his final statement is, it'd be better to do this voluntarily.
[02:11:51.205 --> 02:11:58.851]  Well, I don't believe that's the case, and I believe that some of those statements that you made really show the real intent of this man.
[02:11:58.851 --> 02:12:04.236]  And many in this administration, from the top level down, all these czars that have put in from Van Jones to
[02:12:04.776 --> 02:12:04.977]  I'm good.
[02:12:12.907 --> 02:12:41.067]  I forget who it was that said that when an individual comes face-to-face with such a monstrous conspiracy, they have trouble even believing it, even when these individuals write books about what they plan, but you have Eric Pionka at UT saying killed 90% of the population, you have Ted Turner saying it, you have the UN saying reduced by 80%, you have literally thousands of these individuals, UN Biological Diversity Assessment, Henry Kissinger's PDD, and his different
[02:12:41.867 --> 02:12:43.829]  Uh, programs, State Department memorandum 200.
[02:12:43.829 --> 02:12:51.757]  I mean, this is their religion, and you say you went to school in and around these people, so you certainly had a front row seat to it.
[02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:55.232]  I did, and you know, it is their religion.
[02:12:55.232 --> 02:12:57.794]  It's the religion of environmentalism.
[02:12:57.794 --> 02:13:01.477]  It's a worship of the creations rather than the creator.
[02:13:01.477 --> 02:13:03.599]  It's like the Druads of old.
[02:13:03.599 --> 02:13:04.560]  They do believe in that.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:10.865]  And you know, if you look at it, Alex, they actually have already allowed some of these policies to be implemented.
[02:13:10.865 --> 02:13:12.347]  The whole issue with DDT,
[02:13:13.227 --> 02:13:15.209]  And by the way, Representative Noel, you're not just saying that.
[02:13:15.209 --> 02:13:17.812]  These are the real numbers from malaria removing the DDT.
[02:13:33.863 --> 02:13:35.824]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:35.824 --> 02:13:40.588]  And even, you know, they'll try to back this up, but I remember as a young kid, my dad was a military officer.
[02:13:40.588 --> 02:13:41.868]  We lived in Virginia.
[02:13:41.868 --> 02:13:45.211]  I used to run behind the trucks when they sprayed the DDT.
[02:13:45.211 --> 02:13:47.532]  And to get rid of the mosquitoes.
[02:13:47.532 --> 02:13:48.773]  And it's not harmful.
[02:13:48.773 --> 02:13:51.335]  It's not something that would kill you.
[02:13:51.335 --> 02:13:56.558]  And it was used to control one of the worst diseases out there on the planet.
[02:13:56.558 --> 02:14:01.942]  Hitler, not Hitler, but Shakespeare talked about it in his plays.
[02:14:01.942 --> 02:14:03.443]  And they talked about how many people
[02:14:04.203 --> 02:14:05.544]  It's a shift of wealth.
[02:14:30.278 --> 02:14:33.402]  It's a movement from liberty, as Mark Levin said, to tyranny.
[02:14:33.402 --> 02:14:37.048]  It's absolutely a taking of your rights, your individual rights.
[02:14:37.048 --> 02:14:40.434]  It's allowing the government to get in every single facet of your life.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:51.452]  And they admit that's their plan, while Pachauri and Gore and Obama and Newt Gingrich get stinking rich, and that leads me to another problem we face here.
[02:14:51.452 --> 02:15:02.242]  Then I want to talk about the actual resolutions and what the Senate's doing for states' rights, the resolution you helped author and get through, saying we're aware of this fraud, the state says no.
[02:15:03.163 --> 02:15:07.066]  How this is really our frontline battle against these people.
[02:15:07.066 --> 02:15:12.570]  Climategate, how they're now being routed, and where you see these weasels going next.
[02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:23.479]  But before we get into that, we have the owner of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, I don't know if you've seen this, put out an eight minute video bragging, showing all the stuff they put in their
[02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:30.191]  They're fiction entertainment shows pushing man-made global warming and how we're all going to die if we don't do this.
[02:15:30.191 --> 02:15:33.732]  We've got the NFL pushing it, all the big corporations.
[02:15:33.732 --> 02:15:35.032]  We've got John McCain.
[02:15:35.032 --> 02:15:40.494]  I mean, even two years ago, Sarah Palin, and now she isn't, was saying, oh, I think it's real.
[02:15:43.075 --> 02:15:56.140]  You know, all these top Republicans involved, I mean, I'm glad now they're backing off of it somewhat, but we've gone from the fact that they bullied basically most people into accepting this to it blowing up in their face.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:58.440]  My only problem is we need criminal prosecutions.
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:03.022]  We need to route this whole thing and put it to bed once and for all or like cancer.
[02:16:03.402 --> 02:16:09.885]  You know, if you've got metastasized cancer in 10 or 12 areas and you only remove 8 or 9, you're still going to die.
[02:16:09.885 --> 02:16:17.328]  We've got to remove all of this cancer and hunt these criminals down through the law and bring them to justice.
[02:16:17.328 --> 02:16:24.751]  How many billions and billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money have we wasted on this pseudoscience?
[02:16:24.751 --> 02:16:25.831]  How much money?
[02:16:25.831 --> 02:16:32.314]  You know, in order to get a grant at any major university, all you have to do is find some kind of a nexus.
[02:16:32.894 --> 02:16:33.655]  We're good to go.
[02:17:02.515 --> 02:17:04.876]  By buying into this, I'm not wanting to take the heat.
[02:17:04.876 --> 02:17:17.960]  You can't believe the heat that I've taken over the last five years on this issue of a total idiot cowboy down in southern Utah that wouldn't know a carbon dioxide molecule if he saw one.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:23.042]  Those types of statements have been made about me, so it takes courage and determination to stand up.
[02:17:23.362 --> 02:17:23.743]  I think so.
[02:17:40.303 --> 02:17:44.707]  Uh, in your soda pop and something that plants need, people start to realize the debate.
[02:17:44.707 --> 02:17:51.232]  We just had a debate this morning, just an hour ago, Alex, on the House floor, where someone was bringing a bill to talk about air pollution.
[02:17:51.232 --> 02:17:58.677]  One of the Democrats on the other side, it was a feel-good type resolution that we need to stop buying our cars because of the danger and the problems with smog.
[02:17:58.677 --> 02:18:00.559]  And we've got a lot here in Salt Lake Valley.
[02:18:00.559 --> 02:18:07.484]  I got up and I amended the bill to take out the words, greenhouse gases and CO2, and again, try to educate the body.
[02:18:07.824 --> 02:18:18.910]  That these are not pollutants in a sense like the EPA has said with the endangerment findings, which you mentioned earlier that many of these states are now suing the EPA to take that off the list of a pollutant.
[02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:26.974]  So it takes a long time to educate people, both Republicans and both Democrats and both Independents and Tea Party people.
[02:18:26.974 --> 02:18:29.495]  They need to be educated as to what the real issues are.
[02:18:29.495 --> 02:18:31.276]  The real issues go down to one thing.
[02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:34.720]  It's how much government control you want in your life.
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:43.130]  What's really an issue, let the state solve these problems, but local government solve them, not federal government.
[02:18:43.130 --> 02:18:44.451]  Absolutely.
[02:18:44.451 --> 02:18:51.900]  And when I get up here on the air, Representative Noel, and I say we're winning and people are really waking up,
[02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:57.694]  Well, that's not hype, and I want to get your take on if you're seeing the same thing, but I want to be clear.
[02:18:57.694 --> 02:18:58.935]  This isn't business as usual.
[02:18:58.935 --> 02:19:06.121]  This doesn't mean phony Republicans go into Congress and give us more big government and a lighter version of what Obama's doing.
[02:19:06.121 --> 02:19:08.903]  This is the spirit of 1776.
[02:19:08.903 --> 02:19:14.428]  We have had enough of big government, control freaks, all the taxes, the police state.
[02:19:14.428 --> 02:19:19.532]  America is truly having a realignment back to the basics.
[02:19:20.943 --> 02:19:22.565]  I absolutely agree with that.
[02:19:22.565 --> 02:19:27.509]  We're seeing in what better state than Utah, one of the most conservative states in the country.
[02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:33.594]  Even our Democratic side of the aisle are very, very conservative and support me on many, many of these issues.
[02:19:33.594 --> 02:19:35.356]  And we are seeing a resurgence.
[02:19:35.356 --> 02:19:38.258]  You know, it's not that the public is unintelligent.
[02:19:38.258 --> 02:19:40.440]  It's that the public is uninformed.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:45.885]  When you inform the public, when you give them the facts, when they see how these things affect their everyday lives,
[02:19:46.605 --> 02:19:46.925]  Stay there!
[02:19:46.925 --> 02:19:47.346]  Stay there!
[02:19:47.346 --> 02:19:48.566]  Our economy is in great distress.
[02:19:48.566 --> 02:19:51.568]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[02:19:51.568 --> 02:19:55.590]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[02:20:14.690 --> 02:20:17.352]  You have auto and home insurance.
[02:20:17.352 --> 02:20:20.575]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[02:20:20.575 --> 02:20:23.857]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[02:20:23.857 --> 02:20:26.519]  Because it might take years to recover.
[02:20:26.519 --> 02:20:33.064]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[02:20:33.064 --> 02:20:39.089]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three-acre heirloom vegetable garden
[02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:44.731]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[02:20:44.731 --> 02:20:45.291]  No.
[02:20:45.291 --> 02:20:45.972]  The answer is
[02:21:08.075 --> 02:21:08.596]  We're good to go.
[02:21:24.284 --> 02:21:31.406]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.406 --> 02:21:35.967]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.967 --> 02:21:41.769]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:21:41.769 --> 02:21:45.170]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:48.131]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.131 --> 02:21:53.193]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.193 --> 02:21:56.034]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.034 --> 02:22:01.716]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.716 --> 02:22:05.718]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:05.718 --> 02:22:08.979]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:08.979 --> 02:22:10.380]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:11.281 --> 02:22:13.743]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:13.743 --> 02:22:20.149]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.149 --> 02:22:25.353]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:25.353 --> 02:22:35.341]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:35.441 --> 02:22:37.782]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:37.782 --> 02:22:39.382]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:39.382 --> 02:22:41.843]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:41.843 --> 02:22:43.964]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:43.964 --> 02:22:49.106]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.106 --> 02:22:54.128]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:23:00.140 --> 02:23:03.681]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:23:03.681 --> 02:23:05.961]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:23:05.961 --> 02:23:06.821]  Don't!
[02:23:06.821 --> 02:23:10.262]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:23:10.262 --> 02:23:17.384]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:23:17.364 --> 02:23:19.364]  's number one debt secret.
[02:23:19.364 --> 02:23:23.025]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:23:23.425 --> 02:23:26.567]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:23:26.567 --> 02:23:33.953]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:23:33.953 --> 02:23:35.133]  Herb K was right.
[02:23:35.133 --> 02:23:38.316]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:23:38.316 --> 02:23:39.677]  What have you got to lose?
[02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:43.379]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:23:43.379 --> 02:23:47.322]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[02:23:51.765 --> 02:23:52.105]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:23:52.105 --> 02:23:52.145]  888-352-7726.
[02:24:23.584 --> 02:24:29.086]  Representative Mike Knoll from Utah leading the charge in his corner of the country against tyranny.
[02:24:29.086 --> 02:24:30.986]  We'll be with us until about 45 after.
[02:24:30.986 --> 02:24:41.369]  I will do a critique tomorrow on air and break down this cover story I'm in in Texas Monthly.
[02:24:41.369 --> 02:24:43.690]  I didn't cover what the New York Times had to say about me.
[02:24:43.690 --> 02:24:47.151]  I didn't really get much into the two Newsweek hit pieces in the last week.
[02:24:49.184 --> 02:24:56.628]  The fact that Rick Perry told a super high-powered public figure that called me to warn me yesterday or this morning actually, tried to get hold of me yesterday, talked to him this morning.
[02:24:57.984 --> 02:25:03.806]  Talked to the person this morning, excuse me, I didn't say it was a man or woman, that the Republicans are going to come after me.
[02:25:03.806 --> 02:25:06.227]  I mean, Karl Rove, they don't like it.
[02:25:06.227 --> 02:25:09.288]  They don't want to really get America back.
[02:25:09.288 --> 02:25:15.991]  Obama, it came out in the newspaper six months ago, I'm on the top 25 enemies list, now I'm on the Republican enemy list.
[02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:16.351]  Why?
[02:25:16.351 --> 02:25:19.152]  Because I've had enough of big government.
[02:25:19.152 --> 02:25:21.873]  And this Texas Monthly thing, I mean, it is a cover story.
[02:25:21.873 --> 02:25:23.194]  Look at this.
[02:25:23.194 --> 02:25:24.334]  Cover story.
[02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:27.411]  I mean, this is insane, man.
[02:25:27.411 --> 02:25:29.893]  They are really coming after us.
[02:25:29.893 --> 02:25:30.874]  And I've scanned over it.
[02:25:30.874 --> 02:25:33.436]  It's got a lot of distortions in it already.
[02:25:33.436 --> 02:25:36.178]  It's not the worst hit piece I've seen, though.
[02:25:36.178 --> 02:25:37.519]  Okay, I don't want to talk about myself.
[02:25:37.519 --> 02:25:42.883]  It's just this thing is... But again, this is only an indicator of how far we've all come.
[02:25:42.883 --> 02:25:53.552]  The fact that people don't believe the mainstream media anymore and alternative media is just on fire, continuing Representative Noel on that subject of just the incredible awakening.
[02:25:55.656 --> 02:25:57.078]  It is absolutely amazing.
[02:25:57.078 --> 02:26:15.776]  I mean, that's probably the greatest thing that's happened in America in the last 10 years is the ability of the everyday citizen to be able to access the news without the filtering through the mainstream or the drive-by media or the lamestream media, those types of media that for some reason they have an agenda.
[02:26:15.776 --> 02:26:18.579]  We had the same situation here in Utah.
[02:26:19.019 --> 02:26:19.859]  We're good to go.
[02:26:49.417 --> 02:26:58.391]  But I think it's more, Representative Noel, when you get attacked by corporate, mainline, big government media, that is then a seal of approval on you!
[02:27:00.377 --> 02:27:02.758]  I appreciate that.
[02:27:02.758 --> 02:27:16.585]  I do have a lot of friends that are in manufacturing that recognize how critical it is to not pass a cap-and-trade bill because they recognize it's going to be a cost of jobs in Utah.
[02:27:16.585 --> 02:27:19.126]  So maybe in Utah, we are somewhat isolated here.
[02:27:19.126 --> 02:27:24.369]  I still talk to a lot of the people in the industry there.
[02:27:24.369 --> 02:27:26.510]  We are a very, very conservative state.
[02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:28.711]  We did not really support
[02:27:29.811 --> 02:27:30.411]  I don't think so.
[02:27:45.638 --> 02:27:58.587]  The people are the ones that need to step up, and there is absolutely a revolution because they can get the facts themselves, because they can go to the media, because they can go to the Internet, and they can get different information, and they can get the truth out.
[02:27:58.587 --> 02:28:08.013]  We're seeing this resurgence, and they see there's fear out there that they're losing their freedoms, that they are losing their freedoms, and this contrived so-called
[02:28:09.332 --> 02:28:09.973]  We're good to go.
[02:28:27.951 --> 02:28:28.211]  I think?
[02:29:01.478 --> 02:29:02.279]  Absolutely.
[02:29:02.279 --> 02:29:05.886]  I may even come to Utah to interview him and try to videotape some of that.
[02:29:05.886 --> 02:29:07.188]  Maybe I can work with you on that.
[02:29:07.188 --> 02:29:10.193]  We're figuring out exactly where I'm going to hook up with him when he's in the U.S.
[02:29:11.728 --> 02:29:18.812]  Again, to be clear about what I was saying earlier, when the mainstream media attacks someone now, they don't realize how discredited they are.
[02:29:18.812 --> 02:29:20.793]  They're starting to get an idea.
[02:29:20.793 --> 02:29:31.600]  They don't understand that when they attack somebody, then the public automatically, whether it's right or not, tends to support whoever's being attacked, because the system is so discredited.
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.903]  I mean, if all these newspapers are attacking Mike Noel, or Ron Paul, or Alex Jones, or Deborah Medina,
[02:29:37.723 --> 02:29:41.425]  Or other people like that, then we must be on to something.
[02:29:41.425 --> 02:29:51.810]  I want to talk about the resolution itself and a lot more straight ahead with our guests on the front lines and the fight for liberty.
[02:29:51.810 --> 02:29:55.732]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.732 --> 02:29:58.434]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.601 --> 02:30:04.603]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.603 --> 02:30:09.928]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.928 --> 02:30:11.989]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.989 --> 02:30:16.993]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.993 --> 02:30:17.894]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.154 --> 02:30:19.275]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.275 --> 02:30:21.176]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.176 --> 02:30:22.237]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.237 --> 02:30:24.438]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.438 --> 02:30:25.779]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.779 --> 02:30:27.320]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:32.584]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.584 --> 02:30:36.166]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.166 --> 02:30:39.649]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.969 --> 02:30:41.210]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.210 --> 02:30:42.111]  We don't know.
[02:30:42.111 --> 02:30:43.213]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.213 --> 02:30:44.134]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.134 --> 02:30:45.235]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.235 --> 02:30:48.298]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:30:50.501 --> 02:30:51.502]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.919 --> 02:31:02.060]  What's your home worth?
[02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:04.180]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:07.222]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:31:07.222 --> 02:31:14.925]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[02:32:00.319 --> 02:32:07.305]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.305 --> 02:32:08.586]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:09.406]  It's very real.
[02:32:09.406 --> 02:32:11.648]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:11.648 --> 02:32:13.290]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:17.773]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:32:49.821 --> 02:32:50.642]  Oh, Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[02:32:50.642 --> 02:32:52.022]  Oh, Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[02:33:12.916 --> 02:33:17.160]  We have only begun to fight against the New World Order.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:25.327]  Against the big global corporations that are not free market, but openly seek to set up a planetary dictatorship so they can consolidate power.
[02:33:25.327 --> 02:33:32.813]  Their foot soldiers are a bunch of eugenics, population control freaks, and the facts are out.
[02:33:32.813 --> 02:33:36.937]  And momentum is shifting towards free humanity and shattering the political
[02:33:37.947 --> 02:33:39.747]  False paradigms.
[02:33:39.747 --> 02:33:43.688]  We have Representative Mike Noel, 73rd District of Utah.
[02:33:43.688 --> 02:33:45.028]  Sir, I've been asking my questions.
[02:33:45.028 --> 02:33:55.231]  I mean, I want to get into the state's rights resolution there as well, and how that's happening in other parts of the country, and the resolution that you've helped get through.
[02:33:55.231 --> 02:34:02.152]  And tell us exactly, I mean, I've got a copy of it, but break down why you felt this was necessary and what this resolution means.
[02:34:03.729 --> 02:34:04.269]  I think so.
[02:34:24.009 --> 02:34:35.671]  The issues that are coming out, some of the information you put on your program with Phil Jones and Michael Mann, the hockey stick, the fact that there was no accountability for the medieval warming period, a lot of those things that we have now come to find out.
[02:34:35.671 --> 02:34:47.594]  The data that's been suppressed, the work by Phil Jones and others to suppress peer review information, a normal process in scientific
[02:34:48.474 --> 02:34:49.315]  We're good to go.
[02:35:14.031 --> 02:35:15.071]  I don't think there's a one of us.
[02:35:15.071 --> 02:35:16.252]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[02:35:16.252 --> 02:35:17.993]  Let me stop you.
[02:35:17.993 --> 02:35:21.834]  But I mean, but it's not that they're errors or they're incorrect.
[02:35:21.834 --> 02:35:26.436]  They knew it was a lot warmer in the medieval period and there were grapes in northern England.
[02:35:26.436 --> 02:35:32.419]  They knew 9,000 years ago at the start of the Bronze Age that the Earth's temperature on average was 8 degrees higher.
[02:35:32.419 --> 02:35:33.539]  They know all this.
[02:35:33.539 --> 02:35:36.020]  This is premeditated fraud.
[02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:37.701]  The ClimateGate emails show us that.
[02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:40.257]  That's true.
[02:35:40.257 --> 02:35:42.199]  That's those that control the data.
[02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:58.952]  But what's happened, unfortunately, because of the billions of dollars that has gone out to universities and scientists across the country in government grants, individuals that wanted to tap in that money supply have taken for granted the information that Phil Jones, the IPCC, the AR4 reports, and all those reports,
[02:35:59.372 --> 02:36:03.095]  Take it as past scientists and come up with these numbers.
[02:36:03.095 --> 02:36:08.859]  97% of all scientists agree that global warming, anthropogenic, man-caused global warming is occurring.
[02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:10.320]  97%.
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:16.504]  And that's how you get the public to then buy into this by saying, well, hey, all the scientists agree.
[02:36:16.504 --> 02:36:17.685]  How come you're coming out against it?
[02:36:17.685 --> 02:36:18.786]  This is where they attack me.
[02:36:19.386 --> 02:36:29.737]  How in the world can you come in, they call the people like Roy Simmons and others that come out against this, and they say they're fringe scientists, they're basically wackos, they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:36:29.737 --> 02:36:38.806]  Those are the ones that have had the courage and the integrity to research it out on their own, take the information and come up with the information that is correct for the public.
[02:36:38.806 --> 02:36:42.510]  So it's a scary thing that a group of individuals can work together
[02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:49.108]  And to control this data and then have all these scientists buy into it, mainly because of the money, Alex.
[02:36:49.108 --> 02:36:49.970]  That's why they're doing it.
[02:36:49.970 --> 02:36:50.993]  The funding that's there.
[02:36:56.155 --> 02:36:57.657]  You're absolutely right.
[02:36:57.657 --> 02:37:05.686]  Now, the reason I have you on, the main reason is because of your courage to get this resolution in, to get it passed, but also because the battle is the state level.
[02:37:05.686 --> 02:37:12.374]  Obama, it was in the New York Times for those that missed it last Friday, has announced he will do signing statements, executive orders,
[02:37:13.235 --> 02:37:24.481]  He'll even just order bureaucracies to levy the carbon taxes, the cap-and-trade, the home inspections, everything that's in the Senate bill that passed the House that he now can't get through, and that's in the New York Times today.
[02:37:24.481 --> 02:37:26.201]  They say basically it's dead.
[02:37:26.201 --> 02:37:37.667]  Now they may be playing possum, as Lord Monckton said, and they are meeting again later this year in Mexico to try to get it at a treaty level, but the Third World found out it was basically doubling the taxes on them, so they pulled out.
[02:37:37.667 --> 02:37:40.728]  So as people realize this fraud is so diabolical, it's...
[02:37:42.264 --> 02:37:46.005]  Basically a dead dog, but they're not stopping.
[02:37:46.005 --> 02:37:54.307]  Schwarzenegger has said, and I'm witnessing it here in Austin where I live, that they're getting the governors and city councils together with this international money.
[02:37:54.307 --> 02:38:05.631]  And Austin Energy announced two weeks ago a 2.6, they said this, 2.6 billion dollar tax over the next three years on energy.
[02:38:06.593 --> 02:38:09.677]  Each year, that's bigger than the entire budget of the city.
[02:38:09.677 --> 02:38:18.108]  I mean, they just calmly announced the biggest tax increase, dwarfing everything, and it looks like Austin's gonna do it.
[02:38:18.108 --> 02:38:19.529]  I mean, they're that criminal.
[02:38:19.529 --> 02:38:20.551]  What do we do?
[02:38:20.551 --> 02:38:22.713]  Well, I guess the answer is the state legislature...
[02:38:23.734 --> 02:38:28.098]  All the cities and all the municipalities are an instrumentality of the state legislature.
[02:38:28.098 --> 02:38:32.081]  The state legislature needs to act and not allow them to implement those taxes.
[02:38:32.081 --> 02:38:33.702]  That would never happen in Utah.
[02:38:33.702 --> 02:38:35.404]  We would not allow the cities to do that.
[02:38:35.404 --> 02:38:45.832]  We control what their taxing authority is, and to put that kind of a tax on would not be allowed by the state legislature in Utah, a strong conservative state.
[02:38:45.832 --> 02:38:47.533]  So we've got to fight back in that direction.
[02:38:47.533 --> 02:38:51.697]  Remember now, Miss Alex, there's going to be winner states and there's going to be loser states.
[02:38:52.117 --> 02:38:55.200]  Some of the winner states are going to be California and Massachusetts.
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:05.428]  Interesting, Boxer and Kerry are supporting the bill in the Senate, the Waxman-Markey bill, and Markey from Massachusetts and Waxman from California.
[02:39:05.428 --> 02:39:09.631]  Both those states will gain because they have carbon offsets that they can sell.
[02:39:09.631 --> 02:39:19.579]  So it's a transfer of wealth not only within the United States, but then it would be a transfer of wealth, as we know, internationally to third world countries, massive transfer of wealth.
[02:39:19.579 --> 02:39:21.601]  So there are some things here that are out.
[02:39:21.721 --> 02:39:22.301]  Absolutely.
[02:39:22.301 --> 02:39:24.422]  Every citizen needs to look into.
[02:39:24.422 --> 02:39:31.784]  The people really know that by 2014, the incandescent light bulb is going to be outlawed in the United States.
[02:39:31.784 --> 02:39:34.685]  They know that laws on the books is going to come into play at that time.
[02:39:34.685 --> 02:39:37.306]  I mean, what are people going to wake up to that?
[02:39:37.306 --> 02:39:42.368]  They're going to wake up in the morning and, hey, your light bulb, you can't go down to the store and buy an incandescent light bulb.
[02:39:42.368 --> 02:39:44.008]  You've got to buy a mercury light bulb.
[02:39:44.008 --> 02:39:46.569]  I mean, this is the kind of crazy things people don't know about.
[02:39:47.304 --> 02:39:58.910]  And again, it starts with something reasonable on the surface like DDT, then it's the toilet you can have, the washing machine you can have, and now they're talking about criminal penalties for selling old-fashioned light bulbs.
[02:39:58.910 --> 02:40:10.897]  They admit the new ones have mercury in them, they're toxic, they give you headaches in major studies, they're total crud, and if they can set the precedent to say what kind of light bulb you can have, they can do anything.
[02:40:11.505 --> 02:40:16.072]  You're absolutely right, which is what we call the administrative state that we're in.
[02:40:16.072 --> 02:40:24.424]  And I think we need to sunset every single independent federal agency, every single year, subject to Congress approving them.
[02:40:24.424 --> 02:40:25.786]  I think that's what needs to happen.
[02:40:26.867 --> 02:40:29.348]  We need to educate the public.
[02:40:29.348 --> 02:40:34.531]  We need to have more of a bigger limit than the Supreme Court's review power.
[02:40:34.531 --> 02:40:42.475]  We need to limit these tax exemptions to the environmental organizations that are not non-partisan charitable foundations.
[02:40:42.475 --> 02:40:45.337]  Heavens, these guys are pushing the agenda all over the board.
[02:40:45.337 --> 02:40:50.179]  They've got statutory authority to go out and get free money from the government.
[02:40:50.179 --> 02:40:51.640]  We're paying the environmentalists.
[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:53.141]  We're good to go.
[02:41:10.239 --> 02:41:17.044]  That's why we have some of the lowest per capita expenditures on our school children because we don't get tax base off these federal lands.
[02:41:17.044 --> 02:41:21.787]  We should have had those lands turned over to the states at inception during the Enabling Act, but we didn't.
[02:41:21.787 --> 02:41:27.050]  That's another bill that we're trying to push is get back control of our state so that we can pay our bills.
[02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:29.612]  I'm a big supporter of repealing the 17th Amendment.
[02:41:29.952 --> 02:41:43.564]  Get these Senators, this elite club of 100 Senators back there in D.C., the most powerful of 100 men essentially in the world, and get those men to come back and be accountable to a state legislature and a local body of elected people here in Utah.
[02:41:43.564 --> 02:41:44.325]  Representative!
[02:41:44.325 --> 02:41:47.067]  That's not taught in school, so explain to people.
[02:41:47.067 --> 02:41:52.552]  The same year we got the private Federal Reserve dictatorship, they had to have their new funding mechanism, the income tax.
[02:41:52.552 --> 02:41:54.174]  The bankers just buffaloed us again.
[02:41:54.674 --> 02:42:16.500]  With that whole stage deal they want a new value-added or sales tax that Beck and O'Reilly are pushing because they're the conservatives we can trust stacked on top so so the next phase of these people and that same year they gave us the 17th amendment and I've had scholars on that show it wasn't ratified many of the states they claim and so expanding from that folks don't know that states
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:32.603]  Previous to 1913, the 17th Amendment, the elected legislature, talk about your state reps having power, they then selected, voted for the two senators who were creatures of the state because it was all about separation of powers.
[02:42:33.424 --> 02:42:36.928]  That's right, it exactly was, and it goes through the whole concept of federalism.
[02:42:36.928 --> 02:42:46.738]  People don't understand that doesn't mean the federal government is in control, that means the federal government has certain duties and responsibilities, the state government has certain duties, the local governments have duties.
[02:42:46.738 --> 02:42:53.745]  When we took away that authority for the legislature to have direct control of the election of senators, we took away a huge power block.
[02:42:54.125 --> 02:43:00.230]  From the states in direct control of one branch of the government, the legislative branch of the government.
[02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:03.492]  That was where our representation in the state came from.
[02:43:03.492 --> 02:43:17.623]  And you wouldn't have this long-term senators serving for 30 and 40 years because they would be coming back on a regular basis, we would be monitoring what their votes are, we'd be talking to them on a regular basis, and all it would take is a majority of the senators
[02:43:18.383 --> 02:43:18.604]  I think
[02:43:34.104 --> 02:43:34.404]  I think
[02:43:52.913 --> 02:43:58.677]  A rural legislator that is a people's legislator because I don't get paid to do my job.
[02:43:58.677 --> 02:44:02.259]  I get a very minimal amount of money to be here for 45 days.
[02:44:02.259 --> 02:44:05.641]  We are required to balance our budget, which we do every single year.
[02:44:05.641 --> 02:44:08.083]  We can't go out of here with an unbalanced budget.
[02:44:08.083 --> 02:44:09.744]  We can't be in a structural deficit.
[02:44:09.744 --> 02:44:12.545]  We've got to make sure that the ongoing revenues are going to be there.
[02:44:12.545 --> 02:44:14.667]  If they're not, we have to cut revenue.
[02:44:14.667 --> 02:44:18.509]  We have to cut programs or we have to increase revenue.
[02:44:18.509 --> 02:44:21.411]  We don't want to increase taxes, so we cut programs.
[02:44:22.011 --> 02:44:23.612]  The federal government won't do that.
[02:44:23.612 --> 02:44:26.895]  We are in a serious situation in this country.
[02:44:26.895 --> 02:44:38.583]  My 16 grandkids are going to have a very, very tough time when they try to make a living with having this huge burden of Social Security and the taxation that we put upon us with this debt.
[02:44:38.583 --> 02:44:41.445]  It really sickens me what we've done to our kids and our grandkids.
[02:44:41.445 --> 02:44:43.927]  It's almost like we don't care about the next generation.
[02:44:43.927 --> 02:44:48.951]  You talk about environmentalists, what about this huge economic debt we're putting on our children?
[02:44:48.951 --> 02:44:50.392]  That's absolutely wrong, Alex.
[02:44:50.392 --> 02:44:51.313]  It's absolutely wrong.
[02:44:53.644 --> 02:44:55.526]  Absolutely, Representative Noel.
[02:44:55.526 --> 02:44:57.709]  Please give listeners your website.
[02:44:57.709 --> 02:45:15.608]  We've got it up on screen for people watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv, but I want people to come learn more about what you're doing to get the Utah Resolution, both on states' rights and on the environmental fraudsters, and hopefully use your blueprint in their sector of the republic.
[02:45:16.277 --> 02:45:17.638]  I appreciate that.
[02:45:17.638 --> 02:45:18.959]  I'm at MikeNoel.com.
[02:45:18.959 --> 02:45:20.721]  It tells a little bit about me there.
[02:45:20.721 --> 02:45:26.385]  It's a little bit old, but you can email me at MikeNoel at Knab.net.
[02:45:26.385 --> 02:45:31.229]  So go to MikeNoel.com or MikeNoel at Knab.net.
[02:45:31.229 --> 02:45:33.431]  I don't have anybody working for me full-time.
[02:45:33.431 --> 02:45:36.354]  When I answer back, it's me writing back to you, so be patient.
[02:45:36.354 --> 02:45:37.675]  It may take me a few days to do it.
[02:45:39.025 --> 02:45:40.446]  Well, we need to fix that.
[02:45:40.446 --> 02:45:41.447]  We need to fix that.
[02:45:41.447 --> 02:45:44.449]  We've got massive listeners in Utah.
[02:45:44.449 --> 02:45:50.213]  We need somebody to get in there and help you because people can poke around and find the resolution.
[02:45:50.213 --> 02:45:52.655]  They can poke around on the Statehouse website and find it.
[02:45:52.655 --> 02:45:56.017]  But we need to get those resolutions up on your site.
[02:45:56.650 --> 02:45:58.211]  Okay, we'll do it.
[02:45:58.211 --> 02:46:00.573]  We'll get that down.
[02:46:00.573 --> 02:46:07.699]  I can give you my administrative assistant, Jeff Peterson, we can get that out and you can contact Jeff and he helps me during the session.
[02:46:07.699 --> 02:46:12.863]  He's a student up here at one of the colleges, a good young man, and he can help do that.
[02:46:12.863 --> 02:46:15.025]  But again, I'm trying to get through this session.
[02:46:15.025 --> 02:46:17.567]  We're about four weeks into it.
[02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:19.108]  We've got 45 days.
[02:46:19.108 --> 02:46:20.729]  We're trying to balance the budget.
[02:46:20.729 --> 02:46:22.811]  We're not going to raise taxes on anything.
[02:46:23.731 --> 02:46:24.732]  If I have a way with it.
[02:46:38.735 --> 02:46:50.747]  Well, that's what's crazy is the only real jobs getting created are government jobs, are government funded jobs, and every study shows every government job costs two jobs in the real world.
[02:46:50.747 --> 02:46:57.394]  I mean, this country's going into a depression and government's growing like a case of lymphoma cancer.
[02:46:57.992 --> 02:47:00.114]  Yeah, and that's why the people in Washington, D.C.
[02:47:00.114 --> 02:47:01.895]  come and they go, what's the problem?
[02:47:01.895 --> 02:47:03.136]  Things are happy back here.
[02:47:03.136 --> 02:47:07.379]  The lobbies are getting taken care of and all the government jobs and everybody's happy.
[02:47:07.379 --> 02:47:16.445]  And you get out in the hinterland and out in real America and you find out that it's not a 10% unemployment, it's more like a 17 to 20% unemployment.
[02:47:16.445 --> 02:47:18.446]  People have given up looking for jobs.
[02:47:18.446 --> 02:47:20.528]  We could, in fact, this is a push I want.
[02:47:20.908 --> 02:47:22.249]  People to understand.
[02:47:22.249 --> 02:47:29.255]  We have got more resources, fossil fuel resources, in this country to run our country for several hundred years.
[02:47:29.255 --> 02:47:37.482]  We can convert coal through the syngas process and through the old Fischer-Trump process that the South Africans did, which Hitler did at the end of World War II.
[02:47:37.482 --> 02:47:39.744]  He converted it and ran his armies on it.
[02:47:39.744 --> 02:47:42.126]  We can convert coal to gasoline.
[02:47:42.126 --> 02:47:43.547]  We've got tar sands.
[02:47:43.547 --> 02:47:48.992]  We've got a process, hydro-gasification, that we can take any carbon-based material and make fuel out of it.
[02:47:49.552 --> 02:47:54.876]  But the bankers like a monopoly, so that's why they shut down all the oil and gas.
[02:47:54.876 --> 02:48:03.403]  Well, Clinton shut down all that clean burning coal, mainly in Utah, thus doubling the price of the Chinese coal, making them tens of billions.
[02:48:03.403 --> 02:48:07.066]  Mr. Noel, Representative Noel, thank you for spending time with us, sir.
[02:48:07.066 --> 02:48:08.027]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:48:08.027 --> 02:48:09.748]  You hang in there and keep doing the good work.
[02:48:09.748 --> 02:48:10.369]  Thanks a lot.
[02:48:10.369 --> 02:48:11.129]  Appreciate it.
[02:48:11.129 --> 02:48:11.550]  Thank you.
[02:48:11.550 --> 02:48:13.271]  God bless you.
[02:48:13.271 --> 02:48:16.193]  Okay, now shifting gears to the last hour and 12 minutes.
[02:48:17.302 --> 02:48:23.964]  I'm going to open the phones up, coming up in the next hour, specifically on the big bombshell breaking news today.
[02:48:23.964 --> 02:48:25.585]  But I have these other guests on.
[02:48:25.585 --> 02:48:26.865]  This is an important fight.
[02:48:26.865 --> 02:48:28.325]  Deals with states' rights.
[02:48:28.325 --> 02:48:39.569]  Deals with the solution-based broadcast we have of taking our states back, educating the people about the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and who their globalist enemies are.
[02:48:39.569 --> 02:48:44.811]  But I'm going to recap our top stories today about Perry, coming after Ron Paul, myself, and Medina.
[02:48:44.811 --> 02:48:45.851]  The inside info.
[02:48:47.153 --> 02:48:54.481]  Also, Sarah Palin, the 9-11 truther, what this means for Medina, I would imagine you already know.
[02:48:54.481 --> 02:49:03.331]  This is all coming up, but before I go to break, I haven't even plugged any of my books or videos or anything we carry that funds us, and I've done two hours and 49 minutes.
[02:49:03.331 --> 02:49:05.874]  Folks, visit the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.

[02:50:43.836 --> 02:50:44.796]  Best prices.

[02:52:02.723 --> 02:52:06.725]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.725 --> 02:52:09.966]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.966 --> 02:52:11.387]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.091 --> 02:52:14.752]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.752 --> 02:52:21.153]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.153 --> 02:52:26.335]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:36.317]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.437 --> 02:52:38.798]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.798 --> 02:52:40.378]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.378 --> 02:52:42.839]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.839 --> 02:52:44.959]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.959 --> 02:52:50.120]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:13.211 --> 02:54:16.810]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.379 --> 02:54:25.361]  We are back live.
[02:54:25.361 --> 02:54:27.123]  Top story today.
[02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:30.666]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:54:30.666 --> 02:54:34.990]  We have twin top stories for you.
[02:54:34.990 --> 02:54:40.536]  We're going to open the phones up with your response, your take on these two stories only.
[02:54:40.536 --> 02:54:44.600]  I want to keep it focused on the states' rights rebellion against the New World Order.
[02:54:45.140 --> 02:54:48.943]  Foreign offshore banks have publicly come in and taken over our federal government.
[02:54:48.943 --> 02:54:54.208]  They're using it to rob and loot us, just like they're robbing Greece and all these other nations right now.
[02:54:54.208 --> 02:54:55.509]  It's all over the newspapers.
[02:54:55.509 --> 02:54:57.710]  This is the enemy.
[02:54:57.710 --> 02:54:59.632]  And that's why the establishment's coming after us.
[02:54:59.632 --> 02:55:05.257]  And they're counting on the Republicans, the mainline neocons, to pose as revolutionaries against the tyranny.
[02:55:06.601 --> 02:55:17.213]  They've taken on our political coloration to try to get reelected and the key battleground state being watched nationwide by the New York Times, Politico, Newsweek, you name it.
[02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:33.811]  Is Texas, because if Medina can get elected, it is going to send shockwaves across the country, get many others to run on the Campaign for Liberty constitutionalist type platform, which is so popular with the left and the right as we shatter the paradigm.
[02:55:33.811 --> 02:55:35.272]  Here are the two top stories.
[02:55:35.272 --> 02:55:36.433]  Breaking!
[02:55:36.433 --> 02:55:41.416]  Sarah Palin, 9-1-1 Truth or Controversy, makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[02:55:41.416 --> 02:55:44.218]  She said she supports, in October 2008, a new investigation.
[02:55:46.479 --> 02:55:49.415]  We have a video up there explaining why this is so important.
[02:55:52.062 --> 02:55:53.743]  And I reach out to listeners and viewers.
[02:55:53.743 --> 02:55:55.443]  I say, look, it's up to you.
[02:55:55.443 --> 02:56:05.607]  If you contact national, local media, especially Texas TV and radio and print, and get them to go, wait a minute, you attacked Medina when Beck said, what do you think of 9-11 truth?
[02:56:05.607 --> 02:56:08.588]  Would you get rid of somebody in your campaign if you found out they were part of it?
[02:56:08.588 --> 02:56:11.269]  She said, well, people have a right to their own opinion in America.
[02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:14.790]  That's nothing compared to the Democrat candidate who said it could be an inside job.
[02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:17.812]  That's his right to say, and I agree with him.
[02:56:17.812 --> 02:56:20.493]  But meanwhile, Palin's saying, oh yes, I want a new investigation of it.
[02:56:22.421 --> 02:56:24.163]  This is the darling of these people.
[02:56:24.163 --> 02:56:28.187]  I mean, he says Palin, according to Beck, shouldn't be allowed to be near the President.
[02:56:28.187 --> 02:56:30.128]  She might try to kill Obama.
[02:56:30.128 --> 02:56:39.297]  Because he says that on last night's show and a week ago and on his TV program that 9-11 truthers want to kill Obama with no evidence.
[02:56:39.297 --> 02:56:40.799]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:56:40.799 --> 02:56:42.460]  And they're setting that false flag up.
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:47.265]  I saw more articles today where Biden's worried about terrorist attacking and all this stuff.
[02:56:48.621 --> 02:56:49.081]  Breaking!
[02:56:49.081 --> 02:56:52.502]  Sarah Palin 9-11 Truth or Controversy makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[02:56:52.502 --> 02:56:57.524]  If you get this out to everyone, the media will cover it.
[02:56:57.524 --> 02:57:05.567]  We'll be tracking this the next few days and say, look, you attacked Deborah Medina in a clear-staged event.
[02:57:05.567 --> 02:57:10.489]  The Dallas Morning News caught Perry people in the same IP addresses posting and making wild
[02:57:11.465 --> 02:57:16.326]  Conspiracy statements and racist claims and other things and saying they were with Medina.
[02:57:16.326 --> 02:57:18.767]  This is a Karl Rove operation.
[02:57:18.767 --> 02:57:20.528]  I was already telling my writers this yesterday.
[02:57:20.528 --> 02:57:21.628]  I was sure of it.
[02:57:21.628 --> 02:57:24.469]  I saw Beck getting positioned the last month to go after.
[02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:28.890]  They're running three neocons as Tea Party people against Ron Paul.
[02:57:28.890 --> 02:57:32.131]  And then I get the incredible high-powered phone call.
[02:57:32.131 --> 02:57:33.391]  Last night missed it.
[02:57:33.391 --> 02:57:35.312]  Connected this morning.
[02:57:35.312 --> 02:57:36.612]  I won't say they're a media pundit.
[02:57:36.612 --> 02:57:38.533]  I won't say they're a high-powered politician.
[02:57:38.533 --> 02:57:39.473]  I won't say who they are.
[02:57:40.708 --> 02:57:49.732]  I won't say if they're male or female, but they were at an event with Perry in the Green Room with several high-powered people and he talked directly to Perry.
[02:57:49.732 --> 02:57:53.874]  And who did Perry talk about as the big enemy and who's quote under his skin?
[02:57:53.874 --> 02:57:55.535]  Three names in this order.
[02:57:55.535 --> 02:57:59.677]  Deborah Medina, Alex Jones, Ron Paul.
[02:57:59.677 --> 02:58:00.697]  Why?
[02:58:00.697 --> 02:58:04.959]  Because she represents the state's rights liberation movement.
[02:58:04.959 --> 02:58:06.380]  Ron Paul, the overarching
[02:58:07.874 --> 02:58:08.454]  I don't know.
[02:58:26.539 --> 02:58:30.042]  And so they are moving against us, and we have an article about that.
[02:58:30.042 --> 02:58:34.725]  Insider, Republican dirty tricks machine targeting grassroots constitutionalists.
[02:58:34.725 --> 02:58:39.108]  This is an exclusive at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:58:39.108 --> 02:58:43.251]  Your call is straight ahead.
[02:58:43.251 --> 02:58:45.873]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.873 --> 02:58:48.995]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.155 --> 02:58:55.717]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.717 --> 02:58:56.617]  Number one.
[02:58:56.617 --> 02:59:00.039]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.039 --> 02:59:00.899]  Number two.
[02:59:00.899 --> 02:59:05.801]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.801 --> 02:59:06.541]  It's true.
[02:59:06.541 --> 02:59:11.083]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.403 --> 02:59:12.223]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.223 --> 02:59:15.805]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.805 --> 02:59:19.746]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.746 --> 02:59:20.526]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.526 --> 02:59:23.287]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.287 --> 02:59:26.969]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.969 --> 02:59:27.769]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.769 --> 02:59:31.910]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:36.672]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.952 --> 02:59:41.113]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.113 --> 02:59:42.913]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.913 --> 02:59:45.174]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:45.174 --> 02:59:47.455]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:47.455 --> 02:59:48.755]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:48.755 --> 02:59:50.015]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.601 --> 03:00:29.306]  I made a video last night that was posted in the early morning hours titled Sarah Palin 9-1-1 Truth or Controversy Explodes that Aaron Dykes put together.
[03:00:29.306 --> 03:00:32.228]  Stayed up from 2.30 in the morning to get it done.
[03:00:32.228 --> 03:00:34.969]  It is going viral right now.
[03:00:34.969 --> 03:00:37.771]  It is posted at the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:00:39.139 --> 03:00:46.903]  It is posted in the article titled, Sarah Palin 9-11 Truth or Controversy Makes Hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[03:00:46.903 --> 03:00:50.365]  We need this to have a hundred thousand views by tomorrow.
[03:00:50.365 --> 03:00:52.066]  We need you to send it out to everyone you know.
[03:00:52.066 --> 03:00:59.970]  Now, a few of the troll commenters in there are saying, why is Alex saying this potentially could be one of the most important stories he's ever covered?
[03:00:59.970 --> 03:01:01.271]  Well, let me see.
[03:01:01.271 --> 03:01:06.654]  I said back in January when we got secret government documents from the Bureau of Cemeteries in
[03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:20.429]  New York State and had an emergency manager on from Indiana and other key witnesses that the Feds were saying, the flu is coming, millions will die, get ready for martial law.
[03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:28.475]  Now I came on air and I said, I don't know if martial law is going to happen, but they're certainly gearing up for it and saying they're going to use flu to do it.
[03:01:28.475 --> 03:01:34.340]  And then it came out, we discredited it, they backed off, they tried forced inoculation in New York and Massachusetts.
[03:01:35.339 --> 03:01:36.779]  That's martial law.
[03:01:36.779 --> 03:01:41.681]  You know, Texas Monthly has an article saying Jones said we'd be under martial law.
[03:01:41.681 --> 03:01:42.901]  No, I didn't.
[03:01:42.901 --> 03:01:45.522]  No, I didn't.
[03:01:45.522 --> 03:01:52.384]  I said that they were going to try it, and I said months before they launched that operation.
[03:01:52.384 --> 03:01:55.605]  That's why I said that could be one of the most important stories.
[03:01:55.605 --> 03:01:56.825]  We only have a few of these a year.
[03:01:59.545 --> 03:02:11.455]  I told you when ClimateGate broke, we were the first to slam it out there that this could devastate them, that this could bring them down, that this could expose their entire agenda because it's the heart of their takeover.
[03:02:11.455 --> 03:02:13.236]  Now look what it's done!
[03:02:13.236 --> 03:02:28.869]  And look, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know this, but these disinfo operatives don't want people reading these articles and watching these videos to know that when I tell you something has the potential to annihilate the New World Order or to bring us a big step closer to that point,
[03:02:30.046 --> 03:02:33.387]  That I don't just say that for hype.
[03:02:33.387 --> 03:02:49.191]  Now, in case you don't understand, some of you out there, why the Sarah Palin, 9-11, and Truther comments are so big, Glenn Beck has spent the last two nights attacking Debra Medina as the number one enemy and saying she's a dangerous infiltrator and must be stopped.
[03:02:49.191 --> 03:02:51.691]  He spent all last week doing it, too.
[03:02:51.691 --> 03:02:55.432]  Chris Matthews did it, following the exact same talking points last night.
[03:02:55.432 --> 03:02:58.473]  Guess what Bill O'Reilly led his show with?
[03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:00.880]  This!
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:01.941]  This!
[03:03:01.941 --> 03:03:03.181]  This is big!
[03:03:03.181 --> 03:03:05.502]  You don't understand political strategy!
[03:03:05.502 --> 03:03:07.622]  You don't know how these people work!
[03:03:07.622 --> 03:03:10.363]  They know it's key!
[03:03:10.363 --> 03:03:14.565]  Rick Perry's talking about how I am in his top three enemies!
[03:03:14.565 --> 03:03:16.445]  I'm on the White House enemies list!
[03:03:16.445 --> 03:03:18.346]  Because I've studied this!
[03:03:18.346 --> 03:03:21.847]  I know how it works!
[03:03:21.847 --> 03:03:22.627]  Okay?
[03:03:22.627 --> 03:03:24.668]  This is important!
[03:03:24.668 --> 03:03:27.929]  But if the trolls and people have their way, it won't be important.
[03:03:27.929 --> 03:03:28.969]  It'll get glazed over.
[03:03:30.250 --> 03:03:34.912]  We've got 48 hours before they clamp down on this story to get it out there.
[03:03:34.912 --> 03:03:38.154]  We're sneak attacking them right now.
[03:03:38.154 --> 03:03:43.116]  If Debra Medina gets elected, if she wins the primary, she'll beat the Democrats hand down.
[03:03:43.116 --> 03:03:51.020]  Just her getting this many percentage points is already making everybody foul around the country on a Ron Paul, true constitutional type bandwagon.
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:52.621]  It's already devastating them.
[03:03:52.621 --> 03:03:53.562]  It'll take time though.
[03:03:53.562 --> 03:03:57.604]  These things don't happen in five minutes like you pull up and get a McDonald's Happy Meal.
[03:03:57.604 --> 03:03:58.104]  Instantly.
[03:03:59.053 --> 03:04:00.594]  It's like Force 10 from Navarone.
[03:04:00.594 --> 03:04:05.339]  When they blow up the dam, it takes 10 minutes for it to start cracking.
[03:04:05.339 --> 03:04:07.360]  Okay?
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:10.003]  Now you see, Climategate, the whole dam's collapsing.
[03:04:10.003 --> 03:04:12.265]  We got other dams to blow here.
[03:04:12.265 --> 03:04:15.067]  I'm in there with the explosives in the Infowar.
[03:04:15.067 --> 03:04:17.229]  I know it'll bring them down.
[03:04:17.229 --> 03:04:19.411]  You understand that?
[03:04:19.411 --> 03:04:22.114]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:04:22.114 --> 03:04:22.274]  Now,
[03:04:24.585 --> 03:04:33.111]  The reason it's so important is not just that Sarah Palin made some 9-11 truth comments, but that they are demonizing Medina with that.
[03:04:33.111 --> 03:04:48.621]  And if we go, well, wait a minute, Sarah Palin's saying it, it will reverse itself and make people pile on even more to Debra Medina while hurting the fake neocon Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin, Bill O'Reilly.
[03:04:48.621 --> 03:04:52.904]  Bill O'Reilly that says raising taxes is good, NAFTA and GATT are good.
[03:04:57.196 --> 03:04:58.256]  Global warming's real.
[03:04:58.256 --> 03:05:03.418]  I mean, if these are conservatives, I mean, I guess Stalin was then.
[03:05:03.418 --> 03:05:04.118]  I guess Mao.
[03:05:04.118 --> 03:05:11.120]  I guess Che Guevara is... I mean, why don't you conservatives out there, you mainline idiot... I've seen the Glenn Beck crowds at his little theater events.
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:13.281]  Talk about a soft group of ninny cowards.
[03:05:13.281 --> 03:05:14.201]  Those aren't conservatives.
[03:05:14.201 --> 03:05:15.842]  Those are idiots.
[03:05:15.842 --> 03:05:20.083]  Glenn Beck's designed for soft, weak, pathetic people to follow him.
[03:05:20.083 --> 03:05:24.184]  Everything he does... Folks, I saw his TV show last night, The 8 Minutes, when he attacked...
[03:05:26.811 --> 03:05:32.836]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.836 --> 03:05:36.439]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.439 --> 03:05:40.263]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.263 --> 03:05:41.484]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.484 --> 03:05:42.384]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.384 --> 03:05:43.485]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.485 --> 03:05:44.226]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.226 --> 03:05:45.247]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.507 --> 03:05:48.550]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:50.332]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.332 --> 03:05:51.253]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.862 --> 03:06:04.985]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:06:04.985 --> 03:06:07.866]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:06:07.866 --> 03:06:09.127]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:09.127 --> 03:06:09.948]  It's very real.
[03:06:09.948 --> 03:06:12.189]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[03:07:30.473 --> 03:07:39.817]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:07:39.817 --> 03:07:46.860]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:07:46.860 --> 03:07:50.802]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[03:07:53.525 --> 03:07:54.246]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:07:54.246 --> 03:07:55.848]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:55.848 --> 03:07:57.389]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.274 --> 03:08:21.858]  I was ranting so hard, they forgot to go to break.
[03:08:21.858 --> 03:08:25.461]  Hey, put that Texas Monthly cover story back up.
[03:08:25.461 --> 03:08:26.022]  Look at this.
[03:08:26.022 --> 03:08:30.066]  It says, the swine flu vaccines will lead to martial law.
[03:08:31.104 --> 03:08:33.385]  That's coming out of a speaker in the city ceiling.
[03:08:33.385 --> 03:08:53.155]  No, if it was accurate, it would say, Jones, three months before the flu showed up in Mexico, in the wrong season, in the wrong hemisphere, and then top scientists said it was manufactured, said the government is telling police departments there's going to be martial law and cemeteries that are under state regulations in major states.
[03:08:53.155 --> 03:08:59.359]  And I gave you and posted the actual interviews with the emergency managers and people and
[03:09:00.677 --> 03:09:02.378]  What was Aaron Dyke's article?
[03:09:02.378 --> 03:09:04.200]  Preparation for mass graves confirmed?
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:05.701]  Pull it up for people.
[03:09:05.701 --> 03:09:06.341]  Aaron Dyke's.
[03:09:06.341 --> 03:09:10.744]  I mean, pull that article up.
[03:09:10.744 --> 03:09:14.307]  Bureau of cemeteries with the names and phone numbers.
[03:09:14.307 --> 03:09:20.692]  And I said, I don't know if they're going to kill millions, but they've killed millions of Iraqis.
[03:09:20.692 --> 03:09:22.553]  Who knows what they'll do?
[03:09:22.553 --> 03:09:24.555]  And so we were ahead of it.
[03:09:24.555 --> 03:09:25.856]  That's why they hate us.
[03:09:26.806 --> 03:09:32.529]  Because when the police are being told, get ready for martial law for flu, we take it serious.
[03:09:32.529 --> 03:09:36.091]  But no, Texas Monthly says that I said we were going to have martial law.
[03:09:36.091 --> 03:09:37.692]  This is the predictable stuff.
[03:09:37.692 --> 03:09:40.193]  I haven't read the whole article yet.
[03:09:40.193 --> 03:09:41.734]  It's flattering in some ways.
[03:09:41.734 --> 03:09:43.255]  It doesn't say I'm an evil person.
[03:09:43.255 --> 03:09:46.237]  They admit that I really believe this and I'm right about some things.
[03:09:46.237 --> 03:09:52.080]  But, you know, they try to go on and say, but Alex Jones saying that the
[03:09:54.804 --> 03:10:15.231]  Eugenics movement today, or the environmental movement today, or Planned Parenthood of today, even though they were involved in eugenics 50, 60 years ago, that's like saying the Democratic Party today is involved with the Ku Klux Klan, because the Ku Klux Klan were the leaders of the Democratic Party in the 1860s.
[03:10:15.231 --> 03:10:18.452]  Well no, actually Robert Byrd was a Grand Dragon.
[03:10:18.452 --> 03:10:19.913]  He's a Democrat Senator right now.
[03:10:21.121 --> 03:10:28.263]  No, I'm talking about books written by the White House science czar calling for exterminating the population.
[03:10:28.263 --> 03:10:34.384]  We just had a state rep on who was fully aware of it and went to school with these people.
[03:10:34.384 --> 03:10:41.746]  We're talking about current statements like two months ago at Copenhagen when the UN called for a global one-child policy.
[03:10:41.746 --> 03:10:46.427]  That was in the Associated Press!
[03:10:46.427 --> 03:10:48.067]  It's just all baloney.
[03:10:49.517 --> 03:10:51.899]  Because they can't believe this is happening.
[03:10:51.899 --> 03:10:58.666]  In fact, the article opens up with Alex Jones says the whole global warming movement's a fraud.
[03:10:58.666 --> 03:11:05.192]  He did that interview before ClimateGate.
[03:11:05.192 --> 03:11:07.735]  Oh man, look.
[03:11:07.735 --> 03:11:11.799]  Nate Blakeslee that wrote the Texas Monthly article
[03:11:13.926 --> 03:11:20.431]  Really broke and drove the Tulia story about police planting drugs on folks, and I interviewed him years ago.
[03:11:20.431 --> 03:11:26.696]  And he wrote positive articles about Ron Paul, like the elephant in the room, how he's the only real Republican.
[03:11:26.696 --> 03:11:29.238]  So he's not a bad guy, he just doesn't know.
[03:11:29.238 --> 03:11:36.384]  It's like his wife works for City of Austin Water Supply, at least according to, I never asked him about it, but I saw it on her own blog.
[03:11:38.068 --> 03:11:47.270]  I saw a newspaper interview he did, actually, talking about her, and he didn't believe me that 90 plus percent of the EPA scientists
[03:11:48.789 --> 03:12:00.614]  Had written an open letter twice to, from their union, saying, we didn't know fluoride was hundreds of deadly chemicals, they just call fluoride, and the type of fluoride you're putting in precipitates out in the body and causes cancer.
[03:12:00.614 --> 03:12:05.536]  He didn't believe all that, so actually sent it to him, and he called up and said, wow, this is actually true.
[03:12:05.536 --> 03:12:06.996]  I didn't know that.
[03:12:06.996 --> 03:12:11.418]  I guess his water treatment, wastewater wife doesn't know that?
[03:12:11.418 --> 03:12:16.480]  Maybe she's the 10% of, you know, people in this business that don't know about it?
[03:12:18.274 --> 03:12:20.456]  They just don't know.
[03:12:20.456 --> 03:12:23.599]  They just don't understand how real all this is.
[03:12:23.599 --> 03:12:24.940]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[03:12:24.940 --> 03:12:27.842]  I said I was going to go to your phone calls.
[03:12:27.842 --> 03:12:29.724]  I was ranting intensely.
[03:12:29.724 --> 03:12:33.007]  Let me spell it out to people at a third grade level.
[03:12:33.007 --> 03:12:34.368]  Not that my audience is dumb.
[03:12:34.368 --> 03:12:35.869]  The general listener is smarter than I am.
[03:12:35.869 --> 03:12:37.671]  I've really found that.
[03:12:37.671 --> 03:12:44.817]  I don't have some high and mighty view of myself, but studying this I have gotten a few understandings that people don't have.
[03:12:47.754 --> 03:12:56.646]  If they're trying to kill the Debra Medina campaign for her saying, I support people's right to have whatever view they want about 9-11.
[03:12:56.646 --> 03:12:59.550]  The average poll in the US, over 50%, believe it's an inside job.
[03:13:03.231 --> 03:13:07.332]  Six of the ten 9-11 commissioners say it's a cover-up, want a new investigation.
[03:13:07.332 --> 03:13:09.033]  And then, oh my God, this woman!
[03:13:09.033 --> 03:13:12.453]  Last night, we have a video clip up in the article about this.
[03:13:12.453 --> 03:13:15.614]  Sarah Palin 9-1-1 Truth or Controversy makes hypocrite of Glenn Beck.
[03:13:15.614 --> 03:13:17.335]  We have the clip, it's eight and a half minutes long.
[03:13:17.335 --> 03:13:20.816]  I may play part of it later if I have time.
[03:13:20.816 --> 03:13:25.377]  I can't play Beck without stopping and countering him because everything is a distortion or lie.
[03:13:25.377 --> 03:13:26.997]  I've never seen someone that lies this much.
[03:13:26.997 --> 03:13:29.558]  It's like everything that comes out of his mouth is a distortion.
[03:13:32.110 --> 03:13:39.776]  The first thing he does is says the New York Times has written a vicious hit piece against the Tea Parties saying they're violent.
[03:13:39.776 --> 03:13:45.321]  And he goes, oh I thought you said they were a bunch of pathetic geriatrics on walkers.
[03:13:45.321 --> 03:13:50.726]  And he makes the point of they have hundreds of thousands of people at some of these rallies and not one window gets busted out.
[03:13:50.726 --> 03:13:52.487]  So he endears the Tea Party.
[03:13:52.487 --> 03:13:54.068]  I'm defending you against the New York Times.
[03:13:54.068 --> 03:13:54.509]  And then he goes,
[03:13:56.462 --> 03:14:00.745]  There's only 10% of people in the country that believe in 9-11 truth.
[03:14:00.745 --> 03:14:02.287]  That's 5%.
[03:14:02.287 --> 03:14:03.187]  Half the 10%.
[03:14:03.187 --> 03:14:05.229]  The other 5% are birthers.
[03:14:05.229 --> 03:14:10.093]  These 10% on the right and left are dangerous and bad and infiltrators and want to kill the president.
[03:14:14.889 --> 03:14:20.634]  And he knows that in major polls over 60% of registered Republicans question the birth certificate issue.
[03:14:20.634 --> 03:14:23.377]  He knows in polls it's well over 50% on average.
[03:14:23.377 --> 03:14:25.639]  Some are 84, some are 36.
[03:14:25.639 --> 03:14:27.441]  But over 50 on average.
[03:14:27.441 --> 03:14:28.101]  He knows that!
[03:14:28.101 --> 03:14:33.706]  He lies and says 5% of the country are 9-11 truthers and 5% are birthers.
[03:14:33.706 --> 03:14:36.549]  And he does this left-right paradigm thing again.
[03:14:36.549 --> 03:14:40.292]  Well, and then he says, what we need to do is stop the birthers
[03:14:41.087 --> 03:14:44.909]  We need to stop the truthers, we need to stop the DNC and the RNC.
[03:14:44.909 --> 03:14:53.353]  And he does this criminal tell where he kind of, when he says RNC, the guy's completely run by Roger Ailes, the former head RNC strategist.
[03:14:53.353 --> 03:14:55.795]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:14:55.795 --> 03:14:58.096]  It's all lies.
[03:14:58.096 --> 03:15:04.559]  I was watching it last night, the YouTube, and I was stopping it every five seconds, just digesting it.
[03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:08.481]  Everything was lies, except for the very first thing he said about the New York Times.
[03:15:08.481 --> 03:15:09.102]  It was all true.
[03:15:10.305 --> 03:15:14.326]  He spent 30 seconds, maybe a minute, on truth.
[03:15:14.326 --> 03:15:17.067]  That's a worm on a hook.
[03:15:17.067 --> 03:15:18.027]  That's a real worm.
[03:15:18.027 --> 03:15:19.687]  A bass could live off that.
[03:15:19.687 --> 03:15:21.448]  That's good for the bass's tummy.
[03:15:21.448 --> 03:15:22.628]  We're the bass.
[03:15:22.628 --> 03:15:32.930]  He threads the hook, gets that plump nightcrawler on there, drops it into us, but 90% of it was lies after that.
[03:15:32.930 --> 03:15:39.072]  That's the hook, and the string, and the rod, and the reel, and the New World Order on the other end of it.
[03:15:41.829 --> 03:15:48.355]  Bringing in old Glenn Beck.
[03:15:48.355 --> 03:15:51.438]  Bringing in Glenn Beck.
[03:15:51.438 --> 03:15:52.739]  Bringing in all the slaves.
[03:15:52.739 --> 03:15:55.561]  Bringing them in Glenn Beck.
[03:15:55.561 --> 03:15:57.943]  And usually by the fourth hour I get kind of scatterbrained.
[03:15:57.943 --> 03:15:58.304]  It's just
[03:16:06.789 --> 03:16:13.492]  How can Bill O'Reilly be calling for value-added taxes and sales taxes to pay the bankers?
[03:16:13.492 --> 03:16:15.393]  How can they be saying global warming's real?
[03:16:15.393 --> 03:16:20.155]  Palin, O'Reilly, McCain?
[03:16:20.155 --> 03:16:26.378]  How can Beck be supporting all the different bailouts?
[03:16:26.378 --> 03:16:30.880]  He'll have Ron Paul on, and ten minutes after, make fun of him and call him a kook!
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:31.961]  Over and over again!
[03:16:33.562 --> 03:16:43.048]  I hate Chris Matthews, he's a scumbag, a poverty pimp, he creates racism, he creates division, but at least that scumbag is consistent.
[03:16:43.048 --> 03:16:46.771]  No, he lies a lot.
[03:16:46.771 --> 03:16:57.038]  But Beck, but now Matthews is so scared, the establishment is so scared, Matthews was word for word, Watson has a new article out on this, what Beck said last night.
[03:16:58.732 --> 03:17:00.513]  That and Matthews come on at the same time as Beck?
[03:17:00.513 --> 03:17:01.154]  Look that up.
[03:17:01.154 --> 03:17:06.398]  I mean, they're on the same time with the same attack on Debra Medina.
[03:17:12.495 --> 03:17:14.457]  O'Reilly and Matthews come on at the same time.
[03:17:14.457 --> 03:17:20.382]  So you've got all three of these guys the same night leading with attacks on Deborah Medina.
[03:17:20.382 --> 03:17:25.086]  What else don't you people need to get?
[03:17:25.086 --> 03:17:35.935]  We're in a fight with these people over the states, over one of our best, most positive avenues for a solution.
[03:17:35.935 --> 03:17:37.617]  We can take our state houses back.
[03:17:37.617 --> 03:17:38.778]  It's already starting to happen.
[03:17:39.793 --> 03:17:43.956]  We've got to take them back even faster.
[03:17:43.956 --> 03:17:59.666]  And so if we can show that they're hypocrites and that they only made a big deal out of Debra Medina's mild 9-11 truth statement, mild compared to Sarah Palin, mild compared to the Democrat candidate.
[03:17:59.666 --> 03:18:00.206]  What's his name?
[03:18:00.206 --> 03:18:03.028]  I have trouble pronouncing.
[03:18:03.028 --> 03:18:04.089]  I have to have it in front of me.
[03:18:05.512 --> 03:18:09.477]  The Palestinian-American running as the Democrat.
[03:18:09.477 --> 03:18:10.879]  Farouk Shami, the Democrat.
[03:18:10.879 --> 03:18:11.800]  Seems like a pretty nice guy.
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:15.324]  The point is, is he's a gun grabber and for big governments.
[03:18:15.324 --> 03:18:18.628]  He may be a nice guy, but stay the hell away from me, pal.
[03:18:18.628 --> 03:18:23.234]  Stay away from my guns, my land, not your property, but... I'm gonna be a little bit nicer here.
[03:18:23.234 --> 03:18:24.175]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:18:27.113 --> 03:18:29.095]  You have a jewel like Deborah Medina.
[03:18:29.095 --> 03:18:30.396]  She's just a figurehead, though.
[03:18:30.396 --> 03:18:33.578]  A great lady, smart, but a figurehead for all of us.
[03:18:33.578 --> 03:18:40.404]  It's like Ron Paul said he's a figurehead or a focal point for our anger and what we understand and what's going on.
[03:18:40.404 --> 03:18:53.494]  So, if you can point out that Sarah Palin said more 9-11 truth and she's Beck and Perry's darling and throw that back in their face, the media, though it's somewhat controlled, they won't get their orders quick enough,
[03:18:54.315 --> 03:19:00.017]  If it gets out in the next two days, if they don't get their orders to not cover it, this will blow up.
[03:19:00.017 --> 03:19:05.478]  Do we have the power to counter the disinfo of Beck, to throw this back in his face?
[03:19:05.478 --> 03:19:06.779]  Can we do that?
[03:19:06.779 --> 03:19:09.239]  And then leave the charge for states' rights.
[03:19:09.239 --> 03:19:12.540]  If we lose this round, we get smarter each time.
[03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:14.301]  She got a lot of points.
[03:19:14.301 --> 03:19:16.822]  A lot of people are running now because of her success around the country.
[03:19:16.822 --> 03:19:17.402]  It's still a win.
[03:19:19.534 --> 03:19:22.740]  But it's just like I told you back in November with the ClimateGate documents.
[03:19:22.740 --> 03:19:25.906]  We've gotten the Death Star plans.
[03:19:25.906 --> 03:19:27.549]  The Bothans got them to us.
[03:19:27.549 --> 03:19:29.533]  We've got to mount the X-Wing attack now, folks.
[03:19:30.697 --> 03:19:33.159]  And you don't have to actually fly into a Death Star.
[03:19:33.159 --> 03:19:39.383]  You've got to just call Radio TV, email everybody, send this video, this article everywhere, point out Beck's hypocrisy.
[03:19:39.383 --> 03:19:45.447]  Other radio hosts, TV hosts, you don't have to give us credit for breaking this story a year and a half ago or even putting this out now.
[03:19:45.447 --> 03:19:46.248]  Do it yourselves.
[03:19:46.248 --> 03:19:47.108]  Say it's your story.
[03:19:47.108 --> 03:19:47.909]  I don't care.
[03:19:47.909 --> 03:19:51.471]  Just get this story out to everyone now.
[03:19:51.471 --> 03:19:54.013]  A lot of websites take my name off stuff and use it themselves.
[03:19:54.013 --> 03:19:55.994]  Go ahead.
[03:19:55.994 --> 03:19:59.156]  I'm trying to save the country, not be little stooges like you.
[03:19:59.156 --> 03:19:59.777]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.656 --> 03:20:05.219]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[03:20:05.219 --> 03:20:07.501]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[03:20:07.501 --> 03:20:08.362]  Don't!
[03:20:08.362 --> 03:20:11.805]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[03:20:11.805 --> 03:20:18.930]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:20.892]  's number one debt secret.
[03:20:20.892 --> 03:20:24.996]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[03:20:24.996 --> 03:20:27.678]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[03:20:28.098 --> 03:20:35.485]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:20:35.485 --> 03:20:36.666]  Herb K was right.
[03:20:36.666 --> 03:20:39.849]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:20:39.849 --> 03:20:41.210]  What have you got to lose?
[03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:44.333]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money!

[03:20:49.720 --> 03:20:49.760]  888-352-7726.
[03:21:01.559 --> 03:21:03.900]  Hi, this is Peter Krashenable with Midas Resources.
[03:21:03.900 --> 03:21:08.683]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[03:21:08.683 --> 03:21:15.307]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[03:21:15.307 --> 03:21:17.809]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:21:17.809 --> 03:21:20.390]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[03:21:20.390 --> 03:21:25.553]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[03:21:25.553 --> 03:21:26.894]  Lose on your capital investment,
[03:21:27.054 --> 03:21:30.417]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[03:21:30.417 --> 03:21:36.782]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[03:21:36.782 --> 03:21:40.866]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:21:40.866 --> 03:21:45.349]  Call me today, Peter Krashenable at 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:50.474]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:21:50.474 --> 03:21:50.894]  Call 800-686-2237 extension 108.
[03:21:53.416 --> 03:21:55.518]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:55.518 --> 03:21:56.778]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:56.778 --> 03:21:57.899]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:12.330 --> 03:22:14.992]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.992 --> 03:22:21.398]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.398 --> 03:22:26.582]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.582 --> 03:22:36.570]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.690 --> 03:22:39.031]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.031 --> 03:22:40.612]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.612 --> 03:22:43.074]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.074 --> 03:22:45.195]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.195 --> 03:22:50.359]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.359 --> 03:22:55.362]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:23:12.167 --> 03:23:16.353]  You've heard of people spending over $700 for this exact same diet at doctor's offices?

[03:23:31.626 --> 03:23:32.947]  No doctor visit required.
[03:23:32.947 --> 03:23:33.968]  No painful injections.
[03:23:33.988 --> 03:23:34.408]  I think so.
[03:24:07.401 --> 03:24:15.606]  Yeah, down in Texas!
[03:24:15.606 --> 03:24:16.987]  There's a big fight going on.
[03:24:16.987 --> 03:24:19.569]  Not just the nation, the world is watching.
[03:24:21.988 --> 03:24:24.570]  They're trying to sink Debra Medina with 9-11 truth statements.
[03:24:24.570 --> 03:24:25.391]  Like, she's dead.
[03:24:25.391 --> 03:24:26.852]  It's over politically for her.
[03:24:26.852 --> 03:24:28.353]  Polls don't show that.
[03:24:28.353 --> 03:24:35.259]  You take Sarah Palin calling for more 9-11 truth than Medina has, this is going to blow up big time in their face.
[03:24:35.259 --> 03:24:36.420]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:24:36.420 --> 03:24:44.106]  But I'm asking you, the listeners, to get these articles at InfoWars.com about Perry listing myself, Medina, Paul as the number one enemies.
[03:24:44.106 --> 03:24:45.808]  This is from the RNC at the top.
[03:24:45.808 --> 03:24:46.889]  They are threatened by this.
[03:24:48.459 --> 03:24:50.920]  Get the article about Sarah Palin, the 9-11 truther.
[03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:51.821]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:24:51.821 --> 03:24:53.382]  Get these videos out to the media.
[03:24:53.382 --> 03:24:54.702]  Get it out to everyone.
[03:24:54.702 --> 03:24:58.104]  Rusty in Iowa, then Captain Briggs, Blake, Derek, Kevin, and others.
[03:24:58.104 --> 03:24:59.025]  Rusty, you're on the air.
[03:24:59.025 --> 03:25:01.706]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[03:25:01.706 --> 03:25:04.207]  Thanks for doing what you do every day.
[03:25:04.207 --> 03:25:04.488]  Thank you.
[03:25:04.488 --> 03:25:06.369]  What's on your mind?
[03:25:06.369 --> 03:25:08.450]  Well, you're talking about state's rights and stuff like that.
[03:25:08.450 --> 03:25:13.012]  Well, I work in a call center for AT&T, so I'm surrounded by a lot of people every day.
[03:25:13.012 --> 03:25:13.712]  And the other day,
[03:25:15.509 --> 03:25:15.989]  We're good to go.
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:40.421]  Go ahead, Rusty.
[03:25:40.421 --> 03:25:43.503]  Rusty, I appreciate your call, but let me say this.
[03:25:43.503 --> 03:25:45.123]  3% started the Revolutionary War, 5% won it.
[03:25:45.123 --> 03:25:46.544]  Less than 20% fought us, the rest sat out.
[03:26:05.689 --> 03:26:10.793]  Glenn Beck and Newsweek and all these people are targeted to the dumbed-down mainline America.
[03:26:10.793 --> 03:26:13.576]  Dumbed-down leftist, dumbed-down right-wing people.
[03:26:13.576 --> 03:26:14.937]  We don't need all them.
[03:26:14.937 --> 03:26:16.998]  Move on.
[03:26:16.998 --> 03:26:20.541]  Okay, I know there's a lot of dumbed-down people, but look at the awakening happening.
[03:26:20.541 --> 03:26:26.666]  Look at how people laughed at you a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, when you said global warming wasn't real.
[03:26:26.666 --> 03:26:29.048]  But look how it's all falling apart now.
[03:26:29.048 --> 03:26:32.591]  It takes time to destroy the enemy.
[03:26:32.591 --> 03:26:34.413]  Captain Briggs in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:26:35.615 --> 03:26:40.439]  Hey brother, great to hear y'all, keepin' the word goin' on out there to everybody that needs it.
[03:26:40.439 --> 03:26:47.744]  Just wanna let you know I'm on my way, I'll be takin' off at midnight, drivin' from North Central Illinois back to Central Texas.
[03:26:47.744 --> 03:26:52.307]  I'm bringin' my vote back for Debra Medina to be the next governor of the great Republic of Texas.
[03:26:52.307 --> 03:26:56.850]  I'm bringin' my dollars down to the Austin Gun Show this weekend, I hope to see y'all there.
[03:26:56.850 --> 03:27:04.536]  And third off, I wanna put my school-trained, field-tested, psychological operations officer hat on for you for a moment.
[03:27:05.285 --> 03:27:17.390]  And say, you're right on point with what Glenn Beck was trying to do with his little kindergarten cop antics there, breaking down how he was supposed to be rolling out as far as the left-right paradigm.
[03:27:17.390 --> 03:27:18.291]  You're spot-on, brother.
[03:27:18.291 --> 03:27:21.172]  That's all I can say.
[03:27:21.172 --> 03:27:24.614]  Looking forward to seeing you all this weekend, and I would challenge every other person.
[03:27:24.614 --> 03:27:34.738]  If I can drive from north-central Illinois to central Texas, I challenge everybody else there in Bell County, around Fort Hood, Killeen, Copper's Cove, Parker Heights,
[03:27:35.236 --> 03:27:38.940]  Get off your tail feathers, get on down to the voting booth, and cast your vote for Debra Medina.
[03:27:38.940 --> 03:27:49.910]  Well, Captain, Captain, I mean, if we have the neocons internally, and then you can see it on television attacking Debra Medina, how important, how big is this?
[03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:55.115]  See, they understand this will lead to a total states' rights rebellion that they're already losing.
[03:27:55.115 --> 03:27:57.036]  This will be a major victory.
[03:27:57.797 --> 03:27:59.819]  They are running scared.
[03:27:59.819 --> 03:28:11.307]  That's why it's so important to show that Sarah Palin said more 9-11 truth than Medina because they're using the attack on 9-11 truth to get at her.
[03:28:11.307 --> 03:28:17.872]  I mean, do you agree with me that this is devastating if we get the media to cover it?
[03:28:17.872 --> 03:28:26.059]  Exactly, and if you go to my Facebook account, I'm on your friend's page there as well, but I've been extracting as much as I can using a little share button from InfoWars.com.
[03:28:26.849 --> 03:28:27.849]  I hear you, Captain Briggs.
[03:28:27.849 --> 03:28:28.750]  And again, what do you do, folks?
[03:28:28.750 --> 03:28:30.210]  You don't just have to call the media.
[03:28:30.210 --> 03:28:31.571]  Other people will get into the media.
[03:28:31.571 --> 03:28:35.452]  If you put these two articles written by Paul Watson, the one about Perry saying we're the number one enemy,
[03:28:50.638 --> 03:28:54.840]  The one with Sarah Palin, the 9-11 truther, with the videos embedded and all the facts.
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:58.162]  Put it on your MySpace, your Twitter, your Facebook.
[03:28:58.162 --> 03:29:00.424]  Fax it to radio stations, TV stations.
[03:29:00.424 --> 03:29:02.085]  Call into radio stations.
[03:29:02.085 --> 03:29:04.966]  Call the Dallas Morning News, the Austin American-Statesman.
[03:29:04.966 --> 03:29:12.731]  Call, especially in Texas, because then all these people that said, well, I won't go for Medina now because they said she can't win and, you know, I'm not a 9-11 truther.
[03:29:12.731 --> 03:29:16.093]  I'm just a conservative that wants to cut taxes and control our border.
[03:29:17.352 --> 03:29:19.393]  That's great, we want their votes.
[03:29:19.393 --> 03:29:23.096]  So, you've got to show them, wait, Palin agrees!
[03:29:23.096 --> 03:29:24.377]  Maybe that should be the headline.
[03:29:24.377 --> 03:29:28.320]  Sarah Palin agrees with Debra Medina.
[03:29:28.320 --> 03:29:31.882]  And I've got to say this, Palin is not as bad as these other guys.
[03:29:31.882 --> 03:29:36.605]  I mean, she did, actually, two nights ago, defend Palin.
[03:29:36.605 --> 03:29:40.468]  Palin defended Debra Medina on Fox when O'Reilly wanted her to attack her.
[03:29:43.629 --> 03:29:44.830]  Who knows about Sarah Palin?
[03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:47.171]  Maybe she really is a 9-11 truther.
[03:29:47.171 --> 03:29:51.933]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.933 --> 03:29:53.313]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.313 --> 03:29:54.934]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.934 --> 03:29:58.556]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.172 --> 03:30:05.735]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.735 --> 03:30:06.635]  Number one.
[03:30:06.635 --> 03:30:10.078]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:10.078 --> 03:30:10.918]  Number two.
[03:30:10.918 --> 03:30:15.821]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.821 --> 03:30:16.562]  It's true.
[03:30:16.562 --> 03:30:21.425]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.425 --> 03:30:21.965]  Number three.
[03:30:22.245 --> 03:30:25.828]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.828 --> 03:30:30.551]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:30.551 --> 03:30:33.313]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:33.313 --> 03:30:37.776]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:37.776 --> 03:30:41.939]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.939 --> 03:30:46.683]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:46.983 --> 03:30:51.145]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:51.145 --> 03:30:52.926]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:52.926 --> 03:30:55.187]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:30:55.187 --> 03:31:02.890]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:31:02.890 --> 03:31:06.912]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.912 --> 03:31:10.153]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.153 --> 03:31:11.554]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.262 --> 03:31:14.944]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.944 --> 03:31:21.328]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.328 --> 03:31:26.531]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.531 --> 03:31:36.518]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.638 --> 03:31:38.980]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.980 --> 03:31:40.561]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.561 --> 03:31:43.022]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.022 --> 03:31:45.144]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.144 --> 03:31:50.307]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.307 --> 03:31:59.413]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:32:01.448 --> 03:32:05.110]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:06.050]  I'm Cramer.
[03:32:06.050 --> 03:32:11.192]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[03:32:11.192 --> 03:32:18.015]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.

[03:33:17.222 --> 03:33:19.683]  Okay, I'm going to try to accelerate through your calls.
[03:33:19.683 --> 03:33:22.443]  Blake, Derek, Kevin, Rob.
[03:33:22.443 --> 03:33:32.546]  Specifically, do people realize the magnitude of all of the major talk show hosts, not just on Fox, but on MSNBC?
[03:33:32.546 --> 03:33:38.567]  We're getting more videos sent to us by the hour of the other shows all attacking Deborah Medina, saying, do not vote for her.
[03:33:38.567 --> 03:33:39.287]  She can't win.
[03:33:39.287 --> 03:33:40.287]  She's a kook.
[03:33:40.287 --> 03:33:41.288]  She's bad.
[03:33:41.288 --> 03:33:44.348]  She was asked, will you fire an employee if they're a 9-11 truther?
[03:33:44.348 --> 03:33:46.089]  She said, well, people have a right to their own opinion.
[03:33:47.029 --> 03:33:50.790]  But, you know, I don't think it was an inside job.
[03:33:50.790 --> 03:33:52.570]  She doesn't have to totally agree with me.
[03:33:52.570 --> 03:33:54.271]  She wants to cut taxes.
[03:33:54.271 --> 03:33:55.551]  She wants to control our borders.
[03:33:55.551 --> 03:34:00.372]  She wants to get rid of the unconstitutional gun laws and nullify federal laws.
[03:34:00.372 --> 03:34:10.895]  She has the most mild statement compared to Sarah Palin or the Democrat governor candidate, and they go crazy and make a big deal out of nothing, like Howard Dean's roar.
[03:34:14.209 --> 03:34:21.385]  Not that I'm saying Howard Dean was good, but he was kind of the outside candidate, so they made a big much ado about nothing thing about him.
[03:34:21.385 --> 03:34:24.432]  So that the ringer, George W. Bush's cousin,
[03:34:26.297 --> 03:34:29.500]  John Kerry could take a dive and he clearly did win.
[03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:30.141]  So did Al Gore.
[03:34:30.141 --> 03:34:32.003]  I'm not saying it would be good if they got elected.
[03:34:32.003 --> 03:34:34.806]  The point is who the establishment wants gets elected.
[03:34:34.806 --> 03:34:37.108]  John McCain and Sarah Palin were ringers.
[03:34:37.108 --> 03:34:40.772]  So I'm going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[03:34:40.772 --> 03:34:41.112]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:34:41.112 --> 03:34:45.636]  Do you realize how important all of this is and the fact that they're now saying
[03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:50.915]  That, oh, we better not vote for Deborah Medina because of the 9-11 truth statement.
[03:34:50.915 --> 03:34:54.118]  How this will blow up in their face if you get it out to everyone.
[03:34:54.118 --> 03:34:59.103]  It's at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now and so are the videos breaking it down.
[03:34:59.103 --> 03:35:00.405]  Get it out to everyone.
[03:35:01.055 --> 03:35:01.675]  I could do it right now.
[03:35:01.675 --> 03:35:03.056]  I could call the statesman on air.
[03:35:03.056 --> 03:35:05.378]  I could call KI and Austin for you and show you how it's done.
[03:35:05.378 --> 03:35:06.418]  I mean, it's easy.
[03:35:06.418 --> 03:35:07.019]  Call them.
[03:35:07.019 --> 03:35:07.959]  Say, I want your email.
[03:35:07.959 --> 03:35:13.143]  Did you know that Sarah Palin made 9-11 truth comments and it was no big deal that people are demonizing Medina?
[03:35:13.143 --> 03:35:14.283]  Isn't that a big story?
[03:35:14.283 --> 03:35:24.129]  That the big advisor and big supporter of Perry is supposedly a 9-11 truther by the yardstick that Glenn Beck uses?
[03:35:24.129 --> 03:35:25.030]  They will run with it!
[03:35:27.025 --> 03:35:30.427]  I'll be surprised if it isn't in the news by tomorrow if you do your job.
[03:35:30.427 --> 03:35:31.368]  I've done mine.
[03:35:31.368 --> 03:35:34.390]  Please, take action.
[03:35:34.390 --> 03:35:36.251]  I'm going to your calls in T-minus five minutes.
[03:35:36.251 --> 03:35:40.393]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because gold has run up again today.
[03:35:40.393 --> 03:35:42.355]  It was $1,050 a week ago.
[03:35:42.355 --> 03:35:44.076]  It's $1,020 something.
[03:35:44.076 --> 03:35:44.316]  $1,120.
[03:35:44.316 --> 03:35:47.658]  So it's up over $70 right now.
[03:35:47.658 --> 03:35:49.579]  And Ted has a deal.
[03:35:49.579 --> 03:35:50.880]  His deals just get better and better.
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:51.761]  He's just so competitive.
[03:35:52.782 --> 03:35:55.723]  He's never offered this before until about a month ago here.
[03:35:55.723 --> 03:36:16.191]  You get a frank at the $1,050 level, when it's at $1,120 right now announced, and then you get a $159 free yearly newsletter, either digital twice a week or hard copy, what is it, twice a month, mailed to your door, the International Forecaster.
[03:36:16.191 --> 03:36:18.352]  It's 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 pages thick.
[03:36:18.352 --> 03:36:20.073]  It's always different, but it's always beefy.
[03:36:21.153 --> 03:36:27.619]  You may know all about the New World Order, but Bob Chapman's got some key info on the economy, and it's a great way to wake people up.
[03:36:27.619 --> 03:36:32.203]  You can get that free, ordering one franc.
[03:36:32.203 --> 03:36:45.795]  The deal on the franc is already insanely good, but Ted, before we give people the number and tell them how they can get that and some of the gold and silver offers today that also support this network on the tiny profit you make on these type of deals, I guess there's really no profit in this one,
[03:36:46.994 --> 03:36:48.435]  It's a lost leader.
[03:36:48.435 --> 03:36:56.998]  What do you think about the Medina situation and the Sarah Palin situation and the neocons internally?
[03:36:56.998 --> 03:37:07.062]  Ted actually knows who the source is, saying that I am the number one enemy in Texas along with Ron Paul and Medina.
[03:37:07.062 --> 03:37:13.744]  I can tell you right now, Alex, what Beck did to Medina, you know, looks like child's play as far as I'm concerned.
[03:37:13.744 --> 03:37:15.405]  I mean, Medina is a
[03:37:16.169 --> 03:37:22.952]  Incredible source, and I think that's where the fear is here, is that Medina has a real shot at knocking Perry off.
[03:37:22.952 --> 03:37:35.117]  You know, I don't know if Perry is going to have a lot of, you know, what kind of fight he's going to have with the Democrat candidate, but Medina actually is offering the people of the state of Texas what they want.
[03:37:35.117 --> 03:37:38.819]  And they've been wanting this for so long, they're so thirsty for it.
[03:37:39.139 --> 03:37:50.576]  That they're willing to go just about anywhere for it, and it's your listening audience and you, Alex Jones, who happens to be the one, the, the, the, uh, uh, craw in the foot of, uh, Perry.
[03:37:50.576 --> 03:37:53.500]  He is being hammered by your listeners.
[03:37:54.008 --> 03:37:56.429]  And when you say something, people follow it and do it.
[03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:57.810]  And thank God they do.
[03:37:57.810 --> 03:38:05.854]  Because the state of Texas has the option of possibly having some real politicians.
[03:38:05.854 --> 03:38:08.216]  I mean, thank God you have Ron Paul down there.
[03:38:08.216 --> 03:38:12.758]  If you get Debra Medina and Ron Paul in the same state, man, that's a power to reckon with.
[03:38:12.758 --> 03:38:19.682]  Well, Ted, I don't know how much you want to say, but this high-powered, not going to say government official, not going to say media, but it's a household name,
[03:38:20.683 --> 03:38:22.985]  They tried to get a hold of me yesterday.
[03:38:22.985 --> 03:38:25.067]  They got a hold of you.
[03:38:25.067 --> 03:38:28.790]  And then I've made the connection today.
[03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:41.582]  But I mean, when I have the story written by Watson about this super high powered person in a private meeting with with Perry, and he's worried, he's saying Alex Jones, Deborah Medina, Ron Paul.
[03:38:42.262 --> 03:38:48.407]  I mean, the RNC neocons are scared to death of us because this has national import.
[03:38:48.407 --> 03:38:51.069]  I mean, we are the main enemies on their radar.
[03:38:51.069 --> 03:38:51.950]  You sure are.
[03:38:51.950 --> 03:39:01.178]  You were named specifically as being one of the influences that could lose Perry his seat as the governor of Texas.
[03:39:01.178 --> 03:39:02.058]  And I don't know how
[03:39:02.979 --> 03:39:11.143]  Or, how much better of a compliment that you could have, but then to have Perry himself, out of his own lips, say this.
[03:39:11.143 --> 03:39:12.344]  And that's where it came from.
[03:39:12.344 --> 03:39:14.304]  This is Perry's words.
[03:39:14.304 --> 03:39:25.130]  And I can tell you right now, Alex, they're keeping a close eye on you, and I suppose they darn well should be, because you're speaking the truth, and you're giving the people what they want.
[03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:26.430]  Well, let me add something here.
[03:39:29.873 --> 03:39:35.936]  My, well I'm not going to tell the whole story, but there's a lot of high power political people here in Austin.
[03:39:35.936 --> 03:39:48.143]  And I talked to one of these old ladies, who's a family friend of my dad, who, it was actually in the paper, they were having this little impromptu meeting with less than 30 women with Bill Clinton three years ago in Austin.
[03:39:48.143 --> 03:39:49.984]  Spends a lot of time here.
[03:39:49.984 --> 03:39:53.826]  He actually ran some campaigns in Texas before he was governor.
[03:39:53.826 --> 03:39:56.507]  And they said, what do you think of Alex Jones of Infowars?
[03:39:56.507 --> 03:39:57.908]  And Bill Clinton said,
[03:39:59.363 --> 03:40:03.813]  He's one of the most important people in the media in the world.
[03:40:04.770 --> 03:40:07.272]  Specifically about Alex Jones, the conspiracy terrorist.
[03:40:07.272 --> 03:40:14.037]  Now, why is Bill Clinton, privately to high-powered Democrats, saying I'm one of the most important people in the media in the world, three years ago?
[03:40:14.037 --> 03:40:16.479]  Why is Rick Perry saying the Republicans are worried?
[03:40:16.479 --> 03:40:17.420]  We gotta get these people.
[03:40:17.420 --> 03:40:19.562]  Deborah Medina, Ron Paul, Alex Jones.
[03:40:19.562 --> 03:40:23.425]  Not just about his campaign, but overall.
[03:40:23.425 --> 03:40:26.767]  Because, and again, I'm not bragging about this, folks.
[03:40:26.767 --> 03:40:29.049]  It's scary, and I'm not perfect.
[03:40:29.049 --> 03:40:30.750]  The point is, we are real.
[03:40:30.750 --> 03:40:32.712]  People resonate with it, and
[03:40:34.059 --> 03:40:38.642]  I don't think listeners understand, we don't hype up how many people we really reach.
[03:40:38.642 --> 03:40:40.723]  I mean, Ted, it's scary.
[03:40:40.723 --> 03:40:51.448]  I can get off a plane in England, in Canada, in Roatan, Central America, and I can't walk 30 feet now without people running out of shops up to me.
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:41:06.024]  We're much bigger than Glenn Beck globally, not in the U.S., but it's all grassroots because, Ted, it's incredible what we've built here, and I hope they don't kill me or set me up, because Karl Rove is a dangerous person.
[03:41:06.024 --> 03:41:12.806]  Well, you're right about that, and so you're going to have to watch your back, and so is, you know, we're all going to have to watch our back.
[03:41:13.286 --> 03:41:17.228]  But, I mean, that's the main thing, Alex, is that we are reaching a lot of people.
[03:41:17.228 --> 03:41:25.411]  And you look at the traffic of Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, and you compare it to even RushLimbaugh.com, and they're dwarfed by you.
[03:41:26.201 --> 03:41:34.645]  I mean, I was trying to get you on, oh boy, I tell you, Salem Radio Network, they have a lot of 50,000 watt stations.
[03:41:34.645 --> 03:41:42.149]  And here I am trying to pay them money so they pick up your Sunday show so we can get into more markets and have a bigger effect.
[03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:48.632]  And the response to me from them was, is they said, well, we don't like Alex's position on 9-11.
[03:41:48.632 --> 03:41:52.954]  And I just, I wrote them back, I said, you have got to be kidding me.
[03:41:53.607 --> 03:42:04.853]  You know, that is something that happened way back then, and all you're doing is questioning the findings of the 9-11 Commission, and that's enough for them to keep you off of their station?
[03:42:04.853 --> 03:42:09.836]  Well, I've been called over the years and had meetings with many of the top radio executives in the country.
[03:42:10.996 --> 03:42:15.538]  And they all, I mean, they told me 10 years ago, they said, you'll be bigger than Limbaugh.
[03:42:15.538 --> 03:42:18.900]  They wanted to groom me to be the new Glenn Beck.
[03:42:18.900 --> 03:42:20.241]  And I said, no way.
[03:42:20.241 --> 03:42:24.863]  And they said, no more fellow reserve, no more new world order, no more black helicopters.
[03:42:24.863 --> 03:42:26.244]  Now it's no more 9-11.
[03:42:26.244 --> 03:42:29.145]  Look, I've been told, and it's done in confidence, so I don't talk about it.
[03:42:29.145 --> 03:42:30.546]  That's how you keep sources.
[03:42:30.546 --> 03:42:35.109]  I've been told, recant on this and I'll get a $50 million contract.
[03:42:35.109 --> 03:42:37.370]  No, I will do it my way and tell the truth.
[03:42:38.010 --> 03:42:44.516]  But then it's bad if I drive a, you know, a decent Dodge car or live in a house that's safe.
[03:42:44.516 --> 03:42:48.679]  You know, again, again, again, I own things.
[03:42:48.679 --> 03:42:49.960]  Things don't own me.
[03:42:49.960 --> 03:42:52.923]  And I'm doing it my way, telling the truth, just like you are, Ted.
[03:42:52.923 --> 03:42:53.783]  But I want to go to the calls.
[03:42:53.783 --> 03:42:55.145]  I'm not going to keep any more, Ted.
[03:42:55.145 --> 03:42:56.205]  Tell people the gold offer.
[03:42:56.205 --> 03:42:56.706]  Give them the number.
[03:42:57.113 --> 03:43:06.796]  Well, like you said, the frank is the very best thing at $249.61 because I'm buying a full year subscription to Bob's newsletter, The International Forecaster.
[03:43:06.796 --> 03:43:10.597]  Education is the key factor here, and that's why I'm doing it.
[03:43:10.597 --> 03:43:22.220]  So I would suggest that you give us a call for that, but we do have the British Sovereign, we have Walking Liberty Halves, we have Lakota Nation Rounds, Montana Silver Rounds, we have a whole long line of stuff that I bought when gold was at $1,050 an ounce.
[03:43:24.201 --> 03:43:29.304]  And we've seen 1,125 today, to give you an example of what's going on.
[03:43:29.304 --> 03:43:35.227]  So if you are interested, call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:43:35.227 --> 03:43:39.189]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:47.794]  And Alex, I just need to say it, because this is so important to me, that I just want to thank everybody that's been so supportive, because that's what's making the difference.
[03:43:47.794 --> 03:43:52.837]  It's not necessarily you, it's not necessarily me, it's the people behind us that make this work.
[03:43:53.886 --> 03:43:54.546]  Absolutely.
[03:43:54.546 --> 03:43:57.828]  800-686-2237.
[03:43:57.828 --> 03:43:59.929]  Get the frank and then get the free newsletter.
[03:43:59.929 --> 03:44:01.970]  It's the best deal you've ever offered.
[03:44:01.970 --> 03:44:02.131]  800-686-2237.
[03:44:02.131 --> 03:44:04.032]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:44:04.032 --> 03:44:05.993]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[03:44:05.993 --> 03:44:08.934]  Alright, I'm going to jam in as many calls as possible now.
[03:44:08.934 --> 03:44:11.436]  Blake in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:44:11.436 --> 03:44:15.578]  Alex, hey, do you think your source might come public?
[03:44:15.578 --> 03:44:19.160]  Because, based on some of the stuff I'm seeing, I think they may need to.
[03:44:22.312 --> 03:44:23.393]  What does that mean?
[03:44:23.393 --> 03:44:34.280]  Well, okay, Glenn Beck, since his deal, you know he's lost 500,000 viewers since his little attack on Medina?
[03:44:34.280 --> 03:44:35.341]  Yes, I saw that.
[03:44:35.341 --> 03:44:37.942]  I meant to have Watson or Kurt post that.
[03:44:37.942 --> 03:44:39.223]  In fact, I saw that last night.
[03:44:39.223 --> 03:44:40.324]  What was the source on that?
[03:44:40.324 --> 03:44:41.485]  The Nielsen?
[03:44:41.485 --> 03:44:46.008]  It's just actually TV ratings by the guide or something like that.
[03:44:47.057 --> 03:44:47.397]  I don't know.
[03:45:06.607 --> 03:45:13.990]  That's all, I mean, everyone calling in is just going, Glenn Beck, you're a coward, you know, we know what you are, we know what you did to Medina.
[03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:17.851]  I think that their first little attack, their first strike didn't work.
[03:45:21.798 --> 03:45:23.799]  It didn't work completely.
[03:45:23.799 --> 03:45:25.199]  It's kind of like a glancing blow.
[03:45:25.199 --> 03:45:33.882]  Somebody with a sword tries to chop your head off, and you kind of block with your shield, but the sword hacks through the wood to shield and cuts into your arm.
[03:45:33.882 --> 03:45:44.306]  I mean, it wasn't good, but if we point out that he's a hypocrite, and that he set it up and spun it, and that Palin said even more, it will destroy this Goliath.
[03:45:44.306 --> 03:45:46.887]  But the point about Beck is, yes, I know he's in deep trouble.
[03:45:47.327 --> 03:45:53.214]  That's because the power of this show and the power of Ron Paul and the power of Texas and the rest of the country.
[03:45:53.214 --> 03:45:59.642]  That's why they even brought in Chris Matthews as their backup, saying he was right.
[03:45:59.642 --> 03:46:05.048]  See, they're in panic mode, not because if she gets elected as governor.
[03:46:05.048 --> 03:46:07.291]  That's not even that powerful of a position in Texas.
[03:46:08.578 --> 03:46:13.180]  Because we had some Civil War corrupt governors that were installed, so the state weakened the governorship.
[03:46:13.180 --> 03:46:16.802]  But as a bully pulpit, she'll be able to lead things through the legislature.
[03:46:16.802 --> 03:46:29.068]  It's the message it sends to states' rights people nationwide, and getting Ron Paul-type people to run, and like George Washington winning a battle at Trenton, it buoys morale.
[03:46:29.068 --> 03:46:34.731]  But when you say they may have to come out, that's like people saying, give me your source on this or that.
[03:46:34.731 --> 03:46:35.971]  Ted got a call.
[03:46:35.971 --> 03:46:36.612]  I got the call.
[03:46:37.552 --> 03:46:45.537]  Famous, well-known person inside this whole thing, and they told us what we already knew as the manifestation.
[03:46:45.537 --> 03:46:52.781]  But if our source is able to come out, then someday they will.
[03:46:52.781 --> 03:46:55.662]  You lose sources if you tell people who your sources are.
[03:46:55.662 --> 03:46:58.064]  But anything else, Blake?
[03:46:58.064 --> 03:46:59.905]  No, that's it.
[03:46:59.905 --> 03:47:00.265]  Thank you.
[03:47:00.265 --> 03:47:01.085]  God bless you.
[03:47:01.085 --> 03:47:02.146]  We need a headline on that.
[03:47:02.146 --> 03:47:03.787]  Beck loses 500,000 viewers.
[03:47:03.787 --> 03:47:05.548]  I mean, I can't keep track of all this.
[03:47:06.778 --> 03:47:08.760]  He's got 4 million on average.
[03:47:08.760 --> 03:47:11.942]  One of the best in cable for cable news.
[03:47:11.942 --> 03:47:15.285]  And he loses 500,000.
[03:47:15.285 --> 03:47:16.246]  What is that?
[03:47:16.246 --> 03:47:17.387]  10% of his audience?
[03:47:17.387 --> 03:47:21.130]  Or a little more than 10%?
[03:47:21.130 --> 03:47:23.552]  That'd be 12, 13%?
[03:47:23.552 --> 03:47:24.833]  Do the dividing for me, guys.
[03:47:24.833 --> 03:47:25.794]  I'm public school educated.
[03:47:25.794 --> 03:47:27.555]  Took me a while here with paper.
[03:47:27.555 --> 03:47:32.720]  What does 500,000 divide out of 4 million, Ash?
[03:47:32.720 --> 03:47:33.721]  Will you guys want to give me the numbers?
[03:47:34.940 --> 03:47:36.561]  Pull that up for me.
[03:47:36.561 --> 03:47:38.582]  Let's go ahead and talk to Derek.
[03:47:38.582 --> 03:47:40.844]  Derek in Wisconsin.
[03:47:40.844 --> 03:47:43.406]  You're on the air.
[03:47:43.406 --> 03:47:44.807]  Hi, Alex.
[03:47:44.807 --> 03:47:46.268]  It's very awesome to talk with you.
[03:47:46.268 --> 03:47:48.910]  I'm very proud of what you do for this country.
[03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:51.831]  I thank you very well.
[03:47:51.831 --> 03:47:57.115]  First time caller, I just want to say that I've been listening to your program for probably three weeks now.
[03:47:59.409 --> 03:48:02.130]  I was a definite Obama follower.
[03:48:02.130 --> 03:48:04.010]  I danced when he was elected.
[03:48:04.010 --> 03:48:07.631]  I just give you an idea where I was at that point.
[03:48:07.631 --> 03:48:19.153]  Because of Bush, I held Obama on a short lease and I just watched him and I was finding anything to help me understand what was going on and then I saw the Obama deception and that changed pretty much everything for me.
[03:48:19.153 --> 03:48:21.514]  And that's what we're here for, to expose puppets.
[03:48:21.514 --> 03:48:22.894]  Obama, Beck, any of them.
[03:48:23.956 --> 03:48:25.477]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:48:25.477 --> 03:48:30.979]  I noticed you haven't talked about this on the show today, and I want to point this out to everyone listening.
[03:48:30.979 --> 03:48:43.904]  I usually go to mainstream news sites and look for news stories that kind of blow my mind, and CNN.com, one of their video things right on their front page today, cyber attacks is U.S.
[03:48:43.904 --> 03:48:44.904]  ready?
[03:48:44.904 --> 03:48:47.325]  I watched the video, and it had
[03:48:47.955 --> 03:48:54.221]  Home, Department of Homeland Security Leader, Treasury Secretary, Secretary of State.
[03:48:54.221 --> 03:48:59.606]  Yeah, no, no, they're saying they're gonna tax, they're gonna tax the internet in the name of saving it from cyber attacks.
[03:48:59.606 --> 03:49:00.587]  Send us the video.
[03:49:00.587 --> 03:49:01.668]  Gotta jump here.
[03:49:01.668 --> 03:49:02.349]  Thank you, Derek.
[03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:04.631]  Kevin in Utah, you're on the air.
[03:49:04.631 --> 03:49:06.052]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:49:06.052 --> 03:49:07.353]  Go ahead.
[03:49:07.353 --> 03:49:10.416]  Uh, Alex, I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[03:49:10.416 --> 03:49:11.437]  I woke up in 1985, but I need to, uh,
[03:49:14.252 --> 03:49:18.875]  Let everybody know that Glenn Beck is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:49:18.875 --> 03:49:29.402]  For the Mormon people, which I am one, the best sources of news is Joel Skousen, Ken Bauer, and Jack Burnett.
[03:49:29.402 --> 03:49:31.343]  But Glenn Beck's got it coming.
[03:49:31.343 --> 03:49:36.386]  And Skousen, who's a relative of the guy that wrote, what, The Naked Capitalist?
[03:49:36.386 --> 03:49:38.587]  The Naked Communist.
[03:49:38.587 --> 03:49:40.769]  He's spoken out against Beck as a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:49:41.380 --> 03:49:42.741]  Yes, definitely.
[03:49:42.741 --> 03:49:45.943]  He lives in Orem, Utah.
[03:49:45.943 --> 03:49:47.884]  I live in Spanish Fork, south of him.
[03:49:47.884 --> 03:49:58.050]  But the situation is that he was trying to get the campaign of Ron Paul up here in Utah, and it was quite hard with the Deseret News and all of our media.
[03:49:58.050 --> 03:50:06.756]  But I just want to tell him that Glenn Beck is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and the time's going to come when he's going to get in real trouble.
[03:50:07.554 --> 03:50:08.675]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[03:50:08.675 --> 03:50:09.976]  Let's jam in one more.
[03:50:09.976 --> 03:50:11.536]  Rob in California, go ahead.
[03:50:11.536 --> 03:50:14.238]  Alex.
[03:50:14.238 --> 03:50:15.619]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:15.619 --> 03:50:16.420]  How's it going?
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:16.720]  Good.
[03:50:16.720 --> 03:50:19.381]  I had a couple quick comments and a question for you.
[03:50:19.381 --> 03:50:19.762]  Go ahead.
[03:50:19.762 --> 03:50:29.648]  I think at this point, there should be some coordination between you, Dr. Stanley Monteith, and others to do interviews as much as you can with
[03:50:30.461 --> 03:50:37.106]  Medina, Palin, those people that... Well, I mean, Medina loves me and thinks I'm great.
[03:50:37.106 --> 03:50:37.926]  I would have her on more.
[03:50:37.926 --> 03:50:41.068]  Her campaign people would rather put her on an internet show with five listeners.
[03:50:41.068 --> 03:50:45.952]  And maybe that's a good strategy, but she is going to be on Sunday in between some things she's doing.
[03:50:45.952 --> 03:50:47.153]  We would have her on more.
[03:50:47.153 --> 03:50:50.875]  We're here supporting her as much as we can, believe me.
[03:50:50.875 --> 03:50:55.879]  But I'll come back, let you finish up your statement on the other side.
[03:50:55.879 --> 03:50:57.220]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51:02.660 --> 03:51:09.344]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:51:09.344 --> 03:51:15.749]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:51:15.749 --> 03:51:22.073]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:51:22.073 --> 03:51:26.976]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:51:27.456 --> 03:51:35.620]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:51:35.620 --> 03:51:40.223]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[03:51:40.223 --> 03:51:43.945]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:51:44.845 --> 03:51:48.406]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:51:48.406 --> 03:51:51.086]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:51:51.086 --> 03:51:53.347]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.518 --> 03:52:15.200]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.200 --> 03:52:21.585]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.585 --> 03:52:26.649]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.649 --> 03:52:36.777]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.877 --> 03:52:39.219]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.219 --> 03:52:40.820]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.820 --> 03:52:43.281]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.281 --> 03:52:45.403]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.403 --> 03:52:50.546]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.546 --> 03:52:59.652]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:03.340 --> 03:53:05.341]  Remain in your houses.
[03:53:05.341 --> 03:53:11.123]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:53:11.123 --> 03:53:12.464]  Will they do it?
[03:53:12.464 --> 03:53:15.085]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:53:15.085 --> 03:53:21.547]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:53:21.547 --> 03:53:22.808]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:53:23.749 --> 03:53:28.013]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:53:28.013 --> 03:53:32.919]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:53:32.919 --> 03:53:37.825]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:53:37.825 --> 03:53:42.650]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:53:43.551 --> 03:53:51.978]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[03:53:51.978 --> 03:53:54.481]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[03:53:54.481 --> 03:53:57.543]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[03:53:57.543 --> 03:54:05.370]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:54:05.370 --> 03:54:07.772]  They don't want to see us
[03:54:11.906 --> 03:54:16.669]  There's a six-and-a-half page cover story in Texas Monthly.
[03:54:16.669 --> 03:54:18.250]  It's millions of readers.
[03:54:18.250 --> 03:54:20.371]  It's the biggest magazine in Texas.
[03:54:20.371 --> 03:54:23.133]  It's taken all over the world.
[03:54:23.133 --> 03:54:26.535]  And Jaron read it, and his vote is it's a pretty positive article.
[03:54:26.535 --> 03:54:27.636]  I've scanned over it.
[03:54:27.636 --> 03:54:32.018]  It's got some little snipes, but it's better than most.
[03:54:32.018 --> 03:54:34.019]  It's better than most, and hell, that
[03:54:35.240 --> 03:55:04.558]  Dan Winters listed as one of the top five photographers in the world as a fan and I got invited out to his little photography studio and we're gonna get him in studio coming up the next month and I mean it was the photos in here they're coming after me folks they're identifying says Alex Jones can't say that can he and you open it up to the page three where it lists all the top stories look at that
[03:55:06.459 --> 03:55:09.362]  We're half, no, no, two-thirds the page.
[03:55:09.362 --> 03:55:15.329]  I mean, that is crazy.
[03:55:15.329 --> 03:55:20.695]  And he's like the only photographer I've ever seen who actually captured what I really look like.
[03:55:20.695 --> 03:55:25.160]  It's not that I'm not photogenic, it's just cameras make me look different than what I look like in the mirror.
[03:55:25.160 --> 03:55:26.702]  These photos actually look like me.
[03:55:27.745 --> 03:55:30.887]  That's, when I look at that, that's what I see in the mirror every day.
[03:55:30.887 --> 03:55:33.168]  And then I look at myself on TV, that's not what I look like.
[03:55:33.168 --> 03:55:34.288]  It's weird.
[03:55:34.288 --> 03:55:39.171]  Not that I look bad, it's just that, you know, in person, the ladies have a little bit of trouble.
[03:55:39.171 --> 03:55:44.433]  I'm just screwing around, folks, trying to have some fun here.
[03:55:44.433 --> 03:55:52.497]  I'm actually extremely exhausted a lot of days now, because I went to bed late at night and got up at 4 a.m., and I kind of spent out in the last hour.
[03:55:52.497 --> 03:55:53.998]  Sometimes I think about getting rid of the fourth hour.
[03:55:55.094 --> 03:55:57.737]  Well, maybe it's time for you to consider having a
[03:56:20.402 --> 03:56:27.072]  A red phone that Beck and O'Reilly and Hannity can call into since they want to be representative truthers.
[03:56:27.072 --> 03:56:28.854]  Well that's pretty close to who called me!
[03:56:28.854 --> 03:56:32.059]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's crazy.
[03:56:36.491 --> 03:56:42.834]  I am a little bit excited today because this is dangerous what we're doing, and I appreciate your call, but we are really hurting them.
[03:56:42.834 --> 03:56:44.495]  We can fight these people.
[03:56:44.495 --> 03:56:46.856]  We have power, thanks to God's good grace.
[03:56:46.856 --> 03:56:48.937]  We can stand up like our founding fathers.
[03:56:48.937 --> 03:56:50.718]  You have to believe in that.
[03:56:50.718 --> 03:56:54.220]  Dave in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:56:54.220 --> 03:56:55.640]  He just dropped.
[03:56:55.640 --> 03:56:58.282]  Phil in New York, you're on the air.
[03:56:58.282 --> 03:56:59.242]  Hello, Alex.
[03:56:59.242 --> 03:57:01.123]  It's the first time I've called you.
[03:57:01.123 --> 03:57:02.964]  Welcome, sir.
[03:57:02.964 --> 03:57:04.885]  I've been a fan of yours for two years now.
[03:57:05.871 --> 03:57:10.034]  And between you and Joyce, I don't even listen to my television anymore.
[03:57:10.034 --> 03:57:12.456]  Well good to have you on board.
[03:57:12.456 --> 03:57:13.617]  What's going on?
[03:57:13.617 --> 03:57:16.099]  I just wanted to bring up a couple things I had a chance to say.
[03:57:16.099 --> 03:57:22.724]  First thing, Glenn Beck used to be a fan of his, but he got sick.
[03:57:22.724 --> 03:57:25.086]  And then when he came back he started talking different.
[03:57:26.169 --> 03:57:35.315]  I'm not upset with Glenn Beck, but if you disappear for a few months and get sick and start calling back, talking funny, I won't be mad at you.
[03:57:35.315 --> 03:57:38.517]  I'll just realize that somebody got your grandkids' fingernails.
[03:57:38.517 --> 03:57:49.404]  Actually, it was declassified that that was what the main MKUltra program was built around, was grabbing prominent people, electroshocking them, torturing them for even a month, and
[03:57:50.586 --> 03:57:53.188]  Then, most people will do whatever they're told after that.
[03:57:53.188 --> 03:57:54.969]  It erases their memory.
[03:57:54.969 --> 03:57:56.710]  They then reprogram them.
[03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:59.952]  And they did that to Ronald Reagan after they shot him, no doubt.
[03:57:59.952 --> 03:58:03.255]  And Beck did get a lot worse after he got grabbed.
[03:58:03.255 --> 03:58:04.896]  I mean, after he got sick.
[03:58:06.621 --> 03:58:07.782]  Almost died, he said.
[03:58:07.782 --> 03:58:16.506]  If anybody is a candidate for mind control, it is Glenn Beck.
[03:58:16.506 --> 03:58:17.887]  That guy is incredible.
[03:58:17.887 --> 03:58:19.788]  Folks, we have articles at Infowars.com.
[03:58:19.788 --> 03:58:22.129]  Thanks for the call, Dave.
[03:58:22.129 --> 03:58:24.790]  That will devastate.
[03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:25.891]  That wasn't Dave, that was Phil.
[03:58:27.045 --> 03:58:30.546]  We have information that will devastate the globalists.
[03:58:30.546 --> 03:58:36.348]  Inside info, key info on Sarah Palin, the 9-11 truther, at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:36.348 --> 03:58:37.528]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:58:37.528 --> 03:58:39.809]  I cover it the first hour in detail.
[03:58:39.809 --> 03:58:43.150]  Second wind coming up right now.
[03:58:43.150 --> 03:58:44.811]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:44.811 --> 03:58:46.271]  It's a free podcast.
[03:58:46.271 --> 03:58:47.211]  Oh, we're fighting tyranny.
[03:58:47.211 --> 03:58:47.792]  It's so much fun.
[03:58:47.792 --> 03:58:48.232]  I love it.
[03:58:48.232 --> 03:58:48.752]  Good job, crew.
[03:58:53.390 --> 03:58:57.351]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:58:57.351 --> 03:59:06.213]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:59:06.213 --> 03:59:10.854]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:59:10.854 --> 03:59:21.656]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:59:22.296 --> 03:59:31.801]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:59:31.801 --> 03:59:37.243]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
