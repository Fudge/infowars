[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:32.040]  Texas Alex Jones we have a devastatingly important radio show today for you
[00:32.040 --> 00:41.960]  ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the 20th day of May 2009 I'm going to be
[00:41.960 --> 00:51.400]  live here for the next four hours obviously I have news of great import
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.280]  as world government is openly set up in front of everyone as the federal
[00:55.280 --> 00:59.080]  government takes over every facet of society here in the United States and
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.280]  his other puppet central governments expand control of the hegemonic money
[01:03.280 --> 01:11.400]  power but something happened here at the office yesterday that upset me so
[01:11.400 --> 01:24.320]  bad but not in a hysterical type of upset I have a deep deep disgust it's
[01:24.320 --> 01:36.000]  deeper than hatred it's more like a raw spot at my core gnawing at me only
[01:36.000 --> 01:47.400]  counterbalanced by the love I have for innocent innocent souls and I hadn't
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.080]  eaten much lunch I hadn't eaten a breakfast yesterday and I've been so
[01:50.080 --> 02:00.240]  upset by this I can't eat and I couldn't sleep last night and let me tell you I
[02:00.240 --> 02:08.720]  can always see and I could almost always sleep I'm not hungry and I'm just
[02:08.720 --> 02:16.200]  completely angry but more than angry I'm just hurt because I know tyranny when I
[02:16.200 --> 02:22.840]  see it I know evil when I see it and I just realized the blight that's on our
[02:22.840 --> 02:27.960]  land you know it's characterized as a fight between the people in the
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.040]  government really the people in the government the government's drawn out
[02:31.040 --> 02:37.040]  of the people the government is just a tool a mechanism enslaving those that
[02:37.040 --> 02:43.080]  work in it as well it's a very sad pathetic situation we're in how we're
[02:43.080 --> 02:50.720]  played off against each other coming up in an hour and a half in studio we are
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.840]  going to have one of the customer service ladies who works here in this
[02:56.840 --> 03:07.840]  office named Janet Janet Sanchez very nice worked here quite a while really
[03:07.840 --> 03:17.360]  friendly smart you know has a good spirit I like her and I got off the
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.320]  area stand was about 3 30 and I was gonna go home and see my family and then
[03:20.320 --> 03:27.120]  come back and work last night and I walked into a little administrative you
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.880]  know human resource for all resources in a little human resource office that's
[03:30.880 --> 03:34.360]  not what we call it but that's what it'd be called and you know she looked like
[03:34.360 --> 03:41.600]  she'd seen a ghost and had tears in her eyes and I said what's wrong and then
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.960]  she began to tell me what had happened at the family destruction center the
[03:47.960 --> 03:54.560]  prison induction center the re-indoctrination center known as the
[03:54.560 --> 04:00.200]  public school their eight-year-old daughter Haley and you know you read
[04:00.200 --> 04:07.720]  about this type of stuff in the news but when it actually happens to somebody
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.640]  you know it's as if it happened to me because my instincts are straight my
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.360]  head screwed on point in the right direction in my gut I empathize for her
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.800]  but the instinct the programming is I'm I'm realizing at a base level that could
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.640]  happen to her it could happen to me and somebody who works for you is in your
[04:29.640 --> 04:33.680]  tribe as they say psychologically at least if you've got your head screwed on
[04:33.680 --> 04:40.720]  straight and then the story that unfolded and what we confirmed is
[04:40.720 --> 04:53.760]  unbelievable but in today's sick society it's very believable these sickos love

[07:24.760 --> 07:28.040]  you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending

[08:27.000 --> 08:31.040]  Obama is further confirming the torture secret arrest and definite
[08:31.040 --> 08:36.520]  detention will continue camps will be set up in the United States for foreigners
[08:36.520 --> 08:41.680]  and US citizens alike nothing but lobbyists will be hired

[09:02.040 --> 09:05.600]  open phones but coming up in an hour and a half from now or about an hour and 20
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.480]  minutes now we're gonna have in studio a nice lady who works here in my office
[09:12.480 --> 09:18.360]  with the CPS violating her and her eight-year-old daughter's rights in the
[09:18.360 --> 09:24.000]  government training camp and just engaging in all sorts of sickening
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.640]  despicable criminal activity and they do it wantedly because the state claims it
[09:30.640 --> 09:36.640]  has immunity you do not have immunity it's another mind trick they play so you
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.120]  go into police departments they won't let you file complaints on other cops well
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.400]  then you file charges on them with the court that's criminal to not follow the
[09:44.400 --> 09:52.880]  law the state has declared war on us when the state abuses children I mean
[09:52.880 --> 09:55.920]  killing them beating them hurting them badly nothing happens because they
[09:55.920 --> 10:01.520]  protect themselves that's why just department's own numbers show that CPS
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.800]  is five times more likely than any other demographic to abuse children they
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.600]  also have the most pedophiles in their ranks well who else could go grab
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.840]  screaming children away from parents for no reason these are monstrous people you
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.240]  got pedophiles you got control freaks you got the people that like to get the
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.800]  bounties they get big bonuses they get money for every child they snatch that's
[10:24.800 --> 10:34.400]  on record that's federal law so what I'm gonna do in the next hour and a half is
[10:34.400 --> 10:45.520]  I'm going to lay out the horrors the horrors of what I have witnessed CPS do
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.480]  with my own eyeballs and I'm gonna take your phone calls with your horror
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.560]  stories quickly and succinctly now people will notice that a fella called the
[10:55.560 --> 11:05.840]  show Sunday night hyperventilating about how they came and took his wife's
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.160]  children from another marriage and took their newborn baby while they were at it
[11:11.160 --> 11:18.200]  and at a certain point I just hung up on him saying I I wish I could help you
[11:18.800 --> 11:25.640]  because if I was to emotionally identify with him it would cause me days of
[11:25.640 --> 11:34.080]  agony and I've likened it to I'm a person in a lifeboat in a ICC and there
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.280]  are millions of hands reaching out grabbing scrabbling for a hold on the
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.360]  side of the little boat trying to pull themselves in and I'm in a lifeboat that's
[11:44.360 --> 11:48.920]  already got so many people in it that it's right down to the water's edge the
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.440]  water is almost coming over and flooding us we're on the verge of being
[11:53.440 --> 12:02.840]  foundered of being capsized of being engulfed by the water it's lapping over
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.360]  the side we're bailing for our lives and I see children dying everywhere from
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.280]  cancer from the vaccines and what's in the food and water nothing stopping and
[12:12.280 --> 12:17.240]  it's only intensifying I see the corruption I see the dying core
[12:17.240 --> 12:20.800]  Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings in Chicago Tribune
[12:20.800 --> 12:26.760]  BBC congressional testimony nothing happens to him I see so many crimes so
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.600]  many evils it's encyclopedic maybe I should write a book you know the
[12:30.600 --> 12:35.480]  encyclopedia of government crimes or something I mean it's just so legion it
[12:35.480 --> 12:47.520]  makes my mind real and it makes me real that I not strong enough that I that I
[12:47.520 --> 12:53.160]  can't work 48 hours a day that I don't have the will that that this stuff can
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.400]  get to me and then I can't just robotically move against it that this
[12:57.400 --> 13:03.600]  is see see ladies and gentlemen I look at Brad Pitt at cans you know I'm on the
[13:03.600 --> 13:11.960]  drudge report I see the photo soaking in a bizarre ego trip with the director and
[13:11.960 --> 13:19.760]  it makes me nauseous and I see that ego trip in Brad Pitt and it makes me
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.440]  nauseous because I've been on ego trips and I'm still on an ego trip to a
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.240]  certain extent though almost all of it is burned away people misidentified just
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.880]  passion and fury and focus and dedication to bring down tyranny as ego but
[13:34.880 --> 13:41.120]  I'll tell you my deep hatred and it's deep it's deep and I don't like it it's
[13:41.120 --> 13:52.040]  so deep I know it's my core is stronger than anything you can imagine it's
[13:52.040 --> 14:01.240]  light years deeper than peacock behavior preening peacock behavior in fact I
[14:01.240 --> 14:12.120]  miss the psychological diversion of dress-up of imaginary play of status
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.640]  that's all it is it's childlike game the last remnants of that are burning off my
[14:18.640 --> 14:30.040]  hull and I'll tell you in a way I don't like what I see because I see a machine
[14:30.760 --> 14:46.480]  and I'm who I am is changing and it it shakes me but I'm telling you all of you
[14:46.480 --> 14:52.360]  have to steal yourselves and you have to become like metal you have to turn the
[14:52.360 --> 15:06.200]  forges on in your heart of resistance to tyranny you have to commit and you have
[15:06.200 --> 15:10.040]  to hate evil you know they tell you don't hate the whole Bible is about
[15:10.040 --> 15:15.480]  hating evil and loving good but I'll tell you at that core where there's that
[15:15.480 --> 15:22.680]  deep hatred that's so strong it can't even be registered it can't even be
[15:22.680 --> 15:31.800]  articulated there is also something just as strong and that is the love of
[15:31.800 --> 15:36.680]  innocence and beauty and of family and of everything wholesome and good
[15:36.680 --> 15:42.320]  everything beautiful everything honorable and then I realized that my hate of
[15:42.320 --> 15:47.960]  the enemy isn't the strongest thing in my heart it is only the armor wrapped
[15:47.960 --> 15:56.320]  around that love of the innocent and it is my commitment to stand up against
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.600]  anything to commit to the end and I realize at that point the last vestiges
[16:02.600 --> 16:12.680]  of fear have left me it is now gone completely from me all that is left is
[16:12.680 --> 16:23.920]  a complete drive to be everything I'm meant to be and to fight the enemy as
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.320]  smartly as I can and to be focused you know I do four hours of radio a day and
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.080]  it's fun to go wild it's fun to make jokes and it's fun to imitate and be
[16:32.080 --> 16:34.760]  satirical and make fun of the establishment that's one reason we've
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.400]  been successful but in my gut it I know that's wrong I am going to be more
[16:40.400 --> 16:44.040]  effective it doesn't mean I'll change completely overnight but I can see where
[16:44.040 --> 16:49.360]  this transformation takes me towards being more focused more serious more
[16:49.360 --> 16:57.720]  disciplined and to try to launch more effective movements and organizations and
[16:57.720 --> 17:05.240]  really get serious and that means get the people that work around me serious in
[17:05.240 --> 17:10.960]  this mission to take on evil because if you are in denial about the fact that
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.640]  evil is running rampant it is and think about that means rampant it is running
[17:16.640 --> 17:28.200]  pale male helter-skelter wild on every point of the compass it is a disease it
[17:28.200 --> 17:38.000]  is it is a mental virus a spirit that is just replicating and and it's as if
[17:38.000 --> 17:46.520]  giant reservoirs of stinking cess have been dumped into the streets of our
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.560]  world I am not going to be part of it and I'm just glad and I am blessed and I
[17:52.560 --> 17:57.560]  am thankful that I grew up and I made my mistakes and I did things that were
[17:57.560 --> 18:06.280]  wrong but in the end I ended up getting going down the right path and I for as
[18:06.280 --> 18:12.200]  much as I hate evil I feel sorry for the zombie like creatures that we that that
[18:12.200 --> 18:16.560]  we call our fellow humans that are so weak-minded and so given over to evil
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.920]  that they can't recognize the evil they're involved in when they're in the
[18:19.920 --> 18:27.920]  middle of it and let me tell you I don't revel in the fact that you are so
[18:27.920 --> 18:33.960]  broken and wicked and pathetic and degenerate because you're dangerous a
[18:33.960 --> 18:41.960]  locked jam of dead bodies on a hundred foot tall island floating through the
[18:41.960 --> 18:47.760]  sea and certainly overtake you and smother you when you're out on the open
[18:47.760 --> 18:52.960]  sea of the world and so you're very dangerous for all the wrought holes in
[18:52.960 --> 18:58.520]  your soul all the spiritual worms coming out of your eyeballs and out of the
[18:58.520 --> 19:04.520]  nose out of the hole in your face where your nose was I see what you are you're
[19:04.520 --> 19:13.040]  like the portrait of mr. Gray God look at you look at what's become of you and
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.920]  I'll tell those out there that have been serving evil we thought it was sexy at
[19:16.920 --> 19:21.080]  first and got into it for power if you if I can reach you now and there's still
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.320]  some good left in you turn back now if you feel an overtaking spirit of
[19:26.320 --> 19:30.040]  wickedness wanting to make you giggle and laugh about this this isn't funny and
[19:30.040 --> 19:37.000]  you know it there's still time for you to turn back there's still time for you
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.640]  to break the conditioning and the programming and the brainwashing and
[19:40.640 --> 19:48.440]  the spiritual bondage you're under but I don't know how much further you can go
[19:48.440 --> 19:55.160]  for those of you who are fully given over to it and are basically Nazgul you
[19:55.160 --> 20:02.680]  will fall the ride back have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams
[20:02.680 --> 20:06.280]  personal hygiene products vitamins or herbal supplements did you know that
[20:06.280 --> 20:10.280]  most skin creams body lotions shampoos and toothpaste contain chemical additives
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.440]  such as sodium laurel sulfate the same type of detergent used in dish soap did
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.120]  you know that many multi vitamin supplements are made from synthetic

[24:36.520 --> 24:41.280]  Dinecore and Halliburton publicly run giant child kidnapping rings and then
[24:41.280 --> 24:44.640]  you have the fact that when you go to most pediatricians or most doctors now
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.560]  even adults they say hey do you have firearms in your house are they locked
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.680]  away safely you'll be like no they're you know in the gun case well they call
[24:53.680 --> 24:58.400]  CPS on you or in the states where they have gun laws about how to lock them up
[24:58.400 --> 25:05.940]  they send a SWAT team and it's amazing in fact I've even got senator Glenn
[25:05.940 --> 25:10.840]  growthman putting out an article here seeing medical care and firearm
[25:10.840 --> 25:16.960]  profiling a constituent of state senator Glenn growthman stopped into his
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.600]  Madison office last week and said he recently had knee surgery and by the way
[25:21.600 --> 25:25.200]  this is confirmed this has been going on for about five years and they by the way
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.040]  puts you in a health department computer they just tell the doctors and nurses to
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.440]  do this while getting the paperwork completed the doctor asked the man do
[25:32.440 --> 25:35.680]  you own a firearm do you keep it locked in a secure location the doctor would
[25:35.680 --> 25:39.480]  not continue the appointment or provide medical care till the patient supplied
[25:39.480 --> 25:42.720]  answers to the above questions see returning everybody into secret police
[25:42.720 --> 25:46.560]  and then acting like this is normal senator growlms office is wondering if
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.200]  this is an isolated incident or referring practice yes senator in case you
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.960]  don't know Aaron just gave me this during the break yes this goes on
[25:54.960 --> 26:00.640]  nationwide and the American Medical Association orders their doctors to do
[26:00.640 --> 26:06.920]  this I guess they might start ordering the doctors to mow their lawns or maybe
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.920]  give them massages or you know this is indentured servitude no one explain
[26:10.920 --> 26:18.920]  just how bad this is how widespread I've had three children in a year ago we're
[26:18.920 --> 26:24.160]  there at the North Austin Women's Medical Center because I like the doctor
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.800]  that's there she's a good doctor she's a fan of the show she's not bad I'm not
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.640]  saying she's bad it's the bureaucracy and I figured this out by the second
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.840]  child they have health department computers I really already knew about it
[26:37.840 --> 26:39.960]  but then you're there and it's happening to you and you don't really pay
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.640]  attention and the second child they said hey will you take this file downstairs
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.000]  for me and then the control freak nurse they're on a power trip they think
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.400]  they're like James Bond you know they've got all this power and they've got all
[26:51.400 --> 26:58.960]  this authority and they decide what to do and so you go downstairs and you
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.400]  deliver the file and you come back and then the nurse leaves my wife said that
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.680]  lady she was just asking me if we get along and am I rude to her and you know
[27:06.680 --> 27:10.080]  like oh girls talking with friends and hey do you have enough money and you
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.840]  know does he abuse you and then she was typing in the computer yeah it's up to
[27:14.840 --> 27:18.560]  the health department and so by the third go around I knew about this and the
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.080]  lady so we take this file down here for me and I said oh sure and winked at my
[27:24.080 --> 27:29.640]  wife as I walked out same deal and all over the country it's in the news these
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.120]  nurses are such wicked control freaks that when you refuse the vaccine a lot
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.560]  of times they'll secretly inject your children that's been in the news that's
[27:37.560 --> 27:42.760]  how evil government and now the nurses and the doctors and everybody else are
[27:42.760 --> 27:52.720]  the school teachers they're all a bunch of dirt bag spies and so everywhere you
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.920]  go you know in the case with lady who works in my office at the end of the
[27:58.920 --> 28:03.080]  year they have it three times a year they call the children into the lab
[28:03.080 --> 28:08.600]  computer lab and then one by one the counselor takes the eight-year-olds I
[28:08.600 --> 28:15.080]  don't know what grade is that third grade fourth grade they take them into a
[28:15.080 --> 28:19.080]  room and they ask how are you doing and then they said is your mommy rude to you
[28:19.080 --> 28:24.560]  to your parents argue tell me about it real friendly and fake and then oh does
[28:24.560 --> 28:30.880]  mommy spank you by the way spanking is not illegal hurting them is and then the
[28:30.880 --> 28:38.080]  little girl says no and don't lie to me tell me do they have well there's a
[28:38.080 --> 28:42.720]  little bruise on her leg little bruise I'm walking into a just a little bruise
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.440]  on the side of the thigh from walking into a table we've all had them and the
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.200]  next day yesterday they're police there and they pull her make her pull her
[28:49.200 --> 28:56.720]  pants off and take photographs we'll tell the rest of the story coming up in an
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.520]  hour the issue here is ladies and gentlemen that when you put your children
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.480]  in a public school they have quotas to inoculate them they get federal money
[29:06.480 --> 29:09.800]  for that so they lie to you and tell you it's the law when it's not because they
[29:09.800 --> 29:13.880]  get 99% inoculated they get big bonuses that's on record they get bonuses for
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.440]  season your kids but they want most of men's school until the end of the year
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.080]  then they go try to grab them and I talked to the CPS lady today and I said
[29:21.080 --> 29:24.000]  I bet the end of the year is busy time for you she said yeah it is I said yeah

[33:24.800 --> 33:32.840]  but caring about your fellow man opens up a wider universe but with it comes
[33:32.840 --> 33:37.600]  all the pain it is very alluring to just not care about people having their
[33:37.600 --> 33:41.760]  children stolen it's very easy to just care about yourself and revel in being
[33:41.760 --> 33:47.600]  selfish but you harden your heart you lose your soul you lose who you are you
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.880]  lose your humanity and the globalist their religion is about only caring
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.720]  about themselves their religion isn't not just not caring about the public but
[33:55.720 --> 34:02.040]  reveling in feeding on us playing with us like a mouse plays with a like a cat
[34:02.040 --> 34:10.840]  plays with a mouse before it kills it finally and I know the government is
[34:10.840 --> 34:19.800]  99% their own I know for every good thing they do they do 50 bad things I know the

[34:35.920 --> 34:44.960]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 with your CPS horror stories you know I have my
[34:44.960 --> 34:51.000]  lawyer who's a litigator and a corporate lawyer and he's trying to figure out the
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.600]  best most aggressive lawyer for us to get we've talked a couple lawyers last
[34:55.600 --> 35:00.840]  night we're talking to some more today and basically the advice I gave Janet
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.240]  Sanchez here in our office is what the lawyers have now told me was the best
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.600]  advice because I've probably interviewed oh over the years more than a hundred
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.280]  lawyers like we even already had one set up today dealing with CPS that was
[35:15.280 --> 35:22.840]  set up last week Rob do set this guest up last Friday dealing with the Minnesota
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.000]  case of a Native American where they're trying to put him on chemotherapy and
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.200]  last night I was doing research I was bound to that little girl last year we
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.280]  had on where they grabbed her when she didn't have a very bad cancer chemo
[35:37.280 --> 35:41.000]  therapy there now they're saying there's a 20% chance she's gonna live the
[35:41.000 --> 35:49.680]  parents have taken her back and the chemotherapy almost killed her it's
[35:49.680 --> 35:52.880]  the same thing with this little boy these aren't Christian scientists these
[35:52.880 --> 35:55.560]  are people that you know they tell you all the chemotherapy is gonna kill you
[35:55.560 --> 36:08.000]  but we're gonna do it I mean there's we already had somebody on dealing with
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.040]  CPS stuff set up today before this even happened in our office I mean I've
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.120]  interviewed hundreds of lawyers hundreds of different legal defense funds
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.600]  different organizations and grips and since yesterday when this happened and
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.840]  now I found a few of them at most of them were homeschool defense groups they're
[36:25.840 --> 36:29.200]  like well we just defend homeschoolers I'm talking to these secretaries going I
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.480]  know but I've had your director on I've had your this group on I've had that
[36:32.480 --> 36:35.880]  group on and they tell me well we just I'm like give me the lawyers names you
[36:35.880 --> 36:41.160]  know that deal with this exclusively I'll pay them right now and then Rob's not
[36:41.160 --> 36:44.560]  having much luck with that so we've called a bunch of Austin lawyers I'm
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.360]  talking to my lawyer during the breaks trying to work all this out I need

[37:31.640 --> 37:34.480]  done you agree with that yeah that's the right thing to do are you gonna be
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.120]  aggressive he's like well yeah it's good to not meet with him and not ask a lot
[37:38.120 --> 37:41.200]  and all don't let him get more evidence or fake evidence and escalate it so I
[37:41.200 --> 37:43.960]  got three lawyers we're dealing with right now and I'm trying to get my
[37:43.960 --> 37:49.160]  lawyer who's very high-powered runs a huge law firm very busy but and he's
[37:49.160 --> 37:52.520]  doesn't want to give me a bad advice so he's rummaging around for them for the
[37:52.520 --> 38:06.560]  best best family lawyer he's got and so a lot of times when callers calling and
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.600]  they say they've grabbed my children you know and I'll say I'll say nine times

[38:42.000 --> 38:46.880]  think about the millions of parents I can't help in the United States I think
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.760]  about the millions of people in the last few years alone most of them
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.440]  completely innocent and they weren't given due process even if they were
[38:53.440 --> 38:58.920]  guilty that's the issue who had their little babies torn away from them last
[38:58.920 --> 39:02.920]  Friday I had a state senator on Eagle form head of Georgia and she was
[39:02.920 --> 39:06.760]  listening names where they don't just have bounties to get kids and quotas

[39:11.640 --> 39:19.640]  girl they'll pay $400,000 for and they go to the school and they've got
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.520]  teachers and nurses they give kickbacks to legal anti-legal they've got judges

[39:31.800 --> 39:38.440]  committing the crime I just wish God would strike every one of them down

[44:02.800 --> 44:21.000]  Jefferson I swear on the altar that should get it trying to find it here yes
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.680]  here it is I swear upon the altar of God eternal
[44:26.680 --> 44:31.720]  hostility every form of tyranny over the mind of men and it's mental it's
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.920]  spiritual it's in the mind it's a spell it's a program it's a cow wing it's
[44:36.920 --> 44:44.960]  teaching us to lay down and take it no I'm gonna stand up I'm not gonna cower I
[44:44.960 --> 44:51.680]  swear upon the altar of God eternal hostility every form of tyranny over the
[44:51.680 --> 44:59.560]  mind of men I swear upon the altar of God eternal hostility every form of
[44:59.560 --> 45:11.800]  tyranny over the mind of men there's another Jefferson quote my god how
[45:11.800 --> 45:16.000]  little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are in possession
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.800]  of and which no other people on earth and joy absolutely let me tell you what
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.600]  I value there are people that will kill to be a movie star or kill to be liked
[45:27.600 --> 45:33.840]  in their church or kill for some type of petty peacock worship and I look at
[45:33.840 --> 45:40.520]  movie stars on the red carpet and how they preen and suck it in and get off on
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.200]  it I'm almost ashamed when I march up in front of a crowd of a thousand people
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.920]  to give a speech at that little part of me that enjoys it and I always shift
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.080]  back into defense of humanity and then get up there to give the speech I don't
[45:54.080 --> 45:57.200]  want to give the speech and then I know the few movie stars I do know that are
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.560]  really classy they can't stand the spotlight we've had those discussions
[46:02.560 --> 46:08.200]  but I do want the spotlight so that I can have my name at the top of the list
[46:08.200 --> 46:13.240]  like John Hancock to declare to this scum that I will never submit to their
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.240]  tyranny and I'll never submit to their mind tricks it's like they told the
[46:17.240 --> 46:20.240]  Leningradian reporter when he was at the police station and saw the guys that
[46:20.240 --> 46:23.040]  have been following him and harassing him and then the cops were denying it
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.040]  and he said there they are right there in the head police chief the state police
[46:26.040 --> 46:30.160]  guys said no you don't see them there they play that now there's no North
[46:30.160 --> 46:33.560]  American Union there's no European Union they play those mind games well your
[46:33.560 --> 46:37.400]  spell is broken on me and I'm not even gonna argue with you we know you're a
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.080]  bunch of sicko scum your pirates your mercenaries your pedophiles you all got
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.280]  your evil you're into and you've given yourselves completely over to it now
[46:48.280 --> 46:51.600]  some of you haven't and if you got the hair stand up on the back of your neck
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.240]  right now you got tears in the corners of your eyes and you feel something that's
[46:55.240 --> 46:59.840]  painful but also good at the same time that's your soul go walk in out the door
[46:59.840 --> 47:09.000]  that you got one second to reach over and grab but you're being touched right
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.320]  now by truth and love and honor and if you turn your back on it that's the
[47:13.320 --> 47:20.080]  ultimate sin don't turn your back on this opportunity to be like solid tarsus
[47:20.080 --> 47:25.120]  and to be hit by that spirit of goodness and honor and to be knocked off your
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.920]  horse and to stand up as a new man and woman I don't want you to fall to the
[47:29.920 --> 47:33.600]  designs of the new world order I don't want you people to serve evil I want you
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.720]  to stop making excuses about what you're part of
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.160]  and then I look at those that have joined evil and hardened their hearts
[47:48.160 --> 47:52.680]  they're not even human anymore folks they are habitations of wickedness they
[47:52.680 --> 48:02.480]  are vessels and gates windows into hell and to them I pledge eternal complete
[48:02.480 --> 48:09.120]  resistance to them dump your fear today stop caring what your neighbors think
[48:09.120 --> 48:15.120]  stop approaching people from a cowardly apologetic position we are champions we
[48:15.120 --> 48:22.240]  are leaders we were forged in our mother's wombs for our destiny to be
[48:22.240 --> 48:30.440]  builders and creators and lovers of honor and goodness and innocence not
[48:30.440 --> 48:39.640]  lovers of death now I know we've got a lot of callers in this I just want you
[48:39.640 --> 48:43.680]  to know that I had a stack of news yesterday in fact I gave it to who's
[48:43.680 --> 48:46.880]  asking to dig through it did you find those articles about seven-year-olds

[48:52.040 --> 48:55.280]  looking the stack referral in America to find out some other articles every day

[48:58.760 --> 49:01.680]  environmental core in the U.S. and England and Canada Australia they all the
[49:01.680 --> 49:04.760]  same thing and they tell us oh we're gonna help the environment and then by
[49:04.760 --> 49:06.960]  the way we're going to look in your neighbor's trash and make sure they're
[49:06.960 --> 49:09.920]  recycling right and even if it's not along your ego knock on their door and
[49:09.920 --> 49:13.960]  tell them that sets the precedent of the boldness to go knock on somebody's
[49:13.960 --> 49:18.560]  door children and told them what to do until your parents want to do and then
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.360]  now as I told you they've launched us about three years ago the climate cops

[55:01.720 --> 55:04.720]  and then later I'm going to break down their big master plan, how they overall operate,
[55:04.720 --> 55:10.720]  and we're going to have in studio Janet Sanchez.
[55:10.720 --> 55:16.720]  It's just absolutely amazing, wait till you hear this story, and the point is this is going on all over the country,
[55:16.720 --> 55:26.720]  there's what, 16 people in this office, Kurt Nemo in New Mexico, Paul and Steve Watson in England,
[55:26.720 --> 55:31.720]  so out of 16 people in my office, then suddenly half of the people that have kids in this office
[55:31.720 --> 55:37.720]  were going, oh yeah, my son had bruises on his shins from shocker, everybody has bruises all over them when they're a kid,
[55:37.720 --> 55:44.720]  and the CPS tried to take his kids, his sons, then they called him into this public school
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.720]  and said that because Mike used to smoke cigarettes, that that was drug use,
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.720]  and they wanted him to drug test, and Mike even did it years ago, and didn't have drugs in his system,
[55:53.720 --> 55:56.720]  but they said smoking cigarettes was the evidence of his drug use.
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.720]  I mean, it just turns out everybody in the office has been hit by these people.
[56:00.720 --> 56:07.720]  It's just everywhere, it's filth, when the government is the most abusive of children anywhere,
[56:07.720 --> 56:11.720]  who has oversight over them, I play all these CPS newscasts where all these kids die,
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.720]  and they're custody, and they just get on the news and say so what, children will die, remember that clip?
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.720]  In fact, YouTube that, CPS says children will die, and I want them to hear this son of a, oh excuse me,

[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:22.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:39.720]  Out there with the family, they're in the break.
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:43.720]  We're going after the child kidnapping rings.
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:47.720]  We are not submitting to the evil sheriff and his henchmen anymore.
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:51.720]  We're not going along with the corruption in this town we call the United States
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:53.720]  run by these parasite globalists.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:55.720]  All right, for the stations that just joined us,
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.720]  I got a lot of news coming up in the last hour today.
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:00:59.720]  Well, I've opened phones throughout the broadcast,
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:03.720]  but the CPS is trying to kidnap one of my employees' daughters
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:05.720]  on record strip search through everything.
[1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:07.720]  She's six, eight years old.
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:09.720]  It's an unbelievable story.
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:12.720]  That's all coming up with them in studio in 30 minutes.
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  Right now, Janet and P.A., we're getting your horror stories from these people.
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.720]  Janet, go ahead.
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:20.720]  Hello.
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:21.720]  Hi, Janet.
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:22.720]  Hi.
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.720]  How are you doing?
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:28.720]  I hear you on the anchor here five years ago.
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:33.720]  My marriage was in abuse of the situation and verbally,
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:35.720]  and I held out as long as I could,
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:39.720]  finally divorced and left Florida and come back to my hometown.
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:42.720]  My children were giving me a hard time
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:46.720]  and their father was in a bad accident and he got killed.
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:50.720]  Well, my oldest one rebelled and she was dating this boy,
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:53.720]  and I didn't like this situation because she was only 15
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.720]  while she ended up getting pregnant.
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.720]  And I didn't like the situation while I had put her in counseling
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  in school thinking it was going to help her and it didn't.
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:06.720]  Next, they put her on drugs and they tried to put her on mental.
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  No, they didn't do none of that.
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:11.720]  They just take them, whatever my child said,
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:15.720]  they were believing her and they never came to talk to me.
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:19.720]  And I had taken her to, I had called the family pediatrician
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:22.720]  to ask if I could have a pregnancy test done on her,
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:27.720]  and they said I couldn't have it done unless I had her permission.
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:28.720]  Okay?
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:29.720]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:32.720]  They also let kids as young as 10 have abortions without the parents.
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:33.720]  Yes.
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:36.720]  This is how sick the system is because they want to be eugenicists.
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.720]  It influences your 10-year-old to have an abortion.
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:43.720]  The state basically has usurped more authority than parents now.
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:47.720]  But the whole thing is, is because she wasn't getting her own way
[1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:51.720]  and it took me, I mean, everybody in the town knew,
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:54.720]  she was telling everybody, I didn't know.
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:56.720]  I had to take her to my brother's.
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  Yeah, a lot of times they advertise,
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.720]  they call your little kids and everybody listening
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  when it goes to public school and most big privates now,
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:04.720]  they call them in and have ways to trick them
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:06.720]  and make them, you know, get them to tell stories,
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:08.720]  to break up your family.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:11.720]  And it's all because these local counties and cities
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:14.720]  get money from the feds to do this.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:19.720]  And so finally my brother broke it where he got her to say the truth
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:21.720]  and I found out then she was pregnant.
[1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:23.720]  Well, because she wasn't getting her own way
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  because I wanted to separate them because I didn't like the idea
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.720]  because of her age.
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:33.720]  Well, me went in and lied and said that I tried to abort her baby,
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:35.720]  which I would never do that.
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:39.720]  And because of her false accusations would come out later
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:42.720]  that I didn't do that, she said she lied.
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:45.720]  Yeah, this is the government getting involved in the family.
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  So how did this nightmare end?
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.720]  Well, both of my children ended up gone.
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:52.720]  And to this day I have been over backwards,
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:55.720]  which I thought that does not work, you know.
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.720]  Where did they end up gone to?
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  The state took them?
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:03:59.720]  The state took them.
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:01.720]  My youngest one still in foster care,
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.720]  she wishes not to come home,
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.720]  but I know that they play those mind games with them.
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:09.720]  Well, we can give you money to send you college.
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:11.720]  We can give you money for color.
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.720]  No, no, they're experts, psych warfare experts.
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:15.720]  They even have some psychological terms for that
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  because then they blame you for what happened.
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:22.720]  They're blaming me because I left my kids in an abusive situation.
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:24.720]  They're using, even after he's dead,
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.720]  because of what the kids said, they used that against me.
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:31.720]  They're experts. Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:33.720]  Yeah, the facts are here.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  They're in the family.
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  They're breaking down the society.
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  In fact, I do have the news article now
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  where they are hiring seven-year-olds
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:45.720]  to tattle on people in the neighborhood.
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:49.720]  So we'll cover that when we get back and go to your phone calls.
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:50.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.720]  This is the one, the only GCN radio network.
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:56.720]  We're going to have this family in studio coming up
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:59.720]  in about 25 minutes, infowars.com and prismblinded.com
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:00.720]  are the websites.
[1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:05.720]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.720]  and today that's more important than ever.
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:10.720]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:13.720]  You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread.
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:15.720]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:17.720]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:19.720]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:22.720]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.720]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:29.720]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:32.720]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:37.720]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:41.720]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.720]  freeze-gride and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:50.720]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:55.720]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:56.720]  Take action today.
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:59.720]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:07.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:11.720]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order
[1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:13.720]  that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:16.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:19.720]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:21.720]  While Obama's already fudging.
[1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:23.720]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:28.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:32.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:35.720]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:38.720]  It's not about left to right.
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:43.720]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:47.720]  the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:51.720]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com
[1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:55.720]  or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:57.720]  The Obama deception.
[1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:59.720]  The people strike back.
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:07.720]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:12.720]  that even when you do a great job for someone
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:15.720]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  there is no job security.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:18.720]  You are always in danger of losing your job,
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.720]  unless you take charge of your livelihood
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:22.720]  and own your own business.
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:25.720]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:28.720]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years,
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:31.720]  and he is passionate about turning other people on
[1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:34.720]  to the joys and benefits of working for themselves
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:35.720]  and not for others.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.720]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.720]  that can help people lose weight
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:46.720]  and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.720]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com
[1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:50.720]  and check out the opportunity.
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:53.720]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:55.720]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested,
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  MZ wants to talk to you.
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:22.720]  Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:24.720]  You know that feeling where you just know
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:27.720]  you can take on 20 men and win.
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:30.720]  That's a righteous feeling to defend innocence.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  That's the feeling I got right now.
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:35.720]  I feel like I can start spinning like a Tasmanian devil
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:39.720]  right into a armored column of enemy New World Order operatives.
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:41.720]  I'm sick of your crap, and we're going to get you.
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.720]  Do you understand?
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  The spirit of liberty will just start rising.
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:49.720]  We can clear out this trash very quickly,
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:52.720]  but people have got to get the guts going.
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.720]  They got to get the attitude.
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  Sick of it.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:58.720]  Remember your calls here in just a moment,
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:01.720]  and we've got from one of the big legal defense funds,
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.720]  one of the best lawyers in Texas,
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:05.720]  and I'm getting other lawyers,
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:07.720]  and I want the people to know that did this.
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:09.720]  We're not just going to defend this little girl.
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:11.720]  We're going to come after you for what you did
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:16.720]  and wait till we cover what you did coming up.
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:19.720]  Because you've been involved in official oppression,
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:22.720]  and you've got the court cases to do it.
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.720]  I don't just make this stuff up.
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:27.720]  We filed in federal court on YouTube
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.720]  and demanded it go to trial,
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:31.720]  and they dropped it and reinstated the channel.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:34.720]  And I wrote the briefing myself.
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.720]  Well, they're in dykes,
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:38.720]  and I'm not saying we've got, you know, we're great.
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:41.720]  I'm saying we take action.
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.720]  We fight back.
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.720]  Does it mean we win every time? No.
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:47.720]  You just know this. You mess with us.
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  You get a response back,
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.720]  and that is the answer to all of this.
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:53.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776,
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:55.720]  and what is 1984?
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:57.720]  It's cowed, cowardly people surveilled,
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:59.720]  controlled, giving in to tyranny,
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.720]  lying down, working against each other,
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.720]  divided and conquered.
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  What is 1776?
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.720]  Fired up, caution to the wind.
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:10.720]  You want a war, you're going to get one.
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:12.720]  We're done playing games.
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.720]  That's the spirit of 1776,
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.720]  and that's my spirit.
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:18.720]  I will not be part of your 1984.
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  You know what I'm wearing today?
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  I'm wearing live, free, or die,
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  and I got a minute men on my chest.
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  And that's the spirit I want.
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.720]  That's what I call into me.
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  That's what I am.
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.720]  I declare it.
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:34.720]  I am born again
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.720]  against tyranny.
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:38.720]  Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:40.720]  there is liberty.
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:42.720]  I want freedom.
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.720]  That's what I want.
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:46.720]  And I know tyranny when I see it.
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:48.720]  And no slack-jawed
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  government propagandists can confuse me
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  by telling me tyranny's good.
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:54.720]  You give me a big old goblet full of cyanide,
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:56.720]  and you tell me it's grape juice.
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  I know cyanide.
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  How about you drink it?
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  New order says our lives don't matter,
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:04.720]  but then their lives matter so much.
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:06.720]  You don't like the overpopulation,
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  according to you?
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  How about all you new order people, kill yourselves?
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:12.720]  All you abortion pushers
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:14.720]  trying to make all the inner city people
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:16.720]  got your little hired
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:18.720]  community leaders, minority leaders
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:20.720]  trying to kill their kids.
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:22.720]  How about you kill yourself?
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.720]  You want us to die
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:26.720]  and stop living?
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.720]  You don't like our life force?
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.720]  You don't like our love of life?
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.720]  You love death? Then kill yourselves!
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:34.720]  Do it!
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  You like death so much?
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  Go home and kill yourselves!
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:40.720]  Don't call for the death of little babies.
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  Kill yourselves!
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:44.720]  You abortionists? Kill yourselves!
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.720]  You don't like it? I got red blood?
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.720]  You don't like I got fury?
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.720]  You don't like it? I'm not gilded?
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:54.720]  You tell me to leave this country?
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  No, you leave this country!
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  You leave this country! You kill yourselves!
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:00.720]  You get out of my way!
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:04.720]  They tell us, kill ourselves.
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.720]  They have these human extinction societies
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:08.720]  and these
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:10.720]  suicidal nihilist groups
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:12.720]  with huge UN funding
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  and all these organizations out there.
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.720]  You know what? You like death so much?
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:20.720]  No, you don't like death.
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:22.720]  You like us dying. You like controlling us.
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:24.720]  Well, listen to me, you bastards.
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.720]  It didn't open season anymore.
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:28.720]  It's all a spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  I never understood this until a few years ago
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:32.720]  and more and more understand it.
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:34.720]  It's an attitude. It's a mindset.
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:36.720]  It's a spirit.
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  There were people in limp riskedness
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.720]  and weakness in this country.
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.720]  The men all puff up and strut around
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:44.720]  like they're tough but they don't have
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  any of the deeds to match it.
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:50.720]  Strength is doing what's unpopular
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:52.720]  in the eye of the establishment.
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.720]  Strength
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.720]  is not being a coward.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.720]  Strength is going against the herd.
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:00.720]  Strength isn't
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  riding a Harley- which is around with
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.720]  devil tattoos all over you
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:12.640]  Just bugging your eyes out at people at red lights.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:15.940]  Those big tough guys, every time you're slamming their head in the pavement and they start
[1:13:15.940 --> 1:13:20.220]  crying, aren't so tough anymore.
[1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:24.340]  All you tough macho cops that like pushing people around, if you're doing, you're pushing
[1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:29.600]  people around and you're bullying people, you're on the side of evil and you're weak.
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:40.240]  At the bottom of who you are, you're weak.
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:44.120]  That's not a radical statement.
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:51.000]  If you want us to die and humans are so bad, kill yourself.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.320]  They want us to die, they want us to give up our will to live, they want to teach us
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:55.320]  humans are bad.
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:14:01.560]  I get these articles every day and I go on to your calls and I don't even cover them.
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:06.160]  I got DJ, Tennessee former CPS worker, we'll talk to him in a minute, town halls hire citizen
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:14.160]  snoopers as young as seven to spy on neighbors and report wrongs.
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:15.160]  You know, who's in there?
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.720]  Googled this earlier when I couldn't find it in my stack from yesterday that I didn't
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:23.240]  get to and hundreds of articles just the last couple months came up under the similar search
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:28.480]  and they spy on their neighbors, their parents, they look in people's trash bins, seven-year-olds
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:30.880]  are seven-year-olds running around spying on people.
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:34.960]  Is that freedom or is that 1984?
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.080]  Is it 1776?
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:40.680]  Is that a spirit of 1776 or is that a spirit of 1984?
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:52.200]  I ask you now, I ask you, is that tyranny?
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:57.280]  You know, I don't try to sit here and sound like some kind of boar growling.
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:58.280]  That's who I am.
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:14:59.680]  That's what comes out of my soul.
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:05.160]  I could grind my teeth into bloody stumps right now.
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:08.760]  I've got so much hatred boiling in me for tyranny.
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:11.520]  You understand that?
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:14.440]  I'm always looking and probing for the way to defeat the enemy.
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:19.720]  I'm always tracking and scanning and thinking how to mobilize, how to energize, how to defeat
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:24.240]  them, how to stop them, how to get them off the backs of the innocent and the little ones.
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:25.600]  Does it mean I have all the answers?
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:27.560]  No, I'm asking you what the answers are.
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:32.920]  I just know I'm always there, always there trying to find cracks in the enemy and I found
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:33.920]  plenty of them.
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:39.240]  I found out the enemy is as soft as a rotten old barn and it's time to tear the doors off
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.120]  and tear the son of a bitch down.
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:46.600]  Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:50.680]  John Hall's higher citizen snoopers as young as 7, these under federal grants, to spy on
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:51.680]  neighbors and report wrongs.
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:52.680]  This is out of England.
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:53.680]  It's going on in the U.S. too.
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:56.880]  Children as young as 7 are being recruited by councils to act as citizen snoopers.
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:59.680]  The Daily Mail can reveal the environment.
[1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:05.520]  Volunteers will report on their litter louts, noisy neighbors, and even families putting
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.240]  a rubbish out on the wrong day.
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:10.760]  There are currently almost 9,000 people signed up for the schemes.
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.040]  More likely to be recruited in the coming months.
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:16.960]  Controversially, some councils are running junior schemes which are recruiting children.
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:19.880]  And then it goes on to say, after basic training, volunteers are expected to be the eyes and
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:24.480]  ears of the town and to fight terrorism and everything else when it goes on.
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:31.560]  In one town in Luttenborough Council Street, they have 650 volunteers to report environmental
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:32.560]  concerns.
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:35.440]  It also is recruiting junior street champions.
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:39.400]  My God, they called them, I think, the champions in 1984, didn't they?
[1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:40.720]  The junior spy champion?
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:43.000]  My God, they're even using 1984 terms.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.200]  We've reached red level.
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:49.240]  They're actually following the book now, 1984 in freedom.
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:52.920]  I've seen them rebranding Big Brother, like Big Brother Helping, Big Brother, that Google
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:54.080]  that term, Big Brother Helping.
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:58.160]  Now, they're, oh, Big Brother, oh, yay, they'll probably put up Big Brother signs soon.
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.440]  They already put up All Seeing Eye posters saying, we're watching you in England in the
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:03.440]  U.S.
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:04.960]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:10.440]  DJ, Tennessee former CPS worker, then we're going to go to Janet, Leo, Justin, Bob, others.
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:11.440]  Go ahead, DJ.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.640]  Hi, Alex, I just, first of all, I want to thank you so much for giving a voice to all
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:20.520]  these children and even these oppressed parents that don't have a voice.
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:25.120]  I thank you from the bottom of my heart because I've worked for CPS and I know what they do
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  and I'm not as help.
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.040]  Well, I want to be clear.
[1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:33.880]  There's a lot of different divisions of social work, as you know, but the audience may not.
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:39.080]  That's why CPS has a 50% turnover, the highest of any government job, because most people
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:42.800]  aren't bad to get into it and then it ends up only the scum is in there.
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:43.800]  Absolutely.
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:44.800]  Absolutely.
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:49.680]  But there were a handful of workers that actually remained as far as I know.
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:53.520]  Maybe they've been there 10 years and they were like, it was a snake pit going to work
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:59.560]  every day with them and everyone else that went there, they would leave within six months
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:03.520]  because they would see what was going on and at first think they could try to change the
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:08.360]  system from within and found out that they were pretty much powerless or they were knocked
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:09.480]  out.
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:14.480]  I was pretty much, you know, scapegoat out of there, so I tried my best.
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:19.600]  What do you think this CPS is going to do when I give the Hays County CPS phone numbers
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:24.280]  and the county commissioner's court numbers out and they get 5,000 phone calls?
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:27.800]  Oh, I'm sure they're going to have a circus.
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:28.800]  I don't know.
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:29.800]  I don't know.
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:32.120]  They'll figure out a way to lie through it.
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:35.600]  You know, I mean, we've had citizens call.
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.600]  I've tried to put editorials in the paper.
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:40.960]  I've tried to spread the word about what's going on right here in our region.
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:43.920]  Why did you get out of it?
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:45.440]  Just too many of the things.
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.200]  Everything that you've pretty much summed up about CPS, you know, over the years that
[1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:55.800]  I've been listening to you, I've observed firsthand and believe me, it's true.
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:01.720]  And I just couldn't take any more seeing parents lose their children for no valid reason.
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:08.360]  I mean, the day and then so many of these children for no reason, one woman, for instance,
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:12.280]  she lost her kids because she was in the middle as she had been through a fire.
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:15.280]  She didn't have the resources to buy new furniture.
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:22.720]  So two of her children, beautiful blonde hair, blue-eyed little girls sleeping on bed mats.
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:26.480]  And a neighbor came in and saw that they were sleeping on these little, you know, like those
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:29.600]  exercise mats and called CPS on them.
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:33.200]  Are they in Saudi Arabia right now in a harem?
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:35.040]  Exactly, yeah.
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:36.040]  Exactly.
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:39.680]  I mean, they, you know, they had clothing, they had food, they had shelter, they were
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:42.880]  sleeping on bed mats, they were taken.
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:50.680]  And I was told to testify in court that she was not a fit mother and subsequently she
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:51.680]  lost her children.
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:52.680]  You know why?
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:53.680]  Because the adoption agency got 400 grand a piece for them.
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:54.680]  Stay there, ma'am.
[1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:56.560]  I'm going to talk to you more on the other side.
[1:19:56.560 --> 1:19:57.560]  Yeah.
[1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:00.840]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:03.720]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:05.240]  Is it safe, secure and healthy?
[1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:10.120]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.920]  We at Baker Creek Air Loom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for
[1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:19.120]  12 years and carry over 1200 varieties of GMO free heirloom seed.

[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:30.040]  Baker Creek Air Loom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:33.680]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:37.520]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strive every year to
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:40.480]  bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:44.720]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:49.200]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:52.840]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.

[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:01.080]  That's rareseeds.com.
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:07.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:13.080]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:14.480]  just as well-funded.
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:19.600]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:21.080]  of the American people.
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:25.240]  Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:30.600]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:37.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:47.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:01.880]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.720]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.360]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:10.240]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:11.240]  drinking water.
[1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:14.440]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:12.240]  We're going to go live at PrismPlanet.tv in T-minus eight minutes, and we'll start the
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  next segment.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:23.440]  We're going to get to Leo, Stephen, Bob, and others, but going back to DJ, Tennessee,
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:30.320]  former CPS worker, you know, Mike Nelson and Derek Einkauf, who work in this office, couldn't
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.280]  do paramedic stuff anymore.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:38.160]  And one of them worked in Hayes County and used to go, that was part of it, when they'd
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:41.720]  pull an ambulance up and they would send CPS in to grab somebody's kids at night when
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:45.080]  they would try to catch them at 2 a.m. to fluster them when they'd have them sign orders
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:48.600]  to wave their kids' rights and take them.
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.840]  But Mike told stories about going to a call with drug addicts with a big pile of coke
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:56.560]  handle at the table and a two-year-old had eaten it and died, and that was when he finally
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:00.640]  quit, couldn't do it anymore.
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:03.880]  And you know, parents that would stick their kids in boiling hot water.
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:08.120]  They're psycho-criminal parents, and they use that on the news and say, oh, God, you
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:12.080]  know, we've got to have all these CPS workers then out spying and having secret police.
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:17.320]  But then you have all these foster care houses and these big facilities where they're five
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:21.480]  times more likely, that's the Justice Department's own numbers, to abuse children, and so there's
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:29.160]  no oversight, pedophiles get into this job position, and people just want money, and
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  it's a race to the bottom.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:33.160]  There's no due process, so there's tyranny.
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:36.560]  I mean, if somebody's beaten their kid with a tire iron, that's assault the deadly weapon.
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:38.440]  They go to prison.
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:40.640]  We got the laws.
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:45.560]  So the evils are much greater always in the name of government good, and that's what we
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:46.560]  found.
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:49.240]  So I'm not saying there aren't terrible parents out there, and society's degenerating.
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:52.280]  You know, I mean, my dad's a physician.
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:56.040]  He's seen plenty of horrible stuff, parents do.
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:59.400]  Plenty of kids coming in with the parents have knocked their teeth out.
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:05.600]  But the issue is, it needs to be done to the criminal justice system, not in these phony
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:09.600]  family court systems set up in the 20s for eugenics.
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.560]  Anything else you can add, DJ, to what we're dealing with?
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:16.200]  Well, to what you just said, you're absolutely correct.
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.920]  There are parents out there that do horrible things to their children, and I'd say out
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:25.600]  of the thousands of cases that I saw, there are probably only, I don't know, five percent
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.080]  of them were valid where children should have been taken out of their homes.
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:33.640]  And I must add to that, many times, they're taken out of their homes, and they're put
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:38.800]  into abusive foster care systems, or with relatives who created the abuse problem in
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:39.800]  the first place.
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  I've seen children go from one abusive family member to another, and there is no oversight.
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:50.040]  I worked for the foster care division for a small short period of time, and was amazed
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:53.200]  by the homes that they were putting them into, and they weren't checking.
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:59.040]  Like I said, I was a carpet cleaner for one summer, and I guess with five or six, I forget
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:03.920]  CPS, you know, the foster homes, and these were mills.
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:07.720]  These children were kept in slave positions just to get the money.
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:08.720]  Absolutely.
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:13.680]  Yeah, I've seen kids pretty much kept in little fenced-in bedrooms, and they were made
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:18.560]  to stay there all day, without going out to play, without having any social interaction.
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:20.520]  That's exactly what I saw.
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:21.520]  It's like a recipe.
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:22.520]  This is how they do it.
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:23.520]  It's amazing.
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:28.760]  It's amazing, and like you said, the court system is just as corrupt.
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.920]  The parents aren't given a voice.
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:36.320]  If they're even given a lawyer, it's somebody who doesn't even speak up in court, and they
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:37.720]  make it impossible.
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.040]  The process to regain custody once your children are in foster care is nearly impossible to
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:44.040]  overcome.
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:47.440]  And that's why all the lawyers that I talked to now said we did the right thing, saying
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:51.160]  avoid them, stay away from them, because they're telling her, wait till you hear the story.
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:52.160]  It's coming up.
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.720]  This was unbelievably sneaky, unbelievably evil, and I said, when she was pulling up
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:00.120]  her house, actually, I told them, don't go to the house, go to the gas station, just
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:07.400]  to see if they're with a cop, and sure enough, they were there with the cops, and just unbelievable.
[1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:15.160]  And literally, this is a tiny scar, a bruise, the size of a quarter on her thigh from walking
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:19.400]  into a table, and then she's got little bruises, tiny ones on her knees from gymnastics.
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:22.120]  My kids are covered with bruises from playing outside.
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  Who isn't?
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:28.720]  When I was a kid, I had cuts and scratches, but now they take your kids, and to hear how
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.920]  they mill them in at this beauty elementary, they brought every kid in and said, mommy's
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:34.920]  rude to you, huh?
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:35.920]  Tell me about your mommy.
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:43.200]  I mean, these people are just, oh God, I just, I don't even want to say what I think of them.
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:47.040]  Did they do that in Tennessee where you were at a couple of times during the year, bring
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:49.800]  all the kids through the counselor as a spy?
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:50.800]  Absolutely.
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:51.800]  Absolutely.
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:58.280]  And we've got more references, referrals from counselors who are untrained in questioning
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:28:59.280]  a child about abuse.
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:04.200]  I mean, they use leading questions, and children just don't respond to that sort of thing correctly
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:07.800]  if they say it, because mommy hits you, they're going to say yes, and then they go from there
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:13.120]  instead of asking in a more appropriate manner, and so it goes from there.
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:19.740]  Well I talked to this little girl for two hours yesterday to get the truth, and acting
[1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:23.560]  like I wanted her to say it, and then basically the cops came and said, you're going to get
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:26.440]  in trouble if you don't say she did it.
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:27.440]  Wow.
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:28.440]  Unbelievable.
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:30.920]  Oh yeah, they had to get a guy in a uniform, and then they took pictures of her and put
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:32.320]  it in a laptop.
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:34.800]  They made her take her pants off, she said, I don't want to, and they said, you're going
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.480]  to get in trouble if you don't.
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:39.560]  So they forced her to do it because they didn't want to be the ones pulling her pants off.
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.440]  But it's the same thing with a child.
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:43.120]  That's what sexual abuse, you know?
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:44.120]  It's a child.
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:46.720]  You tell the child to do it, and they do it, you still don't get off.
[1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:47.720]  Stay right there.
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:55.280]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:08.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:08.040 --> 1:31:12.520]  You've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:13.840]  us would like to see.
[1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:19.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:20.400]  of the American people.
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:24.760]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:29.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:37.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:41.520]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:48.440]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:10.280]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:15.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are

[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:48.840]  I am Alex Jones.
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:53.640]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:33:53.640 --> 1:34:01.840]  And I am going to go over what happened to Janet Sanchez.
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:08.800]  And we've got her fiance here with us, Joe Flores, and her eight-year-old daughter Haley
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:16.640]  is out there in the office with some of the other ladies that work here at the office.
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:18.080]  Now this affects everybody.
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:23.800]  This affects everybody out there watching, everybody out there listening.
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:25.280]  And I'm sure most of you already know this.
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:29.960]  Most of you already understand this because just here in the office yesterday when I got
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:36.320]  off air and found out this was going on and Janet was crying, everybody around the office
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:41.240]  including Mike was going, yeah, when my boy was eight, he's 11 now, he had a bruise on
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.040]  his chin and they saw it in PE and called me in and my son told him I didn't do it,
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:46.040]  that it was from soccer.
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.320]  I mean, you ought to see my kids from playing soccer.
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:50.920]  After soccer practice, they just bruises all over their legs.
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:51.920]  That's what happens.
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:57.000]  But they tried to take them and then they tried to say that they said, does your dad smoke
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.160]  and they called smoking cigarettes a drug and they threatened him they'd take his kids
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:01.160]  if he didn't drug test.
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:02.560]  He didn't have any drugs in the system.
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:06.480]  This is how crazy the secret police stuff is and you have due process.
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:07.480]  You're not a slave.
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:13.040]  They set up the family courts under the eugenics courts to sterilize 400,000 plus Americans
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:15.040]  in the 20s through the 80s.
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:18.800]  That's where these special courts came from, where they don't follow the Bill of Rights,
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:19.800]  the Constitution.
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:20.800]  They lie.
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:21.800]  They do all the rest of this.
[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:27.960]  I wanted to go back and have before I tell the story briefly and then talk to Janet and
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:29.960]  Joe here about what's happening.
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:36.400]  I wanted to have the caller is a former CPS worker who couldn't stand it and got out of
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:37.400]  it.
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:38.400]  DJ and Tennessee on them.
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:41.760]  We'll also take other calls coming up from others that are patiently holding to tell their
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:42.760]  stories.
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:48.120]  DJ, anything else as a CPS worker about the incredible crimes you witnessed?
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:53.320]  I would have to say, keep your kids out of the emergency room at all costs.
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:58.640]  That's one, like you said, if school observes a bruise, if the ear, I brought my children
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:03.040]  to the emergency room and they treat you like a criminal if it's any kind of injury, like
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:04.040]  a broken arm.
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:10.160]  Listen, one time I was at the pool when I was about 12 at the neighborhood pool and
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:13.760]  my shoulder got hurt, chicken fighting when you get on somebody's shoulders, and my dad's
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:16.720]  an oral surgeon, a dentist, and so he knows the medical system.
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:21.960]  He's worked in the hospital and I got home and he kind of got real concerned.
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.640]  He said, listen, they're going to ask you if I did this, you got to tell him I didn't.
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:29.760]  And he was scared when we went into the, I mean, that's my dad, and this isn't freedom
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:32.080]  where you're guilty until proven innocent.
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:33.200]  Kids get bruises.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:36.240]  I know a lot of kids that have been taken, even though there's witnesses, they fall off
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:39.920]  the park jungle gym, break their arm, they're gone, especially if they're blonde haired
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:40.920]  blue eyed.
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:42.080]  That's the big bonuses.
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.200]  As you mentioned, did you not as a CPS worker see that they really got hungry for those because
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:49.600]  the adoption agencies can get up to a half million bucks?
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:53.720]  You know, it wasn't until years later that that occurred to me, but I did notice that
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:59.320]  most of the time it seemed like parents with small, small children, I'm talking infants,
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:02.480]  had a more difficult time getting their parental rights back.
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:05.400]  Yeah, they don't want the older kids.
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:06.560]  They don't want the older kids.
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.000]  They want little kids.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.440]  They want the more the babies, you know, more people, they're more adoptable.
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.720]  And also minorities seem to get out of the system faster, oddly enough, because a lot
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:22.280]  of the minorities had, you know, less as far as resources to be able to follow.
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:26.000]  Let's face it, there are rich white families that want white kids and they don't care where
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:27.240]  they come from.
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:31.560]  And so they put the orders out and that's why it goes in order of the most desirable.
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:34.760]  It goes white, Hispanic, Asian, and then black.
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:37.000]  And that's who they're out mainly trying to kidnap.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.840]  That's sadly, that's what I've seen.
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:43.440]  I mean, that's my observation and it's, it's disgusting.
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.840]  You know, these rich white yuppies should really check where these kids are coming from.
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:48.840]  It's despicable.
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:49.840]  It's absolutely.
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:53.600]  Well, they'll pay thousands of dollars for a baby, so I don't think they're going to
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:55.680]  check too hard where those children came from.
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:56.680]  A lot of these people.
[1:37:56.680 --> 1:38:00.080]  Well, what about quotas, because it's now come out, there's federal bounties, they've
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:03.640]  got to, they get bonuses for the more kids they grab.
[1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:07.560]  I never observed, at least I was never told about having quotas.
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:15.200]  I mean, we had to make so many phone calls or take so many phone calls every week from
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:16.200]  reports.
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.320]  I mean, if you want to call that a quota, but I was unaware at that point.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:24.160]  I mean, this was back in 98 through 2000.
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:25.160]  Oh yeah.
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:30.720]  No, the really bad quota stuff started out in 97 under law wasn't implemented till 98.99.
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:35.440]  So so you got out right when that true criminality accelerated and that's the point of this is
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:39.480]  the bureaucracy is growing, growing, getting hungrier and hungrier and hungrier.
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:45.520]  And so at this case of buta elementary in down in Taylor, people should know that just
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.960]  south of me, I have family that lives down there, I have a cousin lives there in the
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:49.960]  military.
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:52.240]  You need to know when you send your children to these public schools and it's not just
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:53.240]  beauty.
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:54.240]  It's all over the country.
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:55.240]  Everywhere.
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:59.640]  I can't tell you how many families I've talked to where or a lot of times they'll say your
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:04.480]  child has ADHD, they might even be 12 and they take them and then institutionalize them
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:09.080]  because the state then gets federal money saying your child's mentally ill and they
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:11.560]  jack them up on all these drugs.
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:14.640]  I've seen more of that than you care now.
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:15.640]  People only knew.
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:20.960]  I mean, children, small, small children on anti psychotic drugs that you wouldn't even
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:28.040]  give to a persistently and chronically mentally ill person adult and they're sent to these
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:29.040]  places.
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.640]  I mean, these mental institutions for children that are nothing more than bedlam where they're
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:38.200]  continued to be raped and abused further.
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:42.040]  Well, you know, I looked into this, but now remember the 70s and 80s they would show hidden
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:47.000]  film footage of Russian orphanages where all these kids and piles of crap everywhere in
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  the hell of it.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.800]  Did you know Russia doesn't have those anymore because they pay people to have children now.
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:54.960]  They're going the opposite of eugenics.
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:57.000]  I disagree with a lot of things Russia does, but I agree with that.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.920]  They're trying to get families to have children.
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:03.480]  They're being profan because Russia is literally their populations imploding about 1.2 population
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:07.920]  replacement and they, the government admits and apologizes that the socialists, the communists
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:09.240]  wanted to break up the family.
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:13.440]  Now we have that here and it's been in the news, especially in Florida and Michigan,
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:18.960]  where they warehouse the kids and basically like little cages at the CPS offices and then
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.320]  how the kids die and they still give kids to these foster parents and how they lock them
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:27.920]  up in cages and give them like one hot dog and one water a day and they're like concentration
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  camp victims.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:30.920]  I mean, it's so hellish.
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:31.920]  Yeah.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:32.920]  Bologna sandwich.
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:33.920]  Yeah.
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:38.960]  That's why I would say, I mean, if there's anything anybody can take away from the little
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:44.200]  bit of information I could give you was educate your children, sit down and talk to them about
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:50.040]  speaking with a guidance counselor, teach them, don't answer those kind of questions
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:53.640]  and I want my mommy or my daddy there with me because they will come.
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:54.640]  I'm sorry.
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:55.640]  That's my dog in the background.
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:00.440]  They will come to the school and interrogate your child without your knowledge or permission.
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:04.560]  Well, what about them strip searching their daughter?
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:05.560]  I find that incredible.
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:09.640]  I mean, I'm assuming a nurse or a medical professional was there.
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:10.640]  Yeah.
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:14.520]  But I mean, doing that without your parents approval.
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:17.600]  And by the way, we've been trying to get this straight from Haley.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:20.760]  It looks like there was a male officer there and a female.
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:21.760]  She said a man.
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:22.760]  Unbelievable.
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:26.480]  Well, the Supreme Court just ruled with those girls for drugs.
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.240]  She gave her friend an aspirin and they stripped searcher with males.
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:31.560]  The other one, she's 10.
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:32.720]  They just said they can do that.
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:35.640]  But other Supreme Court rulings say no.
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:38.600]  So it's kind of a mixed bag, but I don't care what the Supreme Court says, you know,
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:41.040]  they said black people weren't human beings before.
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:42.040]  And you know, that was overturned.
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:45.160]  Well, listen, I want to get your, I want to get your number, maybe have you on.
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:49.040]  So I've had other official CPS people on have quit before and other family rise.
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:50.560]  Chris, ma'am, you're very articulate.
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:52.040]  I'd like to have you on as a full guest.
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:55.240]  Can I get your, we can use a fake name if you want, but can I get your number right
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.240]  now off air?
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:57.240]  Absolutely.
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.240]  Okay.
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:41:59.240]  We'll get that right now.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  Thank you so much.
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:01.240]  Okay.
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:02.240]  Yeah.
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  God bless you.
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:04.240]  John Harmon.
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  Please get that from her up there on the phone system.
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:06.240]  Okay.
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:12.880]  Let me just try to briefly tell this story, then have the family talk about it.
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:18.560]  You know, Janet and Joe and Haley, the little portal girls are sweet and I've seen around
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:24.400]  here and it's very nice and everybody likes around here at the office, um, to hear this
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:25.400]  story.
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:26.400]  Absolutely.
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:32.600]  It didn't blow me away because just as that CPS former CPS worker said, this is standard
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:33.920]  three times a year.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:35.280]  It's more some schools less.
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:36.680]  They bring them into the counselor.
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:40.560]  This happened when I was started, when I was in high school, 18 years ago, 19 years ago,
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:43.240]  they call you and they ask house family life, do you have plenty of money or your parents
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:44.240]  nice to you?
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:46.640]  And then if you don't say they go, are they, did they get you a car?
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:47.960]  They're introducing you to talk crap.
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:48.960]  No, they didn't.
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:49.960]  Are they rude?
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:50.960]  Do they fight?
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:54.320]  And all these questions were asked and they would call each kid in, uh, you know, they
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:57.360]  put them in the auditorium area and they would call them back and they, and they got
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:00.960]  her in there and what kid doesn't have bruises on their legs.
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:07.520]  There she is with the shorts because it was pajama day that all these schools have.
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:08.520]  It's the last week of school.
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:11.680]  They have a pajama day using on the Monday or the Friday and she sees a little bruise
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  there on her thigh.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:13.680]  I mean, it's a little bit.
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:14.680]  I've seen it.
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:15.680]  It's a little big thing.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:19.400]  On the table, kids always say she has a few little bruises, you know, on her legs, uh,
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:22.720]  on the, like my kids do from gymnastics and running and jumping, little tiny ones.
[1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:24.000]  You can barely see them.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  This is normal though.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.480]  I mean, with me, I was cuts everywhere and black eyes and, you know, just, you know,
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:33.000]  broken fingers because I was wild and skateboarding by the time I was 10, you know, huge scrapes
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:34.680]  on me missing half the skin on my back.
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:42.040]  I mean, I would have been gone in today's society, but, uh, just to finish this up here
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:50.920]  and we're going to go to them, get the timeline clear and we have the name of the, uh, counselor
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:55.920]  and everybody here, just absolutely disgusting and then, and then this is normal.
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:00.040]  We have to do this secret police because if it saves one child, you know, better than
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:06.240]  10 innocent kids be taken that one child abuse doesn't see this is the opposite of 10 guilty
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:07.440]  men go free than one innocent.
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:10.080]  And of course, again, the systems five times more likely to abuse you.
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:11.080]  That's key.
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:14.560]  You know, people that are above the law and very bad on average in the system.
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:16.160]  And so then they interrogate her.
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.160]  They say, you know, did your mom do that?
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:20.760]  And Haley said, no, my mom didn't do that.
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:21.760]  I'll hurt myself.
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:23.280]  My grandma walks into the table.
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:24.280]  You can see it.
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:25.280]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:26.800]  You can see the corner.
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:29.200]  And then she said, well, does your mom spank you?
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:30.200]  No, not really.
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:32.440]  I guess a few times, which by the way, isn't illegal.
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:34.400]  Well, and, you know, not lately.
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:37.960]  And then, okay, well, the next day, the police show up, they take her to the nurse.
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:41.320]  They tell her, take your pants off because this day she's wearing jeans and she says
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:42.320]  she's wearing them.
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:43.320]  Yes.
[1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:45.320]  Then when she came, she said, no, and they said, do it right now.
[1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:46.320]  You're in trouble.
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.560]  And the police told her, do it.
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.640]  So she pulls her pants off and she's very embarrassed when she's talking about this
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:58.280]  and look for other bruises and didn't find them, but took photos of the one little bruise.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.440]  And then they may have gotten the protective snatch order.
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:04.520]  They won't say when I talked to them, but we're about to have the lawyers talk to them.
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:07.080]  We've got to wait till Janet can get off air and go talk to them.
[1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:10.200]  You know, on the conference call.
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:13.800]  And so the police are there, they strip search her and they say, your mother did this.
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:20.400]  And she said, no, and the policemen, they said, wearing yellow shirt tucked into jeans.
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:24.920]  That's what they wear in, in, uh, in Hays County a lot of the time, playing clothes.
[1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:31.560]  And then one in the uniform said, and she said male and female, the CPS was a female
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:35.280]  male cop in there with a little girl in her panties, eight year old.
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:37.480]  This is what they do.
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:43.280]  And they said, uh, they said, tell the truth, you're in trouble and she said, no, they didn't
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:44.280]  do that.
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:48.000]  And, and, you know, I told you, and they said, you're going to get in trouble.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  You tell me right now.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.320]  Oh, she wouldn't take her pants off.
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:51.320]  They said, you're going to get in trouble.
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:54.600]  So, and then now their argument is, well, she took her pants off willingly, a minor
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:55.880]  doesn't work that way in the law.
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:58.360]  And you, you people know that I'm going to call you scum.
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:01.640]  It's what you are violating her due process, not calling her parents.
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:04.400]  You said, take it off or you're in trouble.
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:05.400]  So you forced her.
[1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:09.200]  That'd be like of an adult, grabbed a kid at a park and said, uh, have sex with me
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:10.200]  or you're in trouble.
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:11.200]  You raped them.
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:14.320]  You can say, well, the little kid, you know, get it when I told him to put a gun to a woman's
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:15.840]  head and say, I'm going to rape you.
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:17.400]  You know, you raped them.
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:21.440]  Well, you forced her to take her pants off, little eight year old.
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:22.440]  Okay.
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:24.320]  And you didn't find what you wanted.
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:25.520]  So you wanted to get in their house.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:32.360]  You start calling her at work at three o'clock and she was going to gymnastics then threatening
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.320]  Janet Sanchez that, that you had to come meet at her house.
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:44.080]  They wanted to go to Janet's house, her house just south of Austin here in Kyle, my beauty.
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:45.080]  Where is it?
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  Taylor Taylor's north of here.
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:48.160]  I get all the names mixed up and Taylor's north.
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:49.160]  It's Kyle.
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:50.160]  It's Kyle.
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:51.160]  Yeah.
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:52.160]  I'm just so many facts.
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:53.920]  I know Taylor's north of us folks, 20 miles.
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:55.240]  This is, this is south.
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:46:56.240]  This is Kyle.
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:46:58.080]  Kyle, a family in Kyle, not Taylor.
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:01.400]  And so they're down there in beauty, down by Neeter wall and all that south of Austin
[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:03.880]  in between here in San Marcos.
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:07.560]  And so, and correct me any time I'm wrong, we're going to go to you in a moment.
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:10.040]  We got a lawyer coming up next hour.
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:16.560]  And so all of this goes on and I tell her, I say, in my experience and I'm online checking
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:19.560]  the law sources and things, I'm going to Mike's things.
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:23.640]  Most lawyers, like all lawyers we talk to and family say, don't get a lawyer first.
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:24.640]  Don't go home.
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:27.680]  They're going to force their way in one dirty dish, one piece of dog hair.
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:29.320]  They're going to say it's neglect.
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:32.560]  You heard about the tube lawn here and kids from the last lady being taken for sleeping
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:35.640]  on match when their house burned down, even though they'd be sleeping on those at the
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:36.640]  Salvation Army.
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:40.120]  They'll be sleeping in a cage once they're in CPS hands.
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:43.800]  And I said, no, call her and I said, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I would
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:46.520]  say meet her at a gas station and even see what she says.
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:47.520]  She calls back.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:49.200]  She goes, okay, I'll meet you at the Dutch roll shell.
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.240]  And I said, okay, we'll drive to the parking lot and see if there's an unmarked or marked
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:55.680]  police car with her.
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:56.680]  She gets there in five minutes.
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:58.360]  She goes, oh my God, I'm here in the parking lot.
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:47:59.360]  There's a guy.
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:01.560]  It looks like he has a gun on his side with a t-shirt partway over it.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:02.560]  He's at her car.
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:06.440]  He's driving a black Mercury unmarked and he's at the window with the lady.
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:09.000]  I go, okay, drive out of the parking lot, call her, ask if she's there.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Yes, she's there.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  Okay, that's pretty much her.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.920]  But she didn't like it when I called this morning and said, we saw you in the parking
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:14.920]  lot with your little friend.
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:16.080]  She starts going, she starts shaking.
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:17.080]  Oh, sir.
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:18.960]  You know, the point is this is how these creeps operate.
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:21.200]  They wouldn't tell you, we want to talk to you.
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:24.680]  What the talking was going to be, you sign this paperwork and don't worry, you'll get
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:25.680]  your daughter back.
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:26.680]  Just sign it.
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.680]  Boom, they'd have taken her.
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:28.680]  Oh, they would.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  But they can't.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:30.680]  We're not violating.
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:31.680]  We're not violating.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  Or they had the court order.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:33.680]  But they won't say, so we're not violating court order.
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:34.680]  These, these phony things.
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:35.960]  But they always fill him out wrong, too, so they can that's official oppression.
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:37.160]  We'll, we'll catch him in that.
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:38.160]  There's lots of stuff.
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:40.160]  We're going to get them right to me.
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:45.320]  I don't want a Lamborghini, Uh, uh, Tester Rosa or a Lamborghini Coutache.
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:46.700]  I don't want a supermodel.
[1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:48.360]  I don't want a castle.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:50.100]  I want criminals to go to prison.
[1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:54.760]  The government criminals to me, this is like piles of diamonds to defeat them to crush
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  them.
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:58.360]  I mean, it literally, I want the treasure, the jewel of liberty.
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:02.640]  And so it's my, anyways, I want everybody else to learn how to deal with them.
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:04.200]  So when we come back, we're going to go to you guys.
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:07.000]  I just wanted to lay this out.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:11.800]  So then they start calling your mother trying to intimidate her and they say she's not allowed
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:17.000]  to have the child, but didn't, you know, give her the authority just tells her, hey, slave.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  That's how they do.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.760]  You've got to have really, they were just wanting to have her take over there as they
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:23.320]  could get her, make her mom feel important.
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:25.480]  You have to come get her because she lives near you.
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:26.480]  You have to come get her.
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:31.240]  She's not allowed to stay with your daughter anymore, you know, hurt of the mother anymore.
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:35.760]  So that right there means they're either threatening without the order, which is a big official
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:39.240]  oppression going around ordering people around the cop can't come to your house, the CPS
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:43.240]  can come to your house and say, come polish my, you know, come wax my car.
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:44.440]  They can't say, do my nails.
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:47.080]  They can't say unpack my garage.
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:50.360]  Well, they can't come and say, you will now take your daughter here.
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.680]  And again, even when they get these court orders, which they probably don't have, they
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:54.800]  may have now they're fake.
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:58.360]  It's like they, they write blank warrants to take blood at checkpoints in Austin without
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:49:59.360]  warrants.
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:00.760]  It's not real.
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  This is America.
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:02.760]  This is not Russia.
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:03.800]  This is not China.
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:07.200]  This is precious and Liberty that we have here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:08.800]  So the government's not God.
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:09.800]  The police are not God.
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:11.600]  And the CPS workers sure are God.
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:18.760]  They have not one, one, 10th the authority police or sheriff's deputies out.
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:24.800]  So all of this is going on, all of this is happening.
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:26.480]  And so now we're getting your lawyers.
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:27.480]  We're going through this.
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:28.480]  We're fighting this.
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:29.480]  But remember, this is happening to everybody.
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:31.760]  This could happen to you next.
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:34.800]  When you put your children in public schools and now most private are quote, complying for
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.400]  their insurance regulations, they bring your children in guilty to prevent innocent with
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:42.760]  snooping operations like the Soviet Union to break up the family.
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:43.880]  And I have the textbooks.
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:48.720]  They teach the social workers saying the families of disease belong to the prehistoric
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:49.720]  times.
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:53.720]  It must be abolished and replaced with kids in cages getting one bologna sandwich a day
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:57.160]  and a bag of chips show or sent to Saudi Arabia.
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:51:01.240]  Literally, that's on record to slave pits will be right back with the family.
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:02.240]  You worry.
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:04.200]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:07.560]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:11.000]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember there's a
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.200]  learning curve experiences the best teacher, but that means time to speed it up.
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:18.040]  You'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:19.840]  Another Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:22.640]  Her wild food knowledge package is the crash course.
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:26.360]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:30.800]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[1:51:30.800 --> 1:51:34.960]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:39.560]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:41.160]  in weeks, not years.
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:43.520]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:45.680]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:50.560]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:51.560]  Start now.
[1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:53.040]  Knowledge is power.
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:54.040]  Better take action.
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:52:01.640]  I think a storm's coming.
[1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:07.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:13.720]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:15.040]  just as well-funded.
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:20.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:21.200]  of the American people.
[1:52:21.200 --> 1:52:26.120]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:31.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:37.720]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:39.400]  It's not about left or right.
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:41.280]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:48.200]  His film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:57.960]  The Obama deception.
[1:52:57.960 --> 1:53:02.400]  The people strike back.
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:10.240]  The New World Order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals,
[1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:13.880]  and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:23.880]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options, starves or surrender.
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:28.560]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:29.560]  What then?
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:30.560]  Then.
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.960]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:38.360]  Survivalistseeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company, and it's
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:41.160]  owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:45.440]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables, like a watermelon, a bundle of
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:48.880]  carrots or tomatoes, for a little more than a penny each.
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:54.520]  Survivalistseeds.com, and now you can go into business with Big John at survivalistseeds.com
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:55.880]  by becoming an affiliate.
[1:53:55.880 --> 1:54:11.400]  See his link at survivalistseeds.com Okay, we're not going to get into too many more
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:15.240]  details about Haley, but we may, with the cameras off, as we're live at PrismPlanet.tv,
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:18.760]  have her in here with a letter just on record here from the eyewitness that they told her,
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:21.720]  you're going to get in trouble if you don't tell us what your mommy did.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:23.840]  And they said, your mommy did that bruise.
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:25.640]  Your mommy did that bruise.
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:29.200]  And they may be coming to arrest Janet Sanchez.
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:32.800]  We've got her fiance here, Joe.
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:34.240]  You guys have got the floor.
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:38.000]  Tell folks what it's been like going through this.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.600]  And we're going to try to give the numbers out to this county.
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:43.240]  Again, I can't help everybody, but this has happened in my own backyard.
[1:54:43.240 --> 1:54:44.240]  I'm asking folks for help.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:47.440]  This is also an educational thing on air of how folks can counter this.
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:48.440]  Go ahead, Janet.
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:54.400]  Okay, it's just been really emotional because my daughter feels like it's her fault that
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:56.360]  all this has happened.
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:57.960]  And I think it's crazy.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:58.960]  It's ridiculous.
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.240]  She had one bruise.
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:04.120]  I took pictures.
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:07.640]  They took pictures yesterday and I saw the bruise and there's one bruise.
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:08.640]  I don't...
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:09.880]  Now, you took pictures last night.
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:11.760]  To be clear, they first interrogated her Monday.
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:12.760]  Monday.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:13.760]  Had police there yesterday.
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:14.760]  Yeah.
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:15.760]  You took a photo.
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  Yeah.
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:18.960]  And they took pictures yesterday and had her pull her pants down yesterday.
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:23.040]  And so that was two days that they...
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:25.360]  That's when do men get to strip search little girls?
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:27.920]  I mean, this country is just really going to hell.
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:29.040]  I don't know if the...
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:35.840]  I think she told me both of the male cops were out of the office, but the CPS lady and
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:37.320]  the nurse and counselor were in.
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:38.320]  Yeah, well, it wasn't clear.
[1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:39.480]  But she said the cops ordered her.
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:40.480]  They said...
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:42.360]  They told her that she needed to take her...
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:43.880]  Her pants off or she would be in trouble.
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:44.880]  And that they made her close...
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:47.720]  She asked them to close the mini blinds because she felt that uncomfortable.
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  My God.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:50.600]  And then they told her to...
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:51.600]  She said twice.
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:52.600]  They said, tell the truth.
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:53.600]  I did that.
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:54.600]  I believe...
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:57.840]  She tried to tell them, you know, I don't now want to remove my pants down, but they
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:01.000]  told her, if you don't take your pants off, you're going to be in trouble.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  So they...
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:03.240]  She had to do what they told her.
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:04.240]  That's terrorism.
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:05.240]  They forced her to do something.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:08.200]  And that right there does not make me happy or her happy.
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:10.240]  And it's very stressful right now.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:11.240]  Janet...
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:13.840]  Well, then Janet, what happened yesterday when I...
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:15.520]  I said, do what you want, but this is what I would do.
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:16.520]  This was the law...
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:19.280]  And later I gave you lawyer printouts where that's what they recommend.
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:21.400]  You know, I said, why don't you meet her at a gas station?
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:24.280]  And then I said, but drive through because there's probably going to be a cop there.
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:25.280]  Tell folks what you saw.
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:30.360]  Uh, there was a unmarked car I looked like and another lady sitting in the car.
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:34.400]  So I'm assuming those were the people I was meeting because they weren't parked in front
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:37.000]  of the gas station as if they were getting off or anything.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  And you said she was...
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.920]  The cop guy was out and had like something on the...
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:44.480]  Yeah, I saw something back on the side of his pocket, so I assume maybe it was just...
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:45.480]  But you weren't looking too close.
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:46.480]  I told you, don't look.
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:47.480]  Don't look out of there.
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:48.480]  Yeah.
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:49.480]  You were like, don't look.
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:51.480]  I didn't see any issues or something.
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:55.800]  So I just drove through and like not even a minute or two later she called, she asked
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:56.800]  where I was.
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:56:57.800]  I told her I was just pulling out of the...
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:56:58.800]  I mean, I didn't...
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:56:59.800]  Well, I confirmed that was her.
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:00.800]  I called her this morning.
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:01.800]  I wasn't able to meet her, but...
[1:57:01.800 --> 1:57:04.480]  I mean, that was her there because I called her this morning and I said, we saw you and
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:05.480]  your friend there at the gas station.
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:06.480]  She said, oh, you did.
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:07.480]  And I was like, yeah.
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:09.800]  So she said she was at the gas station where it was.
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:12.360]  I told her I'm not going to meet you.
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:13.360]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:14.360]  And then she threatened you.
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:16.120]  She said, I'm going to have to call the police if you don't come in.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Yeah.
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:20.040]  I don't know that you were uncooperative, I was like, well, I can meet with you tomorrow.
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:21.040]  So I made arrangements.
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:22.040]  Yeah.
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  You've got to meet when they want.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:24.840]  I mean, it's like when they come to your door, you go, no, you don't have a warrant.
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  This is my house.
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.200]  Get out of here, you little scumbag.
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:29.080]  You're just here to get money.
[1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:33.200]  I mean, folks, my children have bruises all over them year round.
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.200]  They're always playing.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:35.760]  They have a treehouse.
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:37.480]  I mean, when they're in...
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:41.760]  They're in gymnastics, swimming, soccer, basketball.
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:45.840]  I mean, you know, my son's head is lip busted by the basketball hitting him while I lose
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:47.600]  him because of the YMCA basketball.
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:49.720]  When they play soccer, they get bruises.
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:51.320]  I mean, is soccer illegal?
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:52.320]  I mean...
[1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:53.320]  Correct.
[1:57:53.320 --> 1:57:56.680]  It's very, very frustrating over here on our end.
[1:57:56.680 --> 1:57:59.600]  I've had this happen before.
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:03.040]  Counselors gave me a call that my son has bruises on their legs.
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:08.160]  It's where they just take advantage of the children and that really is wrong.
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:11.440]  But Joe, that's bad enough for them to call you and be secret police.
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:15.120]  They call the cops and strip searcher and took photos and are now running around with
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:16.120]  the cops after you.
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  And this all...
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:20.960]  I mean, if they were that concerned, they would have made arrangements for me to be there
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.960]  Tuesday because all this happened Monday.
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:24.680]  No, no, they don't want you to know.
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:25.680]  Yeah, so...
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:26.680]  They do this in secret.
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:28.560]  I questioned her two days without my knowledge.
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:29.880]  I asked her why she didn't tell me.
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:30.880]  She said she was scared.
[1:58:30.880 --> 1:58:32.280]  So I don't know what they told her.
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:33.280]  Like, don't...
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:34.280]  I talked to her.
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:35.280]  They told her not to talk to you.
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:36.280]  I remember them as in the conversation.
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:37.280]  So...
[1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:38.280]  Stay right there.
[1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:40.480]  We'll be back in 70 seconds fighting the child kidnappers.
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:52.800]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:56.640]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:58:56.640 --> 1:58:57.640]  important than ever.
[1:58:57.640 --> 1:59:00.640]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:59:00.640 --> 1:59:03.480]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:07.440]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:09.720]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:13.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:17.320]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:59:17.320 --> 1:59:19.720]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[1:59:47.080 --> 2:00:13.080]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:22.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:27.880]  We got a lawyer coming on in 15 minutes, one of the ones recommended by some of the parent
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:31.080]  rights and a homeschool defense groups because they really harass homeschoolers.
[2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:33.640]  They've even had to pass a lot of state laws.
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:40.120]  Texas has had to pass state laws, decrying CPS and the whole system because it came out
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:47.360]  that the entire Youth Commission operation was at every facility raping the children.
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:52.240]  That's the Texas Youth Commission and I have the new laws here written to counter that.
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:54.880]  This is getting serious, folks.
[2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:58.480]  You heard the CPS worker earlier admitting that there's all these criminals involved
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:00:59.480]  in it.
[2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:02.600]  Okay, so we're talking to Joe and Janet.
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:06.880]  We're talking about Haley, your daughter.
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:11.640]  I wanted the truth, plus, spanking is not illegal, but I know when I look at a bruise
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:14.680]  and it's that big on her thigh, that wasn't even it, and I know she was telling the truth
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:18.920]  because I've got a good BS vector, I do this, that you didn't do that to her and doesn't
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:19.920]  matter.
[2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:22.480]  The point is, you don't strip search or you don't not follow due process.
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:23.480]  You go get a warrant.
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:27.080]  You go get an indictment, you know, but the family courts don't think that they have
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:28.080]  to do that.
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:30.360]  We're going to give their phone numbers out coming up in the next segment.
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:33.360]  Other points you guys want to add?
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  Go ahead, sweetie.
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  Anything else?
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:41.160]  I don't know, I just, I'm going to, I feel really bad for me and Haley just because we're
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:46.280]  going to go into school and I'm going to be recognized as that lady who beat her child
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:49.280]  or whatever they think and.
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:52.320]  You called this morning to say you were taking her to the doctor and they were, and like
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:55.240]  suddenly, you know, you know, usually you call to say your kid's going to be sick.
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:58.480]  She said she's been sick three times this year and they're like, okay, fine.
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:01:59.480]  This was 20 questions.
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:03.800]  They were like, oh, oh, hi, Janet, you're not, you're going to take her to the doctor
[2:02:03.800 --> 2:02:04.960]  if she's sick, right?
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:05.960]  You're not abusing her.
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:10.600]  So they're just like, they're, again, they're all, they're all little secret police minions
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:11.600]  now.
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:15.440]  Yeah, I don't know if that's their protocol, but I know it's not their secret police.
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:21.880]  So I just, I just feel really bad and we drive her across town thinking that she was going
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:22.880]  to a better school.
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:26.040]  She's on a student transfer.
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:28.040]  Just a student.
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:33.360]  Well, buta buta is only what about 8% Hispanic and I don't know if this is a race card issue,
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:36.880]  that needs to be investigated, you're saying mostly, I mean, you know, there's always that
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.840]  subconscious thing of, and we've seen this with the eugenics, how these family courts
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:41.840]  were set up.
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:46.000]  They first mainly grabbed Native Americans and blacks, and then they moved on to everybody
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:50.920]  else by the 60s and 70s and 80s, but the family courts were set up to carry out racial
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:51.920]  hygiene.
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:57.080]  So so they were set up inherently to attack, uh, non whites, right?
[2:02:57.080 --> 2:02:58.080]  Correct.
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:04.480]  It's just like when I went down for her field trip is very uncomfortable, uh, like I was
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:08.000]  being a criminal, just being there at that school district.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.680]  It's very uncomfortable.
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:13.560]  So I mean, I don't know, I just feel really bad.
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  It's been emotional.
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.360]  Haley wrote me an apology letter.
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:19.880]  Now she feels like she, she did wrong.
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:20.880]  I don't know.
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  But it's not her fault.
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:22.880]  Yeah.
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:24.880]  They told her at least twice, you're going to be in trouble.
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:28.040]  She kept saying, no, that my grandma, they'd say, tell me the truth.
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:29.040]  Your mother did that.
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:30.040]  Didn't she?
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:34.680]  Your mother spanked you and she, she went, she, yeah, I guess before I've been spanked.
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:38.480]  And when I asked the CPS officer, I was like, so you saw bruises on my daughter.
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:41.920]  She said, yes, I go, that means you must have took her pants down because I know what Haley
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  wears to school.
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:43.920]  Yeah.
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:45.680]  You get a call first for even told by your daughter because they told your daughter
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:46.680]  not to tell you.
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:51.200]  And, and, and psychology studies show people rape kids and they won't tell their parents
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:52.520]  because they get scared.
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:53.520]  They're embarrassed.
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:54.520]  Yeah.
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:58.280]  And when I confronted her with that about her pulling my daughter's pants, I should
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:00.280]  say that Haley did it willingly.
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:01.280]  Here's an example.
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:04.840]  When I was three, I had a babysitter try to sexually assault me, a neighbor kid that,
[2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:06.200]  you know, like a teenager they had keep me.
[2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:07.840]  I never told my parents about it.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:09.560]  I'm talking about it for the first time here.
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:10.560]  But I said no and refused.
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:13.160]  I was a pretty tough little kid.
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:14.880]  But I didn't want to put that in my mouth.
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:18.520]  So I was like, my eight year old willingly took her pants off.
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:23.480]  I was like, no, she was, no, I just think it was all wrong.
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:29.880]  And I really upset that I wasn't notified Monday or Tuesday by the school, at least,
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:32.160]  you know, oh, we're a little concerned.
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:35.760]  Something would have helped not for me to get blindsided, slapped in the face.
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:38.480]  They're not your friends and they operate outside the law.
[2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:41.920]  They are a eugenics organization and most of this trash doesn't even know what they're
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:42.920]  part of.
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:47.200]  They're either control freaks or their pedophiles or their bounty hunters.
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:48.200]  That's it.
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:49.840]  50 plus percent leave.
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:50.840]  They get there.
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:51.840]  They're like the lady they called earlier.
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:53.880]  I'm not.
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:58.880]  We can handle the small percentage of real child endangerment abuse with the police.
[2:04:58.880 --> 2:04:59.880]  Stay with us.
[2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:00.880]  The lawyer's coming up.
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:01.880]  We'll talk more and take the cost.
[2:05:01.880 --> 2:05:05.560]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:10.200]  longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:15.440]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:20.680]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:07.120]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:13.800]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:15.120]  just as well-funded.
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:20.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[2:06:20.280 --> 2:06:21.800]  of the American people.
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:26.200]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:31.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:37.800]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:41.360]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:48.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:10:55.400 --> 2:10:57.720]  they they drag them in they question them
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:10:59.360]  it is all over the country

[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:06.520]  will know
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:09.480]  well does your mom ever spank you well i guess sometimes or once or
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:12.640]  you know this year and then get spanking is illegal back when i was in high
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:13.720]  school
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:16.280]  on junior high i was getting pops every month
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:19.160]  i'd get in a fight i'd smart out of the teacher i'd take you know and the and
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:20.560]  the principal would
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:22.040]  you'll put bruises on me
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:23.880]  and you know what that got my attention
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:26.560]  but see the police taser you when you don't do something as other people are
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:27.520]  out of control
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:31.160]  or society does all this but no parents can even though it's not a lot

[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:44.280]  i guess it being in public school this is just normal
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:46.120]  even when you're fifteen year olds now
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:48.200]  have bruises from football they try to take them
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:52.720]  oh yeah it's it's it's it's very it's that even in del valley there they do the

[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:02.920]  well you know we're guys we
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:05.960]  we're gonna be playing around it's it's very stressful to
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:06.880]  to have to
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:08.720]  put up with people like this already
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.800]  and control freak secret agents yes and it's we needed somebody or that the
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:14.680]  governor
[2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:16.680]  i mean they're not doing nothing for us
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:20.400]  ourselves as citizens we have to do something and and well i mean
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:24.320]  slavery is a uh... uh... uh... lucrative business and they slavery still
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:26.560]  around the day they catch you smoking while you're a slave
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:28.840]  they catch a bruise on your kid they're a slave
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:30.520]  and it's all about money
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:32.600]  but they are passing laws
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:35.880]  federal appeals court with the authority over texas handed down a decision in
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:38.080]  case that will refer to the gates case
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:41.280]  the decision is binding on text because it involves federal constitutional
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:43.240]  rights supersedes anything the
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:46.280]  uh... contrary to texas law the d f p h
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:47.800]  policy practices
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:51.000]  and this is when with one complaint they go and grab all families and just never
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  see him again
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  and they've had to pass state laws explaining the cps in texas a nationwide
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:57.800]  it's not illegal to homeschool
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:00.720]  you know why most the groups fighting cps or homeschoolers
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:03.880]  because they take your kids it's
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:07.920]  they don't care

[2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:30.480]  understand
[2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:34.720]  the state of texas and all of the other states have made a pact with the devil
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:37.120]  when they subscribed to
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:41.440]  the federal money back in the seventies under the mondale act
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:43.800]  and that deal was
[2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:47.880]  will give you federal money for cps as long as you provide
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:50.200]  these people immunity
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:53.880]  and it's gone downhill ever since
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:56.920]  they have absolute immunity
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:15:59.160]  virtually absolute immunity
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:01.480]  if they say there's abuse
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:02.800]  the doctors have
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:07.120]  immunity if they report abuse they don't have immunity if they say
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:10.600]  they don't report abuse so everything's geared for the tattletell
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:13.600]  society and so now when i'm at the hospital having a baby
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:16.600]  they ask you if you may ask my wife if i'm abusing her and put it in the
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:18.440]  database with the health department i mean
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:22.040]  this is the total stasi society
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:26.360]  that's a very apt way of describing it
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:29.040]  nothing proves that nothing happened
[2:16:29.040 --> 2:16:32.000]  but nothing proves that something happened
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:33.400]  it's that
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:35.720]  backwards
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:38.480]  now one of its official oppression one of the operate outside their office
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:41.800]  i mean i mean they did strip searcher
[2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:47.800]  that has to do with the the police and whether that is proper protocol
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:50.760]  or not i have a real serious problem
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:53.840]  with a male police officer
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:57.040]  strip searching a female
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:16:58.600]  or any female
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:01.280]  well regardless of they want to strip search an adult they have to get a
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:04.200]  warrant i mean i know they set up these eugenics courts in the twenties in the
[2:17:04.200 --> 2:17:06.440]  mondale act in the clinton in ninety seven
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:09.200]  i know we've gone down this road of these fake courts
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:13.200]  uh... but uh... this is just amazing and then telling her over and over again
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:15.720]  tell the truth no your mother did this
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:17.120]  that's despicable
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:19.400]  well it's beyond despicable
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:20.920]  the
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:25.080]  book jeopardy in the courtroom by maggie brock and stephen cc
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:26.240]  shows
[2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:29.640]  how easy it is to corrupt a child's recollection
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:32.960]  a child is going to respond to the forty figure
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:35.280]  and give them what answer
[2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:37.640]  they expect
[2:17:37.640 --> 2:17:42.280]  it takes a very strong child to stand up and say no
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:45.120]  especially when they come in wearing a uniform in a batch
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:49.360]  you know god bless her daughter for saying no nothing happened
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:52.760]  but no that is improper interrogation it should not happen
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:55.880]  i have uh... already advised
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:17:59.360]  janet to make a laminated card
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:02.440]  for poor her children to carry around saying
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:04.640]  i do not want to talk
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:06.880]  or say anything without my
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:09.440]  parent being here or my lawyer being here
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:11.640]  put her name and phone number on it
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:13.480]  and if necessary
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:16.840]  put it on a lanyard so the child can wear it around her neck
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:18.920]  but that to me is important
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:22.080]  well just to finish up in case you know they didn't relay this to you they
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:24.960]  told her twice maybe three times were not sure
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:27.960]  no your mother did that bruise did that bruise until she said
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:31.760]  okay i guess she did but it's on record that they told her to say it
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:33.280]  uh... expanding on that
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:36.960]  monday they see the bruise because it's pajama they were in shorts
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.120]  at the school
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:40.840]  tuesday without telling you know they told her not don't tell your mother
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:44.120]  tuesday they call her tell her we want to go to your house while our kids at
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:45.440]  school
[2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:48.040]  uh... i tell her you know that's may not be a good idea when you get your house
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:49.880]  and look for stuff when you talk to a lawyer first
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:51.880]  so she said okay let me get her to gas station
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:55.160]  i told her is she with a cop they drive through there's an unmarked cop car with
[2:18:55.160 --> 2:18:55.800]  a cop
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:59.840]  with a woman she leaves says are you there that yeah we're here so it looks
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:01.360]  like they may be to the point of
[2:19:01.360 --> 2:19:04.640]  grabbing your daughter something what does it sound like to you mister brah
[2:19:04.640 --> 2:19:06.720]  well it pleases but
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:08.720]  but secondly
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:12.400]  force them to make the the mistake
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:14.080]  make them commit
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:16.760]  to something that's illegal
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:18.160]  they show up at your door
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:20.600]  and they want to know where's your search warrant
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:25.680]  they show up at your door and they want your child where's your search warrant
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:28.700]  force them to make the mistake
[2:19:28.700 --> 2:19:31.920]  if you haven't done anything wrong
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:34.120]  insist upon that search warrant
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:36.800]  yeah because they'll trick their way in like a vampire let me in
[2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:38.400]  it'll be all you just let me in
[2:19:38.400 --> 2:19:40.480]  absolutely any small consent
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:46.200]  becomes a global consent and then it's a swearing match you said what
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:49.160]  so i gave them the right advice not to not to go meet them
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:53.880]  absolutely i never advised my clients to meet with them
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.040]  i'd stay there mister abroad uh... but what's brought attorney at law joins

[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:15.760]  two forty five kind of brawl at the shoulder and there at the hip
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:19.600]  and everybody knew you didn't get no lift much brought
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:24.800]  on top of this her fiance has several other children with his ex-wife
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:29.200]  who live nearby and when they were calling Janet yesterday she was saying
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:32.000]  and i want those other children i want to know where they live
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.760]  so i guess they were wanting to kind of you know
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  meet their quota with children that don't even live in the same house
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:44.480]  uh your comments on that sir and and where should this go i mean does she
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.960]  put her daughter back in the government training center
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:52.080]  so they grab her uh you know why were they taking photos are the police
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:55.840]  planning to arrest janet i mean i guess later the cps worker said she
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:59.760]  would talk to you certainly you advise janet not to meet with them i mean
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.400]  what's the course of action here well if i am shocked that you would say they
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:07.280]  have a quota they don't they can destroy as many
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:12.480]  families as they can get a hold of so it's worse than that
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.920]  yeah the and and obviously part of their
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:21.840]  uh system even though they deny it is is how many
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:29.040]  cases they open and close it it is hard to believe in the united
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:34.560]  states of america that as far as men we are all perverts we just
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:39.680]  haven't all been caught as far as families
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:43.680]  they're all abuse factories they all haven't been exposed i don't know how
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:47.200]  they expect us to have families or raise children or so forth
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:50.800]  other than in state-run institutions well no sir
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:53.920]  have you seen the the i mean we've posted these the textbooks
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  that they give all the cps workers in college it says quote the family is a
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:03.200]  disease i have not seen the textbook i am aware
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:08.400]  of this mindset that they are of the firm opinion
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:12.240]  that the state of texas or whichever state you happen to be in
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:18.160]  is better suited to raise your child your children and teach them morals and
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:23.120]  values than you are and that to me is abhorrent
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:30.480]  it is so twisted as to beggar you know comprehension i i don't know how you
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:35.440]  get there um as far as what is the next step they're going to snoop around
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:40.160]  trying to find something again their mindset is
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:44.080]  just because nothing happened that there's no evidence doesn't mean
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:49.280]  something didn't happen there are doctors who testify in these cases who say
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:53.920]  because there's no physical evidence a percentage of cases there can be rape
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:59.280]  without any physical evidence beyond me to understand i have
[2:26:59.280 --> 2:27:04.960]  actually heard a doctor give a presentation that the hymen grows back
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:08.880]  and that supposedly this doctor had photographic proof of this
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:14.560]  has never been published but that's their mindset yeah everything is so the
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:17.920]  deck is stacked and how do they get the nurses and
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:20.800]  doctors i guess if they're forced to do it they get where they like it
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:24.160]  i mean it did to go have a baby now is like entering a nazi
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.400]  uh interrogation chamber i mean everything is interrogation everything
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:31.600]  is tattletales everything is i have news articles where they're training
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:35.520]  seven-year-olds to spy on their parents i mean it's just it's hellish where it's
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:42.400]  it's east germany absolutely the how do you train
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:49.360]  the doctors this way it's very easy you give them absolute immunity
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:54.480]  if they report abuse you give them no immunity and civil liability
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:58.720]  if they don't that people no brainer what about how now they ask everybody do
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:01.680]  you own a gun do you have children you'll go in to have your broken
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:04.960]  finger fix and they their little secret police asking you do you have guns in
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:08.240]  your house and then not telling you by the way we're filing this with a
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.000]  criminal agency i mean it's just incredible the answer to that one is

[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:20.640]  period in the story why don't you ask the doctor hey do you own any guns

[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:28.880]  how dare you get out of here but it's normal for him to do it
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:32.320]  well because they're trained this way unfortunately
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:36.480]  and yes do they see actual abuse you bet

[2:33:17.200 --> 2:33:20.800]  they're creating youth brigades they've got seven-year-old spying on people
[2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:24.640]  this is in the news this is the government taking over society
[2:33:24.640 --> 2:33:27.920]  they grab masses of kids hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:31.120]  thousands every year and when they end up killing them in
[2:33:31.120 --> 2:33:33.840]  their custody five times more likely to abuse them than any other group nothing
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:37.760]  happens you better care about this folks and become informed now
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:41.760]  uh two final questions for you sir and then i'll you know get off air and
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:44.800]  you know let's you start advising uh you know janet and joe they should do it
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:48.720]  hailey here but it does seem the worm is turning you
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:51.760]  know the texas youth commission and all the mass raping's they were doing the
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:56.640]  government and all over the country it seems despite all the cps industry and
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:33:59.760]  the child protective services propaganda and the federal propaganda
[2:33:59.760 --> 2:34:04.240]  people know these are ghouls now and that for every one good thing they do
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:07.760]  they do probably a hundred bad and they violate due process
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:11.920]  i mean is the worm starting to turn some good news here
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:15.120]  the worm is starting to turn because people like you alexer
[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:20.240]  are focusing the spotlight on it unfortunately too many people have the
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:26.240]  assumption that gee it can't happen to me so why should i be concerned
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:30.080]  well it's going to happen to you directly or indirectly
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:33.680]  it's going to happen to you and your kids or you and your grandkids
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:39.680]  or your children and their kids it's going to affect you
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:44.000]  and you need to know your rights you don't talk to these people
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:48.480]  i have a videotape of a cps interview of a
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:59.680]  three-year-old boy from 1987 four times in a row cps caseworker asked this boy
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:05.040]  did your daddy do these horrible things to you and four times in a row
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:11.360]  the child denies it caseworker on the videotape takes the child sits on her
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:16.160]  lap rubs his crotch he goes nuts wets himself
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:21.280]  she repeats the questions he changes his answers
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:25.360]  she asks him then realizing he's wet himself what you just told me is that the
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:28.320]  truth or a lie he spins around looks right at the
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.360]  camera and says it's a lie and they went out and got an indictment
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:37.840]  which ultimately was dismissed so excuse me you're saying on record i've seen
[2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:41.440]  the famous cases where they tell them this is what he did to you now show me
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:43.600]  and the kid and they do it real happy like with a clown
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:46.080]  show me this is how you did it they do it over and over again
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:50.240]  you're saying they now do sexual abuse on the children on camera and that's okay
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:55.520]  in 1987 on the videotape they take this three-year-old boy after asking
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:59.040]  four times in a row well they're pedophiles how many of these guys are
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:02.640]  pedophiles and i'm sorry go ahead go ahead and finish your story i'm gonna
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:05.840]  ask you anyway you know how do you
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:09.680]  go on interview that incorrectly of course the way they do that now
[2:36:09.680 --> 2:36:12.640]  is they talk to them when they're not on the videotape and then bring them in
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:14.640]  and get them to repeat what they've just been told
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:17.360]  say oh well everything happened on the videotape
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:21.440]  horse hockey but wait a minute now the pedophiles on camera sexually abuse the
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:23.920]  children and that's good i mean that's how crazy they're getting
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:27.440]  that was 1987 lord knows what they're doing today
[2:36:27.440 --> 2:36:30.320]  how many of them are pedophiles because they're always getting busted and caught
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:33.440]  we know the pedophiles get into this so they can have access to kids
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:36.400]  and of course they let the foster parents abuse and that's where the smart
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.840]  pedophiles become foster parents what percentage
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:44.720]  i have no idea alex i have no idea but i know that
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:48.240]  the vast vast majority of the ones that i have dealt with
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:53.680]  come from dysfunctional families uh they are dysfunctional themselves
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:57.120]  they have no idea what a normal relationship is with a child
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:03.280]  or with a wife or husband well i've been around them a lot i fought them and
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:06.160]  it's always the guys are like the nely effeminate
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:09.600]  i call it you know the the the android pedophile model you know what i'm talking
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:13.280]  about you thought and then the women are the butch with a haircut all crazed
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:16.080]  i mean is that not what you've seen with these people
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.240]  by and large that if i had to say there's a stereotype you pretty well pegged
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:24.720]  yeah fat nely homosexual and a and a butch and then they don't like heterosexual
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:28.240]  families with kids and they're waging war and i'm not bashing gay people but
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:31.840]  stop trying to steal our kids and you're in your demon guilds
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:35.600]  i mean out there i've said it i've just laid it right out counselor
[2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:39.840]  well if you will not get any argument from me that they are dysfunctional on
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:46.240]  more levels than one and go find the real criminals
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:50.160]  don't try to indoctrinate them by putting them into your custody but see that's
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.640]  what these nely scumbags like they love the drama of tearing families apart
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.640]  they love the power and i'm declaring war on them
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:03.440]  and no question they like the power they they get paid a relatively low salary
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:06.800]  and they have the infinite ability to destroy people's lives
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:11.520]  yeah we're coming after a power trip that's it
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:15.360]  yeah and again i've just fought them i've seen it i don't ever i've never seen
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:19.280]  it where it's not those i mean it's what it is it'll be a
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:25.200]  weird chubby nely guy with a demonic face you know smiling i mean here let me
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:30.160]  try to make the face for the tv crowd and then the woman is like some angry
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:32.480]  you know demon i don't know how to explain it
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:37.200]  i have been dealing with cases involving cps since 1982
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:41.600]  and in that period of time i can recall one case worker
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:46.000]  that impressed me as coming from a functional family having a normal
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:51.520]  psychological makeup one yeah so they're either perverts or
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:53.440]  they're pirates they're people that just want the money
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:55.520]  and they and they get the bonuses for more kids i want to go to
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:00.480]  bring kim hard up and stay there if you can mr brot i want to bring kim hard
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:04.080]  up executive director national child abuse defense and resource center that
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:06.560]  recommended you false allegation dot org
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:11.360]  what is your comments about this ma'am well the problem that we have a social
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:14.960]  services oh by the way hello mr brot um
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:18.960]  the problem with social services is it was a nice experiment that's gone bad
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:23.840]  you cannot give a bureaucracy completing total control over
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:27.840]  families and children without accountability or the child abuse
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:31.760]  mechanism that follows behind it this is not going to change
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:36.560]  until we remove remove the immunity that's been given to
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:41.200]  all of the people involved in the investigation and prosecution and
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:44.320]  accusations of child abuse by the state and federal
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:48.800]  legislatures it's not going to change the politicians know what's going on
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:52.480]  but the lobby is just much stronger than we
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:55.120]  that's got to be one of the most evil things in the world because this is a
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:58.080]  holocaust of families and lives and all the kids that get killed in their
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:01.680]  custody and i guess they don't care the politicians just the lobbyists come in
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.440]  and they give them money and and it's it's radically expanding isn't it
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:08.000]  that's one reason we see people fighting back now is it's just
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:11.920]  they're everywhere i mean pretty soon the numbers are the numbers are astronomical
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:17.520]  you know social services numbers even as ill-defined as they are
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:23.680]  demonstrated uh for the last many years that there's approximately three
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:28.240]  million um we're not sure if it's children or
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:32.560]  accusations because like i said it's ill-defined but of those
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:36.160]  the social services department of health and human services acknowledges that
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:39.360]  they cannot meet a 51 percent burden on
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:43.600]  two-thirds of those which is two million either children accusations we don't
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:46.080]  like again don't know what the number means
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:50.000]  but um nobody really seems to care about the hell that
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.600]  fair those families are going through in the fear
[2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:57.520]  that it puts in the families but that this is about them
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:03.360]  and the power it gives the children once they understand what the power of an
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:08.160]  accusation is because they're kids but you that's why you tell your kids you
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:10.640]  want to go live in a prison with big fat pedophiles
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:15.120]  you go ahead and talk bad about us and that's what you can do that but i mean
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:19.600]  kids are indoctrinated in school now you know to uh
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:25.200]  to tell everybody anything about anything they don't like except
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:29.600]  don't tell your parents it's only tell me exactly reporters
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:32.000]  well we gotta get out we gotta get rid of the public the government training
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.960]  camps i want to bring up mr broad just briefly because let him go
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:38.640]  he's busy man and then less your your opinion of this
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:41.520]  kem hard who's really you know heading a lot of this up doing a great job
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:44.960]  what what what should they do i'm going to send you the the the retainer
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:48.560]  and we appreciate you uh you know working on the case are you going to call
[2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:52.640]  this um this swamp thing or i mean are you going to call
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:57.680]  this creature uh here in buta uh and try to fair it out what they're doing what
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:41:59.840]  their game plan is they said they'll talk to the lawyer
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:02.960]  they won't tell them anything because they're you know they're just slaves
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:06.080]  uh where all this is going i mean any ideas of how this should progress do
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:09.440]  they go back to their house and wait for them to send the swat team because we
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:11.680]  you know they'll make up false allegations too
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:15.520]  i mean i mean what do they do well first off
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:19.120]  you go back and you let them make the mistake
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:23.040]  that's my home i'm not afraid to be in my home
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:27.200]  i cannot stop the state of texas from doing something illegal
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:30.960]  force them to make the mistake yes i will call cps
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:35.520]  i'll probably get the same answering machine that janet scottin
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:40.000]  but i will call now i talked to her this morning she said she talked to you
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:43.840]  it was yes sir now that uh that i made some phone calls yesterday and they
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:47.200]  looked me up so i mean i think they may want to move on
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:50.080]  like they thought this was a gazelle they found that was a tiger they're
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:53.120]  going to move on to some other little poor family in corner them and which is
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:56.080]  the pain to know this is just going to keep going on
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:59.200]  but i think you're finding out this is kind of a porcupine they tried to eat
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:03.600]  instead of a nice little juicy gazelle which the cps want to do an interview is
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:07.840]  that what's up yep well um you are the
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:11.760]  lawyer and i'm and i'm sure that um i don't mean to
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:17.360]  to step on any toes but um you know if they're going to go back wouldn't you
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:21.600]  potentially also suggest third third-party witnesses upon arrival
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:26.160]  and tape recorders in plain view well obviously tape recorders but the answer
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:27.920]  is there's not going to be an interview
[2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:32.400]  without me present clients aren't talking to him in the fact i'm not talking
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:35.520]  nevermind that's not what i was talking about but
[2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:40.400]  if in fact when they first just show up at the door tape recorder in hand
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:45.440]  yeah so that they are a little bit more uh by the way i even have a little
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:48.880]  digital camera that shoots video give you the big camera i'm gonna give you a
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:52.080]  loan you one of the small cameras it'll shoot for like 30 minutes
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:55.440]  so you can just flip it on and it'll be on camera and record that way you gotta
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:58.960]  have that ready and let them know you know i found in my experience be calm
[2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:01.680]  but focused go look you guys are already in enough trouble
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:04.960]  violating our rights we've got a lawyer we've gone to the dot report you know
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:07.200]  this is all made up you know you told her to lie
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:10.480]  you know you're gonna probably you know be getting our tort letters soon
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.400]  you need to back off or or don't even come to the door i mean i mean what would
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:17.920]  you do sir what would you do kim well first off you
[2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:21.520]  go to the door and the answer is where's your search warrant
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:24.880]  i'm not talking to you where's your search warrant and you say let them make
[2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:27.680]  the mistake i've seen a lot of cases where they'll go ahead and
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:31.120]  especially the nellies will go ahead and and force their way in
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:34.320]  kind of following their stomach they'll kind of just worm in
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:39.200]  how do you deal with that when the when uh when they do that
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:44.640]  the neutral place where you can argue this is a courtroom if it comes to that
[2:44:44.640 --> 2:44:48.800]  you're not going to win with one of these people at the door if they want to
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:53.360]  make the mistake on camera on tape let them make the
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:57.440]  mistake but the answer is where's your search warrant
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.440]  you don't have the right just because your cps and they'll keep banging on the
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:04.240]  screen saying there may be abuse let's not
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:07.360]  you know let's not you know let me in it'll be fine just let me in and then
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:09.840]  it'll be all right you're gonna go to jail if you don't you're gonna go to
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:11.600]  jail and you just and you just say you know that's a
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:15.360]  terrorist threat you know that's a lie i mean what do you say then
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:19.840]  the answer is you're not coming in without a search warrant
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:23.040]  i don't care how long you pound make them go
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:26.800]  and commit to something let them go to the police and say there's abuse going
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:30.800]  on in there what's the probable cause to believe that there's abuse happening
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:38.800]  in my home yeah i think they'll make the mistake
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:42.080]  it's like when you get pulled over on the side of the road by a cop you're not
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:46.480]  going to win there let them write the ticket and go to the courtroom and
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:52.560]  argue it there or hopefully cooler heads will prevail
[2:45:52.560 --> 2:45:58.640]  but no good has ever come in my experience from talking to these idiots
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:02.960]  okay so so what you're saying is you're going to put them on notice they've got
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:06.240]  counsel i'm going to put their phone number out i think that's important
[2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:10.400]  and uh and uh you know from a lot of the experts i've talked to over the years
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:14.080]  and i like your aggressive stance my thing is if you got the time and money
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:18.880]  and and joe's on vacation this week just split uh that way go to the beach or
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:21.040]  something or go to santonia go to the zoo and then
[2:46:21.040 --> 2:46:23.760]  you know they'll usually move on to some other child they want to kidnap
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:27.440]  you know so they can do their horrible stuff the fact that school is not over
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:31.840]  right my sim school is not over up in haze county it's not over down here
[2:46:31.840 --> 2:46:34.640]  so yeah so you think in the next week they try to trump up something she's
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:37.760]  only missed three days of school well what happens when they put her back in
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:40.320]  school and they cops come in and surround her
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:43.200]  and then they show her the letter and they just snatch it out of her hand and
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:46.480]  say you're going to jail unless you say your mommy heard you which is what they
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:49.760]  did and i and you know the people have trouble
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:53.520]  believing this this is what we've seen on countless interrogation videos
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:57.440]  i have no doubt i'm aware of similar instances
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:01.440]  that's why i said you make a laminated card size of a business card have your
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:04.560]  child carried i don't want to say anything without my parent or lawyer being
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:07.600]  present what is this business about them telling her
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:10.160]  you can't have your daughter at your house take her to your mother's is that
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:14.800]  them just trying to take control of the situation absolutely
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:19.840]  absolutely they don't have a right to do that now they have the right to go to
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.360]  court and file a pleading and say there's an emergency and let somebody
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:27.440]  swear what the emergency is had one within the last couple of months in
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:34.640]  galveston where the emergency was the parents refused to talk to cps
[2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:38.720]  well judge promptly said no that's not an emergency
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:42.880]  and no that's not grounds to remove the child
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.880]  the most destructive ones are when they tell one of the parents they have to
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:51.920]  divorce the other that is uh one that's most
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:56.240]  distressing because most people are in no emotional state to deal with
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:00.000]  and it's all about splitting up families it's all about in their handbook
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.360]  oh we're just going to say they're abusive no judge no jury no nothing
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:07.040]  you've just got a divorce i mean i mean next what you got to come to my house
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:10.000]  and cook me a barbecue you know next you got to knit me a
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:13.600]  a placement set i mean you know they're not god
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:17.040]  you know are are you guys familiar with how the family courts got set up to
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:19.920]  carry out racial hygiene eugenics in this country
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:23.920]  i am well the well great god give us your insight because only people
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:26.960]  understand this these are the groups that would come and sterilize you
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:29.840]  forcibly that's how they're outside the constitution
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:34.080]  this is a criminal vestigial thing left over from the hitlerian era
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:38.400]  that has just grown that's right it's like the
[2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:42.160]  syphilis experiments you know gee we're going to pick a class of people that we
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:48.800]  can use as guinea pigs and the it's it's been in
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:51.200]  many many years since i read the stuff on the
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:58.080]  the eugenics and so forth but the the classic abuse to me
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:01.760]  are the black men who had syphilis and anorea
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:05.040]  and who were not treated we're going to see how the diseases progress and they
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:07.520]  told them they were getting treatment and they let them spread it
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:12.240]  yeah but you know now we do this in the context of
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:15.680]  specialized family courts we have 40 courts because
[2:49:15.680 --> 2:49:18.960]  this is where you know we now have abuse courts
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.200]  being set up where the constitution doesn't apply because there was no such
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:25.360]  thing as family court when the constitution was
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:29.600]  meanwhile everywhere teachers now beat students choke them hit them police
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.520]  taser five-year-olds and that's all okay they all have immunity
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:37.680]  trying to keep control of society but then if a parent's kid
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:41.760]  is is running out the street and you spat them boom your kid's gone so that
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:45.920]  big fat pedophiles can you know have their way with them
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:49.840]  but even more than even more than a parent
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:55.440]  thanking a kid i mean a parent can threaten to take away privileges and
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:50:00.000]  if you get the if you get a hypervigilant social worker
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  um you know they believe these accusations and that's right never
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  questioned the child um they never question whether or not the child is
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:13.840]  actually saying something that actually happened to that because they want to
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:17.040]  break up the family well i mean or something that they're putting into
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:20.160]  the kid themselves exactly i forgot that you're not allowed to
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:24.080]  yell at them now but it's not a law they just say we're going to take them
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:27.440]  uh all of the countries are all of the states have
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:30.960]  something the equivalent of the child endangerment statute
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:33.920]  which i call the maybe might have possibly could have
[2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:37.760]  you know unwarranted disciplinary measures this continued over an extended
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:41.360]  period of time might cause damage something along that line
[2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:48.560]  i mean it's ridiculous okay um kim hart um butch brought i want to keep in
[2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:51.600]  contact with both of you i'm going to have i want to have you probably back up

[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:46.160]  with this type of activity so i wanted to bring her up for a few minutes with
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:48.800]  what her advice is we're getting different perspectives
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:53.120]  i have you been filled in rachel on this story i'm sure you've heard it a
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:59.680]  million times yes and we deal with cps and false
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:03.440]  allegations parents being falsely accused of
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:07.360]  sexual abuse or physical abuse or neglect of their children
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:11.280]  and um we we hear these sad stories every day
[2:55:11.280 --> 2:55:15.920]  and it it it's a war against our families
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:18.480]  but you've got to feel good because you're doing good work i don't know how
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:21.120]  these why is they have the highest turnover of any industry
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:24.720]  50 plus percent i've read i mean how do these people do this break people's
[2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:28.080]  rights lie and then they're five times more likely to abuse
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:31.760]  children in cps than anywhere else according to justice department well
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:34.880]  what would you advise them to do because they're not saying what they're you
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:37.840]  know they they strip search their daughter has a little bruise on her
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:41.440]  leg they saw with shorts uh they strip search to try to find
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:44.240]  more there was nothing more it was a little bruise size of a
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.080]  maybe in between a quarter and a nickel clearly from a table you know we've all
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:51.520]  had them she told them that they said over and over again no your mommy did
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:53.520]  this you're going to be in trouble if you don't say
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:56.640]  she said okay my mommy did it but she's on record saying
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:56:01.040]  then they took photos laptop didn't tell her and let her go to gymnastics at the
[2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:04.080]  end of school called her and said come to your house in my experience they
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:06.720]  wanted to come in the house and dig up some dirt or say it was
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:10.160]  neglect or there was dishes or something i mean
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:13.280]  what would you do about this i mean they won't say what they want
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:16.560]  she drove by her place where she was going to meet them there was the cop car
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:19.760]  with the cps what does this sound like
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:25.280]  um it it sounds like they already have it in their head which all of all of them
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:30.400]  do the law enforcement and cps um they always believe the child and if the
[2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:33.440]  child doesn't tell them what they want to hear
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:38.080]  then they they will threaten and intimidate the child
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:44.400]  they see it as the children are victims of abuse and they're set out to prove it
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:49.760]  regardless of any type of evidence or indicia to the contrary
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.880]  now let's be clear though most police aren't involved don't they when from
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:56.880]  what i've seen you're the expert have little special pet police that are part
[2:56:56.880 --> 2:57:01.920]  of the psychosis kind of like the nazis that will go out and violate people
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:05.680]  they do and actually um a lot of the advocacy centers
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:10.080]  where the cps workers um and the forensic interviewers
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:16.480]  are how there are detectives specially assigned to these child abuse cases
[2:57:16.480 --> 2:57:19.920]  and so they they work hand in hand with each other
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:24.960]  so they choose to be there because they like children so much
[2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:28.800]  okay uh so where should they go from here in your opinion
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:33.600]  well um with with the instance that you're talking about right now
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:36.960]  it sounds to me like the family needs to have
[2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:41.520]  um very strong and vigorous defense against cps because
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:45.360]  the child needs to be protected against the foster system there's horrendous
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:49.200]  things that happen to these children when they're removed from a family and
[2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:53.360]  placed into oftentimes dangerous environments
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:58.960]  um that are funded by the state and the the parents need to have legal
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:02.880]  representation to to protect themselves against any
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:07.600]  criminal um charges that may come forward and also so they don't lose their
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:09.680]  family and then this and of course the system
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:13.040]  has an incentive to defend these heartable warrants where they keep
[2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:16.160]  children where they routinely die we're back in seventy seconds stay there i
[2:58:16.160 --> 2:58:17.840]  want to do five more minutes with you to get
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:21.040]  more advice i mean cps wants to meet they want to come to the house
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:24.000]  should they go back and stay at their house say no bring a warrant or bring a
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:27.200]  protective order should they wait uh should they
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:30.800]  i mean what should they do your perspective on this as an expert who's
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:33.840]  you know been involved in hundreds of these cases attorney at law
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:38.480]  rachel wimbish with us as they try to kidnap young hailey out of our office

[2:59:56.400 --> 3:00:01.200]  alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:13.600]  coming up in the next segment i'm going to give you the phone numbers to these
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:16.880]  wicked creatures there are child kidnappers everywhere
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:20.240]  claim they have immunity operating hitler and i always had to go back to
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:23.040]  hitler but hitler operated in the san eugenics
[3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:27.440]  program that set up the family courts he got it from the u.s and england
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:31.040]  and the first people they killed the first people they put in death camps
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:34.640]  the first people that they shut down the first were
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:37.760]  were family they say oh you're not fit to have your child oh we're going to
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:40.800]  euthanize your child or you know you get a letter back oh your child died to
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:44.560]  cps custody and then they put more than two-thirds
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:47.520]  of the kids on socket tropics a lot of die from the drugs they put them on
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:50.400]  and then they go before the state and taxes and say they have bad gene pools
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:54.160]  we have that on video in endgame going back uh to
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:57.680]  rachel wimbush rachel what do you think they should do then
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:01.200]  you know hearing this i mean do they go and i know you're not taking the case
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:04.400]  you're just what you would do you know if if you had this case would you go
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:07.040]  back home would you wait would you stay away
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:10.560]  uh you know would you have a lawyer contact the cps and say what is this
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:13.360]  about you know how far have you gone they wouldn't talk to me they said we'll
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:16.320]  talk to her or lawyer but when she then talks to them they won't talk to her
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:19.680]  they just say come meet us come meet us
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:23.840]  they don't need to do anything right now um they've already
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:29.040]  experienced how cps works and where cps is going with this
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:35.520]  and if if they don't have basis to remove the children um and and there's not
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:40.000]  an emergency right now um cps can't do anything and so they do
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:44.080]  not need to cooperate they need to have an independent
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:48.880]  defense um attorney represent them and have
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:52.240]  independent evaluations of everything that's going on
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:57.040]  and not cooperate with cps because cps already has it in their mind what
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:00.880]  they're doing and what they're going after
[3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:04.880]  and if they show up at their house if they don't have a warrant they don't
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:08.320]  have to let them in they don't have to talk with them
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:11.520]  and it's it's advisable that they don't because
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:17.760]  um cps and the the advocacy center everybody that that works um
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:21.920]  in this whole industry they lie incessantly
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:25.040]  yes and and they're all on each other's food chain
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:29.200]  and um you know their careers are based on what about school
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:35.200]  what if they grab her at school unfortunately um you know they they come
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:39.280]  in and speak with children all the time at school without notifying the parents
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.120]  as they're required to do um within a certain period of time after speaking
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.600]  with the children um but the the girls should just
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:53.360]  not say anything and say i i want you to call my parents i want to you to speak
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:56.240]  with my attorney
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:02.080]  absolutely because right now the way that cps is headed and we see
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:05.120]  this all the time in all of our other cases as well
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:08.640]  um they've already got it in their head where they're going
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:14.000]  and just trying to cooperate with them is only going to make things worse and
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:18.800]  until um the the family stands up and and fights
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:22.480]  and and makes cps work and prove their case
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:27.200]  there there's absolutely nothing uh that will stop these people and so
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:30.880]  they need a defense attorney to to defend them
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:35.760]  against cps and and this barrage
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:39.680]  well um you're you're up in the dallas foreworth area
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:43.520]  yes we um as stucco in furguson we represent
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:49.600]  families all across the state of texas in cps cases as well as um criminal
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:53.680]  cases that arise out of false allegations of child abuse or
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:57.520]  false allegations of child sexual abuse because have you heard of butch
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:00.480]  have you heard of attorney butch brought out of houston
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:07.040]  no i have not yeah he got recommended no he just got rid of stucco has
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:10.880]  has heard of him before paul is the the founding partner here
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:13.760]  no i'm just trying to figure out who we should get in austin or what we should
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:16.960]  do for them or who should talk to these creatures i mean
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:21.200]  uh would it be good to have a lawyer call the uh call the
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:25.520]  child grabber and and and try to ascertain you know where they're at or
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:30.160]  or like send a letter a you know uh you know overnight delivery to the school

[3:08:12.880 --> 3:08:15.600]  you know there's all this world news going on around us i'm gonna cover that
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:19.360]  coming up in a few minutes but fundamentally the state all over the
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:22.720]  western world is publicly waging war against the family
[3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:26.000]  they'll pay poor black mother's money not just not have men in the house and
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:30.080]  break the family down from 10% in legitimacy to over 90% now
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  they see the family as a disease and they want to break it down they've done a
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:36.960]  pretty good job the families are all screwed up breaking down society's
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:40.880]  breaking down the state will be the only buoy then we can come to them and they
[3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:48.480]  can euthanize us they can carry out their eugenics Rachel Wimbush
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:51.520]  you know i finally you talked to my personal
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:54.880]  lawyer Eric tab and one of his partners is a family court
[3:08:54.880 --> 3:08:58.000]  lawyer and we're talking to him now we've talked to
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.160]  brought we're talking to you another stuff moves so quick i guess that's the
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:04.880]  problem were they planning to meet her at the
[3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:08.080]  house with the police and we confirmed that was going on
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:12.400]  to force their way in to find some dog hair dirty dishes they call that neglect
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:15.840]  or to interrogate her and to get her to break down
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:20.800]  and i know they love to sneak attack uh i mean is it good that she didn't meet
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:24.400]  with them yeah because anything that she says
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:29.280]  to them they're just going to turn around and twist it and use it against her
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:33.920]  we've seen numerous times where cps workers have lied on the stand
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:37.520]  they have perjured themselves and the state since they're a part of the state
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:40.560]  and a part of this whole child favor industry
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:46.160]  does not prosecute their own people when they lie and fabricate facts
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:53.120]  and if they go to her house unless they have a warrant to enter into her home
[3:09:53.120 --> 3:09:56.800]  she does not have to let them in and in fact cooperating
[3:09:56.800 --> 3:10:01.760]  and letting them in to take pictures to take pictures of her children to to
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:05.760]  look at the house to see if there's a stain on the carpet
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:08.880]  all of that will be used against her to say that um
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:12.800]  the home was in substandard living conditions um
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:15.600]  you know the children are being neglected they'll even look in the
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:20.240]  refrigerator the pantry um cooperating with these people and
[3:10:20.240 --> 3:10:24.080]  meeting with these people without a vigorous defense attorney
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:29.280]  with the client to represent her and to do the talking for her
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:33.040]  is is just suicide basically because these people
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:37.040]  are not on the the side of saving families and keeping
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:41.600]  families together despite what their um you know their statement on the
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.120]  the department's website is no not to keep families together
[3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:48.480]  they are the progeny of the soviet union in aci germany they are literally the
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:51.760]  scum of the earth they are and their theory is dividing
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:55.360]  conquer we see it all the time they believe the children
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:10:59.760]  and and in the cases of like uh sexually they believe the children they
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:04.080]  make the children do it of course they say you will say this or you're in
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:07.760]  trouble i mean what you know these are evil people
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.800]  exactly and they they don't understand that that children can actually be
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:15.920]  especially in custody battles we see it a lot um
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:20.160]  children are manipulated into making false allegations against
[3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:26.240]  the other party the the other parent and um they don't work to see well maybe
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:30.560]  somebody has an axe to grind maybe there's a vendetta and if the parent
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:34.560]  doesn't believe their child because of of some reason
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:38.000]  well you know maybe my kids lying maybe my kids saying this to get out of
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.600]  trouble maybe my kids doing this for attention because
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:45.120]  at school they've been watching the good touch and bad touch videos
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:49.680]  um then they go after the parent they we see it all the time they actually will
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:53.600]  divide families and pit them against that's like that's like sexual
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:57.040]  education it turns out makes them have more sex or makes them tattle
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:00.960]  makeup stuff um it's proven they have death education about don't commit
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:04.240]  suicide by putting this around your neck and then the kids commit suicide
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:07.680]  you know they know what they're doing and they sit there and they teach them how
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:10.880]  to do all of this and the public schools are federalized
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:14.400]  they are a complete reeducation camps is what i call them
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:18.640]  and uh well we'll be in contact rachel wimbush i'm very impressed
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:22.480]  by your information and what you're saying and i guess we've just got a
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:27.360]  um you know try to you know figure all this out and
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:30.560]  and figure out i mean i mean do they put their portable daughter what does she
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:36.560]  have a school next wednesday yeah june 2nd what is june 2nd next wednesday
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:39.760]  tuesday i believe tuesday i mean i i mean do they put her back in the
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:44.560]  government reeducation center so they can you know be predators on her
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:47.760]  or do we send you know a registered letter like keep her out till that gets
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:51.680]  there like thursday or friday and then let the school be on notice
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:12:54.800]  that you're not to talk to her you're not to do this because i just talked to my
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:57.280]  family court lawyer from my high-powered eric tab
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:00.560]  lawyer you know and and he said the same thing that they're saying
[3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:04.960]  that they made a big deals to the strip search and a big boo boo
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:10.800]  a big no no uh with uh not notifying you on monday and then sending cops in
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:13.680]  tuesday uh i have a chance to talk to him a mic in the
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:18.720]  office was uh rachel any comments on that well um they
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:22.640]  anytime that the cps comes out and speaks with the children or takes
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:26.480]  pictures at the schools they do have to um
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:30.080]  notify the parents afterwards at at the minimum
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:34.000]  but the problem with the schools these days is that they're mandatory
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.160]  reporters and so it's often a pass the buck type deal
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:43.200]  where if they see a bruise instead of asking the child what happened or even
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:46.320]  calling the parents and talking to the parents and say hey you know i'm
[3:13:46.320 --> 3:13:50.560]  concerned is everything okay they immediately call cps cps comes out
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:55.600]  paralyzes the children takes pictures and and constantly asked
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:13:58.800]  you know were you abused and and children know if
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:03.600]  if if you give the truthful answer and an adult is questioning you an authority
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:06.880]  figures questioning you and they give you a look
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:11.920]  or a tone of their voice indicates that they're not satisfied with your answer
[3:14:11.920 --> 3:14:15.920]  children eventually will change the answer to get this person to go away
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:18.800]  oh no that's exactly i mean i mean let's say i'm talking to a girl girl and i
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:23.760]  say did you see a green alligator back there in the swimming pool no i
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:27.520]  did you see a green alligator no you're in trouble if you don't tell me they
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:31.360]  actually said to uh hailey you're in trouble
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:35.120]  if you don't tell me the truth and she said okay i i guess she did
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:38.640]  i mean these people are sick they're working when
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:42.560]  and when they interview children they are supposed to be recording
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:46.240]  the conversation if they're talking with children alone
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:51.520]  without the parents there and if if they threatened her like this then that
[3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:57.680]  worker needs to be held personally liable for for intimidating this child
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:01.120]  you know what she's saying that lady's name was heather and then we don't know

[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:18.240]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[3:33:01.920 --> 3:33:10.800]  you know jessie ventura has been all over radio and tv lately and i

[3:33:43.280 --> 3:33:47.680]  much of the big yes coming up later in the week uh into next week i got a big
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:51.520]  news blitz coming up here big stacks of news i haven't even gotten to yet we
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:54.960]  will cover that um got off track today for three and a
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:58.080]  half hours because of what's happening to somebody here in my office with cps
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:05.200]  we already had this guest set up separately uh with what cps is doing
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:09.200]  diane miller national health freedom dot org
[3:34:09.200 --> 3:34:12.080]  she's a minnesota attorney who successfully helped to defend a minnesota
[3:34:12.080 --> 3:34:15.120]  farmer from charges of practice of medicine that elizons all this other
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:18.720]  stuff and there's all these cases where they'll give they'll grab kids do
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:21.920]  chemotherapy and then kill the kids with the
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:25.920]  chemotherapy there's a texas case we covered last year
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:29.280]  and they finally won in court we're sitting like
[3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:32.400]  christian science but but if you don't have your rights to not do stuff and you
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:34.480]  have no rights and they can force vaccines on you
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:37.520]  this is cases where they admit the chemo won't even help
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:43.520]  and then they still do it uh this uh in this case has gotten national attention
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:48.560]  fact here it is on fox news just came out today father asked mom 13 year old boy
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:52.640]  resisting chemo to come home uh so we're talking right now to
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:56.320]  diane miller diane what's the latest on this case
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:34:59.120]  the latest is that the dad does not know where the mom and
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:04.240]  and youth are and um they are did not appear at the hearing yesterday where
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:09.760]  they were going to be discussing um how he would comply with the
[3:35:09.760 --> 3:35:15.600]  recommendations of a pediatric oncologist that does conventional care
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:19.120]  and and and what is your relationship to this case
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:23.200]  i am the national director for national health freedom coalition we've been
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:27.360]  um informally advising on the health freedom issues involved in the case
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:30.640]  for those that don't know the case uh can you specifically just boil it down for
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:35.120]  people um a child was a diagnosed from family
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:39.440]  physicians sent to a pediatric oncologist at children's hospital they
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:44.400]  recommended chemotherapy parents did not want to do it but they
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:48.400]  agreed to do a first round and uh the first round
[3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:53.760]  was severe complications the child uh was ended up in the hospital for 11 days
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:35:58.240]  with a large blood clot under his arm and up to his heart
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:01.760]  and couldn't walk and came home and
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:06.240]  rehabilitated for a couple weeks doing alternative health care and the
[3:36:06.240 --> 3:36:10.320]  uh didn't want to go back to the rest of the chemotherapy and got a second
[3:36:10.320 --> 3:36:13.360]  opinion second opinion said do conventional care
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:17.760]  and uh they reported him to child protection when the parents did not
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:20.880]  bring him back for the second round so even when you get a second opinion
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:24.640]  which the other cases they get from medical doctors they say we don't care
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:28.800]  and you know i had a dog got cancer they gave it one chemo shot he quit breathing
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:32.880]  and died within 10 minutes and and i know my oh everybody else i know
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:35.680]  a lot of times they find cancers aren't really cancers and they
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:38.560]  wipe them out with this stuff this is quite an industry
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:42.480]  uh and so uh you know they don't want it but i guess they
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:47.040]  and so where is this going now well um they put a war note for the mother and
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:50.960]  the child um to find them uh so that they can
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:54.320]  in the county without the mother or child present
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:58.080]  transferred custody to brown county so that uh
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:02.800]  once they find the child the county would uh force the issue
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:05.840]  so there hell been on killing this little boy tell us about him
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:10.880]  yeah and and the media is not carrying the uh defense um we had dr norm
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:14.400]  shealy testifying he said that personally himself he you couldn't give him a
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:17.360]  trillion dollars to take chemotherapy and discuss
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:24.640]  the side effects the efficacy and the um political um holding of the
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:28.240]  chemotherapy and these aren't just families saying no medical doctors
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:31.920]  all over saying it's basically rat poison and kills you doesn't
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:35.360]  help you they don't they don't care how many medical
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:38.720]  doctors you've got the state says we're going to practice medicine
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:42.560]  the kid dies right and the lies in most states say that
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:45.920]  if doctors say anything outside of the recommended
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:50.160]  uh prevailing and accepted standards of care they can lose their license so
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:54.160]  basically in the united states there's a gag order on cancer cures
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:57.920]  yeah i knew about that it's just unbelievable um so where
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:01.440]  so so the families disappeared though they're they're not gonna i mean i
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:03.920]  guess they are extremists they don't want to kill their son
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:07.280]  right they don't want to kill their son they don't they don't want to kill
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:10.880]  their son that's basically what's going on they're very well educated
[3:38:10.880 --> 3:38:14.240]  in alternative health there they had a high learning curve
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:17.760]  they're researching everything they can get their hands on they're
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:21.200]  looking at other clinics they're doing all kinds of stuff to figure out
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:25.120]  how best to bring their son back in a state of wellness without
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:28.800]  uh giving him a toxic lethal substance you know i printed it and i couldn't
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:31.840]  find it in my stack from last night a girl from corpus christie we had her
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:35.280]  on like a year ago and they grabbed her she was fine gave her
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:39.520]  chemotherapy almost killed her they fought and finally won in court
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:43.280]  uh what's her name um corpus christie
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:47.040]  uh i forget but the point is i've got it here in the stack
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:52.400]  but i mean they there are some in the oklahoma lily rot case
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:56.640]  lily went to switzerland to a hospital that united states tried to extradite her
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:59.520]  back to the united states for a second ryan of chemo because the first one
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:03.440]  almost killed her so they left and the swiss doctors would not let her go
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:06.080]  because they said the amount of chemo that they would have given that child
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:11.360]  would be child abuse in switzerland yeah it's totally sick i i know they
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:14.240]  abuse children and then call it abuse not abusing them
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:17.440]  for those that don't know ma'am uh you know researching this and the doctors
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:20.480]  you've had testifying tell folks what chemo is
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:23.040]  because i mean they love it they can charge ten thousand bucks for a bottle
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:26.240]  of raid i mean explain to people how this how
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:30.640]  why this is is is a mafia right the cost of the first round of
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:33.680]  diagnostics and the chemo and one round was 92
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:37.520]  thousand dollars and if a thousand people die of cancer every day in this
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:40.880]  country and you know that most of them take chemo it's just a billion
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:44.480]  dollar industry that's pumping money in every day
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:50.320]  the drugs that they give usually target uh cancer cells they kill
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:55.040]  developing cells some drugs kill all cells and then they hope that enough
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:39:58.720]  cancer cells get killed that the person eventually survives and builds their
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:02.000]  own immune system but the problem is that
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:05.360]  most chemotherapies don't target a particular
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:08.560]  cell so it's killing your immune system off
[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:12.800]  in general yeah and in fact most a lot i know a lot of people now dying of
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:15.520]  blood diseases and you know they're dying five years
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:18.800]  after they took chemo right it is totally fragile blood
[3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:22.400]  yep they get they get heart failure they get thyroid problem
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:26.560]  sterilization and they have a very high risk of getting leukemia and other
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:30.960]  blood discrepancies after they have chemotherapy rounds
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:36.560]  so that the in our opinion the parents are being extremely responsible in this
[3:40:36.560 --> 3:40:40.000]  case they're they are like the opposite of neglect
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:43.520]  they are empowered they're critical thinkers they're doing the best they
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:47.120]  can to an do the analysis of what they want for their child and that's what
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:50.640]  we want in america and it's being totally trashed by
[3:40:50.640 --> 3:40:54.240]  imposing a conventional standard of care
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:59.600]  basically the research drug companies do their own research projects then they
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:03.520]  promote their drugs and they say this is was promoted for a cure
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:07.600]  and they say you don't have the numbers for your other natural remedies so it
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:11.280]  doesn't work and they're basically arguing that
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:14.960]  because you don't have big double-blind studies or
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:19.760]  or clinical trials that you can't do it it's not though as you know you're an
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:23.280]  expert in this that's phase one now they've been kind of defeated so they're
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:26.880]  now patenting fish oil and patenting vitamin c and
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:29.920]  trying to then make governments where we can't have it over the counter where
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:34.480]  we've got to then go pay $92,000 from them for some vitamin b12
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:37.760]  that's right they're going after the dietary supplement
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:41.280]  going chipping away at that for sure they're trying to do it slowly so that
[3:41:41.280 --> 3:41:45.600]  we don't have a huge outcry so they just do one little thing at a time
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:49.600]  that doesn't create enough you know so we're taking a resolution
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:54.720]  forward in in this fall on the codex issues and and that to stop some of that
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:57.120]  all right well Diane we really appreciate you joining us and you're a great
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:41:59.440]  guest I want to have you back up for a full hour in the future we're sorry for
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:02.480]  moving you earlier I have CPS trying to kidnap one of my employees
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:05.040]  daughters for absolutely no reason script searching or
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:09.360]  everything it's total insanity but how do we help this little boy I guess
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:12.400]  there's nothing we can do they just hopefully the parents
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:14.560]  can hide him before the kidnappers get him
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:18.080]  all right well the biggest thing I think is that this case is so
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:21.440]  constitutional that there should be appeals going an amicus briefs and
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:25.600]  whatever and the attorney's law firm taking this case that took the case
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:29.600]  is a very small law firm with two attorneys the lead attorney on it is
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:32.960]  Calvin Johnson the one that did the farmer case with me 15 years ago
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:36.320]  so you can support that law firm so that they can get
[3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:40.240]  another person on this case full-time then we can really
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:43.520]  take it all the way where it's supposed to go and sure I mean I ran into
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:47.120]  precedent just last night in Texas there was a state court
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:52.880]  in the case this little girl and in fact I was googling fight cps
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:56.400]  and found that article like I've had so many guests on I forget them all
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.560]  last night and I can't find it guys a tight corpus christie girl
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:04.240]  doesn't want chemo and that should pull her up because I want to show people on
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:08.400]  screen yeah and well the thing is she won her case when I
[3:43:08.400 --> 3:43:12.960]  had her on like a year and a half ago she was battling and she was fine and
[3:43:12.960 --> 3:43:15.440]  then they gave her the chemo and almost killed her you know they kidnapped her
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:17.840]  gave her chemo they got an injunction got her back
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:21.040]  and now it's a year and a half later and she's doing better her hair grew back
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:24.320]  but there's still hell been on going back to court trying to get her
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:28.560]  so folks folks can go to nationalhealthfreedom.org
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:33.600]  uh no that's not it uh yeah that's a girl with cancer taken from her parents
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:36.880]  yeah corpus christie girl
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:41.600]  okay I don't know that's it well I'll try it's in my stack I'll try to dig it out
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:45.120]  we had Billy best at the trial but the judge won't let him testify he ran away
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:49.920]  from chemotherapy and did uh 714x was just on the fountain canada
[3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:53.840]  and he's fine today and it was 10 years ago oh tell folks that story briefly then
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:58.240]  yeah Billy best is a teenager that ran away from chemotherapy he wrote a book
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:02.800]  uh the boy who ran away from chemotherapy he was at the trial the other day
[3:44:02.800 --> 3:44:07.360]  he's a a native american and he they tried to force chemotherapy
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:11.360]  and um he his father eventually found him and
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:15.360]  and got him across the border into canada and he went to the 714x castone
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:20.160]  naissance clinic and uh got well and now is
[3:44:20.160 --> 3:44:24.160]  promoting his book and speaking and the judge would not let him testify
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:27.600]  total filth irrelevant yeah irrelevant that uh
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:30.640]  yeah what what was the treatments they gave him that were successful
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:34.400]  714x is an immune treatment uh customized
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:39.200]  for um cancer in canada
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:45.120]  wow but of course we can't have that right all over the world are using 714x
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:47.760]  and we can't have it right and then when billy
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:51.360]  came back to the united states and he wanted to get his 714x they stopped
[3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:55.200]  all the shipments at the border of canada and united states so he had to
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:01.280]  always go up there and get them so he lived uh meagerly for forever
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:06.480]  and and still just you know it's it's just
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:11.200]  hard to be in a courtroom for him and to watch the same thing happening to other
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:14.160]  you well yeah because the globalists want globalism
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:17.760]  so if a nation develops a cure they can go in and shut that down
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:20.960]  that's what the new world order is all about eugenics have you discovered that
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:24.720]  in your research i i have personally not
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:28.480]  through the national health freedom coalition but my personal
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:32.240]  uh views on that resonate very much with your radio show
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:35.680]  all right well diane you're a wonderful person folks can find a link to that law
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:40.160]  firm at nationalhealthfreedom.org thank you thank you so much for all your work
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:44.560]  no no god bless you good to have you on with us um
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:48.720]  folks you know i'm not gonna apologize for doing three and a half hours on cps
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:52.080]  today because it's a huge scourge and i've thought a lot of times about doing
[3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:56.400]  whole show specials where we just focus in on one issue
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:01.360]  i've done some of those on 9 11 and other things in the past uh
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:04.160]  when i talked to this little girl yesterday haley and i'm gonna do a news
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:07.760]  blitzer in a moment and take some calls i may be going to overdrive the day
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:10.000]  because well i gotta talk to the law firms
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  um that's another frustration i can't cover all the evil
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:18.320]  uh i can't even explain all the evil much less fight it all i mean i
[3:46:18.320 --> 3:46:20.560]  you know
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:24.960]  but i'm telling you it's the system it's the judges and it's the government
[3:46:24.960 --> 3:46:28.960]  people and it's it's the lazy society going along
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:32.560]  with this i mean they put cancer viruses in your vaccines folks it's on record
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:36.160]  they brag and write books about it it's real funny to them
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:40.080]  and they got these dumb judges who will die cancer themselves getting flu
[3:46:40.080 --> 3:46:42.240]  shots everywhere they're not part of the conspiracy
[3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:45.840]  they just know they get reelected in the foundations give them money
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:46:51.120]  and the um lobbyists give them money if they do all this evil
[3:46:51.120 --> 3:46:54.320]  and they kind of spread the risk they all do a little piece of the evil they all
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:46:56.880]  kind of kind of like they sell derivatives and then triple
[3:46:56.880 --> 3:47:00.560]  certify them and have insurance companies certify them and they sell
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:03.760]  those certifications as as derivatives you know
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:08.560]  it's like just a whole it's like enron a bunch of criminals kind of all
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:12.320]  plausibly denying what they're doing and this goes on
[3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:15.120]  and i mean i couldn't sleep last night i mean getting the point where i can't
[3:47:15.120 --> 3:47:18.160]  eat i'm in the point where i can't sleep i kept
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:21.920]  waking up because i mean i care about these kids i care about there's
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:26.480]  nothing more important than families and they say families yelling at each
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:28.880]  other they'll take your kids that's not against the law that's what everybody
[3:47:28.880 --> 3:47:33.840]  does look at the dysfunctional the government is a million times worse
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:36.800]  and look the truth is the truth when i tell you that when i've gone and
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:40.560]  confronted cps and fought them it's always a bunch of pot belly
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:44.560]  pedophile types a bunch of nilly pedophiles and i'm sick of you bastards
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:48.560]  i mean i hope you go straight to hell i'm sorry to talk like that for everybody
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:52.320]  but i mean that's what i think i'm gonna say it
[3:47:53.680 --> 3:47:56.960]  i want to bring you down bad
[3:47:56.960 --> 3:48:00.960]  i mean i'd give my life to bring you people down and i and i don't care what
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:04.880]  the media does to me i don't care how i'm attacked i don't care what goes on
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:07.760]  i'm not afraid of any of you and i'm committed to the end
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:10.880]  i'm committed to this and i'm asking god for providence
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:13.760]  i know there's a lot of good people out there i know there are there's a lot
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:15.040]  more than there were and
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:19.840]  saw them in gemora and i'm asking god to give me the help and give the listeners
[3:48:19.840 --> 3:48:24.080]  the help to fight these people and even if you don't believe in god you're
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:27.600]  some atheist i mean is it okay to let the government plan control freak and
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:30.640]  violate the bill rights the constitution is it bad too i mean is
[3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:34.560]  everything bad you know live free or die folks because
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:38.080]  there's no point in living as a slave but if you have the attitude you're ready
[3:48:38.080 --> 3:48:41.760]  to die for freedom you're then you'll have freedom but if you cower you're
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:44.320]  going to lose it
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:48.240]  you know here i'm telling this family i'm saying i'm not going to tell you what
[3:48:48.240 --> 3:48:51.920]  to do but i'm advising you
[3:48:51.920 --> 3:48:55.200]  to stand up and fight these people and they did the right thing
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:57.920]  but most people don't have the courage to do that you notice all the lawyers
[3:48:57.920 --> 3:49:01.600]  agree with what i told him yesterday does that mean it's it's the perfectly
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:04.000]  safe course no nothing is only look at this news
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:07.120]  corporate media exploits teen idol to push cyber bullying bill

[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:40.560]  member who was criticizing the government so they grabbed him i think nine
[3:50:40.560 --> 3:50:43.280]  years later they're still forcibly drugging him with any psychotics
[3:50:43.280 --> 3:50:47.360]  he's like a vegetable now no judge no jury no arrest
