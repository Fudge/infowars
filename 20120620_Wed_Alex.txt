[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:22.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.360 --> 00:35.320]  Here we are, Wednesday, the 20th day of June, 2012, you're listening on the radio.
[00:35.320 --> 00:38.760]  We are simulcast on XM-166 over 100 AM and FM.
[00:38.760 --> 00:45.960]  If you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, you see some skulls sitting over here on the desk.
[00:45.960 --> 00:52.800]  You will find out why these skulls are sitting on my desk next Monday during the syndicated
[00:52.800 --> 00:53.800]  radio broadcast.
[00:53.800 --> 00:55.440]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:55.440 --> 01:02.160]  That is a real human skull right there, and that is a real 65 million, 65 million year
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.960]  old, they say, crocodile skull from the era of the dinosaurs.
[01:07.960 --> 01:17.400]  So there it is, and I will explain all of these items, the petrified wood, the calcified
[01:17.400 --> 01:29.720]  fossil of a nautilus, and we'll explain all of this coming up on Monday.
[01:29.720 --> 01:33.080]  The toilet paper sitting next to it has nothing to do with it.
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.120]  We have a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[01:40.120 --> 01:46.440]  Joining us from Rio de Janeiro, site of the World Government New World Order Conference.
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.680]  Mark Moreno in the last 30 minutes of the third hour will give us a breakdown from the
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.160]  scene of the crime.
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.200]  Here's the cnsnews.com headline, and they have the video of it.
[01:57.200 --> 02:03.200]  UN official, Western nations quote, don't need more cars, more TVs, whatever.
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.400]  Need to pay that to the United Nations as if shutting down the economy is going to help
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.600]  the third world when it does the opposite.
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.880]  We're going to be looking at medical crimes and all these attempts to ban soft drinks,
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.720]  popcorn, milk, spreading from New York, not just in New York City now, with Dr. Peter
[02:17.720 --> 02:21.880]  Glidden, a very popular guest when he had his maiden voyage with us a few months ago.
[02:21.880 --> 02:24.160]  He is going to be joining us.
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.680]  Now first off though today, a lot of times you're on somebody's radio show, you're on
[02:28.680 --> 02:35.560]  a TV show and the truth slaps you upside the head, how big it is, hidden in plain view
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.280]  and the fact that we have not made a big enough deal about this subject.
[02:41.280 --> 02:49.080]  And you'll remember last year, the FEMA camp special that I had in my hands all in of all
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.240]  the shows I consulted on and appeared in with conspiracy theory, top show on true TV with
[02:53.240 --> 02:54.880]  Jesse Ventura.
[02:54.880 --> 03:00.800]  That show, I'd say I was 85, 90% of the research, I mean that was my baby and it sent Homeland
[03:00.800 --> 03:08.760]  Security into a conniption fit, a conniption fit over the reeducation camps, the Emergency
[03:08.760 --> 03:15.080]  Centers Establishment Act and I've gotten calls from program directors and I've gotten
[03:15.080 --> 03:20.160]  calls from listeners but I've been so busy it's just feedback that sometimes when we
[03:20.160 --> 03:27.360]  talk about FEMA camps and give out names that the satellite has an EAS takeover system in
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.760]  it, so do some of the more advanced EAS systems at broadcast towers.
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.720]  Most of them are radio controlled, some are wireless digital now and they're breaking
[03:35.720 --> 03:43.160]  in there with NSA keyword software listening for keywords and then they scramble.
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.400]  They scramble the show.
[03:45.400 --> 03:53.360]  So I go on Mankal's radio show today and he's listening right now via ISDN and I go
[03:53.360 --> 04:02.160]  on his radio show and a lot of the same stations carry my show, carry his show and he was talking
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.120]  about how every time he talks about FEMA camps and emergency centers or Jesse Ventura
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.320]  censored show, that's a topic he's really into every week I'm on, he seems to bring
[04:12.320 --> 04:17.400]  it up because he understands how big it is that it's confirmed that Time Warner was
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.000]  visited by Homeland Security, it's confirmed they didn't re-air that show when they normally
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.760]  re-air them about 50 times over the year, it's confirmed that they went in and remotely
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.760]  erased the Teavos.
[04:28.760 --> 04:35.600]  I mean I was sent Time Warner executives gave me the orders saying that it was going to
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.120]  be taken down, I mean I was given stuff where regional people were told when you get calls
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.560]  about this, we've remotely erased it under orders from the government.
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.200]  So they don't want you knowing about this, we're going to break it down with the program
[04:48.200 --> 04:54.000]  director on air and Jesse Ventura with an interview that Mankal just did, he's going
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.680]  to premiere here, he did it off air when he finished his show and we're going to get
[04:57.680 --> 05:27.600]  into drones, big developments.
[05:27.600 --> 05:34.600]  We're going to get into drones, big developments, big developments, big developments, big developments,
[05:57.600 --> 05:59.600]  4 Less Guarantee

[06:22.520 --> 06:26.920]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[06:28.720 --> 06:32.800]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most

[08:08.080 --> 08:13.440]  We're live blasting out world why we're gonna have an incredibly jam-packed transmission today
[08:13.440 --> 08:19.520]  Susstrap yourselves in you found at the front lines of the fight for human liberty worldwide against tyranny
[08:19.520 --> 08:23.260]  I'm your host Alex Jones. It is the 20th day of June
[08:23.880 --> 08:25.880]  2012 on this Wednesday
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.960]  Transmission and I'll tell you about the guest and everything that's coming up here in just a moment first off
[08:31.960 --> 08:38.160]  Here's some of the headlines at info wars.com Ron Paul. There's no way. I'm endorsing Romney
[08:38.160 --> 08:45.360]  That's breaking at info wars.com in the featured news section right now
[08:45.560 --> 08:49.720]  He says he has the delegates, but he doesn't have the hearts and the minds of the people
[08:50.080 --> 08:56.160]  Yeah, I see nothing, but Obama stickers only see a few of those. I've never seen a Romney sticker
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  Richard Reeves has seen one in Dallas
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.440]  That would help him if he tried to choose Rand Paul as his running mate might excite people
[09:03.440 --> 09:11.280]  But might also alienate Ron Paul supporters continuing here when will we attack Syria another article by Ron Paul at info wars.com?
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.960]  Also Romney Builderburg pick Rubio being vetted for VP
[09:18.600 --> 09:24.520]  Continuing and we've got the interview yesterday with Daniel Estel in the great game with author Daniel Estel in breaking down world events
[09:24.520 --> 09:26.520]  The latest intel from inside Builderburg
[09:26.520 --> 09:35.240]  Also, US Israel deployed flame computer virus the slow Iranian nuclear efforts official say and flame is connected to Stuxnet
[09:35.880 --> 09:39.840]  Well, of course that was from the US and Israel. We told you that last year
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.120]  But oh, they'll probably get a Pulitzer prize at the Washington Post for breaking this
[09:44.760 --> 09:46.560]  What a joke
[09:46.560 --> 09:54.360]  Continuing will Russia and Chinese military forces on Syrian soil prevent Obama from bombing Syria another big article on that front and a
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.760]  Very important story that I'll cover with Mark Moreno from Rio de Janeiro
[09:59.880 --> 10:08.560]  Where they're openly the UN is saying don't let people have cars TVs and quote whatever and in Mexico and Canada are invited to join the secret of TPP
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.880]  SPP negotiations for the North American Union that is all coming up today first off ladies and gentlemen
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.600]  We're gonna cover this in detail in the third hour today ahead of Mark Moreno joining us
[10:21.600 --> 10:25.800]  This is big. In fact, it's up at info wars calm
[10:25.800 --> 10:28.520]  But the place that's really covering it is drudge report calm
[10:28.520 --> 10:30.520]  You guys put that on screen for me. Thank you
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.800]  And again, if you're a radio listener on XM 166 or on AM and FM as you go, what do you mean put it on screen?
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.280]  We're also simulcasting video feed
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.480]  At
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.800]  Prison planet dot TV and then later it's archived as well at prison planet dot TV the full archive then later leaks out as we want it to
[10:50.800 --> 10:53.920]  all over the internet and our YouTube channel, but
[10:55.080 --> 10:57.920]  Look at the photo at drudge report calm privilege
[10:59.280 --> 11:00.680]  Privilege
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.000]  Obama declares executive privilege. Is that the same privilege where he tells Congress?
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.640]  They don't have the power of the purse or that the UN gives him orders for war now
[11:09.680 --> 11:12.640]  The president doesn't have privilege to commit crimes
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.160]  Is did Jerry Sandusky have privilege to molest children?
[11:17.160 --> 11:23.920]  Did Hitler have the privilege to line people up and shoot him even though he said he did know he didn't and we'll go over
[11:24.600 --> 11:32.560]  Some of those headlines there as this is breaking as we speak Obama refuses to turn over fast and furious documents
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to go back to our newscast from earlier this year and one we did last year where we dug up the press
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.080]  Conferences because the mainstream media will not pick this up. We've put it out. We've got to do a new article
[11:44.080 --> 11:47.840]  I got to get curtain them over Paul Watson or somebody to do it showing
[11:48.320 --> 11:55.720]  Holder and all of them and and and and and big sis and Paul Itano at meeting saying they were running gun tracing programs
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.080]  By the very names not just saying they were shipping them into Mexico. Of course, they perjured themselves
[12:01.160 --> 12:08.320]  It's an open and shut deal. Did Nixon have privilege? He declared executive privilege. Did that protect him? No
[12:08.320 --> 12:18.680]  That's why we have the contest going to hang Obama dictator posters all over this country because he is behaving like one of behaving like one is trying to become one
[12:18.680 --> 12:20.920]  We've got to break people out of their trance
[12:23.080 --> 12:27.280]  I'd hang him up around local TV stations in the anti free space people will attack it
[12:27.280 --> 12:30.240]  That's what we want him to do but side issue will cover more of that later
[12:31.600 --> 12:34.480]  Continuing Obama refuses to turn over fast and furious documents
[12:34.480 --> 12:40.960]  Flashback attacked trying to hide behind executive privilege. I remember he did that over and over again with Bush
[12:41.720 --> 12:50.040]  Grassley assertion raises monumental questions over documents. He's supposedly never seen again more perjury
[12:50.320 --> 12:53.200]  Is it a holder get ready for contempt vote?
[12:54.880 --> 12:58.920]  This is a constitutional crisis here and it's clear that the Congress is in the right. Wow
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.920]  I'm actually kind of liking what Congress is doing
[13:00.920 --> 13:08.520]  Now holders already threatened to bring out the fact that Bush was running similar programs differences. He didn't perjure himself on it
[13:09.200 --> 13:10.960]  report holder
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.200]  retracts claim Bush AG knew about fast and furious see that little red linky
[13:16.640 --> 13:24.520]  So now he's backing off. I predicted he would use that card and for my intel from Selika still and other DEA people
[13:24.520 --> 13:27.040]  This was going on six and a half years ago
[13:27.040 --> 13:37.040]  Very interesting continuing Obama campaign demands GOP group disclosed donors. So all of that is unfolding and Obama has declared
[13:37.040 --> 13:38.040]  privilege
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.040]  Okay, let's stop right there
[13:42.040 --> 13:45.040]  My problem is the lies are coming in so fast
[13:45.040 --> 13:53.040]  I don't even have time to respond to this and I've been in the nightmare scenario of Paul Watson being on semi vacation the last week and a half
[13:53.040 --> 13:58.040]  Because I got a lot of great writers, but I can always call Paul up in like one minute send him some links
[13:59.040 --> 14:01.040]  He understands the angles and goes with it
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.040]  and
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.040]  I don't get a hold of Paul last few days on his cell phone anywhere. It's supposed to be back in England today. So Watson
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.040]  I'm calling you out here on air, buddy boy
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.040]  Maisie bird. I'm just joking. The point is is that
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.040]  Is he was visiting family in France? His parents moved to France
[14:20.040 --> 14:25.040]  The point is is that I'm so busy. I've missed a lot of stuff that's going on
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.040]  I discovered this morning
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.040]  That there are hundreds of news articles out in the last three days
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.040]  Saying I'm a liar and saying that info wars calm is deceptive
[14:44.040 --> 14:50.040]  And saying that there are no drones in the skies watching the American people
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.040]  And that Megan Kelly at Fox News is wrong
[14:55.040 --> 15:01.040]  About a couple weeks ago reporting on our story our stories. We got drink linked on drugs and got picked up
[15:01.040 --> 15:04.040]  It was actually out of the Omaha newspaper
[15:06.040 --> 15:10.040]  And she said okay the EPA is not spying on farmers and ranchers
[15:10.040 --> 15:15.040]  With drones, they're doing it with manned aircraft. Yes, that's nice
[15:16.040 --> 15:18.040]  They even got some bigger more expensive aircraft
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.040]  But if you read the fine print of the article we linked to
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.040]  In our article EPA using drones to spy on cattle ranchers in Nebraska and Iowa
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.040]  And Watson also wrote an article this is Curt Nemo's article back on June 4th
[15:31.040 --> 15:33.040]  We can a half ago if you read it
[15:34.040 --> 15:36.040]  What we linked to it's the government
[15:36.040 --> 15:42.040]  Announcing that they're launching these and that they're using national parks as the bases
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.040]  And they've built 60 plus bases and their police from Texas to Minnesota
[15:49.040 --> 15:51.040]  And I've got all those articles
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.040]  Saying that they're getting them through grants with Department of Defense and moving to arm them
[15:58.040 --> 16:01.040]  And the 30,000 drone number comes out of the 40 plus billion dollar
[16:01.040 --> 16:09.040]  Funding package that the Washington Post reported on a few months ago to launch quote 30,000 drones by 2012
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.040]  Including thousands this year
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.040]  Now if you scroll down in the article Curt's article you can see the link
[16:19.040 --> 16:24.040]  To the Omaha news article
[16:25.040 --> 16:27.040]  That goes over all of this
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.040]  EPA defends aerial surveillance
[16:31.040 --> 16:35.040]  And it just goes over that and they've been using drones for surveillance
[16:36.040 --> 16:42.040]  In fact I have Wired magazine and CBS where they used it on those farmers in North Dakota
[16:43.040 --> 16:45.040]  And the Department of Defense Air Force ran it
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.040]  The cows kept breaking into their land they said that's it fourth time it's happened we're keeping your cows
[16:50.040 --> 16:51.040]  We've had that happen to our cows
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.040]  We've had people the first time they got into somebody's property they got into a car
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.040]  We've had people the first time they got into somebody's property they got out we're keeping them
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.040]  We're like alright well I mean that's not kosher and ranching but it happens five six seven eight times
[17:04.040 --> 17:10.040]  Or you know they get in with your prize cattle and somebody's got some breed you know you don't want to mix with your cows
[17:11.040 --> 17:13.040]  And it gets in and sires a bunch of you know whatever
[17:14.040 --> 17:16.040]  Sure you can go ahead and keep cattle that's common law
[17:17.040 --> 17:20.040]  That's a side issue though the point is is that they use drones there
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.040]  I've pulled up this morning articles where they announced three years ago
[17:25.040 --> 17:33.040]  They were using drones to spy on people and where they were using satellites five six years ago in the US and Europe to spy on people
[17:34.040 --> 17:39.040]  And is there runoff from your cows into a creek is there dust is there dust from your plow is there dust in your barn
[17:40.040 --> 17:46.040]  $2,000 a day fines. I mean this is all on record and there are no exaggeration
[17:46.040 --> 17:55.040]  This Google gives a number over 300 articles the last two days over 500 in the last week that I just missed
[17:56.040 --> 18:02.040]  Saying Alex Jones is a liar Matt drudge is an idiot for linking to our story
[18:03.040 --> 18:10.040]  And that basically there are no drones the LA Times is schizophrenic they have articles about America's concerned about drones
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.040]  There's fear of civil liberties. They're being launched. They're being armed the same day
[18:16.040 --> 18:21.040]  They've got articles showing a grandpa shooting the weather vane and saying I killed the drone and his wife goes no
[18:22.040 --> 18:24.040]  You know you just shot the weather vane
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.040]  So they've got countless articles saying it's a hoax
[18:29.040 --> 18:34.040]  That 30,000 drones are being launched the predators are in the sky and again this is the disdain
[18:34.040 --> 18:38.040]  That the corporate prostitute media has and I don't even know how to respond to this
[18:39.040 --> 18:41.040]  I don't even know how to respond to this
[18:42.040 --> 18:44.040]  Here it is out of the Missouli and
[18:46.040 --> 18:49.040]  Ryberg backs off claim of EPA drone surveillance
[18:52.040 --> 18:55.040]  And it goes on to demonize one of the local politicians resisting it
[18:56.040 --> 19:01.040]  The drone story has been circulated several days by right wing media before Ryberg wrote Jackson
[19:01.040 --> 19:07.040]  Conservative and there's a bill in Congress trying to kill drones right now Rand Paul's introduced and it's getting steam
[19:07.040 --> 19:12.040]  So see there there's a bill in the house and he's trying to get one introduced the house as well through the Senate
[19:12.040 --> 19:16.040]  But the point is they know there's a major heat. They tried to roll these out in her face
[19:16.040 --> 19:21.040]  It was on every newscast out there how they were they're gonna have weapons. They're watching you. That's the way it is
[19:21.040 --> 19:28.040]  Pentagon's you know the secretary of the army says we're gonna put armed troops in every city council on foreign relations
[19:28.040 --> 19:34.040]  And it didn't work everybody kind of got upset everybody got up in arms states got matched
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.040]  They're like wait wait wait I actually have articles here saying none of this exists and there are no drones
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.040]  This is how dumb they think you are
[19:43.040 --> 19:44.040]  Here it is
[19:45.040 --> 19:51.040]  And it goes on to say conservative talk show host Alex Jones published the bogus drone story on his website info wars.com
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.040]  Complete with a photograph of military drone flying through blue skies
[19:55.040 --> 19:57.040]  Now you're the liars

[23:56.040 --> 24:07.040]  That's goberkey.com today
[24:27.040 --> 24:40.040]  The press out there that's not totally controlled and not absolute criminals working with the globalist needs to investigate this and needs to look at this
[24:40.040 --> 24:47.040]  Now just like I told you a decade ago there was a plan to convert the entire military to drones and robots
[24:47.040 --> 24:52.040]  So that it wouldn't matter if the troops said no to unlawful orders
[24:52.040 --> 24:55.040]  They could just have the automated systems carry it out
[24:55.040 --> 25:07.040]  And now they're reporting on the LA Times and other publications that for several years the Pentagon has had autonomous drones flying on their own, killing on their own in the sky
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.040]  30,000 drones for the US guys were announced in the Washington Post
[25:11.040 --> 25:18.040]  Police departments all over the United States including five departments here in Texas are getting armed drones
[25:18.040 --> 25:23.040]  That is in the news they've put in for Homeland Security grants
[25:23.040 --> 25:31.040]  The system sold this to the public and there was a backlash so they did their old trick of saying doesn't exist
[25:31.040 --> 25:33.040]  And later I'm going to get into it
[25:33.040 --> 25:40.040]  Hundreds of articles I only printed 10 or 15 or so saying it doesn't exist and that I'm a liar
[25:40.040 --> 25:48.040]  And that the EPA is not surveilling farmers and they go to one case and go oh the EPA is in their own aircraft with humans flying at not drones
[25:48.040 --> 25:57.040]  Really I have the news articles that we linked to where they've announced drone bases and that they are using drones and spy satellites and I'm going to go over that
[25:57.040 --> 26:05.040]  But instead they just say right wing extremist Alex Jones he put out the article and that evil Matt Drudge picked it up
[26:05.040 --> 26:15.040]  Really I'm going to read the Wired Magazine, Washington Post, CBS News, LA Times from the last month admitting what we reported on
[26:15.040 --> 26:20.040]  I'm going to show the LA Times contradicting the LA Times
[26:20.040 --> 26:28.040]  But you all saw them announce the drones, you've seen the drones, drones are crashing all over the country and almost flying into aircraft
[26:28.040 --> 26:35.040]  You know about this, I've got the London Telegraph with documents that have gone public where they're calling it the Banker Union
[26:35.040 --> 26:40.040]  And the bankers call it their new kingdom in Europe and admit they've taken over
[26:40.040 --> 26:51.040]  How many years have I told you it's a banker coup? We're right, the bottom paid for media tries to sell you on tyranny, you wake up and they come after you
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.040]  There's LA Times, police employ predator drones, spy planes on home front
[26:56.040 --> 27:03.040]  Now this is a short segment, he'll be with us to the end of the hour, he's Eric Mankal Muller syndicated radio host
[27:03.040 --> 27:13.040]  And he's got a clip that he just got where he talked to Jesse Venturi and played part of it here, he's got a program director
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.040]  Also a tape of that, we can get the director on if we want, we're probably going to pipe him in
[27:18.040 --> 27:27.040]  He's connected with us from Chicago to our studios in Austin, Texas and everything he's about to cover dovetails with the drones and all the rest of it
[27:27.040 --> 27:33.040]  But remember they announced years ago and now it's the cell phones they admit listen to you without warrants
[27:33.040 --> 27:42.040]  They announced yes the president's going to break in and force your phone to stop the call or the surfing and make you listen to a message from him
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.040]  That's mainstream news
[27:45.040 --> 27:55.040]  All of this is happening and there's EAS in the satellites, the communication satellites and all the radio stations where the government can override and take over
[27:55.040 --> 28:01.040]  FEMA, the shadow government, and most importantly can listen for key words
[28:01.040 --> 28:09.040]  With NSA software and override it, Mankal has gotten more than 50 calls, multiple program directors, I've gotten these calls as well
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.040]  That when we talk about FEMA camps, it's not all stations, they're testing it
[28:14.040 --> 28:24.040]  FEMA camps, emergency centers, or Ventura show being censored where they went in and remotely erased the information
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.040]  We're going to go to Mankal right now, Mankal, we're about to go to break, but tell us what you're about to break when we come back
[28:29.040 --> 28:37.040]  Alex, Alex, this is blockbuster stuff, I mean this is, oh my god, I'm a little bit, my hands are shaking, this is so terrifying
[28:37.040 --> 28:43.040]  And you told me about this Ventura situation, we got him when he got off the plane from Mexico, he had no idea what the heck was going on
[28:43.040 --> 28:48.040]  We alerted him to this, this is bigger than anybody imagined
[28:48.040 --> 28:54.040]  In fact, people in TV, forget radio, people in TV didn't know the government had the powers that they have
[28:54.040 --> 29:04.040]  And we're going to talk about it, I've got Jesse Ventura, his first word on it coming up, plus program directors talking about how my show and your show being scrambled
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.040]  I mean, good night Irene, this is frightening
[29:07.040 --> 29:14.040]  You're right, and it's when we talk about FEMA camps, so we're going to talk to MankalMankal.com
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.040]  Nobody may be hearing this right now
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.040]  This may not even be on the radio right now
[29:20.040 --> 29:31.040]  By the way, you're going to have that Ventura clip, but you're also going to be, I know you have the tape from this morning on the program director who's too scared to talk with his name openly, but can we pipe him in live too in about 10 minutes?
[29:31.040 --> 29:33.040]  Let me try to get him
[29:33.040 --> 29:48.040]  Okay, stay there, Mankal.com is the website, this is big folks, this is the technocracy, this is the big secret they're going to use during martial law collapse, this is happening, stay with us
[30:04.040 --> 30:08.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[30:08.040 --> 30:14.040]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[30:14.040 --> 30:20.040]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[30:20.040 --> 30:24.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.040]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[30:28.040 --> 30:32.040]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:32.040 --> 30:36.040]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[30:36.040 --> 30:41.040]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[30:41.040 --> 30:46.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors

[32:59.040 --> 33:07.040]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
[33:07.040 --> 33:11.040]  There was something so pleasant about that place
[33:11.040 --> 33:17.040]  Richard Nixon claimed executive privilege on lying to Congress and obstructing justice
[33:17.040 --> 33:23.040]  Did it work for him? He said it's not illegal, it was illegal when the president does it
[33:23.040 --> 33:29.040]  Well now Obama said there were no documents but now he's saying executive privilege
[33:29.040 --> 33:32.040]  He's not going to release them on shipping guns into Mexico
[33:32.040 --> 33:36.040]  These are terrorists, they did this to blame the Second Amendment
[33:36.040 --> 33:41.040]  Those memos got covered by CBS News of all places
[33:41.040 --> 33:45.040]  This is serious information and Obama is back into a corner
[33:45.040 --> 33:51.040]  Now listen, they put NEAS expanding the emergency broadcast center in 1996
[33:51.040 --> 33:57.040]  Now two years ago FEMA announced hey the president might start popping in whenever he wants
[33:57.040 --> 34:04.040]  Or government at large or your local fusion center taking over radio TV and your cell phone
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.040]  Now it's begun in tests in New York and New Jersey this year
[34:08.040 --> 34:11.040]  And by the way folks got really mad
[34:11.040 --> 34:17.040]  When you're on the phone it drops and it takes over with text and audio and soon video
[34:17.040 --> 34:21.040]  Apple's iOS 6 includes government alerts
[34:21.040 --> 34:28.040]  LA Times says you cannot override the executive alerts from the criminal in chief
[34:28.040 --> 34:32.040]  Again ladies and gentlemen this is beyond 1984
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.040]  Now listen, it's on record that Jesse Ventura's show got censored
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.040]  Threats, homeland security visits, I'm not supposed to get into all of it because I was told in confidence
[34:42.040 --> 34:46.040]  They erased off the DVRs by remote control the FEMA Camp Special
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.040]  Now Mancow, Eric Mueller with his syndicated show are on a lot of the same stations
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.040]  A lot of great program directors and listeners out there that like to show
[34:54.040 --> 34:59.040]  That every time he talks about FEMA camps and they've recorded this at the stations
[34:59.040 --> 35:01.040]  He's played it
[35:01.040 --> 35:08.040]  Every time he talks about FEMA camps, Rex 84, things like this, he gets scrambled
[35:08.040 --> 35:12.040]  That's what the EAS system does when it starts to take over
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.040]  Now they've got him in the satellites too, it's not just at the broadcast tower
[35:17.040 --> 35:20.040]  Wired in as the final piece of equipment
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.040]  This is amazing information so I want to bring Eric Mueller, mancowmancow.com up here
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.040]  Because he got a program director on this morning while I was on talking about it
[35:30.040 --> 35:33.040]  And the program director was scared, I'm not saying the program director is bad
[35:33.040 --> 35:37.040]  But folks if we give into this fear they win, we've got to admit this is going on
[35:37.040 --> 35:39.040]  Just like the drones
[35:39.040 --> 35:42.040]  They admit they're launching drones, there's a backlash
[35:42.040 --> 35:47.040]  Legislations introduced at the state and federal level, suddenly oh they don't exist
[35:47.040 --> 35:51.040]  Mancow, what's happening here? You've got the floor, tell folks what's happening
[35:51.040 --> 35:53.040]  Get to the audio clips that you have
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.040]  I have so much to talk about, look, firstly Alex just minutes ago
[35:57.040 --> 36:00.040]  This news broke that Eric Holder is not going to be held responsible
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.040]  I know this drives you crazy, it drives me crazy when people do it
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.040]  But I want to mention something quickly, right there on your border where you broadcast
[36:06.040 --> 36:10.040]  You and I have hung out there, I mean, men, women and children were executed
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.040]  They did this so that we would see children killed, right, always for the children
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.040]  Whenever a politician mentions the children, it means you're going to lose the freedom
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.040]  Or your taxes are going up or they're going to be some kind of fine or something
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.040]  They use our children against us
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.040]  So this government gave guns to drug lords, massacres happened including our own agent
[36:27.040 --> 36:31.040]  An American agent, the documents come out about Fast and Furious
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.040]  They snicker that it was about the Vin Diesel movie Fast and Furious
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.040]  An executive privilege and they do what they want and end of story
[36:37.040 --> 36:39.040]  I mean, this is frightening now
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.040]  You tipped me off to this Jesse Ventura situation
[36:43.040 --> 36:49.040]  I talked about it, Alex, this is the story and we'll play it here in a second, okay?
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.040]  And I want to say to all of your listeners and my listeners were shocked by this
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.040]  I had it on Tivo, you're my friend, you're part of it, so I have a season pass
[36:59.040 --> 37:02.040]  I had it, I never got to see it
[37:02.040 --> 37:08.040]  DVRs, you know, blank DVDs, people that record these things
[37:08.040 --> 37:13.040]  The government went into every home, this is a very successful show, the highest rated show on true TV
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.040]  The government went into every home, went into my Tivo and erased it
[37:18.040 --> 37:21.040]  Erased this TV show that you consulted on
[37:21.040 --> 37:24.040]  So we talked about it on the radio
[37:24.040 --> 37:28.040]  And when we talked about it, well, they scrambled it
[37:28.040 --> 37:31.040]  Now, I have on, it's actually not a program director, it's a general manager
[37:31.040 --> 37:34.040]  I don't want to say who he is, he's very nervous
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.040]  Because look, these stations are licensed from the government
[37:37.040 --> 37:40.040]  You have to understand, I've had government thugs come in and say, you know, you're licensed to the government
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.040]  You know, your mother owes this amount on her house
[37:43.040 --> 37:45.040]  You have a brother that does this
[37:45.040 --> 37:47.040]  You know that there's a license for his business
[37:47.040 --> 37:49.040]  You know that, and that's what they do
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.040]  They strong arm you so that you shut up
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.040]  So I don't want to get anybody in trouble here, but this is one of the guys, you know, of many that runs the show
[37:57.040 --> 37:58.040]  Are you there, sir?
[37:58.040 --> 38:00.040]  Yeah, I'm here, I'm here
[38:00.040 --> 38:01.040]  So what happened?
[38:01.040 --> 38:04.040]  Well, you know, I'm driving in and listening to the station
[38:04.040 --> 38:08.040]  It's a good interview, we're about to hear about FEMA camps
[38:08.040 --> 38:10.040]  You're talking to Jesse Ventura
[38:10.040 --> 38:15.040]  And all of a sudden, the station completely goes off the air
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.040]  And I just spent a lot of money on engineering work
[38:18.040 --> 38:21.040]  I've had the engineers in the studio, I've had them at the transmitter site
[38:21.040 --> 38:23.040]  Everything is tip-top
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.040]  And I get in and the engineer running the show looks like he's seen a ghost
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.040]  And he said that phones ringing off the hook
[38:30.040 --> 38:33.040]  And people are calling from all over the area saying
[38:33.040 --> 38:36.040]  That just as you were about to finally get to the...
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.040]  You know, you guys had some chit-chat and you talked about other stuff
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.040]  And right when you get to the FEMA stuff, we were completely taken off the air
[38:43.040 --> 38:48.040]  And we checked on it, and the transmitter was like powered down
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.040]  Now, I'm not an engineer, I don't know what can happen, but...
[38:53.040 --> 38:55.040]  I don't know what's going on
[38:55.040 --> 38:58.040]  I've heard this from Alex, I've heard this from 60 different people
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.040]  In management positions around America, yes, you and I share
[39:02.040 --> 39:05.040]  Several stations, Alex, can I continue?
[39:05.040 --> 39:07.040]  Yes, continue with the interview
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.040]  Alright, no, no, no, look, I don't want to move in on your territory here
[39:10.040 --> 39:12.040]  But let me play, I mean, we've gotten thousands of messages
[39:12.040 --> 39:16.040]  I want to play some interesting messages that I received
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.040]  And I also want to give out my number, we give out your website almost every day on my show
[39:20.040 --> 39:22.040]  I want to give out the number if people have witnesses
[39:22.040 --> 39:24.040]  Or they want to add to this conversation
[39:24.040 --> 39:27.040]  And I want to hear from them, 877-MANCOW-9
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.040]  877-MANCOW-9
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.040]  No, no, I agree, that's why I wanted to get you on today
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.040]  Because we've got to do a major investigation
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.040]  It's admitted Homeland Security went and visited True TV and made sure it only aired once
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.040]  After the one airing, they flipped out, that's on record
[39:43.040 --> 39:49.040]  That was in newspapers that the congressman admitted that he went and had Homeland Security do this
[39:49.040 --> 39:51.040]  I mean, what a thug
[39:51.040 --> 39:55.040]  He started getting erased off DVRs and then I got internal stuff from a major city
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.040]  Time Warner manager that, hey, if you get calls, don't answer it
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.040]  But we were ordered by the government to remotely erase all of this
[40:03.040 --> 40:09.040]  Imagine, imagine the government going into your TV, into your VCR, into your DVD player, into your DVR
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.040]  And erasing it, well that's done it
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.040]  But that's the future of this censorship and we're going to talk about that later, yeah
[40:14.040 --> 40:16.040]  Go to these clips
[40:16.040 --> 40:19.040]  Here's the thing, a guy actually was listening and called me
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.040]  And you're going to hear that, let me, let me
[40:21.040 --> 40:22.040]  Next message
[40:22.040 --> 40:24.040]  I'm working trucking, I got everybody listening at your station
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.040]  Problem is, every time Mankow talks about something extremely controversial
[40:29.040 --> 40:32.040]  Like the FEMA camps, prison and stuff like that
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.040]  Your radio station goes out, it's completely shut out
[40:35.040 --> 40:37.040]  I figure you guys might want to know
[40:37.040 --> 40:38.040]  And this message
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.040]  Okay, hold on, hold on
[40:39.040 --> 40:40.040]  Next message
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.040]  Yo, Mankow, believe it or not, every now and then you get scrambled on certain stations
[40:44.040 --> 40:47.040]  When you talk about certain subjects and not all of them do it
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.040]  That's how I know they're scrambling you
[40:49.040 --> 40:51.040]  You should investigate some of that
[40:51.040 --> 40:52.040]  Oh, we're doing it
[40:52.040 --> 40:54.040]  These antennas that they have that are cell phone towers
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.040]  You might want to go research that, they're not cell phone towers
[40:56.040 --> 41:02.040]  It's more like a Tesla tower that sends cable signals, cell phone communications
[41:02.040 --> 41:05.040]  It even sends electricity, it does it all
[41:05.040 --> 41:08.040]  And that's how they're tapping in and blocking you
[41:08.040 --> 41:09.040]  Alright
[41:09.040 --> 41:10.040]  And then jacking the station
[41:10.040 --> 41:11.040]  I want the message
[41:11.040 --> 41:12.040]  I want the message
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.040]  Okay, I want the message where the guy plays what I sound like scrambled
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.040]  And it's usually when I have you on Alex, thank you very much
[41:18.040 --> 41:20.040]  Well listen, listen, listen
[41:20.040 --> 41:23.040]  We're such a small crew, you're a small crew
[41:23.040 --> 41:25.040]  I get program directors calling up saying
[41:25.040 --> 41:30.040]  That when you talk about things, the EAS cuts us off, will you please call me
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.040]  And then I've gotten so conditioned to know this is going on
[41:33.040 --> 41:34.040]  I don't even have time to call them
[41:34.040 --> 41:37.040]  Because I'm literally running 15, 16
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.040]  I mean, I left here last night at 9.45 in the evening
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.040]  But yes, we know this is going on
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.040]  And we know, we know that they have this power
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.040]  And we know that they have openly announced
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.040]  That they're already breaking in with President Obama
[41:55.040 --> 41:57.040]  Taking over people's cell phones
[41:57.040 --> 42:00.040]  I mean, they're just testing and testing and testing
[42:00.040 --> 42:02.040]  Let's ask the general manager there
[42:02.040 --> 42:05.040]  What he thinks of this and what his engineer thought
[42:05.040 --> 42:10.040]  Well, you know, it's scary because when you're in my position
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.040]  Your priority number one isn't ratings, it isn't sales
[42:13.040 --> 42:15.040]  It's to keep the license
[42:15.040 --> 42:17.040]  The government can take your license from you
[42:17.040 --> 42:20.040]  If they take your license from you, a lot of people don't know this
[42:20.040 --> 42:22.040]  Your station, your business is gone
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.040]  So I have to do everything they say
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.040]  In fact, I just had to order a new thousand dollar box for the government
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.040]  The new EAS box is a thousand bucks
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.040]  And it's mandatory that we have to have it in the studio
[42:36.040 --> 42:39.040]  Whatever box we had last month
[42:39.040 --> 42:42.040]  And no longer good enough, we have to have whatever this new thing is
[42:42.040 --> 42:45.040]  And by the way, they did a takeover thing earlier in the year
[42:45.040 --> 42:47.040]  And it screwed up stations all over the country
[42:47.040 --> 42:50.040]  They're doing it on TV and they admit
[42:50.040 --> 42:52.040]  They're going to start doing government announcements
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.040]  You go to Walmarts now, they have Jumbotrons with Big Sisshing
[42:55.040 --> 42:59.040]  Watch everyone, highway checkpoints
[42:59.040 --> 43:01.040]  The president's acting like Nixon
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.040]  Again, though, this is confirmed that Homeland Security
[43:05.040 --> 43:07.040]  Ordered the Jesse Ventura show
[43:07.040 --> 43:10.040]  Now the word is they're not going to let the third season air
[43:10.040 --> 43:12.040]  But here's what I want to tell the general manager
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.040]  I understand, quote, it's license
[43:14.040 --> 43:17.040]  But they're outside their purview when they're doing this
[43:17.040 --> 43:20.040]  It's time for all of us and the different broadcaster organizations
[43:20.040 --> 43:23.040]  To get together and defend the First Amendment
[43:23.040 --> 43:25.040]  Or we're going to lose it all
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.040]  And they're trying to bring the fairness doctrine back in
[43:28.040 --> 43:30.040]  They're trying to censor the internet
[43:30.040 --> 43:33.040]  We've got to say no to these people
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.040]  Yeah, listen, I want to play the guy listening
[43:37.040 --> 43:38.040]  Can I play it, Alex?
[43:38.040 --> 43:39.040]  Yes
[43:39.040 --> 43:40.040]  Okay, and then I have Jesse Ventura
[43:40.040 --> 43:41.040]  I don't know if you have time for this
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.040]  Yes
[43:42.040 --> 43:44.040]  But Jesse responded to this situation
[43:44.040 --> 43:46.040]  And you told me you couldn't reach him
[43:46.040 --> 43:49.040]  He was in Mexico and when I told him he was shocked
[43:49.040 --> 43:50.040]  And anyway, here we go
[43:50.040 --> 43:51.040]  Next message
[43:51.040 --> 43:53.040]  Yeah, Mankow, listen to what it sounds like
[43:53.040 --> 43:56.040]  When they're scrambling my station when you say important stuff
[43:56.040 --> 43:57.040]  Listen
[43:57.040 --> 43:58.040]  There you go
[43:58.040 --> 43:59.040]  There you go
[43:59.040 --> 44:01.040]  Jesse Ventura, do you want to hear him?
[44:01.040 --> 44:02.040]  Yes, let's hear that
[44:02.040 --> 44:03.040]  All right, let's roll that
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.040]  Guys, do we have it? Let's roll it
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.040]  Alex wants it
[44:05.040 --> 44:06.040]  Are you there, caller? Hello?
[44:06.040 --> 44:07.040]  I'm here, we're not
[44:07.040 --> 44:09.040]  Okay, Jesse Ventura is on now
[44:09.040 --> 44:10.040]  Jesse, are you there?
[44:10.040 --> 44:11.040]  Yes, I am
[44:11.040 --> 44:12.040]  I want you to hear this, Jesse
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.040]  This is huge news
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.040]  This is a firestorm, my friend
[44:16.040 --> 44:18.040]  Okay, this is one of the station managers
[44:18.040 --> 44:20.040]  I've had over 60 call me now
[44:20.040 --> 44:22.040]  I've had over 60 call me now
[44:22.040 --> 44:24.040]  I've had over 60 call me now
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.040]  I've had over 60 call me now
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.040]  And what happened when Jesse Ventura and I were talking?
[44:30.040 --> 44:32.040]  You're off the human camp
[44:32.040 --> 44:35.040]  I'm on the wheels of the radio
[44:35.040 --> 44:39.040]  And all of the subject completely goes off the air
[44:39.040 --> 44:41.040]  We were yanked off the air
[44:41.040 --> 44:43.040]  Nobody at your station knows how it happened
[44:43.040 --> 44:44.040]  I've heard this from everybody
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.040]  That's a guy that runs my show successfully in his city
[44:47.040 --> 44:49.040]  Pick a city, USA
[44:49.040 --> 44:51.040]  And Jesse, this has been happening
[44:51.040 --> 44:52.040]  Next message
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.040]  Yo, Mankow
[44:53.040 --> 44:55.040]  Believe it or not, every now and then
[44:55.040 --> 44:57.040]  You get scrambled on certain stations
[44:57.040 --> 44:58.040]  Next message
[44:58.040 --> 44:59.040]  Yeah, Mankow
[44:59.040 --> 45:01.040]  Listen to what it sounds like when they're scrambling
[45:01.040 --> 45:03.040]  My station when you say important stuff
[45:03.040 --> 45:04.040]  Listen
[45:05.040 --> 45:07.040]  That's what it sounds like, Jesse
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.040]  Yep, they're scrambling, you dude
[45:11.040 --> 45:13.040]  And a message
[45:13.040 --> 45:14.040]  I'm working talking
[45:14.040 --> 45:16.040]  I got everybody listed at your station
[45:16.040 --> 45:19.040]  Problem is, every time Mankow talks about something
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.040]  Extremely controversial
[45:21.040 --> 45:23.040]  The human camp, prison, stuff like that
[45:23.040 --> 45:25.040]  Your radio station goes off
[45:25.040 --> 45:26.040]  Alex Jones
[45:26.040 --> 45:28.040]  I'll figure you guys might want to know
[45:28.040 --> 45:29.040]  What's this message?
[45:29.040 --> 45:31.040]  Jesse, what the hell is going on, brother?
[45:31.040 --> 45:33.040]  I had you on and they yanked me off
[45:33.040 --> 45:34.040]  The government
[45:34.040 --> 45:36.040]  Well, I'll tell you, you're obviously a target
[45:36.040 --> 45:38.040]  Because you're talking about things
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.040]  That they don't want out to the general public
[45:40.040 --> 45:42.040]  That's the best thing I can come up with
[45:42.040 --> 45:43.040]  Do I know that for sure?
[45:43.040 --> 45:45.040]  No, I'm not privy, but
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.040]  You know, it seems pretty strange
[45:48.040 --> 45:51.040]  And, you know, clearly they have the power to do it
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.040]  You know, they got the power to do a whole bunch of things
[45:54.040 --> 45:57.040]  That the general public isn't always aware of
[45:57.040 --> 45:59.040]  Look at my television show
[45:59.040 --> 46:01.040]  We've done eight more episodes
[46:01.040 --> 46:02.040]  They were done in November
[46:02.040 --> 46:04.040]  And due to go on in January
[46:04.040 --> 46:06.040]  They haven't seen the light of day
[46:06.040 --> 46:07.040]  And the excuse I'm getting is
[46:07.040 --> 46:09.040]  Oh, we still have to do some more editing
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.040]  Brother, so that's what they're going to do now
[46:13.040 --> 46:16.040]  In the digital age, they just punch in a word
[46:16.040 --> 46:18.040]  And anytime something's mentioned that they don't want
[46:18.040 --> 46:20.040]  It's just going to be removed
[46:20.040 --> 46:21.040]  Yeah, it's very well
[46:21.040 --> 46:23.040]  We live in a country of censorship
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.040]  Today, there's no doubt about it in control
[46:26.040 --> 46:28.040]  And whom do we have to blame for?
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.040]  The Democrats and Republicans
[46:30.040 --> 46:32.040]  Well, that's a bit of it, Alex
[46:32.040 --> 46:34.040]  Absolutely
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.040]  And, again, they confirm
[46:37.040 --> 46:39.040]  That they are raced off T-Vos everywhere
[46:39.040 --> 46:42.040]  In fact, we talked to multiple big city managers
[46:42.040 --> 46:44.040]  Of cable and one-time warner
[46:44.040 --> 46:46.040]  In a major city, who's a listener
[46:46.040 --> 46:49.040]  And they sent us the order
[46:49.040 --> 46:51.040]  Saying, don't respond
[46:51.040 --> 46:53.040]  We've remotely erased this
[46:53.040 --> 46:55.040]  We know you're getting calls about it
[46:55.040 --> 46:57.040]  Do not respond, this is secret
[46:57.040 --> 46:59.040]  And so, again, they erased it
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.040]  But it's on record that that congressman
[47:01.040 --> 47:03.040]  Got caught and had to admit the secret camps
[47:03.040 --> 47:05.040]  For the American people in that FEMA camp
[47:05.040 --> 47:07.040]  Threat Fusion Center takeover piece
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.040]  And so they sent homeland security over there
[47:11.040 --> 47:13.040]  A bunch of stuff happened behind the scenes
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.040]  Break-ins, threats
[47:15.040 --> 47:17.040]  I'm not supposed to get into all of it
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.040]  In fact, I better shut up right now
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.040]  Because I'm told this in confidence
[47:21.040 --> 47:23.040]  But the congressman admits
[47:23.040 --> 47:25.040]  He called Time Warner and all this
[47:25.040 --> 47:27.040]  And they never aired it again
[47:27.040 --> 47:29.040]  And then now, this is what I've heard
[47:29.040 --> 47:31.040]  When we talk about FEMA camps
[47:31.040 --> 47:33.040]  Or we talk about NSA stuff
[47:33.040 --> 47:35.040]  Some of our stations get cut off
[47:35.040 --> 47:37.040]  We're not sure if it's the EAS
[47:37.040 --> 47:39.040]  Because it's not all the stations
[47:39.040 --> 47:41.040]  And you would think it's the satellite
[47:41.040 --> 47:43.040]  Of all the stations
[47:43.040 --> 47:45.040]  I think they're testing it, man, Cal
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.040]  What do you think's happening?
[47:47.040 --> 47:49.040]  You know, Alex, I...
[47:49.040 --> 47:51.040]  I know...
[47:51.040 --> 47:53.040]  I'm a little bit freaked out right now
[47:53.040 --> 47:55.040]  I know that we always, for years
[47:55.040 --> 47:57.040]  We've had to run these tests
[47:57.040 --> 47:59.040]  Of the emergency broadcast system, right?
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.040]  We run the tests
[48:01.040 --> 48:03.040]  So the government can jump in at any time
[48:03.040 --> 48:05.040]  And little did I know when I was running those tests
[48:05.040 --> 48:07.040]  Which I've always heard from engineers
[48:07.040 --> 48:09.040]  And everybody else were completely unnecessary
[48:09.040 --> 48:11.040]  So they can assume control
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.040]  The internet can...
[48:13.040 --> 48:15.040]  I mean, look at Nicolenda, they had a program in place
[48:15.040 --> 48:17.040]  You know, this guy, number one ratings
[48:17.040 --> 48:19.040]  This stunt show
[48:19.040 --> 48:21.040]  The guy that walked over Niagara Falls
[48:21.040 --> 48:23.040]  ABC, every time...it was a live event
[48:23.040 --> 48:25.040]  But they had a...
[48:25.040 --> 48:27.040]  Every time he thanked God, they would talk over it
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.040]  Well, or every time he mentioned Jesus or God
[48:29.040 --> 48:31.040]  They just...live
[48:31.040 --> 48:33.040]  On TV, they just took it right out
[48:33.040 --> 48:35.040]  And words that they don't like
[48:35.040 --> 48:37.040]  They're just going to remove it
[48:37.040 --> 48:39.040]  And it's just like Shazam
[48:39.040 --> 48:41.040]  Hey, oh, this is huge
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.040]  This is huge, I wish I could name this guy
[48:43.040 --> 48:45.040]  And I made your media outlets
[48:45.040 --> 48:47.040]  I alerted them to this
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.040]  And man, they were terrified when I told them this
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.040]  And you can fill in the blank, Alex
[48:51.040 --> 48:53.040]  But we can't do it on the air, just like you
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.040]  I can't reveal these sources or it kills me
[48:55.040 --> 48:57.040]  And it kills them
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.040]  Look at Breitbart, I mean, I believe they literally
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.040]  Killed him, my opinion
[49:01.040 --> 49:03.040]  Academy award-winning director said, look
[49:03.040 --> 49:05.040]  They don't want books
[49:05.040 --> 49:07.040]  They want DVDs, they don't want anything
[49:07.040 --> 49:09.040]  They want everything digital, that's what Kindle
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.040]  And all this stuff is about
[49:11.040 --> 49:13.040]  So that if there's a book or an idea
[49:13.040 --> 49:15.040]  Or a pamphlet or a song or something
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.040]  That causes trouble for the powers it be
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.040]  They just push a button and it's gone
[49:19.040 --> 49:21.040]  Kindle remotely erased last year
[49:21.040 --> 49:23.040]  1984
[49:23.040 --> 49:25.040]  Off of hundreds of thousands of people's system
[49:25.040 --> 49:27.040]  And they did it to a bunch of other books
[49:27.040 --> 49:29.040]  That people had bought
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.040]  And I have a Supreme Court ruling today
[49:31.040 --> 49:33.040]  It's up at infowars.com
[49:33.040 --> 49:35.040]  You can even shell your used iPhone to somebody
[49:35.040 --> 49:37.040]  It's copyright violation
[49:37.040 --> 49:39.040]  And that's what Shazam is
[49:39.040 --> 49:41.040]  I've been told by high level, national security level people
[49:41.040 --> 49:43.040]  I talked to a retired NSA guy
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.040]  And he said, that was the plan
[49:45.040 --> 49:47.040]  Ten years ago, just like Shazam
[49:47.040 --> 49:49.040]  He said, Alex, you know how Shazam
[49:49.040 --> 49:51.040]  You can hold it up and know what music it is
[49:51.040 --> 49:53.040]  You know the guy that does Optimus Prime's voice
[49:53.040 --> 49:55.040]  Autobots roll out
[49:55.040 --> 49:57.040]  His voice is copyrighted and they can erase it
[49:57.040 --> 49:59.040]  Internet wide
[49:59.040 --> 50:01.040]  With a system they put out, a viral order they put out
[50:01.040 --> 50:03.040]  They could erase your voice, my voice
[50:03.040 --> 50:05.040]  Forever in a matter of hours
[50:05.040 --> 50:07.040]  Off the internet
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.040]  This is the control of total digitization
[50:09.040 --> 50:11.040]  And the cloud computing grid
[50:11.040 --> 50:13.040]  Yes sir, yes sir
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.040]  I mean, look, I in Rand, Fountainhead
[50:15.040 --> 50:17.040]  You don't like it, you just erase it
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.040]  And it's gone forever
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.040]  It's gone forever, 1984
[50:21.040 --> 50:23.040]  Or Brave New World, you push a button
[50:23.040 --> 50:25.040]  And it's gone, and this is what this government wants
[50:25.040 --> 50:27.040]  You push a button, man, Cal's gone
[50:27.040 --> 50:29.040]  You push a button, Ron Paul's gone
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.040]  You push a button, Jesse Ventura's gone
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.040]  You push a button, Alex Jones is gone
[50:33.040 --> 50:35.040]  We've got to wake up to this
[50:35.040 --> 50:37.040]  We've got to, Cal, stay there
[50:37.040 --> 50:39.040]  We should get excited, we should get angry
[50:39.040 --> 50:41.040]  A human revolt against the technocracy
[50:41.040 --> 50:43.040]  They're using against us
[50:43.040 --> 50:45.040]  Straight ahead, more man Cal

[51:58.040 --> 52:00.040]  For less, guaranteed
[52:00.040 --> 52:02.040]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors
[52:02.040 --> 52:04.040]  In every relationship, and one of the biggest
[52:04.040 --> 52:06.040]  Is that men are losing libido or sexual desire
[52:06.040 --> 52:08.040]  Especially if you're a man over 40
[52:08.040 --> 52:11.040]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.040]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man
[52:14.040 --> 52:16.040]  In every way, that's why we created TGen
[52:16.040 --> 52:18.040]  TGen is an all natural formula
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.040]  With ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone

[52:25.040 --> 52:27.040]  Here's Gina from California
[52:27.040 --> 52:29.040]  My husband tried one month at TGen
[52:29.040 --> 52:31.040]  And we both noticed his desire increased right away
[52:31.040 --> 52:33.040]  He felt the difference in his energy level
[52:33.040 --> 52:36.040]  I certainly liked the other effects it had on him

[53:58.040 --> 54:04.040]  No, this is not America
[54:04.040 --> 54:07.040]  Drones in the skies, the CIA director came out
[54:07.040 --> 54:09.040]  Two months ago in Wired Magazine and said
[54:09.040 --> 54:11.040]  Yeah, all your appliances are watching you
[54:11.040 --> 54:15.040]  The headline was your dishwasher is watching you
[54:15.040 --> 54:17.040]  This stuff is really going on
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.040]  We're paying for technology to have backdoor grids built into it
[54:21.040 --> 54:23.040]  I saw a headline that the communist Chinese
[54:23.040 --> 54:26.040]  Everything we buy has backdoors for them
[54:26.040 --> 54:29.040]  That's because the Pentagon and the people running our country
[54:29.040 --> 54:30.040]  Demanded
[54:30.040 --> 54:33.040]  This is incredible the technocracy that's being established
[54:33.040 --> 54:36.040]  We have that general manager of the radio station there
[54:36.040 --> 54:37.040]  But don't people understand something?
[54:37.040 --> 54:39.040]  Man Cal and I are not joking, okay
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.040]  It's real that they're announcing that the government
[54:41.040 --> 54:43.040]  Is going to start taking your phone over with messages
[54:43.040 --> 54:46.040]  It's real that the EAS more and more
[54:46.040 --> 54:48.040]  Is taking stations over and they're practicing
[54:48.040 --> 54:51.040]  Nationwide broadcast by the president
[54:51.040 --> 54:53.040]  It's real that we're getting reports
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.040]  When we talk about certain things, it just suddenly gets scrambled
[54:57.040 --> 55:00.040]  Okay, we're on a different satellite than Man Cal
[55:00.040 --> 55:02.040]  So this is super creepy
[55:02.040 --> 55:04.040]  These are folks that will ship guns into Mexico
[55:04.040 --> 55:05.040]  To blame the Second Amendment
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.040]  And I was not criticizing the general manager of that station
[55:08.040 --> 55:10.040]  For wanting to stay below the radar
[55:10.040 --> 55:12.040]  I think that's prudent up front
[55:12.040 --> 55:16.040]  But as groups they should get together and say no
[55:16.040 --> 55:19.040]  You're not going to just take over whenever you want now
[55:19.040 --> 55:20.040]  And you're not just going to
[55:20.040 --> 55:21.040]  I mean, you're a general manager
[55:21.040 --> 55:24.040]  I'm sure you know they're trying to tell stations now
[55:24.040 --> 55:27.040]  Get ready for government mandated programming
[55:27.040 --> 55:29.040]  Where they're going to have blocks where the EAS
[55:29.040 --> 55:32.040]  Takes over and tunes you to a frequency
[55:32.040 --> 55:34.040]  To make you carry their programming
[55:34.040 --> 55:36.040]  I mean, are you concerned about that, sir?
[55:36.040 --> 55:38.040]  As a general manager of a station?
[55:38.040 --> 55:41.040]  You know, what I'm concerned about
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.040]  Is Breitbart showing up yet
[55:45.040 --> 55:48.040]  And you know, I've got little kids
[55:48.040 --> 55:49.040]  You guys have little kids
[55:49.040 --> 55:51.040]  I'm not some bombastic host
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.040]  That's out there talking about the problems
[55:54.040 --> 55:57.040]  I'm some guy that tries to get advertising
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.040]  To support the station
[55:58.040 --> 55:59.040]  No, I understand
[55:59.040 --> 56:00.040]  I understand
[56:00.040 --> 56:02.040]  But they're going to get us all
[56:02.040 --> 56:04.040]  Breitbart because we believe Breitbart was killed
[56:04.040 --> 56:05.040]  Oh, I do too
[56:05.040 --> 56:06.040]  But I mean, I understand what he's saying
[56:06.040 --> 56:08.040]  He's saying this isn't...
[56:08.040 --> 56:10.040]  But I'm saying we've all got a dog in this fight
[56:10.040 --> 56:11.040]  Because this is it
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.040]  I mean, if they take over
[56:13.040 --> 56:14.040]  That's what we've got to be afraid of
[56:14.040 --> 56:17.040]  Alex, look, I had the Secret Service come after me
[56:17.040 --> 56:19.040]  A good cop, bad cop
[56:19.040 --> 56:20.040]  And they said, look, Bill Clinton's in town
[56:20.040 --> 56:22.040]  This was for the Democratic National Convention
[56:22.040 --> 56:23.040]  With Bill Clinton
[56:23.040 --> 56:24.040]  They said, we don't want to hear...
[56:24.040 --> 56:25.040]  We do not...
[56:25.040 --> 56:27.040]  We do not want you to mention Bill Clinton
[56:27.040 --> 56:28.040]  And they talked about my mother
[56:28.040 --> 56:30.040]  They talked about the radio station
[56:30.040 --> 56:33.040]  At that time, $174 million license
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.040]  $174 million
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.040]  They said, don't mention...
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.040]  Don't say Bill Clinton's name once
[56:39.040 --> 56:40.040]  We know where you live
[56:40.040 --> 56:41.040]  We know your kids
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.040]  And so guess what I did
[56:44.040 --> 56:46.040]  I didn't say anything
[56:46.040 --> 56:47.040]  It's incredible with this country
[56:47.040 --> 56:48.040]  No, not exactly
[56:48.040 --> 56:50.040]  I'm not criticizing anybody
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.040]  But we got it
[56:51.040 --> 56:52.040]  Let me ask the guy this
[56:52.040 --> 56:54.040]  I understand people listening going on
[56:54.040 --> 56:55.040]  What a punk, what a loser
[56:55.040 --> 56:57.040]  Really, you're going to lose everything
[56:57.040 --> 56:59.040]  You're going to lose somebody $174 million
[56:59.040 --> 57:01.040]  You're going to lose your family
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.040]  You're going to lose your house
[57:02.040 --> 57:04.040]  No, I understand all that
[57:04.040 --> 57:05.040]  Well, I've had them here too
[57:05.040 --> 57:06.040]  And I've told them to jump in the lake
[57:06.040 --> 57:08.040]  But the point is...
[57:08.040 --> 57:10.040]  But I understand that's why they want to take...
[57:10.040 --> 57:11.040]  End up like Breitbart
[57:11.040 --> 57:12.040]  I've got kids, man
[57:12.040 --> 57:13.040]  I understand
[57:13.040 --> 57:15.040]  But we're all going to end up like Breitbart
[57:15.040 --> 57:16.040]  Or like the Germans did
[57:16.040 --> 57:17.040]  If we don't turn this around
[57:17.040 --> 57:19.040]  Let me give the general manager
[57:19.040 --> 57:21.040]  The final word on his station
[57:21.040 --> 57:22.040]  All I'm saying is
[57:22.040 --> 57:23.040]  Do we see the danger
[57:23.040 --> 57:25.040]  If we all just give in to this?
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.040]  You're obviously not giving in
[57:26.040 --> 57:29.040]  You've had the courage to at least call in, sir
[57:29.040 --> 57:32.040]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, given in
[57:32.040 --> 57:34.040]  It's easy to say that I'm not giving in
[57:34.040 --> 57:37.040]  Because I'm airing, you know, man cows
[57:37.040 --> 57:39.040]  Exactly, exactly
[57:39.040 --> 57:41.040]  I guess the way to really push it
[57:41.040 --> 57:43.040]  Would be to, you know, to put you on
[57:43.040 --> 57:45.040]  To put him on and let everybody
[57:45.040 --> 57:47.040]  You know, with multiple voices
[57:47.040 --> 57:48.040]  Really go crazy
[57:48.040 --> 57:49.040]  And really talk to people
[57:49.040 --> 57:50.040]  About what's going on
[57:50.040 --> 57:51.040]  Exactly
[57:51.040 --> 57:53.040]  I mean, it is scary
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.040]  And they shouldn't be able
[57:56.040 --> 57:58.040]  To do anything to a radio station
[57:58.040 --> 58:00.040]  The only thing that should take the station off the air
[58:00.040 --> 58:01.040]  Is that the power is down
[58:01.040 --> 58:03.040]  And we have backup generators for that
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.040]  So now we've got these blockages at my station
[58:06.040 --> 58:07.040]  Wow
[58:07.040 --> 58:08.040]  You can push it in and take it off
[58:08.040 --> 58:09.040]  Well, look, look
[58:09.040 --> 58:10.040]  Any engineer will tell you
[58:10.040 --> 58:11.040]  Under the federal reg
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.040]  It's got to be wired in as the final piece
[58:13.040 --> 58:15.040]  It has to be in control
[58:15.040 --> 58:17.040]  At the tower and at the station
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.040]  Incredible, sir
[58:19.040 --> 58:21.040]  God bless the general manager there
[58:21.040 --> 58:22.040]  Name not to be mentioned here
[58:22.040 --> 58:24.040]  This is the point we've gotten to here
[58:24.040 --> 58:26.040]  In this country
[58:26.040 --> 58:28.040]  And, you know, email us
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.040]  At showtipsandinfowars.com
[58:30.040 --> 58:31.040]  If you're a program director
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.040]  And want to tell us about this
[58:32.040 --> 58:34.040]  Or if you're a listener and have witnessed it
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.040]  We'll do a little bit more with man cow
[58:36.040 --> 58:37.040]  Than our next guest
[58:37.040 --> 58:42.040]  Back in 60 seconds
[58:42.040 --> 58:44.040]  This is GCN
[58:44.040 --> 59:08.040]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[59:44.040 --> 59:45.040]  And in foewars.com

[59:53.040 --> 59:55.040]  Waging war on corruption
[59:55.040 --> 01:00:05.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040]  Big Brother
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.040]  Mainstream media
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040]  Government coverups
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.040]  Well, so does he
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.040]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.040]  The bottom line here is this
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]  The private corporate interests
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]  That are funding Al Qaeda
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.040]  Funding the communists, Chinese and others
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040]  Don't want freedom
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]  They want a monopoly
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.040]  They want total power
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.040]  They want the life extension technologies
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040]  They want it all
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]  They're using our money
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040]  To militarize police, to surveil us illegally
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.040]  To launch drones against us
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.040]  To put EAS systems in
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.040]  To take over radio, TV, computer, cell phones
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040]  And force their messages on your site
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040]  They're talking about redirecting
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040]  All your websites to whitehouse.gov
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040]  This is in the news
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.040]  And when there's a backlash to the drones
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040]  I'm going to cover this later
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.040]  They come out and say there are no drones
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.040]  I mean, literally over 500 articles
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.040]  The last week that I just seem to just now notice
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040]  And they're saying I'm a liar and all this
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040]  There's no drones
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]  Even though they all announced it
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]  I've seen them
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]  It's on the news
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]  They're arming them
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]  They're arresting people with them
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.040]  Again, it's total disdain
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040]  They're executing their program
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040]  They're lying right to our face
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]  This isn't our government
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040]  It's been taken over
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.040]  And now, when we talk about FEMA camps
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]  And emergency centers
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040]  They're not just erasing it off the TV
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040]  They're not just blocking it off through TV
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.040]  They're scrambling people's radio shows
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.040]  Selectively testing to see what they can do
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.040]  Ahead of a total collapse
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.040]  Ma'am, Cal, we've got about four minutes left
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.040]  You've got the floor with points on this
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]  But you're not joking
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.040]  You brought this up and you were flooded with
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.040]  Stations and listeners and program directors
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040]  I mean, this is real
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.040]  This is happening
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040]  Don't believe your own eyes
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040]  Don't believe your ears
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.040]  There's nothing to see here
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.040]  Just believe whatever the government tells you
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.040]  Just believe whatever the government tells you
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]  Next message
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]  Yeah, Ma'am, Cal
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]  Listen to what it sounds like
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]  When they're scrambling my station
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040]  When you say important stuff
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.040]  Listen
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040]  When Alex and I talk
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]  They scramble it
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  It's something else
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040]  You heard one of the program directors
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040]  One of the general managers earlier
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.040]  60-plus, you know, suits
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040]  Business people have contacted me
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.040]  But thousands of regular folk have called me
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.040]  What are they so afraid
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.040]  Of the American people hearing?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.040]  A TSA agent was getting grasped
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.040]  And groped by a passenger
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.040]  In Florida yesterday
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.040]  A woman groped back
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040]  And that person's now in jail for sexual assault
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040]  What they do is okay
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]  They can do whatever they want
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040]  They can give guns
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.040]  And little kids can be gunned down in Mexico
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040]  We can provide the guns
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.040]  That's fine
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.040]  We can't have a gun to protect ourselves
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]  I live in Chicago
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.040]  It's worse in Afghanistan right now
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.040]  The Tribune is saying
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]  And others are saying
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]  It's a race war going on
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040]  I can't protect myself
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040]  My wife can't have a gun to protect herself
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.040]  But we have guns for drug lords
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.040]  The double standard to these people
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]  Listen to Joe Biden
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]  Can I play the Joe Biden clip
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]  Of him all worked up?
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]  Sure
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.040]  I mean, radical Islam has risen up
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040]  In Egypt
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040]  Well, the globalists are financing it
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]  It's unbelievable, you know
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040]  And now we're going to go to Syria
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040]  Why?
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040]  These people want us dead
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040]  Listen to this
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040]  Our dollars, when something goes wrong
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040]  Well, they need more of our money
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040]  Right?
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040]  A big tax
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040]  When they give you a big tax discounter
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040]  It's $30
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.040]  A minor tax increase cost me $800
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040]  I'm sick of their double standard
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]  Play that clip, man, Joe
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040]  I just described you
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]  You're the one
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.040]  Here he is talking to government workers
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040]  We owe you
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040]  You shouldn't be billified
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040]  You provide the safe neighborhoods
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040]  You provide the good schools
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040]  You provide the school lunch program
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040]  You provide the daycare centers
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]  You provide the hospitals
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040]  You provide the roads
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040]  You provide the government
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040]  The glorious government
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040]  They're the federal family
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.040]  They're the federal family, as Janet calls it
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040]  I say it's you and I working hard
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]  In our tax dollars
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.040]  I mean, the cops with the batons
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040]  And a boot on the back of someone's neck
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.040]  They have forgotten who's paying them
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040]  We're the boss
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040]  How did we let them become...
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.040]  Really, why are we their servants?
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]  What has happened, Alex?
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]  The attack drones are launched
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040]  The armored pillbox is the 400 plus
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]  If you say something they don't like
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.040]  They just cut it out
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.040]  I tell you
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]  I tell you
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.040]  This is the future
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.040]  I don't even know if we're on right now, Alex
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.040]  Some areas are probably testing the censorship
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040]  We've got to push back against this
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040]  Eric Mankow, Mueller
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040]  Of Mankow.com
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.040]  We'll continue to investigate this
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040]  Keep fighting
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040]  And come back soon to give us the findings
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040]  Of your investigation
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.040]  Don't stop fighting, Alex
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040]  All right, we've entered the Mankow manhouse
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.040]  Thank you, sir, you too
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040]  All right, we're going to look at medical tyranny
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040]  Straight ahead
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.040]  Drones, the police state
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.040]  Executive privilege on fast and furious
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.040]  And war in Syria
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.040]  The Spetsnaz are going in

[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040]  A full acre crisis garden

[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.040]  Remember, in a real crisis
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.040]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.040]  This is Alex Jones for
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040]  Survivalseedbank.com
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.040]  You've heard Alex explain
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040]  How the Silver Lunges Generator
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.040]  Infuses the respiratory system
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.040]  With your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040]  Yet many are unaware
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040]  Of the entire function
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040]  Of the Silver Lunges System
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]  And how it has been designed
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040]  To deliver your silver solutions
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.040]  Anywhere in or on the body
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.040]  My name is Mario Safaldi
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]  And I'm the developer
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.040]  Of the Silver Lunges Generator
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]  Not only does the Silver Lunges
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.040]  System produce endless colloidal
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.040]  And ionic silver solutions
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.040]  It also comes equipped
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.040]  With the proper applicators
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040]  And devices needed
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040]  To deliver your silver solutions
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040]  Directly to key target areas
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.040]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.040]  Topically to the skin
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.040]  And orally for the digestive system
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.040]  Be sure to watch our new
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.040]  7 minute video tour
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.040]  Of the Silver Lunges System
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.040]  At www.silverlungs.com
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040]  To learn more about
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.040]  The Silver Lunges System works
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.040]  As well, we are always ready
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.040]  To answer any questions you may have
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.040]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.040]  Now Daddy didn't like trouble
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.040]  But he came along
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.040]  Everyone that knew him
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.040]  Knew his side that he'd be on
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.040]  He never was a hero
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.040]  For this town he shined in light
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.040]  But you could always find him standing up
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.040]  But what he thought was right
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.040]  He'd say you've got to stand for something
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.040]  Or you'll fall for anything
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]  You've got to be your own man
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040]  You've got to be your own man
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.040]  Not a puppet on a string
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.040]  You never compromise what's right
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.040]  You uphold your family name
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.040]  You've got to stand for something
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.040]  Or you'll fall for anything
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040]  And nowadays a lot of people think that's stupid
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040]  And that's why our country's going to hell
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040]  In a handbasket
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040]  Put up with anything
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.040]  Arm drones in the skies against us
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]  We've got the federal government
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]  Launching Homeland Security
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.040]  And the Pentagon against the farmers
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040]  With the rural council
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040]  We've got the secretary of the army
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.040]  And the council on foreign relations
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]  Announcing two weeks ago
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.040]  They're going to put combat brigades
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]  In every major city
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040]  To deal with the American people
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.040]  And call in airstrikes against us
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.040]  This is all in the news
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040]  They came out and announced the drones
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040]  For us in the last month
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040]  Trying to break our will
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]  People backlashed
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.040]  So they hit the psych warfare button
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.040]  And had 500 plus articles the last week
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.040]  I just noticed this this morning
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.040]  Saying I'm a liar and there's no drones
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040]  No arm drones
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040]  And no drones watching farmers
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040]  They must have missed the North Dakota family
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.040]  Arrested on their farm
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.040]  They must have missed all the LA times
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040]  You name it
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040]  Reporting on drones and fixed wing aircraft
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040]  Watching people
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.040]  But they ran the hoax
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040]  And even got Fox News
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.040]  Megan Kelly to say
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.040]  Okay, they're watching farmers and their cows
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.040]  With manned aircraft
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.040]  Well, in that particular case
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.040]  This is a little game they play
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.040]  They think you're stupid
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.040]  Just like 10 years ago
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.040]  Their lie was
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040]  There is no mercury in the vaccines
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.040]  And then we told people
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040]  And others did
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040]  Read the insert
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040]  Demand the insert
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040]  The Marisol Mercury
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.040]  Then they said
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.040]  Okay, the Marisol is good for you
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:34.040]  I actually have national and local newscast
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.040]  We've played it probably 200 times
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.040]  I'm not going to play it again
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040]  You know what, actually do queue up later
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  It'll take the mercury is good for you
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040]  It's on YouTube, CBS News
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.040]  That mercury is good for children's brains
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040]  Now, mercury is the most deadly heavy metal
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.040]  That causes electrochemical explosions in the brain
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.040]  I've had brain surgeons, neurologists
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.040]  I've shown you electron microscope footage
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040]  From the University of Calgary
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.040]  And the University in London
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.040]  Neurosurgery
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.040]  Showing different with human brain tissue
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040]  In a petri dish
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040]  And pig tissue, brain tissue
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  Very similar to ours
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.040]  The electrochemical explosions
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.040]  That happen with mercury
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.040]  Now, they tell you there's no drones
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040]  After saying there's drones
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.040]  It's just like
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040]  Don't run where your friends in Mars attacks
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.040]  Where they're running around with their ray guns
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040]  Shooting people
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.040]  And they go, don't run
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040]  People stop, they shoot them
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.040]  Decentigrate them and go
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.040]  I mean, it's the same thing
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.040]  Don't run, we are your friends
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040]  This is a standard
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040]  We've got to get that clip from Mars attacks
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040]  Where they're running around with a broadcaster
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040]  Going, don't run, we are your friends
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040]  Don't run, we are your friends
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.040]  I mean, that's all this is
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.040]  There's no checkpoints
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040]  There's no mercury on the shots
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040]  Oh, there is, it's good for you
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.040]  Oh, we ship guns in the next cut of Y
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040]  In the second element
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]  We have executive privilege
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]  Oh, we didn't know about that
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040]  But we did
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.040]  Oh, I mean, just crime after crime
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.040]  After crime after crime after crime
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.040]  And now they've got EAS
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.040]  Breaking in on cell phones, computers
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]  It's in the news
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.040]  They're testing it state by state
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040]  It's just frying things
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.040]  People are on the phone with their sick grandmother
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040]  It breaks in with an
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.040]  Announcement from Obama
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040]  Thousands of stores and malls
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040]  Have huge jumbo trons
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.040]  Saying, report your neighbors, trust no one
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.040]  I mean, we've got video of it
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.040]  They're just sinking us into this martial law
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040]  Hundreds of armored pill boxes
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040]  For highway checkpoints
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.040]  450 million rounds of hollow point 40 cal
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040]  The army admits they're building
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]  Re-education camps
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.040]  Admits the document we got
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.040]  Israel and no news coverage of it
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040]  And we talk about it
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040]  And they cut stuff off
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.040]  And then we're talking to a program
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040]  A director slash manager
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.040]  Earlier when man cows on
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.040]  We're going to our next guest
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]  And he's like, well, no, I called in
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.040]  And I guess I put more of you guys on the air
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040]  But I mean, I got a family
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]  I'm just trying to
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040]  That's the point
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]  You're not gonna have a family
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.040]  If you don't stand up and fight for freedom
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.040]  And I don't mean overseas fighting globalists
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040]  Created al-Qaeda
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040]  They give Libya and Syria
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.040]  Put the Muslim brotherhood in
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.040]  And basically kill Mubarak
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040]  Now that the transitions happen
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  He's brain dead now right on time
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  They're taking over
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040]  It's happened in history over and over again
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040]  And folks, they're putting a police state in
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040]  Because they're planning to fully collapse
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040]  The economy
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.040]  I mean, I have a financial times of London article
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.040]  We're gonna cover it at the start of the next hour
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040]  Because we have a guest we're about to go to
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.040]  Where documents were leaked out of the EU
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.040]  Confirmed EU parliament
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.040]  Saying we are creating a banker union
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.040]  We are run by megabanks
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.040]  And all the major ministers
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.040]  Are former Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040]  Or other megabanks
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.040]  You know, the big French bank, you name it
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.040]  Societal General
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040]  However you say it, I can't speak French
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.040]  I mean, this is in your face
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.040]  Banker union
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040]  How many years have I told you?
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]  It's a banker union
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]  That's their word
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040]  A banker technocracy
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.040]  Where all the tech and everything you buy
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040]  Has smart meters wired into it
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.040]  To watch, listen, and control you
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.040]  And now stations know this
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.040]  They're getting now weekly calls
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040]  Not monthly, not twice a year
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]  To test the EAS
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040]  There's more and more break-ins
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  More and more announcements
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.040]  More and more tattle-tale billboards going up
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.040]  More and more militarization of police
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.040]  More and more arming against us
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040]  As they implode Europe
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.040]  And get ready to implode us here
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.040]  While telling us that our economy's never been better
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040]  We're not gonna get out of this
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.040]  Without kicking them out
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  You understand, because it's a planned takeover
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.040]  That's how we could tell you
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040]  15, 16, 17 years ago
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040]  Everything that would transpire
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.040]  Now that's enough for me on that subject
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.040]  I wanted to get Dr. Peter Glidden back on
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.040]  Because it was such a popular response
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040]  And he'll be with us for the rest of the hour
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.040]  They don't cover news for 30 minutes to take calls
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040]  Then I've got from Rio de Janeiro
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.040]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.040]  Former top congressional adviser
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.040]  They're openly announcing world government
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.040]  Cutting off our resources down there
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  Here's the headline, you an official
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.040]  Western nations don't need more cars
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]  More TVs, whatever
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040]  Needs to be paid to world government
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.040]  Dr. Peter Glidden, BSND
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.040]  Naturopathic doctor, received his BS degree
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040]  From the University of Massachusetts
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.040]  Amherst, earned his ND from
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.040]  University in Seattle, Washington
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040]  This is Barrister
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040]  Or Basker, I can't report
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.040]  I can't read anything, I'm public school educated
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040]  Dr. Peter Glidden is an outspoken advocate
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.040]  Of holistic health, for more than two decades
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.040]  He's been treating people with naturopathic therapeutics
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040]  Including homeopathy, heavy metal
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.040]  Helation, herbal medicine and bioidentical
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040]  Harmone supplementation
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040]  I'm not going to go over the whole deal
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040]  Of all the lectures he's given
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040]  The information he's put out, it's just amazing
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040]  His new book, The MD Emperor Has No Clothes
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.040]  Is a jaw dropping
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.040]  Exposed to say of the shortcomings
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.040]  Of the conventional MD directed medicine
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040]  And the unrelated
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  Excellence of holistic medical treatments
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.040]  Or the unrevealed
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  Okay, now let's just stop right there
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.040]  I'm so hyped up folks, I can barely talk right now
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.040]  I'm talking a hundred miles an hour
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.040]  Because so much is happening
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040]  Obama's been caught perjuring
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040]  He's now declared executive privilege
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040]  It's shades of Nixon, all of that's
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040]  Going on
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040]  We've confirmed from 60 stations
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040]  That mancals on, whenever I'm on the show
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040]  Talking about FEMA camps
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040]  They scramble us
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.040]  Again, ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040]  When I used to just be on shortwave
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.040]  They would move Voice of America over
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.040]  And jam us publicly
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040]  And they would have the Chinese do it
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.040]  I mean, they do not want this information
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  Getting out, because it's so horrible
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040]  If people really discover their
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.040]  Re-education camps, if they really discover
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040]  This before they're able to roll it out
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.040]  With some new staged event, we're going to win
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040]  Hard enough for me
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.040]  Again, Dr. Peter Glidden joins us
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.040]  To get into a host of issues
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.040]  Why are we going from
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.040]  1 in 25,300 with autism
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.040]  30 years ago to 1 in 58
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040]  1 in 40 something in South Korea
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040]  They only come with higher
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040]  Vaccine rates than we do
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040]  Why is obesity on the rise
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.040]  What's happening, what's all this stuff
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040]  About trying to ban sugar drinks
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.040]  And milk and popcorn, but not aspartame
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040]  GMO, the rest of it
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.040]  Dr. Glidden is going to talk about all of this
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.040]  Dr. Glidden, you know I'm ranting here today
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040]  What do you have to say about what I've said so far
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040]  Alex, I'm with you
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  1,000% and let me tell you something
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040]  All of this stuff that's going on
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]  Right now about controlling our
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.040]  Minds, controlling our pocketbooks
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.040]  Controlling everything
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040]  Well, you know it's been happening in the background
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.040]  Right, well I've got news for you
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040]  For the last 100 years
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040]  Since 1920, since something called the Flexner report
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040]  The exact same thing
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.040]  Has happened in medicine
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040]  But it's happened right in front of your face
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040]  And you know the best place to hide something
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.040]  Is right in front of your face
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.040]  Since the 1920s
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.040]  The medical theater in the United States
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.040]  Has been completely dominated
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.040]  By the MDs
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.040]  Now you know, MDs
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.040]  Do not own medicine
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.040]  MDs are trained
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040]  In one aspect of medical science
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.040]  In one aspect of medical science only
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.040]  And that aspect of medical science
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.040]  Is really good for surgery
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.040]  For trauma
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.040]  You know, you got a bullet in your arm
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.040]  You got a third degree burner and a handful
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.040]  Of infectious diseases, but that's it
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.040]  However, they have brainwashed
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.040]  You and me and everybody else
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.040]  In this country to believe
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.040]  That MD-directed medicine
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040]  Is the only medicine for everything
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040]  And everybody else is a back of the bus quack
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040]  And while we have let
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.040]  This profession control
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.040]  And monopolize the medical theater
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.040]  Our health has gone to hell
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.040]  In a handbasket
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.040]  Autism rising, Alzheimer's rising
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.040]  Blood pressure rising, obesity rising
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.040]  Life expectancy falling
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.040]  The leading cause of bankruptcy
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.040]  Medical bills
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.040]  This is not because of
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.040]  Financial profiteering by pharmaceutical companies
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.040]  It is not because of insurance fraud
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.040]  It is not because of anything
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.040]  Other than one thing
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040]  That only myself and Dr. Wallach
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.040]  Are talking about
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040]  The reason we have a healthcare crisis
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.040]  In this country
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.040]  The reason we're dropping like flies
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040]  Is because MD-directed
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.040]  Medical treatments for chronic
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040]  Illness do not
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.040]  Work
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.040]  And the best thing that anybody
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  In this listening audience can do
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040]  If you have a chronic health disease condition
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.040]  If you have asthma type 2 diabetes
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.040]  High blood pressure, insomnia
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.040]  Heartburn, fire
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040]  Your MD now
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040]  Stop going to your MD
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.040]  The only thing these people are good for
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.040]  Is trauma, surgery
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.040]  And a handful of infectious disease
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040]  I'm right there with your brother
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040]  As bad as you think it is
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040]  As far as government stuff going on
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.040]  In the background, it's 100 times worse
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.040]  With medical stuff going on
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.040]  Right in front of our face
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.040]  And we don't even see it
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040]  Let's break down some of that history
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.040]  How the Rockefellers openly took over medicine
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040]  About 90 years ago
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040]  And then I want to look at
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040]  Some of the most deadly things
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  That they're putting in the food
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040]  Obviously by design to degenerate us
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040]  And then sell us treatments for the disease
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.040]  They've given us, we'll be right back
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.040]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.040]  And the most deadly thing
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.040]  Is the lack of a relationship
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.040]  And one of the biggest is that men are losing
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040]  Libido or sexual desire
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040]  Especially if you're a man over 40
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.040]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.040]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.040]  A man in every way
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.040]  That's why we created T-Gen
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.040]  T-Gen is an all-natural formula
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.040]  With ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.040]  Optimum testosterone levels mean better mood
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.040]  Energy and of course better sex life
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.040]  Here's Gina from California

[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.040]  I certainly liked the other effects it had on him
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.040]  Great product
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040]  And now for the first time

[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040]  If you've been paying attention
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040]  The ranger's broadcaster went into a fit
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040]  Of mindless gibbering
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.040]  This is happening more and more
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.040]  On television with people
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.040]  It's happening in parliaments and congresses
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.040]  In the western world
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.040]  And every time it happens
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.040]  You end up finding out they're on Prozac
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040]  Zoloft, drugs like this
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.040]  The zombie face eater
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.040]  He was on psychotropic drugs
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040]  We later learned, they'd blamed it on illegal drugs
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.040]  And again, it's just the curse of this system
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.040]  I've seen numbers of breast cancer
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.040]  Up to 3,000%
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.040]  The US leads it
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.040]  And Doc, it's always
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.040]  Oh, we need to find the cure
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.040]  Not, hey, why is this exploding?
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.040]  I mean, because you were saying earlier
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040]  We're leading the pack and everything
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040]  Everything's increasing
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040]  I disagree, everything is exploding
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.040]  I mean, almost everyone I know has cancer
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.040]  Or know someone that does
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.040]  Young people, pediatric cancer
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040]  Up over 10,000%
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.040]  I mean, we talk about this
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.040]  What is going on, Dr. Glidden?
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.040]  The problem is
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040]  With cancer
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.040]  And the problem is with chronic disease
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.040]  That the people that are in charge
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.040]  Of our healthcare, the MDs
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.040]  Their philosophy of training
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.040]  The MDs are not trained in medicine
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.040]  MDs are trained in allopathic medicine
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.040]  I'm not trained in medicine
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.040]  I'm trained in naturopathic medicine
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.040]  There's chiropractic medicine, homeopathic medicine
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.040]  You know, there's a lot
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040]  Of different slices of the medical pie
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.040]  The slice of the medical pie
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.040]  That the MDs are trained in
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.040]  Is one very small section
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.040]  And you know
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040]  Their view, their understanding
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040]  Of health and illness
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.040]  Is seen through a lens
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.040]  They're like colorblind art critics
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.040]  MDs are like colorblind art critics
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.040]  They can only see certain things
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040]  And they are blind
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.040]  To a great deal of information
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.040]  That makes their therapeutics fail
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040]  But their profession is so full
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040]  Of hubris and so arrogant
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.040]  And has been in the driver's seat
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.040]  For so long that they think
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.040]  There you know what doesn't stink
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040]  And so instead of
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.040]  Re-investigating their perspective
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040]  Instead of re-investigating
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.040]  Their stance, their understanding
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.040]  Of the genesis of disease
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.040]  When their treatments fail
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.040]  And let me tell you something
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.040]  Their treatments are failing all over
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.040]  The planet, instead of looking
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.040]  At themselves and you know
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.040]  Taking a different tact which
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.040]  A sane person would do
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.040]  In the patient
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040]  Oh, it's not the doctor's fault
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040]  It's not the medical profession
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.040]  It's not the MD's perspective
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.040]  It's the patient's gene
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.040]  It's got to be genetic
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040]  This is the whole, this is the greatest
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.040]  Scapegoat that the MDs are using
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.040]  To cover up their disease
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040]  Oh yeah, I have a clip in the end game
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040]  Of the head of the state psychiatric board
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.040]  The state reps are saying
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040]  Why are over two-thirds of the foster kids
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.040]  On psychotropics, an average of seven
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.040]  And they said they have bad genes
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.040]  They come from bad gene pools, they're bad people
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.040]  I mean, that's a quote, here's the daily mail
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.040]  Top doctor chilling claim
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040]  The national health service kills
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.040]  Of 130,000 elderly patients
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.040]  Every year, they won't give them treatments
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040]  Over there
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040]  Now they're talking about government-run healthcare
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040]  Here, we see these top bioethicists
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  Who are eugenicists, Dr. Glitton
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.040]  Saying let's kill old people
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040]  Let's kill kids up to age three
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040]  Even if they're healthy
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.040]  And MDs, that's the grassroots as you say
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040]  What about the
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  The overall eugenics angle
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.040]  It's not just bad MDs
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040]  That are causing pediatric cancers
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.040]  To go up 10,000%
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.040]  Well look, here's the deal
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.040]  To a large extent
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.040]  It is, and there's a point here
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040]  That needs to be understood
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040]  The type of, the
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040]  Aspect of medicine and health
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040]  That MDs are trained in is one small aspect
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.040]  So for instance, let's say
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.040]  You and I had scurvy
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040]  Scurvy is caused
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040]  By not enough vitamin C
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.040]  That's what causes it
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040]  And scurvy is a nasty, debilitating, horrifying disease
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.040]  And it'll kill you
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.040]  It's caused by not enough vitamin C
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.040]  If you have scurvy, you take vitamin C
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.040]  It goes away
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.040]  If you went to a doctor
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.040]  And you had scurvy, and that doctor
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040]  Did not know anything about
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040]  Medical nutrition, had zero training
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040]  Zero respect, zero experience
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040]  With medical nutrition
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040]  They would not know that it was a vitamin C
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.040]  Deficiency disease, so they would throw
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.040]  Drug after design or drug
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040]  And surgery at your condition
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040]  And that's what they do now
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040]  I was reading that a lot of people
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040]  Do have scurvy-like symptoms
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040]  And they're just dead because the MD won't tell them
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040]  Well they don't know
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.040]  This is the problem
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040]  The MD doesn't know
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.040]  They don't know
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.040]  They're only trained in drugs and surgery
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.040]  Drugs are like guns
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.040]  Nothing wrong with a drug, it's how it's used
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.040]  The way that drugs are used by the MDs
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.040]  In the United States
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.040]  It's the leading cause of death
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040]  Let me say it again
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.040]  The leading cause of death in the United States
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.040]  Are therapeutics delivered by MDs
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.040]  It's more than heart disease and more than cancer
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.040]  And because we don't know
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040]  There are science-based alternatives
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.040]  We keep going back to these
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040]  Let's talk about every time we get sick
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.040]  Let's talk about those numbers
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.040]  Even the EPA
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.040]  Excuse me, FDA
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.040]  Has come out and admitted that one of the biggest causes of death
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040]  They say number three
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.040]  Is hospitals and prescribed drugs
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040]  And then I want to look at
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040]  Some of your research
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.040]  And Dr. Wallach's research on what people can do
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:30:05.040]  For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with eFoodsDirect
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040]  As a listener, you know why you need to have a supply

[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.040]  Every day we document the attempts
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.040]  To take control of our lives
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.040]  But there's one thing we can all control
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040]  Your greatest dependency

[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.040]  The last place you want to be
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.040]  Is on the road

[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.040]  You'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:16.040]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:21.040]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans

[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.040]  Blue diamond gussets

[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.040]  From enemies, foreign and domestic
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:19.040]  It's Alex Jones
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:23.040]  We are back live here ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040]  You know I did a lot of research into health
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.040]  Because I dedicated myself to working 17, 18 hours a day
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.040]  From about 1996
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040]  Until about three years ago
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.040]  And before I was in great health
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040]  Jogged six miles every other day
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.040]  Lifted weights almost every day
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.040]  Looked like Bruce Lee or something
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040]  And I just totally quit it
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.040]  Didn't exercise other than occasionally going hiking
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040]  For years
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.040]  And I gained about 80 pounds
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.040]  I've only lost about 42 of it or so
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.040]  And for the last four or five years
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.040]  I tried to exercise, tried to eat less
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.040]  Couldn't lose weight
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.040]  And that's one reason I've got Dr. Peter Glidden here
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.040]  I began to do research
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.040]  And found the great young Jevvie products
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.040]  That we promote at infowarsteam.com
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.040]  We have discounted there with free shipping
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.040]  If you sign up for auto-ship
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.040]  And I got into it and lost, you know
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.040]  Like five pounds or so when I couldn't lose weight before
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.040]  And it's not even advertised as weight loss
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.040]  Beyond taking tangerine, polymers, things like that
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  It's just that if you religiously take it
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.040]  You will get the minerals and the vitamins you need
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.040]  Because the soils have been debilitated
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.040]  That's a simplified breakdown
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.040]  I'm going to get Dr. Glidden's take here in a moment on that
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.040]  And you will immediately, at least I have it
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.040]  Everybody I know has more stamina
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.040]  Your brain works better, you're not as hungry
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.040]  In fact, I've been even exercising less than I was
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.040]  Before I got on it and have lost more weight
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.040]  Than I was when I was exercising really, really hard
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  But I need to go ahead and apply all the exercise
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.040]  And then go ahead and lose the rest of the weight
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.040]  But the point is, they don't even advertise
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.040]  Beyond taking tangerine available
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.040]  This counted there at mfoldwarsteam.com
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.040]  Or polymers and all that as a weight loss thing
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  It's just get the vitamins, the minerals, the nutrients
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.040]  You need, my skin, my fingernails, my hair
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.040]  Everything's sort of growing faster
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.040]  Just an amazing response
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.040]  And that's just a couple of the products
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.040]  There's hundreds of, we've got them all listed
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.040]  Right there at mfoldwarsteam.com
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.040]  And your purchase also supports the broadcast
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.040]  There's a business opportunity if you want to become a distributor
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040]  We're actually looking for people that are
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.040]  Understand health and issues like that
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.040]  Who want to be managers in the organization
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.040]  We're growing, find out more at mfoldwarsteam.com
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:54.040]  But the main push is simply about people rediscovering health
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  And this is not being really taught by anybody else out there
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  They don't even advertise this again as weight loss type stuff
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.040]  And that's what's so exciting about it
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.040]  Now Aaron Dykes totally follows the program
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.040]  He takes like 10 different things
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.040]  I only take three different things
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.040]  Essential fatty acids, pollen burst, and the
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.040]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.040]  And I'm starting to take a few of the other things
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.040]  I've just never been, somebody taking pills
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.040]  Somebody drinking, you know, vitamin drinks
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.040]  Sometimes I catch myself for a day or two not doing it
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.040]  And I'm like, wow, that's why I've been so hungry
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.040]  I've got to drink my Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.040]  I just get so busy that, hey, bring some food in
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.040]  I'll shovel it in my face during a break
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.040]  But if you stay with the program
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.040]  It's amazing responses
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:42.040]  Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.040]  He starved himself
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.040]  He exercised every day and couldn't lose the weight
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.040]  92 pounds
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.040]  We're going to do a whole video soon
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.040]  Showing the before and after
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  But those of you that watch the show online
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.040]  At prismplanet.tv
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.040]  You've seen the difference
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040]  Or folks out there on the radio
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  Just Google Aaron Dykes
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.040]  And then look at videos he did a few years ago
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.040]  Or a year ago versus now
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.040]  In a year, 92 pounds
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.040]  And it wasn't even hard
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.040]  Because he religiously follows
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.040]  The stuff that has been developed by Dr. Wallach
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.040]  And Glidden and people like Ben Fuchs
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.040]  Again, I've only partially followed it
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.040]  And had incredible results
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.040]  And I'm going to go back to our guest here
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.040]  And get into the facts that are so important
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.040]  And also open the phones up
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.040]  If you have any quick questions for him at 800-25-99-231
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.040]  But people that have Alzheimer's
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.040]  They're skins rotting off
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.040]  They've got scurvy basically
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.040]  They're on statin drugs
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.040]  That attack the brain
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.040]  I've had brain surgeons on breaking that down
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.040]  They won't tell them its vitamin and mineral deficiencies
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040]  And autoimmune problems
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040]  And inflammation on the brain
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.040]  According to the medical doctors I've had on
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.040]  They just tell them here
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.040]  Take these drugs and kill them basically
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040]  The system at the top
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.040]  The eugenicists know exactly what they're doing
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:01.040]  Ted Anderson's dad went on it
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.040]  Memory came back and go fishing
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.040]  It was incredible
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.040]  The doctor tested his blood and said
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.040]  Vitamin K's up
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.040]  What's he on?
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.040]  He's on this vitamin mix
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.040]  A really powerful beyond-tingenturine and EFA's
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  Sensual fatty acids from, you know,
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.040]  Flaks and fish and things
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.040]  And he said, nope, nope, can't have it
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.040]  Boom, dad's gone
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.040]  And I've been given permission
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.040]  To talk about that even though it's very sad
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.040]  Because the doctor is God
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.040]  I mean, this is the real deal
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.040]  And I'm not even saying it's a total silver bullet
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.040]  But compared to what they're doing
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.040]  Compared to what they're selling
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  In the whole establishment medical system
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.040]  This is the biggest revolution I know of
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.040]  Not drinking fluoride water
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.040]  Trying to get healthy
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.040]  Not fighting with your family
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.040]  Getting involved locally, politically
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  But, you know, the big things we can
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.040]  Really do individually is take action
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.040]  Is take action
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.040]  And get ourselves healthy one step at a time
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040]  Don't imagine overnight results
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.040]  But just watch the cumulative results
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  Is nothing less than staggering
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.040]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  There's also a phone number there
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.040]  If you have any questions
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.040]  Or want to become a distributor
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.040]  Or just sign up for ten bucks
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.040]  And get, you know, it's kind of like Costco
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.040]  Or something at the discount
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040]  On all the products when you become a member
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.040]  Or you can just buy the product straight up
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040]  At InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.040]  And your purchase makes what we do here possible
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040]  As well, so I want to thank all of you for that support
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.040]  As well, you can also call 877-551-13001
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  If you have any questions

[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  Now, I'm ranting here
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040]  With Dr. Peter Glitt
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040]  And joining us via video Skype
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040]  For the radio audience
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.040]  Who's not watching on PrismPlanet.tv
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.040]  People always say you're...
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040]  People watching?
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.040]  Yeah, 95% of the audience is undoubtedly radio
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.040]  But I'm always saying watching
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040]  I've got to make that point
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.040]  Explain, you know, maybe the top ten diseases
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.040]  Out there and obesity
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.040]  And neurological disorders
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.040]  All this bone disorders off the chart
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.040]  What is happening in nutrition?
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.040]  Why?
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.040]  Why?
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  Even if it's organic fruits and vegetables
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.040]  A lot of times
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.040]  Why is it so debilitated?
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.040]  What is the secret that Dr. Wallach's discovered?
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:12.040]  Well, there are 91 essential nutrients
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.040]  That the human body needs
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.040]  Or 90, depending on who you talk to
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.040]  Let's say 90 essential nutrients
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.040]  And you cannot get all 90 nutrients
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.040]  From food, it's impossible
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  You can't do it
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.040]  So it is only a matter of time
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.040]  Unless you are supplementing with nutritional supplements
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.040]  Made from good absorbable recipes
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.040]  It's only a matter of time
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.040]  Until your body runs out of something
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.040]  And then something breaks
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.040]  So you run out of vitamin C, you get scurvy
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040]  You run out of calcium, you get high blood pressure
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.040]  You get arthritis, you get type 2 diabetes
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.040]  The majority, over 95% of all chronic diseases
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  Are caused by nutrient deficiencies
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.040]  That's what they're caused by
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.040]  You don't get high blood pressure
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.040]  You have a hydrochlorothiazide deficiency
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  You don't get arthritis of the knee
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.040]  Because you don't have enough
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.040]  Embrel in your body
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.040]  And so forth and so on
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]  Or viox
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:09.040]  The reason that chronic disease is generated
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.040]  Is because your body has simply run out of the raw materials
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.040]  That it needs to fix itself
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.040]  It's that simple
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040]  The tragedy here in the United States
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.040]  Is that the medical profession
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  That is in charge of our health
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.040]  And in the way that it is directed
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.040]  Pharmaceutical centrist medical profession
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  They do not know this
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.040]  MDs have no training, no appreciation
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.040]  No respect and no clinical experience
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  With nutrition
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.040]  So they don't know
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  Well I've seen studies in the mainstream news
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  Doc that the worst food anywhere
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.040]  Is what's served at hospitals
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.040]  Well it's true
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.040]  And look quite frankly
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.040]  You wouldn't take your laptop to a plumber
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.040]  To get it fixed, right
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.040]  Or more appropriately
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.040]  You wouldn't take your laptop to an electrician
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  To fix it
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  Both deal with electricity, right
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.040]  But the electrician's the wrong guy
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  To fix your laptop
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  Well taking your body with a chronic illness
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.040]  To an MD
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.040]  That's the wrong guy for the job
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.040]  And this is why our health is suffering
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.040]  I will give you a quick example from
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.040]  Our point of view, autism
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.040]  Is not related to mercury toxicity
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  Mercury toxicity is a very big deal
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.040]  It was a very big deal
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.040]  And I was one of the first naturopathic physicians
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.040]  In this country to do heavy metal chelation
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.040]  To remove mercury from the body
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  I know what I'm talking about
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.040]  From our point of view, autism
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.040]  Is caused by chronic nutrient deficiencies
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.040]  In the embryo as it's developing in the womb
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  The mother is egregiously under-nutrified
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  And you know why the mother is egregiously
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.040]  Nutrified?
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.040]  Wheat, barley, rye, and oats
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:41.040]  Whole grains are some of the worst foods
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.040]  That anybody can eat
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.040]  When you eat whole grains
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.040]  They destroy the tissue in the intestinal tract
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.040]  It absorbs nutrients
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.040]  And in this country in the last 40 years
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.040]  There's been a 65% increase in grain consumption
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.040]  And that is what is driving autism forward
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.040]  From our point of view
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040]  And this is the tip of the iceberg
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have arthritis
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.040]  If you have type 2 diabetes
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.040]  If you have heartburn
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.040]  If you have eczema
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.040]  If you have any chronic health condition
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040]  And you have it for more than six months
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.040]  You have gone to the wrong doctor
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.040]  You cannot fix a nutrient deficiency disease
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040]  With a drug
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.040]  And when you try, it will kill you
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040]  Which is why MD-directed treatments
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.040]  Kill 780,000 people
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.040]  The ear-heart disease kills 700,000
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.040]  And cancer kills 550,000
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.040]  Which leads to the unbelievable statistic
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.040]  That your MD is more dangerous than cancer
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.040]  Fire your MD now
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.040]  By the way, Alex
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.040]  That's the name of my radio program
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.040]  Right here on the GCN network
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.040]  Fire your MD now, folks
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.040]  We talk about these subjects every day
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.040]  From 4 to 5 central
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040]  You need to educate yourself
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040]  You need to pull back the curtain
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.040]  On when drugs are good and when they're bad
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.040]  And what you can do right now
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.040]  Like Alex did
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:58.040]  Like the members of his staff did
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040]  To recover their health
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.040]  Because it is easy
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.040]  It is easier than falling off a potato truck
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.040]  To recover your health
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.040]  But you don't know what you don't know
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.040]  Sure, sure
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.040]  So I'm taking beyond taking tangerine
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  Polymerced instead of drinking the afternoon coffee
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.040]  And I am taking essential fatty acids
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:20.040]  Whenever it's late at night
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.040]  And I'm starving
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040]  I want to go to the store and get Bluebell ice cream
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.040]  And I've lost like falling off a potato truck
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.040]  42 pounds
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.040]  And then it just stopped
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.040]  I feel great
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040]  I feel super aggressive
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.040]  Like when I was 18 years old
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.040]  That's a problem though
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.040]  Because I was pretty aggressive
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.040]  When I was 18 years old
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.040]  I'm seething basically
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.040]  And I'm almost afraid to do everything else Aaron's doing
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.040]  What else should I start using
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.040]  That we promote at infowarsteam.com
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.040]  Well, the biggest deal here
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.040]  Is to secure a nutrient program
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.040]  That gives you all 90 essential nutrients
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040]  You know, you don't need 50 nutrients
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.040]  You don't need 60
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.040]  You don't need 70
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.040]  You need 90
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.040]  And so I'm getting that with beyond taking tangerine
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.040]  No, you're not
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.040]  You're getting all 90 essential nutrients
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.040]  In one healthy start pack
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.040]  One healthy start pack
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.040]  Which is the beyond tangy tangerine
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.040]  The essential fatty acids
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.040]  And the liquid calcium
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.040]  Those three all together
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.040]  Give you, me and everybody else
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:19.040]  And by the way, Ted Anderson
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.040]  This really happened
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.040]  Ted was limping
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:22.040]  Was going to get surgery
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.040]  That's why about a year and a half ago
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.040]  He said, you got to get involved in this
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.040]  He goes, I'm telling you
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.040]  He took that liquid stuff
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.040]  I only take it sometimes
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040]  My wife takes it in a big model
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.040]  What's it called?
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.040]  Osteo-FX
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.040]  Yeah, he took that for six months
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.040]  And the knee doesn't need surgery
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.040]  And the MDs were blown away
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.040]  Well, Theo Ratliff
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.040]  Used to be the see-with-I-think the oldest
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.040]  Or the second oldest player in the NBA
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.040]  He just retired from the LA Lakers
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.040]  $100 million in NBA contracts, right?
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.040]  12 years ago, his team doctors
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.040]  And his trainers told him that he was done
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040]  Because he had bone spurs
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.040]  He had osteoporosis in his wrists
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.040]  He had ligaments and tendons
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.040]  That were horrible
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.040]  They told him he was done
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.040]  His career was over
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.040]  He called Dr. Wallach up
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.040]  Said, Doc, what do I do?
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.040]  Doc said, stop eating these foods
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040]  Start eating these foods
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.040]  And take your healthy start pack
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040]  Theo took his healthy start pack
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.040]  Followed Wallach's advice
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.040]  The next year he came back
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.040]  After his team doctors told him he was done
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040]  The next three years he led
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.040]  The league in rebound recoveries
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.040]  And from the time that his doctors told him
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.040]  He was done until he retired
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.040]  He made an extra $38 million
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.040]  And that's Dr. Wallach driving the bus
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, no kidding
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.040]  Dr. Wallach has forgotten more about medicine
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.040]  Than most physicians know
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.040]  His therapeutics for healthy blood sugar
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.040]  Healthy bones and joints
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.040]  You name it, are unparalleled
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.040]  In the world of holistic medicine
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.040]  Let me stop you
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.040]  Let me stop you
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.040]  Theo is on record
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.040]  That he made that $100 million
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.040]  Because of the fact that he wasn't being told
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.040]  That all that sweating
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.040]  All the real vitamins and minerals
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040]  Were coming out of him
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:06.040]  He talks about how it was basically instant
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.040]  When he got on the young Jebedee products
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.040]  People don't understand, young Jebedee
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.040]  Is one of the now most successful
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]  And biggest companies out there
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040]  Hundreds and hundreds of products
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.040]  That they've developed
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.040]  Or products they liked that they buy
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.040]  That are available discounted
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.040]  At infowarsteam.com
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:24.040]  This is a revolution against the system
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.040]  And now I was reading
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.040]  Where overall longevity in the NBA
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.040]  Is increasing and in sports
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040]  Not just with him, with others
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040]  As they discover this
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.040]  Because their team people
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.040]  Weren't telling them
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.040]  They needed 90 minerals
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.040]  And other essential elements
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:40.040]  Continue
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.040]  Well, you don't know what you don't know
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.040]  And this is the deal, you know
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.040]  We are on the cutting edge
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.040]  Of medical nutrition
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.040]  Thanks to decades of Dr. Wallach's research
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.040]  And by the way, it's interesting
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.040]  Because all of the research
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.040]  That informs everything
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.040]  That the young Jebedee company sells
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]  All of the research was because
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  Of mercury toxicity
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.040]  In Japan in the 1960s
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.040]  It was a big deal, there was mercury poisoning
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040]  Everybody in Minamata village
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.040]  Got poisoned by mercury
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.040]  Hundreds of people died
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.040]  Everybody got sick
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.040]  And all the kids that were born
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.040]  Were like Frankenstein
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.040]  Because of mercury poisoning
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.040]  The scientific community freaked out
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040]  It sent a shock wave
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]  Through the scientific community
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.040]  Because they thought it was, you know
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.040]  An extinction level event
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040]  If mercury can do this
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.040]  What about lead and PCBs
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.040]  And everything else?
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.040]  So they put together a $25 million
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.040]  12-year project to figure out
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.040]  The net negative effects of pollution
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.040]  And how to increase body health
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.040]  And you know who was in charge
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040]  Of all of that?
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.040]  Dr. Wallach
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.040]  Dr. Wallach was in charge of $25 million
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.040]  Of federally funded research
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.040]  That took place over 12 years
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.040]  And that research dialed in
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.040]  Medical nutrition as we know it today
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.040]  This is not theoretical
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.040]  Mambo jumbo folks
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.040]  This is science-based clinically verified stuff
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  That you can do right now
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  But your MD either does not know this
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.040]  Or does not want you to know this
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.040]  Because medicine in the United States
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.040]  Is a for-profit industry
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.040]  Well, MDs have been called
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.040]  My dad has a friend
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  Who just won a lawsuit against the doctor
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.040]  Where he needed two stents in his heart
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.040]  Maybe
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.040]  And instead he put something like a dozen in
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.040]  Just to make money
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040]  And it turned out he'd been doing it to a lot of people
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  A lot of these guys are cold-blooded mercenaries
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.040]  Who literally do whatever they want
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.040]  And could care less about you
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.040]  What's going on with the calcification
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.040]  Of the arteries?
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.040]  Well, calcification
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.040]  There's two things to clog arteries
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.040]  One is cholesterol and the other is calcium
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.040]  When you have calcium in your arteries
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:45.040]  It's because you don't have calcium in your blood
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.040]  It's because you don't have enough magnesium
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:50.040]  The main cause of calcium deposition in arteries
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.040]  Is not enough magnesium in your blood, period
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  It's not genetic
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040]  It's not the aging process
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.040]  It's not anything
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  And by the way, if any medical professional tells you
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.040]  That your condition is genetic
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.040]  I want you to take a breath
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.040]  Take two steps forward and say, really, doctor
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]  It's genetic
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.040]  Which gene would that be?
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]  It ain't genetic
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:13.040]  Medical doctors say things are genetic
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.040]  They haven't even tested your genes
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.040]  And they just throw it out
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.040]  What happens is genes will make you
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.040]  Have a higher proclivity from my research
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.040]  From mainline, even the mainline science
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:25.040]  If you have deficiencies, traumas, toxins
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.040]  It will trigger it faster with somebody's genetics
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.040]  But it isn't a death sentence, generally
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]  Yeah, that's called epigenetics
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.040]  And there's a big difference, right?
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.040]  Genetic stuff is like the color of your eyes
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.040]  There's nothing I can do to change the color of your eyes
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:42.040]  That's built in, that's genetic
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.040]  But things like type 2 diabetes
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.040]  And rheumatoid arthritis and asthma
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.040]  What about MS and all this stuff exploding?
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.040]  I mean, it's just everywhere
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.040]  Almost everybody I know is getting MS
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.040]  Or this or that
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.040]  I mean, neurological disorders

[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:30.640]  listeners why I have a human skull here in my hands why I have a historic
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:38.360]  crocodile skull from 65 million years ago they say here on my desk yes a real
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:44.320]  skull from India my dad got this when he was in medical school back in the day
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.280]  they told him to actually they needed these for class shortly after he got out
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.200]  of school they banned importation from India this used to be their biggest
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.360]  export was all the homeless folks they put them down in chambers with a bunch
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.880]  of beetles to eat the skin off and they'd cure the bones a few years and
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:05.480]  ship them into the US now they have plastic bones this is a real skull I'm
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.520]  holding here in my hands see we're a bio mechanical creatures and the
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.080]  globalists know this I mean you've got the minions of the system the MDs that
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.720]  are you know taught to be arrogant and you know think that they run the whole
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:24.200]  system but in truth it's part of a larger program I want to keep Dr. Glenn a
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.920]  little bit with us in the next hour then I've got to get into drones huge
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:33.040]  banking news and Mark Moreno's joining us but it really is amazing that that I
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:36.640]  mean the power structure certainly knows this has your research looked into
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.840]  the same areas that I've looked into about the Rockefellers taking over
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.240]  medicine and the rest of it doctor no man that's everything I mean before the
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.080]  1920s in the United States there was a relatively level playing field nobody
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.040]  had the upper hand you know you had the chiropractors the osteopaths the home
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:54.600]  you pass the herbalists in the MDs and there was nobody really had the upper
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:56:00.320]  hand but then the Rockefellers and the Carnegie Corporation specifically they
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.720]  hired this guy named Adolf Flexner to go all around the country and Flexner took
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:09.280]  him five years it flexured at an inventory of all of the medical schools
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.360]  and hospitals in the US that were prescribing drugs and he brought that
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:20.720]  list back to the Carnegie's it's infamously called the the I'll think of it
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.600]  in a minute the Flexner report the Flexner report and the Carnegie's then
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:31.360]  gave millions of dollars of free money to the hospitals in the medical schools
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.280]  that were prescribing drugs and that was the beginning of the end for all
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.520]  other types of medicine they also glad-handed legislators in this country
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.320]  to pass laws that made it illegal to practice medicine unless you prescribe
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:48.240]  drugs now most people today don't know that this happened most people today
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.240]  incorrectly assume that the MDs are the top dog in medicine because their
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.600]  therapeutics are safer more effective more scientific that's not correct
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.040]  MDs are not safe for another one. It's just like big pharma getting laws passed to ban
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.640]  real raw milk which is totally legal in France and sold out of vending machines
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.040]  and is safer and better for you and then it literally is like a live vaccine they
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.960]  they make their money out of creating monopolies and now they want to shut
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.640]  down what's left of the herbalist tell folks about that codex elementarius the
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.360]  open push now to restrict people as they rediscover this from getting their
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:34.400]  hands on vitamins minerals herbs which are the real original drugs that every
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:39.640]  culture is used that come from the earth well in the United States we're lucky
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:44.200]  because currently there is a law in place called D. Shea which is an acronym for
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.920]  the Dietary Supplement Health Enforcement Act and that law dries a
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.760]  little draws a line in the sand that keeps the pharmaceutical industry out of
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.480]  the vitamin industry so in the US right now we have access to vitamins and
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.600]  minerals without an MDs prescription and you know who was one of the operative
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.400]  players in the passage of that law dr. Wallach dr. Wallach the founder of
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.160]  young Jevvie is one of the he his existence on the planet is one of the
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.560]  reasons you can go to a health food store or online and buy vitamins at the
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.520]  the pharmaceutical industry in Europe and in other parts of the world is trying
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.000]  to restrict this folks and again the Alex pack is the one that has the

[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.760]  you know the MDs and whatnot and you know I sort of find it crazy how you
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:33.280]  know they're able to get away with this shit but at the same time you know I
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.280]  started thinking it back to my past and how you know it is relevant how things
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.680]  are happening out there you know I've been on medicine practically my whole
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:45.360]  life due to ADHD and you know short attention span and whatnot and being
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:50.640]  hyper and whatnot but you know it's they put me on Dexter drain depico prozac and
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.520]  you know that my family sign and waivers saying that it's something happened
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:59.080]  to me or if I happen to immediately get ill that they want to be held
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:02.800]  responsible that's a good point caller I appreciate your points on that we got

[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.080]  children drinking red dye high fructose corn syrup GMO watching television all

[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:14.680]  we've got joining us here in about 25 minutes Martin Moreno from Rio de Janeiro
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:20.880]  at the Earth Summit World Government meeting with big breaking news I got a
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.840]  bunch of other news I want to hit here in just a moment we're almost out of time
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:28.920]  with our guest here today and there's and there's so many points I want to go
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.920]  over with him Barbara in Virginia you're on the air with Dr. Peter Glendon you
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:41.320]  had just talked about your husband on antidepressants for decades and if there
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.440]  was anything natural that could replace that and again we can't give you medical
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.240]  advice here at least I can't over the air I know what medical doctors have said
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:54.040]  about Prozac you better go off drugs like that very slowly or it can cause a
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.960]  serious problem they're very toxic but I know there's a lot of herbs and things
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:02.480]  that I've seen in mainstream news like St. John's warts and other things that
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:08.560]  did much better in double-blind studies than Prozac and things like that so
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.280]  let's go back to a doc to answer her question and let Barbara from Virginia
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.920]  have a follow-up comment go ahead all right very good so the from our point of
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:20.800]  view the leading cause of anxiety is not enough calcium it's a calcium
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:24.760]  deficiency it's not a Prozac deficiency it's a calcium deficiency so if you have
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.480]  anxiety or panic attacks then the first thing to think about is is not enough
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.200]  calcium in the body but really what we do you know if you have a problem with
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:38.760]  your bones we give you the 90 essential nutrients plus extra bone support if you
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:41.960]  have a problem with your liver we give you the 90 essential nutrients plus
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.840]  extra liver support it's not rocket science so in this case we give you the
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.760]  90 essential nutrients plus extra stuff for your brain and central nervous
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.120]  system so the the best product that I've seen for that is something called
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:00.960]  renew IQ so and I would double down on the calcium dose for two months so take
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:07.760]  the Alex pack one extra bottle of calcium and the renew IQ and if you in
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:11.760]  addition to that become gluten-free it's really important that you stop eating
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.840]  wheat barley ryan oats this whole program will work much better and much
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.800]  faster and when you do this program for 60 days then you can go to a pharmacist
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.880]  and have the pharmacist to give you a reduction schedule for your prescription
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:30.000]  medicines start to withdraw with a professional supervision and see how you
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.080]  feel you do not have depression because you have you know a gene a bad gene hey
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.240]  hey I saw an mainstream article last week I meant to cover or even mainlines
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:43.880]  you know MDs were having to admit that a lot of people they say are schizophrenic
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:49.280]  or people that they say you know have mental illnesses or depressed they were
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:55.240]  admitting that it was mercury poisoning in some cases or Lyme's disease I was
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.200]  reading in some states they estimate up to half the population has a Lyme's
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:03.640]  infection and when they go into the MDs they send them to a psychiatrist and
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.360]  they've got people in the funny farm with Lyme's disease they find out put them
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.440]  on antibiotics and they're not schizophrenic anymore I saw that last
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:16.880]  week well you know where Lyme disease came from first first case of Lyme
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.920]  disease was in 1975 in Lyme Connecticut you know it's 10 miles away from Lyme
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:25.760]  Connecticut across the Plum Island Plum Island baby well you know I was
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.160]  looking into life over a facility yeah you know I was looking into it you know
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:35.200]  I'm sorry go ahead who now I'll tell you why I'm looking into my island yeah they
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:38.920]  are I've treated more cases of Lyme disease another any other nature path
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:43.160]  in history I had a private practice on in Cape Cod Massachusetts for 12 years
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:47.440]  it's like the second highest density of Lyme disease on the planet that on
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.880]  Plum Island in the government research facility they had a separate wing for
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:57.600]  tick-borne diseases and then that all of a sudden in 1975 we have Lyme disease
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.960]  where the heck did it come from and I tell you where from it came from Plum
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.240]  Island it was a government created wasn't a deer swimming across I mean you
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:10.800]  just the milder sort of the mainland well yeah that's how they got out because
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.760]  one of the one of the ways that the Lyme parasite persists is it lives in a
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:20.040]  tick that feeds off of the blood of the deer and then the the microorganism the
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:22.680]  spirit key goes into the blood of the deer and then you know it's a whole
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.360]  lifecycle but yeah that's how it got away but all of a sudden in 1975 there's a
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.960]  tick-borne disease that never occurred before Lyme disease is in the same
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:36.200]  category of illness as syphilis is syphilis has been around forever but
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.760]  and it's the same microorganism that caused it but Lyme disease only since
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.880]  1975 don't you think that's let me ask you a question what do you do naturally
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:48.240]  because the MDs won't even tell you if you have Lyme disease most of the time
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  they want to you know put you on drugs they want to keep you sick I mean if you
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:58.640]  do get Lyme disease what's the you know healthy way to deal with it well you want
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.040]  to take the healthy Alex pack because everybody needs the 90 essential
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.080]  nutrients and this is a holistic phenomenon folks you need to have
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:11.440]  everything all the pieces need to be in place you're saying the general public
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.160]  is debilitated that's why things like this are able to affect them everybody
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.080]  is underneutrified everybody is nutritionally deficient every single
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:26.080]  solitary person on the planet is eating the wrong food most of the time and is
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.920]  completely nutritionally deficient when you clean your diet up and take the
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.240]  proper supplementation most of your health concerns all right we've got it
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:37.920]  at info wars team commo to look into that ma'am does that answer your question
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.720]  about your husband whatever prescription drugs he's taking for
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:50.440]  that's gonna do it I'm good and as I could tell everyone just to go try the Alex pack you would be amazed at the results it is
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:55.360]  I can't believe what's happening finally feeling good all right thank you so much
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:59.560]  and again that's just what we're calling it in full worst team comm that the
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.240]  Dr. Wallach says is the most important group of vitamins and minerals to take
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.760]  we're just calling it particular pack the Alex pack to explain that I want to go
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:09.960]  to a bunch of the calls here I could have you on all day I've got to get to
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.520]  other guests all this news but it makes my head spin here to think about here's
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:19.880]  an example my dad growing up in East Texas we have a ranch out there and
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.600]  there's a large black community out there and and you know the families
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:26.400]  friends with all these black families that have been out there forever and
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:31.440]  there's all these old black women that routinely live to be 85 90 100 105 years
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:36.680]  old and of course the old-time white folks did this too but people make fun of
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:41.840]  them locally going and digging out the clay certain clays and then taking it
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.960]  home and eating it and the old black women swear that you need that clay to
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:51.240]  be healthy they don't even know in the wives tells me even though minerals were
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:54.920]  at that time but that's what the old-timers would do they would they
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:00.120]  would grind bone meal into all the bread that has the minerals in it I mean
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.400]  there's an example right there of what the old-timers knew and here are these
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.440]  black women living to be 100 years old routinely but then black folks in the
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:13.680]  cities today are dying at what average age were about 65 yeah and the MDs say
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.520]  it's genetic and it's not and that makes you Alex Jones the smartest man in
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.720]  class because you are 100% spot-on in there's only one place that minerals
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:27.080]  are found it's in the soil but minerals are not evenly spread out in the soil so
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:31.280]  unless you are collecting minerals from some source like clay or you know the
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.760] ongevity supplements and swallowing them you have a mineral deficiency and it is
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.960]  just a matter of time until something breaks and one of the keys to long life
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:46.000]  is mineralization of the human body so I mean I would imagine those those black
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.200]  women eating clay that probably went all the way back thousands of years to
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.960]  Africa yeah I mean it's that you know the body knows what the body knows
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:56.920]  especially when you get out of the way and I was given a lecture I think in
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:00.600]  Utah I think a number of years ago and I was talking about the whole mineral
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:04.560]  thing and a woman sprang up in the back row she raised her hand and I normally
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.520]  don't take questions but she was going crazy and I said what and she said I
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.240]  have to tell you this Dr. Glidden when I have never told anybody else this when
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:16.280]  I was pregnant I used to sneak out of my house in the middle of the night and go
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:20.920]  to this one piece of property that we had and eat the dirt and my baby was
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:24.640]  healthy and I said well yeah your body was telling you what you needed to go
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.920]  but a lot of women have that phenomenon of going out and and their old factory
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:33.640]  nerve picks it up and eating dirt but that's very common yeah and the reason
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:37.000]  that we're inclined to do this is because there's stuff in the dirt that
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.400]  the body needs because we are so unbelievably underneutrified well birds
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:51.160]  eat dirt and it well and it is the the obesity weight gain is not a disease of
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:56.840]  excess obesity is a deficiency disease obesity is a deficiency disease when
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:01.120]  your body runs out of the stuff that it needs the 90 essential nutrients it
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:06.280]  knows that it is running on fumes and it is afraid because it knows your heart's
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:10.240]  gonna go it knows your liver is gonna go it knows your brain's gonna go so it
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:15.360]  forces you to eat in the desperate attempt to fill the nutrient tank up but
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.040]  the food that you're eating doesn't have the nutrients in it that you need and so
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.640]  you go to Olive Garden you eat 2,000 calories and two hours later you're
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:27.480]  hungry again and then your MD tells you your stomach's too big or you're
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:32.320]  lazier you don't exercise enough and it's wrong the only reason we gain weight
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.160]  is we eat too many calories and the only reason we eat too many calories is
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.920]  because we are amazing let's jam in another call here this is an amazing
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:46.120]  info Riley in Detroit you're on the air hey Alex good go ahead hey I had a
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:50.280]  question to dr. Glidden I've used the planted derived minerals for a while
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:54.040]  now and I noticed on the back there's some trace elements of like lead and
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:59.160]  arsenic I wanted you to touch on that and just make sure it's safe and really I
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:03.120]  didn't understand what that was okay good well you know we do a lot of myth
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:06.600]  busting here in this business and I spend a lot of time myth busting what
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.920]  conventional MDs do but there are a lot of myths in holistic medicine as well
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  lead is necessary for DNA synthesis you need it arsenic is necessary to keep
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.040]  your immune system healthy and actually one of the leading they don't do it in
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:25.680]  that many hospitals anymore because you know it's not a conventional drug but
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.600]  arsenic is a really good treatment for leukemia it's one of a really good
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.240]  treatment for some forms of leukemia you can take too much of anything right
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:39.080]  too much sunlight will kill you too much water will kill you too much lead is bad
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:44.160]  for you too much arsenic is bad for you I mean tell me about wrong because I
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:46.600]  looked into this too and there's some other bottoming companies that do it as
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:52.480]  well this tiny trace amounts because it's needed to trigger the other minerals
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:57.120]  and vitamins together it doesn't unlock the key unless there's that tiny trace
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:01.360]  amount and then just like mercury that's in fish mercury is really bad for you
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.040]  but it's bound to the fish that you well you should have been a doctor Alex I
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.560]  mean your ear you're against the spark that's just the research no I mean I've
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.360]  just read research papers look well look I'm telling you man you are
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.760]  absolutely right the body needs a little bit of lead it needs a little bit of
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:24.880]  arsenic it needs a little bit of minerals that most people would incorrectly
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:30.400]  consider toxic it's not the mineral it's how much you take and if you don't
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:34.040]  have enough it's a much bigger problem than getting too much does that answer
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:37.560]  your question Riley yeah I got another quick question for you real quick I've
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:40.960]  been taking like a uvequial bread and I was wondering what you thought about
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:45.840]  that stuff what do you think of the stuff this don't do it in nothing with
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:50.080]  wheat nothing with barley nothing with Ryan nothing with oats and I have a go
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:54.760]  to a fire your MD now calm and there's a whole video against that called against

[02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:10.880]  oh man this show is just going by so fast and I've got so much news we got to
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:18.840]  get into makes my head spin by the way we do have that Mars attack video where
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:21.640]  I'm making the point that they announced the drones they announced their armed
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:25.640]  they start arresting people on their farms and ranches with them it's in the
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:30.960]  Associated Press Reuters legislation is introduced to say they can't do this
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:33.880]  because the military can't operate domestically police shouldn't have armed
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:41.120]  drones and they had literally more than 500 articles the last week 300 the last
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:46.720]  two days a bunch of them saying I'm crazy I'm a liar I can spend hours on this
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.520]  but got other news I've got to get to and that drudge is evil for covering
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.920]  drones and that it's not happening they actually say it's a hoax there's no
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:01.640]  drones because they know people now had a backlash they're like oh no no it
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:06.120]  doesn't exist crazy people crazy people and that's the equivalent of Mars attacks
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.760]  you know this is a real military tactic at Waco they're ramming the charge
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:13.520]  burning it machine gunning people the flare footage shows announcing come out
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:17.520]  with your hands up we are your friends Tokyo rose you know and all these
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:20.960]  different wars they have loudspeakers in World War one on both sides saying come
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.240]  out we're your friends then shoot them when they do this is a military tactic
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.200]  you use on enemies so I here we have the drones this is satire before the New
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:34.480]  York Times runs with us here we have the drones over Vegas a helping the
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:40.520]  population and telling everybody don't run we are your friends here it is
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:57.880]  and again let's play that one more time from the start because this is the proof
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:02.840]  that the Martians are our friends if they ever if the Martians were real and
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:07.240]  they landed with a bunch of drones and we're hitting people with a particle
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:11.560]  beam instead of sodium fluoride and GMO food and everybody starts dying they
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.040]  would just announce we don't run we're your friends and the American people

[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:11.240]  read that from a book written in 1971 we didn't intend to do a plug here but
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:15.320]  it's available at info wars calm back in print none dare call a conspiracy Gary
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:28.480]  Allen with Larry Abraham 1971 I read this in the late 80s when I was a
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.320]  teenager amazing but side issue the point is I'm gonna get to that in a
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:40.720]  moment so I just went over just a quick reprint of just up the last few weeks
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:45.760]  about arresting people with drones watching farms spy satellites watching
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:54.800]  people Denver post government agents from the EPA incestuous flying around now
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.520]  they're buying drones that's the big announcement 40 plus billion dollars to
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:03.360]  buy tens of thousands of them Washington Post reporting it and so there was a
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:07.960]  big backlash drones were one of the big hot items just like TSA groping people
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.880]  are angry state reps were coming out Congress ran Paul in the Senate members
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.120]  in the house legislation to say you can't have the Department of Defense
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:21.840]  involved domestically and you can't have drones without warrants oh if you type
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:27.720]  in drones today into a search engine there's over 500 articles in the last
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:35.000]  week if you type in drones and click Google news and I spent over an hour and
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.920]  a half this morning scanning through them a lot of them of the same articles
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:44.120]  republished just saying none of this exists and crazy people bad people made
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:48.160]  it up now you've heard them announce the drones you've heard them push them
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.200]  you've heard local police and governors and all saying how great it's gonna be
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:57.720]  to have armed drones and then you're told none of it exists here is the
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:05.240]  Missoulean newspaper out of the Billings Gazette Robert backs off claim of EPA
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:09.800]  drone surveillance and then they actually later in the article just say oh
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:14.320]  well this particular operation wasn't drones it was sesnes with EPA people
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:18.320]  watching the ranchers and farmers to start riding them giant tickets if any
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.400]  brown water you know where cows are walking around by creeks runs off giant
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.720]  fines remember last year they were giving $2,000 a
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:32.200]  fine for dust and barns hay dust is now evil but big giant agra their exempt and
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:34.720]  it goes on the drone stories been circulating for several days in the
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:39.040]  right-wing media before he wrote Jackson because it's a big thing in
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:42.880]  Montana conservative talk radio host Alex Jones public you know that's because
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:45.880]  Obama's in office if I criticize Romney if he gets an office I'll now be a
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:49.280]  hardcore Marxist they'll say in the news it's always the same because you gotta
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.000]  be a conservative or a liberal not just a common-sense guy that wants freedom with
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.400]  no agenda but freedom conservative talk show host Alex Jones published the
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.800]  bogus drone story I published a bogus drone story there's no link by the way
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.520]  when they link to info wars it's just a info wars our articles were linked by
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:10.520]  the way to government and media press releases they just linked our site and
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:14.440]  say we're bogus that's why you're discredited that's why info wars is a
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.200]  lot bigger than your little nothing rag you may dance around all day that you're
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:22.280]  the establishment media it's over we make mistakes sometimes this wasn't one
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.000]  of them but you guys do what you do on purpose don't you
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.800]  conservative talk radio host Alex Jones published a bogus drone story on his
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.440]  website info wars comm on June 4th complete with a photograph of a military
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:39.320]  drone flying through the blue skies funny I just showed you LA Times wired
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:44.400]  magazine you name it about thousands of military drones operating inside the
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.960]  United States and people getting arrested citizens with local police
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:53.880]  liaisoning with the Air Force drones I mean I just read to you mainstream
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:58.200]  articles about 64 bases at national parks to fly around the surrounding
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:05.840]  areas but again don't run we are your friends it doesn't exist so we've got
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:14.880]  that report here is media ITE pew those unmanned EPA drones can you guys
[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:18.920]  queue up the Megan Kelly clip from the so-called news show there on Comedy
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:24.440]  Central those unmanned EPA drones spying on farmers were really just manned
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.280]  airplanes oh and it goes on that Matt Drudge just a little Matt Drudge on
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:33.600]  there's a bunch of them and Alex Jones boy they got caught so did Fox News boy
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:38.640]  they got there's no drones and there's articles out there about drone hoax
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:43.800]  exposed it never happened really now there's no drones arresting people in
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:47.440]  North Dakota because they supposedly wrestled cows there's not drones
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:51.040]  watching people that that's not happening even though there's literally
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.600]  hundreds of articles admitting it remember the salacious story from several
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:57.680]  weeks ago that the United States Environmental Protection Agency was
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:02.520]  using unmanned drones much like the ones used in war on terror to spy on
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.560]  Midwestern farmers you might have seen the story reported on Fox News and
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:11.120]  corrected today below yeah because they told him oh those were actually manned
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.480]  ones in that operation and by the way Fox wasn't even wrong they just do that
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:18.640]  they tell her read off the teleprompter say you're wrong and now there's no
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:22.800]  drones there's no airport checkpoints either there's no highway checkpoints
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:26.720]  either there's no Obama fast and furious it didn't happen it was all hoax he
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.200]  didn't do anything wrong it was also reported in the daily show and on other
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.880]  blogosphere and the Washington Post reports the story simply wasn't true the
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.320]  EPA isn't using drone aircraft anywhere at all really I just got a whole bunch
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:44.680]  of articles saying they're buying a bunch of them I mean this is crazy the story
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.480]  originally appeared on several blogs picking up traction of the drudge
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.240]  report linked to info wars article on the story Fox News America line eventually
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:40:00.680]  did a report which were covered here featuring host Megan Kelly and Stuart
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:06.200]  Varney decrying the idea of unmanned drones would be used to enforce EPA
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:11.080]  regulations ladies and gentlemen I saw articles a few weeks ago where the EPA
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:16.280]  that guys look this up EPA to use drones to check for pollution I mean I saw
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.720]  that article just typing in I'm just going for memory EPA to use drones to
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:25.720]  track pollution they were saying I mean again this is how they and you watch the
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:28.800]  drones are being rolled out and we'll be sitting here in a few years with them
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:32.080]  flying over us and they'll say oh well of course we always were going to use the
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:36.160]  drones on you they do this to neutralize opposition when they see opposition
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.680]  forming they neutralize it saying there's no fight
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:45.040]  TSA says we don't grope we don't grope none of that's going on none of that's
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:48.160]  happening and then remember oh we're not groping old ladies in the private room
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:51.400]  turns out they are oh there's no radiation from the scanners we're not
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:59.560]  searching kids under age 11 turns out they are they lie they lie to you and
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:05.480]  again our article on the subject wrote a couple of them links through to the
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:12.840]  announcements of the drones for law enforcement and EPA operations snapping
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:16.800]  photos of livestock farms from an airplane is legal and cost effective way
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.240]  to help protect Nebraska and Iowa streams from runoff contaminations say
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:23.160]  officials the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the agency's aerial
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:25.640]  surveillance program can under scrutiny last week when the brass and
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:29.120]  congressional delegation said a joint letter to EPA administrator Lisa Jackson
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.120]  the elected officials asked Jackson replied by June 10th 25 questions
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.360]  including whether federal law allows such surveillance on Friday EPA
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:43.760]  officials in the agency's region 7 office provided written response and it
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:50.120]  goes on and again they're announcing that all of this drones are already being
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:57.720]  used to arrest people on their farms I mean what about that let's continue right
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.000]  here oh but none of this is happening here's another one of the Washington Post
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:07.280]  raining in the rumor about EPA drones yeah and the NSA to they're not spying
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.760]  on even though they admit they are yeah let's rain that in or the other rumor
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:15.400]  that Google's really in SA which is now admitted or the rumor years ago that
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.040]  Google was stealing people's passcodes with their little mobile trucks now
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:24.560]  admitted or the rumor false reports on EPA drones over Midwest farms alarm
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:31.800]  public that's a another article here out of Midwest democracy.com and they just
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.280]  going to say none of it's true there's no drones here's another one out of the
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:40.960]  Los Angeles Times lie about EPA spy drone thrives in right-wing blogosphere
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.640]  I mean they're announcing 30,000 drones in the Washington Post to surveil
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.920]  everything I remember your articles five years ago about spy satellites being
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:53.160]  used to watch people and farmers in Colorado I just read the BBC where it's
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:57.120]  happening in Europe and they just say it doesn't exist see that's the tactic
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.320]  roll it out there's opposition oh we know we never said that did you hear the
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:06.720]  one about did you hear the one about the EPA spy drones that are darkening the
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:15.160]  skies over America's farms and ranches and it goes on no that is not up for a
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:18.960]  funny punch line there really have been reports of drones casting their evil
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:22.600]  robotic eyes down on the heartland hey guys type in the article about the drone
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:25.440]  crashing last week wasn't that in Maryland or the one in Colorado that
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:30.960]  almost ran in to the passenger jet I mean oh none of that's happening and they
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.080]  have a graphic here says see they're real one of them EPA spy drones was
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.720]  hovering right above the barn and I blasted a kingdom come the evil man's
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:44.760]  he's stupid drone that was grandpa's fancy antique weather vane she knows best
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:50.080]  that idiot with a gun she'll show him as your testosterone level doing to keep
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:55.320]  drinking your BPA they are simply another example of paranoid political
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:00.560]  lunacy being magnified a million times by the blogosphere and Twitter and it goes
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:06.720]  on to demonize anybody that covered it or went over it so again you heard them
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:11.760]  there are no drones they're not watching you the EPA is doing nothing I mean yeah
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:14.560]  they got manned aircraft up there watching you but that's not a big deal
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:18.280]  it's not drones even though they're arresting people on their farms with
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:24.400]  them but hey what's wrong with that cattle buzzed by government flights but
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:29.240]  not by drones Miami Herald so see everything's fine go back to sleep we
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:38.520]  call this now drone denial and it just goes on from there all right
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:46.880]  continuing here ladies and gentlemen let me move right along to this little
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:54.520]  tidbit this is out of the London telegraph headlines secret EU summit
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:45:00.760]  document shows first step in banking union we have it blurb and info wars
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:08.920]  dot com here is the full article London telegraph exclusive
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:18.280]  exclusive secret EU summit document shows first step to banking union that's
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.640]  you can actually pull up our articles where we've called it that it is a
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:26.480]  banking coup d'etat total takeover designed to implode Europe a classified
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:31.920]  draft of next week's EU summit conclusions is the first step on an
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.520]  emerging roadmap that's a quote to a banking union pooling debt via euro bonds
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:45.240]  and political union via EU treaty change over the next ten years the text
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:49.440]  published exclusively the daily telegraph is secret restrictive rise only of
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.160]  diplomats and officials preparing the 28 and 29 junior European Council in
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:46:00.400]  Brussels most of the text the annexed compact for growth and jobs are deals
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.520]  on project bonds and other small-scale EU initiatives at france coast hollandaise
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:11.800]  is for trumpeting in his 120 billion euro growth pack the first which of
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:15.160]  course be loaned by the bankers out of fiat you loan the bankers money loan it
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:18.800]  back to you at interest the first draft is relatively unconventional because the
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:23.240]  euro bond and banking union issues are currently all too sensitive to be
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:29.040]  committed to paper for officials other so-called non papers are circulating a
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:32.880]  top-secret level between the national capitals in Brussels the difficult
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:38.680]  issues not included in the draft are PM items prime minister in the draft other
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:45.720]  financial stability measures and PEC report on EMU
[02:46:45.720 --> 02:46:51.080]  return the page there yeah just move it over to the right a little bit because
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:54.680]  when it's cut off there on the edge you can't really fully read that people
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:47:00.040]  that are watching at prison planet TV thank you and then it just continues in
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:07.880]  to the article and I guess in the printout here I I didn't get the the
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:11.040]  final page of that well you guys reprint this for me because I have
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:14.680]  info wars version and their version but not the actual article here you go I'll
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:17.440]  just give it to you or if you just put it on screen I could probably just read
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:20.480]  it off the screen this is breaking right now here on air if we can just put
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.560]  this back up where I can read it I'll just read it off there that's why I
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.080]  was having to say that so I can actually just read this I'll be able to do that
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:30.840]  right here but the point is is that they're announcing that banks are gonna
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:35.480]  basically run everything and that the government of Europe is just an
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:44.920]  elective bureaucracy with ceremonial organizations that are in place there the
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:48.880]  EU parliament is just ceremonial they just sit there and again we'll put that
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:53.160]  article can you guys put the telegraph back up on screen for me I don't need it
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:57.240]  reprinted we just put it back on screen I'll just be unbelievably awesome there
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:01.600]  it is and okay fine just scroll it up I could probably read it still and then it
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:05.800]  goes over the whole map there's a map right there how the banks are gonna run
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:11.440]  it and the Council of Europe that's unelected and then of course they have
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:15.040]  the parliament but again they don't have any power countries can send their
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:18.520]  minions but the unelective bureaucrats are exempt from their own taxes and their
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:23.920]  own laws it's all right there in the Council of Europe and it says in the
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:28.480]  documents that the big banks I remember reading it this morning basically will
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:32.600]  completely rule everything and it's a banking union a government of foreign
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.360]  by the banks then again now the Economist magazine and others have openly bragged
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:42.400]  about this some translated from Brussels jargon the PEC president of the
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:48.800]  European Council report will be Herman von Rumpi's preliminary text of the
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.680]  future of economic and monetary union this will be circulated in sealed
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:55.800]  envelopes next week because the slaves aren't allowed to see it but it's been
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:00.880]  leaked the separate text will be roadmap to banking union polling debt via some
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.960]  kind of euro bonds we knew this was coming and political union via EU
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:08.760]  treaty over the next 10 years so go into debt to bail out the bankers
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.600]  predominantly the media tells you you're doing this because you're lazy and
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:19.560]  that the debt's yours then then you create euro bonds to pay the bankers
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:24.320]  back interest because you bailed them out that's how this works if you can
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:30.800]  imagine that it is unbelievably off the charts crazy now continuing here with
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:35.040]  the news Obama has announced executive privilege and says Congress just like
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:39.320]  Nixon said has no power to see the documents he said didn't exist he's
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:44.600]  been caught lying about that completely Nixonium and the question is is he
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.840]  above the law he says he can kill US citizens without a judge jury trial or
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:52.920]  arrest he says that our military is under EU in command he says he's God and as
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:56.720]  much as I love to hate Obama he's just a puppet this is what the criminal
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:00.920]  interest that have merged with this global corporate empire want for this
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:05.680]  country and they say despite the fact Obama's declared executive privilege
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:11.520]  they are going to still bring holder before them and still gonna have a
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:15.640]  contempt vote so it's on now this is the perfect time for Obama to start a new
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.280]  war or stage a terror attack and blame it on his political enemies here's Fox
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:25.200]  News issue pushes ahead with holder contempt vote despite Obama intervention
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:28.880]  representative Darrell is to said Wednesday that he is pressing ahead with
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:32.400]  a committee vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.280]  Congress despite an 11-hour move by President Obama to exert executive
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:40.280]  privilege over the fast and furious documents at the heart of the dispute
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:44.520]  will not produce the documents and they can't believe that people would
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:51.240]  actually call them on something why don't they just say in the news there is
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:56.560]  a hoax ATF doesn't exist Obama doesn't exist just like the drones they just
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:01.600]  spent six months telling us they're gonna run our lives with drones
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get

[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:27.040]  don't do that even though it's on thousands of videos so I feel better
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:31.800]  now they also say mercury and bad for you in the vaccines delivered right into
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:36.920]  the bloodstream so I guess everything's okay and they also said that you know
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:43.040]  al-qaeda is good now and can basically take over countries they were bad but
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:48.200]  now the media says they're the good guys in Syria and Libya so I'm to worry
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:52.040]  about al-qaeda anymore and you know like I said they're they say they're not
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:55.680]  launching drones anymore they'd set it over and over again but I guess that was
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:55:00.240]  a mistake because they say now there's the drone stuffs cookie I mean if you're
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:04.560]  trendy and cool you don't even recognize drones in fact one if one flies
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.520]  over your house you didn't see it because you're not a crazy person you're a
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:15.120]  trendy cool person that thinks everything's fine you know also I want
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:19.040]  to apologize when the Stuxnet came out last year we came out and said it was
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:22.840]  Israel and the US government launching it because we had IT experts on it
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:27.000]  identified and analyzed it and we said it was used to shut down the Iranian
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:31.200]  nuclear program of course here's the Washington Post now agreeing and saying
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:36.960]  we were right and breaking it because they say so US Israel developed flame
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:41.440]  computer virus a slow Iranian nuclear efforts and it's part of the Stuxnet but
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.480]  again I want to apologize that I was right and say I was wrong okay okay
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:49.680]  because the government says we should give our rights up on the web because of
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:54.720]  Stuxnet that they launched just like they run Al Qaeda but we should give our
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.280]  rights up because Al Qaeda we need to be groped by TSA but they're not groping us
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:04.520]  because they said so because don't run we are your friends I mean they're good
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:09.480]  people they're they care about us they they ship guns into Mexico to help
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:16.480]  people get the evil guns confiscated here here's some good news Monsanto faced
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:22.720]  with paying 7.5 billion back to farmers that's a present planet.com article and
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:28.920]  it links through to the different articles down in Latin America Monsanto
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:33.560]  may soon be forced to pay as much as 7.5 billion dollars back to farmers who
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:37.920]  say that mega corporation took their rightfully earned income and taxed their
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:41.960]  small businesses to financial shambles yeah because the seeds don't produce new
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:46.000]  seeds it all started with a monumental lawsuit launched by over 5 million
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:49.480]  farmers against Monsanto looking to recover financial losses for a
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.000]  ridiculous seed taxes that bankrupted many families down in Brazil down in
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:59.400]  Brazil back in April a Brazilian court ruled that Monsanto absolutely was
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:03.800]  responsible for paying back the exorbitant amounts of cash back to
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:08.080]  farmers ordering the company to issue back all the taxes collected since so
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:12.040]  for a minimum of two billion dollars afterwards Monsanto appealed the
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:17.720]  decision and the case is now suspended until further hearing is instituted by
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:24.440]  the Justice Tribune the local court stationed in Rio Grande de Sul and it
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:29.000]  just goes on you should read that full article the value involves can total
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:37.520]  15 billion of their their currency equal 7.5 billion US and it just goes on I
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:42.200]  mean Monsanto's got some really monopolistic practices and well they're
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:46.880]  nice people though they did bring us Agent Orange dioxin and and aspartame
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:50.560]  they they got aspartame approved they bought the company Surrell that had it
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.240]  and they're just they're just good people they're good people when their
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:58:00.000]  crops infect yours they trespass take your crop find one percent of their
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:03.520]  genetic senate and then have courts they own rule against you and their
[02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:07.680]  trespassing and they take your property and I think that's good because there
[02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:12.240]  are friends they said don't run we are your friends I see their billboards up
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:17.040]  on the highway says they're friendly says they want to help us says they care
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:24.600]  about us I mean it must be true these are good people very good people I mean
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.360]  look at how much they're helping Greece Greeks ailing economy grinds the halt
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:32.600]  turns out all that austerity stalled their economy further so they can't pay
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:57.000]  back the debt that was the plan that's what the Bankster gangsters do
