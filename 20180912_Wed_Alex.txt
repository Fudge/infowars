[00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:36.541]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.827]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.910]  We're an American band.
[00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.892]  InfoWars is made in the USA.
[00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:18.994]  InfoWars is made out of pure Americana and victory.
[00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:23.377]  InfoWars is the sword Excalibur to take on the Globalist.
[00:01:23.377 --> 00:01:27.360]  But you have to pull the sword from the stone.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.221]  In the Arthurian legend.
[00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:34.684]  Or Roland of the French ethos.
[00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.846]  Or El Cid of Spain.
[00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.953]  We are facing the same threats our forbearers did yet again.
[00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:51.236]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, the 12th day of September 2018.
[00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.418]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:57.560]  We have a raft of really amazing guests joining us.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.541]  The gentleman that had nine of his books banned in one day on Amazon.
[00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:02.122]  It wasn't Nambla.
[00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.223]  It wasn't Jihad Books.
[00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:07.063]  Was it books on bomb-making?
[00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:18.612]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it was books about how conservative men can pick up women with just standard stuff that I thought men just genetically knew how to do.
[00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:24.357]  Because I've actually read one of these guys' books.
[00:02:24.357 --> 00:02:29.982]  I was wondering the big craze about them all a few years ago, and I was like, doesn't everybody know this?
[00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.082]  But, whatever.
[00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:35.659]  He's joining us.
[00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.899]  And then we've got a bunch of other special guests.
[00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.941]  We have former Fox contributor who got drummed out, I think, for no reason.
[00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:44.762]  Eric Bolling is going to be in studio.
[00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:46.543]  He's now with CRTV and others.
[00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.024]  EricBolling.com.
[00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:52.485]  Graham Ledger is going to be joining us from One American News.
[00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:53.585]  It's big breaking news.
[00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:57.687]  So is Roger Stone, Millie Weaver, and so much more today.
[00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:14.245]  I really want to set the record straight on something when we come back from break that is so simple, so common sense, but also very, very, very profound.
[00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:23.551]  And I just want to be clear about this to everybody and to my enemies and everybody else because the process that Infowars has been through and the process that
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.182]  Our amazing president has been through is a roadmap to either victory or a roadmap to defeat.
[00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:41.745]  So I want to explain to people that really I don't think are sociopaths, that are like sociopath-lite.
[00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:48.987]  There's no reason to talk to the sociopaths or the psychopaths, but I can try to talk to people that are sociopath-lite.
[00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:53.488]  They've kind of been artificially inducted into this situation.
[00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.781]  So that you really understand the choice you have to make.
[00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:02.422]  So we're going to really cover something extremely profound when we come back from break.
[00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:07.065]  And then Trump derangement syndrome has gone to full meltdown.
[00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:11.787]  There are so many attacks coming in against conservatives that I can't even keep track of them.
[00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:15.629]  You go to the Breitbart article that has like 600.
[00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.591]  None of the dozens that I've experienced personally or my crew have are even in there.
[00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.752]  So that's an example of just
[00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:28.572]  They say for every bad vaccine interaction, there's probably 60, 70, 80 that you don't hear about.
[00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:33.696]  For every bad drug interaction, there's many, many you don't hear about as well.
[00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:34.997]  Well, it's the same thing with attacks.
[00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:38.800]  They're epic.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.241]  Epic.
[00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.182]  Happening everywhere.
[00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:51.184]  Republican buildings being burned down, switchblade attacks, foaming at the mouth, plans for mass gun attacks on Trump Hotel in D.C.
[00:04:51.184 --> 00:04:52.505]  where I was just last week.
[00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:56.048]  I mean, it is crazy town for real.
[00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.892]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:17.154]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[00:05:17.154 --> 00:05:26.216]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as acid xanthan and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:38.596]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:47.724]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:50.905]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:54.567]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:56.708]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.100]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.741]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:22.741 --> 00:06:37.914]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:44.259]  We're now 55 days out from the most important election in world history.
[00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:57.588]  Not since George Washington took up arms in 1776 have we been at such a crossroads as the one we're now in.
[00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:07.130]  The energy level of the planet is rising!
[00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.270]  We're going to break the global assumption for all.
[00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.311]  You can feel it!
[00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:13.551]  But...
[00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.351]  Some of us have to really want it.
[00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:22.232]  We've got to be the first to slam into the enemy front line.
[00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:26.253]  We'll join all our ancestors in Valhalla.
[00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:29.433]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's lay it out.
[00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:41.356]  There is Trump derangement syndrome, switchblade attacks on congressional candidates, firebombing Republican facilities, death threats pouring in, plans for mass shootings discovered.
[00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:49.794]  Congressman Scalise warns of a violent blue wave of evil.
[00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:51.874]  CNN won't report on any of it.
[00:07:51.874 --> 00:07:56.836]  That's better than when they celebrated Scalise getting shot and had his friend on to say he was a hero.
[00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:58.436]  Just fighting evil.
[00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:02.517]  And Wolf Blitzer looked at him and nodded his head.
[00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:04.218]  Talk about evil.
[00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:05.318]  They believe they own you.
[00:08:07.728 --> 00:08:11.829]  I'm going to get into the hurricane that is, thank God, slowing down from a six.
[00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:13.130]  They were asking me if it would go up to six.
[00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.450]  It's slowed down to a four.
[00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:21.792]  The problem is they think it might stall right over North Carolina instead of running up the coast and kind of giving everybody a little bit of water.
[00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.333]  So people are now fighting over food.
[00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.834]  It's just an example of how civilization is so tenuous right now.
[00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:30.715]  And then we're also going to just get into so much more here today.
[00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:47.309]  Even mainstream news is reporting that more video of staged White Helmets, who are really ISIS and Al Qaeda, that's just how they... When they go in an area to fight, they wear White Helmets and drive around with red crescents on their vehicles, like the Red Cross, and then they get out, they...
[00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.611]  Take the weapons out of the back of the ambulances and start attacking.
[00:08:50.611 --> 00:08:51.912]  It's on video.
[00:08:51.912 --> 00:09:00.336]  Well, the ISIS and Al-Qaeda, White Helmets, have now been caught staging more fake video productions about chemical attacks going on in Aleppo.
[00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:02.377]  I mean, these people don't even try to hide it.
[00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:05.619]  It's like they're saying action Arabic and then they tell people to do that.
[00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:10.561]  Everybody falls over, starts flopping around like dying fish out of water.
[00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:12.962]  It's just so insulting.
[00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:14.623]  So we're going to get to all that, too.
[00:09:14.623 --> 00:09:16.404]  But let me just make a big announcement here on air.
[00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:29.470]  Because this is the main reason that people don't understand how to take the country back and take the world back.
[00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:39.953]  I mean, this is, what I'm about to say, this is the big enchilada.
[00:09:39.953 --> 00:09:42.974]  And it just shows where people come from, from their perspectives.
[00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:51.531]  The media always celebrates my thousands of defeats every day.
[00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:52.571]  Thousands of articles.
[00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:53.692]  Thousands.
[00:09:53.692 --> 00:09:56.034]  Lying about me.
[00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:57.595]  Saying I'm insincere.
[00:09:57.595 --> 00:10:00.237]  Total fiction.
[00:10:00.237 --> 00:10:05.681]  And then celebrating our defeat over and over again when I'm not being defeated.
[00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:07.182]  I'm winning.
[00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:09.204]  See, I'm not trying to be accepted by the world.
[00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:13.123]  I'm not trying to go to award ceremonies from the establishment.
[00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:13.763]  I wouldn't go.
[00:10:13.763 --> 00:10:15.504]  I wouldn't take part in it.
[00:10:15.504 --> 00:10:19.905]  Who was it that said I wouldn't be part of any club that would have me?
[00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:22.445]  I'm a family man and a loner.
[00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:25.546]  Anybody that knows me knows that.
[00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:31.208]  I would rather just live up in the mountains and on a farm.
[00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.969]  I'm not a person seeking to be public.
[00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:34.689]  I am an introvert.
[00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:40.121]  But, I have to be extroverted to defeat the globalists.
[00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:41.823]  Because I will not be their slaves.
[00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:44.746]  And they have roused me from my slumber.
[00:10:44.746 --> 00:10:47.068]  And they've roused many, many other people from their slumber.
[00:10:47.068 --> 00:10:50.372]  I'm just a farmer.
[00:10:50.372 --> 00:10:52.554]  But you come after me and my family, I become a warrior.
[00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:07.431]  Everyone calls me lawyers, and public figures, and famous people, and you name it, and they say, Alex, you need to get back on Google, and Twitter, and all these other things.
[00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:09.111]  You need to say you're sorry.
[00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:11.892]  You need to, my God, how are you taking it?
[00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:13.432]  What's it like?
[00:11:13.432 --> 00:11:14.672]  And I'm like, I've never felt better.
[00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:15.552]  I've never felt stronger.
[00:11:15.552 --> 00:11:18.073]  I've never felt closer to God.
[00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:20.313]  I've never felt satisfied.
[00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:23.014]  It's not really a pride, because I'm not a prideful person.
[00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:28.915]  It's a satisfaction that I'm honorable, and I love God, and I love justice.
[00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:42.056]  And that's why all the enemies get financed and paid and pushed and Google and YouTube promote people that demonize me and lie about me from the establishment angle and from the so-called grassroots angle.
[00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:55.869]  And people set up their self righteously and claim that I'm not real or that I don't stand for what I stand when if you look at the doctrine of the tree, all it is is good fruit and victory.
[00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:56.930]  And that's why I'm under attack.
[00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:03.497]  And yes, there's a Streisand effect of it making us, for a time, more popular.
[00:12:03.497 --> 00:12:13.680]  That'd be like if you were out in the Arctic and your shelter caught on fire for an hour or so, you'd be pretty warm outside of it.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.742]  But once it burned out, you'll freeze to death.
[00:12:18.742 --> 00:12:28.386]  So they're calculating that, okay, Streisand effect, we explode when they totally ban us, the first person in modern world to be deplatformed, to be unpersoned.
[00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:49.045]  They know that long term that will be detrimental to Infowars and that's only part of setting a precedent to shut other people down and it's only part of a precedent to then move on me politically and then move on me criminally.
[00:12:49.045 --> 00:12:54.390]  I'm not at liberty and I'm not going to get into some of the things that have happened last week but believe me what you see on the surface
[00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.274]  You think there's a storm on the surface beneath the water?
[00:13:01.274 --> 00:13:02.815]  That's where the real war is going on.
[00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:15.786]  And the only frustration I have is that people don't see how clear it is and understand that this is real authoritarianism, real tyranny.
[00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:20.070]  This is your birthright being stolen from you by really, really bad people.
[00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:33.174]  Who in authoritarian nations are cheerleaders for horrible political crimes, executions, Christians, Buddhists, you name it, being worked to death, having their organs taken.
[00:13:33.174 --> 00:13:34.015]  Those aren't words.
[00:13:34.015 --> 00:13:35.115]  Those aren't horror movies.
[00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:38.277]  That's real.
[00:13:38.277 --> 00:13:40.839]  And Google and Apple have moved to China.
[00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:43.461]  They've officially said they're not working with the Pentagon or the U.S.
[00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:44.981]  government.
[00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:48.964]  I mean, they deserve to be SWAT teamed six months ago.
[00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:54.590]  All third executives should be arrested immediately.
[00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.171]  This is World War 4, folks.
[00:13:56.171 --> 00:14:00.493]  This is 21st century, 6th generational warfare.
[00:14:00.493 --> 00:14:05.255]  And we don't have time to get up to speed on this.
[00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:08.237]  Congress doesn't know what's going on.
[00:14:08.237 --> 00:14:09.657]  The media doesn't know what's going on.
[00:14:09.657 --> 00:14:14.400]  The idiots that even take money to attack me that work at the New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.942]  If the globalists are successful, our entire way of life is over?
[00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:26.088]  You're going to be very, very poor, and they're going to use racial and cultural division to completely control everybody.
[00:14:26.088 --> 00:14:30.369]  It is going to be a horrible country to live in.
[00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:40.012]  This is like burning down your own house.
[00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:42.293]  And so I'm going to explain something.
[00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:48.315]  I do what I do from intellectual research, and then when I come to the conclusions, from emotion.
[00:14:49.932 --> 00:15:06.199]  I intellectually study things very coldly and then I then emotionally power myself by emotionally caring about it deliberately and making myself fully feel the pain and fully feel the threat to activate my instincts and my will to fight it.
[00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:15.624]  Sociopaths attack me and psychopaths attack me because they're going at it from their thing of pressure and people after them and being attacked and losing things.
[00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:16.464]  They wouldn't want that.
[00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.915]  I am trying to destroy the globalists.
[00:15:21.915 --> 00:15:22.835]  They know that.
[00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:23.936]  And they don't know why I won't stop.
[00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:26.999]  And they just keep escalating the attacks.
[00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:28.821]  Because you're bad people.
[00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:34.666]  And I instinctively cannot let you rule me and my family or any of these other people.
[00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:39.171]  I will go to the end and I am becoming stronger.
[00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:43.490]  God is opening the armories of understanding.
[00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.133]  Every day my discernment increases exponentially.

[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.266]  Start getting on your knees before Jesus Christ, and fight the anti-Christ world government beast system, because it's almost here.

[00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.993]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[00:18:00.256 --> 00:18:03.859]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:05.641]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:16.910]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:26.858]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.858 --> 00:18:32.823]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.823 --> 00:18:37.407]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:40.529]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:42.250]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:52.257]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.899]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:59.623]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.720]  Travis in Florida.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.701]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:07.582]  You know, I'm really, the country's in deep trouble, but at least we're fighting back.
[00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:12.103]  I'm getting persecuted hard, but you know, it's good to be number two under attack after the president.
[00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:16.405]  I'm in good company, and so I, my bones feel good.
[00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.645]  I feel close to my ancestors.
[00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:19.206]  I feel like I'm delivering.
[00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.686]  You're definitely, you're definitely right there with us, the Patriots.
[00:19:21.686 --> 00:19:24.207]  I guess it is true, truth is treason in the empire of lies.
[00:19:24.207 --> 00:19:26.807]  I want to thank you personally, I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
[00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:29.228]  Anyone who knows, like a hypothyroidism condition.
[00:19:29.228 --> 00:19:31.488]  I currently, I mean the products, I can just name them off real quick.
[00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:38.310]  Brain Force, X2, Selenium, the Micro-ZX, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Frosted Dark, the Coffee, the Chaga Mushroom Blend, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Male.
[00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.430]  Let me tell you, it's given me my life back.
[00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.710]  Just taking the thyroid medicine alone is just not enough.
[00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.351]  Just having these products has made my life just back to normal.
[00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.151]  I'm working harder.
[00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:47.912]  We are drugged out!
[00:19:47.912 --> 00:19:49.814]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:18.500]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.361]  Today, it all changes.
[00:20:20.361 --> 00:20:23.123]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:26.004]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:20:26.004 --> 00:20:30.947]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:33.609]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:36.451]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:38.892]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:38.892 --> 00:20:40.513]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:40.513 --> 00:20:41.674]  We have the resources.
[00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:48.617]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:20:48.617 --> 00:20:50.058]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:51.680]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.761]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:20:52.761 --> 00:20:53.842]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:20:53.842 --> 00:20:56.245]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:20:56.245 --> 00:21:01.390]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.514]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:07.276]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:18.725]  We're going to get into all the news next segment.
[00:21:18.725 --> 00:21:21.127]  I have a special guest who just had his book banned.
[00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:25.050]  None of his books banned by Amazon.
[00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:29.894]  But first I want to just restate what I was saying earlier.
[00:21:29.894 --> 00:21:33.317]  This is some of the most important information you'll ever hear.
[00:21:33.317 --> 00:21:37.400]  So I hope that you'll listen to me very carefully.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.785]  Everyone who's trying to go along with the system and who thinks it's stupid to fight the corrupt system,
[00:21:45.316 --> 00:22:10.445]  Isn't understanding historically the Renaissance and the West and everything good came out of individuals standing up to corrupt authoritarian power structures and demanding basic rights for humanity and basic rights for people to think and do as they personally want to do without a power structure telling them what to do.
[00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:17.718]  And classical tyranny with a high-tech overlay is being foisted upon us right now.
[00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:28.642]  So if everyone else gets intimidated and everybody else gets threatened and bullied, when they stand up to the system, they get taken off the air, they get censored, they get attacked.
[00:22:30.123 --> 00:22:32.766]  They run into that stimulus, that bad stimulus.
[00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:33.907]  You can look at an amoeba.
[00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:37.971]  There's lots of microscope videos of this on YouTube.
[00:22:37.971 --> 00:22:40.313]  Amoeba runs from heat source.
[00:22:40.313 --> 00:22:44.177]  And then they can put a little wire with some heat on it into a petri dish with some amoebas.
[00:22:44.177 --> 00:22:46.719]  And the amoebas will all run.
[00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:48.081]  They're single cell organisms.
[00:22:48.081 --> 00:22:49.482]  They have a tail.
[00:22:49.482 --> 00:22:54.167]  But they feel the heat and they run.
[00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:54.527]  They run.
[00:22:58.444 --> 00:23:00.665]  Now, I'm not an amoeba.
[00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:14.070]  So when I see scientific psychology, which they admit the internet was set up for to track you and control you, manipulating people where, oh, you get more tweets, you get pushed if you slap Alex Jones upside the head or if you promote this corporate idea.
[00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:22.774]  So you think through the stimulus you're getting the carrot because you're going along with it and because you're getting pushed out there because you hate Trump or you hate America or whatever.
[00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:32.558]  You push lies about Infowars from above and below, from an establishment angle and from a conspiracy angle.
[00:23:32.558 --> 00:23:37.921]  But no, what you're doing is being given a poison.
[00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:45.066]  You're being given a carrot that is poison.
[00:23:45.066 --> 00:23:46.546]  So there's the carrot and the stick.
[00:23:46.546 --> 00:23:49.848]  There's the heat makes the amoeba run away.
[00:23:49.848 --> 00:23:50.609]  But there's also
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.503]  The food you can put in there that the amoeba doesn't know is poison and it comes over and eats it and dies.
[00:23:56.503 --> 00:24:00.285]  So see, I have to make the decision.
[00:24:00.285 --> 00:24:01.005]  These are globalists.
[00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:01.986]  They're going to demonize me.
[00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:04.007]  They're a foreign multinational power.
[00:24:04.007 --> 00:24:09.010]  They are a technotronic technocracy using psychological warfare in their own white papers.
[00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.573]  They admit this to control people and they want a docile, dumbed down world population.
[00:24:15.305 --> 00:24:18.949]  So that they're in full control and then now they want to phase out that population?
[00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:21.011]  And they're replacing us with robots?
[00:24:21.011 --> 00:24:22.874]  Of course I'm going to fight that!
[00:24:22.874 --> 00:24:28.300]  Of course I'm going to fight Apple and Google.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.923]  Going to Communist China and then trying to bring that tyranny here.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.003]  People call me and they go, man, why'd you go get in Marco Rubio's face?
[00:24:36.003 --> 00:24:37.344]  Why'd you go to that hearing?
[00:24:37.344 --> 00:24:38.105]  Why'd you do that?
[00:24:38.105 --> 00:24:40.166]  You know they're going to ban you.
[00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.448]  Exactly!
[00:24:41.448 --> 00:24:53.218]  I have to go up front and make an issue out of this so we don't just incrementally slide into a hot bath like a frog and boil to death.
[00:24:53.218 --> 00:24:54.099]  I jumped out of the pot.
[00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:02.024]  They're like, well, if you jump out of the pot, they'll try to grab you in the kitchen and put you back in the pot.
[00:25:02.024 --> 00:25:05.687]  Well, maybe that screen door is banging a little bit.
[00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:08.570]  And maybe I jump on the floor and I hop outside and I get in the creek.
[00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:13.635]  All I know is I'm not staying in this hot water that's starting to boil.
[00:25:13.635 --> 00:25:17.879]  And you're like, well, you'll live five minutes longer politically if you just stay in the boiling water.
[00:25:17.879 --> 00:25:19.420]  No.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.122]  I jumped out of the pot.
[00:25:22.757 --> 00:25:30.121]  And the globalists just keep attacking me and threatening me and doing dirty tricks behind the scenes and doing things I won't say on air, okay?
[00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:32.563]  And I have obvious reasons for that.
[00:25:32.563 --> 00:25:36.585]  Because then those things are used against me and it's used against my family.
[00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:40.267]  But the point is, is that they're trying to put me in prison right now.
[00:25:40.267 --> 00:25:45.150]  They are trying to do the finale.
[00:25:46.397 --> 00:25:52.680]  And at a spiritual level, I don't want to die, but at a spiritual level, I don't have any fear because I know I'll be with God.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.843]  And it's also exhausting to have to be good and stand against this and give every bit of my will.
[00:25:58.843 --> 00:26:01.864]  I want to fight to the end, but at the same time, I don't have a death wish.
[00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:06.366]  I never commit suicide, but at the same time, I'm free of these people.
[00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:09.708]  It's like V for Vendetta, where they take her for the mock execution.
[00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:10.628]  She says, go ahead, kill me.
[00:26:10.628 --> 00:26:12.509]  And they go, okay, you're free now.
[00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:25.320]  And it was V getting her to that point of how powerful she was once she truly was ready to do whatever it took for the children.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.681]  And how they were putting bioweapons in the vaccines.
[00:26:28.681 --> 00:26:32.621]  So the Wachowski brothers are telling you what's really going on.
[00:26:32.621 --> 00:26:40.883]  And that's the gravitas of those art productions is because they have truth hidden in them and then it resonates because your subconscious is hundreds of times more powerful than your conscious.
[00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:44.578]  And you know the truth, and so it resonates with you.
[00:26:44.578 --> 00:26:48.460]  So, we're facing a tyranny.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.461]  It's not even left-wing.
[00:26:49.461 --> 00:26:50.661]  It's just authoritarian.
[00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:54.964]  It's a virtue signaling tyranny that uses a bunch of political correctness as its camouflage.
[00:26:54.964 --> 00:26:58.126]  But it's very corporate, very fascistic in its own words.
[00:26:58.126 --> 00:27:00.948]  It's dictatorial by their own definition at Davos.
[00:27:00.948 --> 00:27:05.271]  A technocracy means a ruling group controlling you with technology.
[00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:06.792]  An oligarchy.
[00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:07.092]  And so,
[00:27:10.424 --> 00:27:13.125]  Zuckerberg says, I think Alex Jones wanted to be banned.
[00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:15.105]  No, Zuckerberg, I didn't want to be banned.
[00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:16.665]  I was already shadow banned.
[00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:18.526]  A, your premise is wrong.
[00:27:18.526 --> 00:27:23.347]  B, I cannot stop what I'm doing.
[00:27:23.347 --> 00:27:26.467]  But I did accelerate my banning.
[00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:28.528]  I told my father a week before they're going to ban me.
[00:27:28.528 --> 00:27:29.808]  I just knew.
[00:27:29.808 --> 00:27:32.328]  And see, the enemy can't stand that, that I've got my own supercomputer.
[00:27:32.328 --> 00:27:33.449]  We all do.
[00:27:33.449 --> 00:27:34.669]  Yeah, they're AI so smart.
[00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:35.249]  OK, yeah, right.
[00:27:36.617 --> 00:27:37.898]  They're scared of real human potential.
[00:27:37.898 --> 00:27:42.080]  But see, sociopaths and psychopaths, Zuckerberg is a genetic psychopath.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.321]  He's been bred for that.
[00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:49.584]  That's what really pissed him off because he knows he is a genetic psychopath.
[00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:56.387]  Everybody that knows him knows that he is a just soulless monster that wants pure power.
[00:27:56.387 --> 00:28:00.909]  And so is Tim Cook is a monster.
[00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:02.530]  A monster.
[00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.131]  The head of Google is a monster.
[00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.892]  They have no emotion but domination and power.
[00:28:07.892 --> 00:28:09.694]  And so they keep going, why won't Jones stop?
[00:28:09.694 --> 00:28:10.815]  Is he crazy?
[00:28:10.815 --> 00:28:11.576]  Why won't he stop?
[00:28:11.576 --> 00:28:13.057]  We're going to destroy him.
[00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:15.280]  Because I have a soul.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:23.247]  And see, I'm here, just like my ancestors were, to expend my energy for the larger goal of humanity and God's plan.
[00:28:23.247 --> 00:28:26.751]  Which I'm only privy to a little bit, but I know way more than you'll ever know.
[00:28:28.953 --> 00:28:29.333]  You understand?
[00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:33.614]  So I'm jacked into the big frequency, not your little fake frequency down here.
[00:28:33.614 --> 00:28:39.215]  And so I am absolutely blessed, and I'm just celebrating this.
[00:28:39.215 --> 00:28:40.755]  And just, it's all in God's hands.
[00:28:40.755 --> 00:28:43.476]  You know, when I pray, I don't ask God for thanks.
[00:28:43.476 --> 00:28:53.377]  I just try to just humble myself in the spirit, and the strength, and the power, and then the understanding of the knowledge just pours in.
[00:28:53.377 --> 00:28:55.818]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:57.178]  It's unspeakably incredible.
[00:29:00.379 --> 00:29:02.101]  Let's talk tough.
[00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:03.502]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:29:03.502 --> 00:29:05.884]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:29:05.884 --> 00:29:08.826]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[00:29:08.826 --> 00:29:10.828]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:11.729]  Remember?
[00:29:11.729 --> 00:29:14.832]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[00:29:14.832 --> 00:29:20.376]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:23.199]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:26.522]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:29:28.638 --> 00:29:33.328]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:29:33.328 --> 00:29:36.074]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:29:37.915 --> 00:29:41.279]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.780]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.044]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[00:29:46.044 --> 00:29:46.904]  See them at gusset.com.
[00:29:46.904 --> 00:29:48.026]  That's gusset.com.
[00:29:48.026 --> 00:29:48.586]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:48.827]  That's 888-848-7738.
[00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:49.768]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:29:49.768 --> 00:29:50.148]  Others don't.
[00:30:00.219 --> 00:30:20.192]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:30:20.192 --> 00:30:22.314]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:30:22.314 --> 00:30:26.176]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:26.176 --> 00:30:27.337]  And I want to thank everybody that has.
[00:30:27.757 --> 00:30:33.561]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:35.943]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:30:35.943 --> 00:30:41.366]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:43.868]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:53.054]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:30:53.054 --> 00:30:57.497]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:02.665]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:31:02.665 --> 00:31:04.829]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:07.653]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:31:08.749 --> 00:31:20.234]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:31:20.234 --> 00:31:29.338]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:35.625]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:41.071]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:31:41.071 --> 00:31:43.333]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.355]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:31:46.212 --> 00:31:47.013]  We knew it was coming.
[00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:02.892]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:32:02.892 --> 00:32:16.163]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:32:16.163 --> 00:32:17.144]  And then voila!
[00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:27.213]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:32:27.213 --> 00:32:28.113]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:32:28.874 --> 00:32:29.294]  I think so.
[00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:53.215]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:58.317]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:32:58.317 --> 00:33:03.380]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.002]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.076 --> 00:33:26.500]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.502]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.502 --> 00:33:30.503]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:30.503 --> 00:33:40.650]  55 days out.
[00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.432]  The most historic election in world history.
[00:33:42.432 --> 00:33:47.475]  The Council on Foreign Relations, the Chi-Coms, all of them admit that themselves.
[00:33:47.475 --> 00:33:48.216]  A referendum!
[00:33:49.830 --> 00:34:08.868]  Not just on Americanism vs. Globalism, Nationalism, Free Market vs. Crony Capitalism and Communism, but a referendum on can Silicon Valley and the big corporate media and Hollywood crush the American populist insurgency?
[00:34:08.868 --> 00:34:15.214]  Because they're sociopaths and psychopaths that don't have real emotion, only the emotion of domination and rapine.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.303]  They don't understand that when they oppress us, it only makes us fight harder.
[00:34:21.303 --> 00:34:23.764]  It's like Hitler.
[00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:24.985]  The British wouldn't give up.
[00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:26.606]  He was only targeting military facilities.
[00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:30.249]  If he had kept doing that, he would have won.
[00:34:30.249 --> 00:34:33.831]  But he began to target civilians.
[00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:35.812]  That hadn't been done up until that point.
[00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:38.033]  Chivalry went out the window.
[00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:41.736]  They began to carpet bomb London and other major cities to the ground.
[00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:45.583]  And surprise, surprise!
[00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:57.452]  Killing tens of thousands of children made the Brits shake off all that imperial conditioning to be little lovey-doves and they became psychotic killers.
[00:34:57.452 --> 00:35:00.074]  And then 20 million Germans died.
[00:35:00.074 --> 00:35:01.915]  Funny thing happened in Russia.
[00:35:01.915 --> 00:35:07.280]  Killing millions of Russian peasants didn't make the Russians give up, it made them become killers.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.102]  They already hated their own government, but once that happened, they were unified.
[00:35:10.102 --> 00:35:12.524]  So, it's a crazy time, and he joins us for two segments.
[00:35:13.843 --> 00:35:15.464]  After he leaves us, we'll get into Wyoming.
[00:35:15.464 --> 00:35:18.025]  GOP offices shut on fire.
[00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:23.707]  Two days after it opened, Secret Service investigates actress Carol Cook over assassination comment.
[00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:31.610]  CNN refused to report on attempted stabbing attack on Republican candidate by Democrat screaming, F Trump, F Trump.
[00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.532]  And Congressman Scalise warns of the evil blue wave of violence that's coming, inciting violence.
[00:35:38.237 --> 00:35:39.618]  There's so much more.
[00:35:39.618 --> 00:35:44.002]  Plans to mass attack the Trump Hotel in DC, where I was just staying last week.
[00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:46.765]  But!
[00:35:46.765 --> 00:35:48.607]  We are joined by best-selling author.
[00:35:48.607 --> 00:35:49.928]  He's written a whole bunch of books.
[00:35:49.928 --> 00:35:52.691]  Nine of them got banned two days ago.
[00:35:52.691 --> 00:35:53.171]  And he goes by...
[00:35:54.687 --> 00:36:00.631]  Well, his last name is Vali Zadah, but it's Roosh Vee, if I pronounced that right.
[00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:02.072]  And I've actually read one of his books.
[00:36:02.072 --> 00:36:03.172]  It's been all the big craze.
[00:36:03.172 --> 00:36:07.415]  And also, I got to know Neil Strauss, who's kind of one of the big dogs in this, a few years ago.
[00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:09.816]  I said, well, how about I actually read a few of these books?
[00:36:09.816 --> 00:36:13.258]  I mean, a lot of it just seems like normal mammal mating behavior.
[00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:17.941]  But the point is, we've still got people, bomb building books are on there.
[00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:22.884]  You've got people on Amazon, you know, selling manuals on how to sexually mutilate people.
[00:36:24.485 --> 00:36:27.166]  Nambla writing books that are sold on Amazon.
[00:36:27.166 --> 00:36:31.748]  And by the way, they have a right to write books saying they want to have sex with their kids.
[00:36:31.748 --> 00:36:33.289]  They don't have a right to have sex with their kids.
[00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:35.009]  And I think it's terrible and horrible.
[00:36:35.009 --> 00:36:43.913]  But when you get to the point of banning books when you claim you're this big global bookstore because your books were bestsellers and because you sold 2,000 in one day, I think it's a clear and present danger.
[00:36:43.913 --> 00:36:45.393]  So thanks for joining us.
[00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:49.095]  I mean, you look at this whole constellation of censorship here.
[00:36:50.695 --> 00:37:01.179]  And it really shows they're making their move, and I think we're hitting a singularity of censorship that China's helped develop with Google and Apple coming here, and I think we're being tested.
[00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:08.761]  And I think Congress and the Republicans and Trump on this issue, rhetoric isn't enough saying it's illegal.
[00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:12.563]  This needs to be dealt with now, with emergency executive orders.
[00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:15.124]  But that's my point on that.
[00:37:15.124 --> 00:37:15.724]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:37:16.977 --> 00:37:17.578]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:37:17.578 --> 00:37:27.185]  You know, when I saw them going after you, I knew that authors and other people who have platforms like me were next.
[00:37:27.185 --> 00:37:30.288]  You yesterday, me today.
[00:37:30.288 --> 00:37:36.252]  And, you know, one thing is I've never seen such an un-American action the way they went after you.
[00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:39.495]  They took you off platform after platform.
[00:37:39.495 --> 00:37:40.316]  I mean, this is...
[00:37:41.256 --> 00:37:44.657]  Going against tort law, restraint of trade.
[00:37:44.657 --> 00:37:53.538]  I mean, I think a lot of people are fortunate that you are still here because a lot of lesser men wouldn't have been able to withstand this onslaught.
[00:37:53.538 --> 00:38:01.300]  So, you know, I'm not feeling good right now once Amazon took nine of my books out, but I can't imagine what you had to feel.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:06.341]  One thing that I can say is that when my book was doing well, when it cracked the top 1,000 on the Amazon list,
[00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:12.583]  That's when the bad emails started coming in.
[00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:17.705]  You know, I could have a book that's ranked 50,000 and they don't say anything.
[00:38:17.705 --> 00:38:26.769]  But once you start to red pill the masses, once you're effective, then that's when they start to come after you.
[00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:29.770]  Rush V best selling author is our guest and that's exactly right.
[00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:37.074]  When our app that we just launched a week before we got banned, so we launched it in the late July, it was already in the top
[00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:41.776]  50 of news apps when they banned us on 20 plus platforms.
[00:38:41.776 --> 00:38:47.181]  It went to number one in a week on both platforms, Apple and on Android.
[00:38:47.181 --> 00:38:50.505]  And then they just delisted it where you couldn't see it in the charts.
[00:38:51.946 --> 00:38:54.688]  And then somehow it was climbing back up the charts.
[00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:58.710]  So I guess they must have removed, not all the subscriptions, but at least the total numbers.
[00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.291]  So it was going back towards number one again.
[00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:06.054]  And it was like number 24 last Friday when they killed it out of the app store.
[00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:08.795]  Now, 2 million downloads of the Apple app.
[00:39:08.795 --> 00:39:12.577]  People can still get the Android app for now on infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:39:12.577 --> 00:39:16.079]  And if you have it on your phone, it'll still be there for a few years until it's obsolescent.
[00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:20.542]  But the point is, is that yes, they have algorithms at Amazon
[00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:21.243]  We're good.
[00:39:35.325 --> 00:39:36.907]  Now that's what they admit they've got.
[00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:39.630]  So exactly, they knew you were going to number one.
[00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.432]  They knew I was already at number one.
[00:39:41.432 --> 00:39:48.421]  And so that's what they do with this NSA technology these private companies have is they stop the fact that we are the dominant culture.
[00:39:48.421 --> 00:39:50.664]  Women, men, they want what we say.
[00:39:50.664 --> 00:39:51.925]  They know it's true.
[00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:52.706]  They want success.
[00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:53.928]  They want Americana.
[00:39:53.928 --> 00:39:54.348]  They want
[00:39:55.169 --> 00:40:00.534]  As Robert Duvall says in Network, a big you-know-what hit.
[00:40:00.534 --> 00:40:05.918]  Freedom is the luscious Marilyn Monroe laid out with her feet behind her ears.
[00:40:05.918 --> 00:40:07.619]  I hate to use that analogy, but it's true.
[00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:11.302]  America is the creme de la creme of Renaissance.
[00:40:11.302 --> 00:40:13.184]  People want it, but they won't let us have it.
[00:40:14.366 --> 00:40:24.394]  You know, if you had a radio show helping transgender handicapped people, trying to give them entertainment, no one would ban you from anywhere.
[00:40:24.394 --> 00:40:34.783]  If I wrote a book on how to help gay couples, or if I wrote a book on how to help people who like to wear furry costumes, how they can mate, no one would ban me too.
[00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:37.766]  But once you help the strongest members of
[00:40:38.506 --> 00:41:01.202]  People in this country then they're gonna go after you if you're attacking if you are helping families if you're helping straight men if you're just helping people try to live normal lives trying to be as self-sufficient as possible trying to help men and women connect trying to have a nuclear family if you're igniting the true power of the species you must be blocked
[00:41:02.839 --> 00:41:11.483]  Yeah, so, I mean, this is, if I, like, I have a cover on my book, it's basically a man and a woman sitting under a tree.
[00:41:11.483 --> 00:41:12.984]  It's a beautiful cover!
[00:41:12.984 --> 00:41:15.645]  It's so romantic, it makes me want to sit under a tree with my wife.
[00:41:16.465 --> 00:41:28.474]  But if I put two SJWs with blue hair weighing 500 pounds each and them doing some weird things, then Amazon would feature it on their home page.
[00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:34.578]  So what we have is this inversion where anything that was normal or should be is now wrong.
[00:41:34.578 --> 00:41:35.479]  And it's hate speech.
[00:41:35.479 --> 00:41:36.439]  You're going to be banned.
[00:41:36.439 --> 00:41:37.861]  You're going to be called a racist.
[00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:56.048]  Beauty and function and things that work ergonomically that are designed are being attacked because if you go back to the leftists controlling the CIA in the 60s, this is declassified, they said, we want ugly buildings that crush your spirit, we want ugly art to hold it up so that people reject beauty.
[00:41:56.048 --> 00:42:04.731]  And that's it, it's a feedback loop that they give all these weird betas a program to be hateful and dumb and evil and if they do it, they get promoted.
[00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:05.772]  It's a very satanic plan.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:21.164]  You know, if I said that, hey, every man should drink a liter of soy juice every day or soy milk every day and explore the other gender, maybe I'd get interviews on CNN.
[00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:28.326]  But the fact that I say men shouldn't do that, then, uh-oh, then they're gonna make sure that my books don't even crack the top 1,000.
[00:42:28.326 --> 00:42:36.389]  And let's talk about your books when we come back, and Neil Strauss and all of it, because, I mean, it's true, these leftist women
[00:42:37.771 --> 00:42:43.195]  On average, are totally alone, totally freaked out, man-hating, and it's been done by design.
[00:42:43.195 --> 00:42:51.242]  And then, it's a well-known phenomenon, I'm not going to get into too much of it, but like, Democratic strategists, women and stuff, literally worship conservative men.
[00:42:51.242 --> 00:42:54.944]  And, you know, I won't do it, but they want you to slap them around, you name it.
[00:42:54.944 --> 00:42:55.445]  We'll be right back.

[00:47:03.347 --> 00:47:05.988]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.392 --> 00:47:18.874]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:21.916]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:23.837]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:23.837 --> 00:47:27.378]  So, like night follows day and day follows night.
[00:47:27.378 --> 00:47:40.425]  And Alex Jones, now every conservative, every libertarian, every common sense person, survival, military sites, pro-gun sites, self-help, everything's being blocked that's positive.
[00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:48.173]  We're being demoralized, like a foreign occupying army that takes over your country, demoralizes you.
[00:47:48.173 --> 00:47:50.695]  These are classic tactics they're using.
[00:47:50.695 --> 00:48:01.983]  We're going to go back to best-selling author, Roosh V., who just had his book, Game, that was going to the top of the charts, banned, along with, what was it, eight or nine other books of his, and where he thinks this is all going and how Trump should strike back.
[00:48:01.983 --> 00:48:05.266]  But first, I got some good news and I got some bad news.
[00:48:06.607 --> 00:48:14.349]  It was five, six years ago that we were putting out the cleanest seaweed-based iodine, because all the other stuff's, unfortunately, a bunch of garbage and really bad for you.
[00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:15.710]  That's why it makes you sick.
[00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.411]  You know about lowered IQs, not having iodine, you die without it.
[00:48:19.411 --> 00:48:21.691]  Like oxygen, like water, like vitamin C, you gotta have it.
[00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:26.853]  And it's the good halogens, they hit us with the chlorine, the fluoride, all the bad halogens.
[00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:28.173]  But this isn't a periodic table.
[00:48:28.173 --> 00:48:30.294]  It is THE halogen.
[00:48:30.294 --> 00:48:30.694]  The good one.
[00:48:31.844 --> 00:48:33.185]  And it's just incredible.
[00:48:33.185 --> 00:48:41.050]  I mean, I eat like a pig, live like a pig, work out half as hard as I used to and, you know, are 50 pounds lighter.
[00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.450]  I'm built like a gorilla, so I look big.
[00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.211]  People see me with my shirt off, I'm not fat.
[00:48:44.211 --> 00:48:54.558]  I just, I just got... But the point is, is that the oil companies that we get this from and the whole DEA process and everything is a controlled substance and the precursor of it because it's so pure.
[00:48:54.558 --> 00:48:56.519]  It's not once you get it, it's...
[00:48:58.354 --> 00:48:59.055]  It's incredible.
[00:48:59.055 --> 00:49:01.756]  Survival Shield X2 is selling out.
[00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.037]  I don't have a contract for it anymore.
[00:49:03.037 --> 00:49:04.218]  I can't get it anymore.
[00:49:04.218 --> 00:49:05.219]  We may be able to get it.
[00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:09.161]  I told you I was having problems six months ago, and boom, it happened.
[00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:11.763]  So, if you want it, it's still 25% off.
[00:49:11.763 --> 00:49:15.926]  We bought a big stockpile to get the price down, but then that deal fell through for the next deal.
[00:49:15.926 --> 00:49:19.228]  So, I'm not going to sell this for $100 a model to you.
[00:49:19.228 --> 00:49:20.549]  So, it's, what is it right now?
[00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.749]  Like $29.95.
[00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:21.730]  It's at infowarestore.com.
[00:49:24.406 --> 00:49:26.027]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:49:26.027 --> 00:49:29.889]  Look at that, 6,000 plus reviews from third-party site power reviews, 98%.
[00:49:29.889 --> 00:49:31.670]  That funds our operation.
[00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:36.672]  And we're working on getting it again or something new or a new formulation or whatever.
[00:49:36.672 --> 00:49:41.575]  But the way the rules work with the FDA and stuff is that if you reformulate something, you got to call it something different.
[00:49:41.575 --> 00:49:43.055]  So this is the end of X2.
[00:49:43.055 --> 00:49:43.796]  You want it?
[00:49:43.796 --> 00:49:44.716]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:45.757]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:49:46.457 --> 00:49:53.484]  But be careful with it, because it's like, imagine, you don't have oxygen, you come up from the water, it's like... I mean, it's amazing.
[00:49:53.484 --> 00:50:01.713]  And it's a fact you die without iodine, and they're doing everything they can, because they know there's iodine naturally in seafood, and iodine in a few things, but bad halogens block it.
[00:50:02.702 --> 00:50:04.323]  So, but this is so pure.
[00:50:04.323 --> 00:50:06.545]  9999999.
[00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.967]  Nobody else, it's always bound to something else.
[00:50:08.967 --> 00:50:09.527]  This is pure.
[00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:12.950]  I mean, look, there it is at 90 degrees, it turns into gas.
[00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:15.972]  Like, genie's gonna come out of it or something, you know?
[00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:19.855]  Kids don't know what that is, a show like I Dream of Genie, you know, just looks like that.
[00:50:19.855 --> 00:50:22.216]  But that's what this is doing, that's how pure this is, and...
[00:50:23.615 --> 00:50:27.537]  They pull strings behind the scenes to stop us from having the damn product, so.
[00:50:27.537 --> 00:50:28.818]  And I'm not going to sell it at full price.
[00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:30.479]  I usually discount 25% of what's there.
[00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:31.480]  Alright, let's go back to our guest.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.141]  I'm going to try to give him the floor because I've been ranting.
[00:50:34.397 --> 00:50:36.599]  You're a smart guy, and I've read one of your books.
[00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:38.220]  It just seemed like common sense stuff.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.062]  It's the physiology of women versus men.
[00:50:41.062 --> 00:50:53.872]  They're so threatened by it because they're targeting that and breaking it, and leftist women particularly are so hungry for the normal male-female interaction, and the whole system in their own documents is to break that.
[00:50:53.872 --> 00:50:55.913]  So why were you the first person?
[00:50:55.913 --> 00:51:02.018]  Because they've messed with other conservative authors and played games, or it goes to, you know, number 100 or whatever, and then Amazon doesn't reorder.
[00:51:02.018 --> 00:51:03.219]  I mean, they do that a lot, too.
[00:51:03.499 --> 00:51:06.401]  But yours just banned, and then they wouldn't comment.
[00:51:06.401 --> 00:51:08.382]  And again, not banned because it wasn't selling.
[00:51:08.382 --> 00:51:10.884]  And Amazon's always, oh, we'll sell everything unless it's illegal.
[00:51:10.884 --> 00:51:14.687]  Your books are pretty, they're interesting, they're well-written.
[00:51:14.687 --> 00:51:16.568]  The one I read, pretty milk toast.
[00:51:16.568 --> 00:51:17.769]  So, I mean, it's the truth.
[00:51:17.769 --> 00:51:19.590]  So why is this happening?
[00:51:21.187 --> 00:51:31.012]  Right now we live in a culture where only women can be empowered to achieve their goals and their dreams and to get the most happiness out of life.
[00:51:31.012 --> 00:51:38.416]  We're not allowed to empower men because don't you know that men have been holding women down for thousands of years?
[00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:42.078]  So now men are being pushed down so anyone, any author
[00:51:42.538 --> 00:51:52.227]  Who wants to help men and I try to help men connect with women on their terms without getting abuse from women, women who cancel dates or cheat on them.
[00:51:52.227 --> 00:52:01.435]  I'm trying to empower men to help understand women, how to connect with them, how to get happiness from them, but in a culture where men are treated like dirt.
[00:52:01.915 --> 00:52:03.796]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:52:03.796 --> 00:52:08.199]  And as you noted, there's nothing in my book that is particularly graphic.
[00:52:08.199 --> 00:52:09.320]  There's no abuse.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.602]  I tell men when a woman says no, it means no.
[00:52:12.602 --> 00:52:14.423]  Stop means stop.
[00:52:14.423 --> 00:52:18.506]  I mean, Amazon sells a lot of graphic novels.
[00:52:18.506 --> 00:52:23.510]  They sell covers with sex acts depicted on the actual cover.
[00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:26.071]  But you can't sell a book that helps men.
[00:52:26.071 --> 00:52:29.774]  Anything that helps men, they're going to try to stop you.
[00:52:29.774 --> 00:52:31.475]  And I think that's what they're doing to me.
[00:52:33.056 --> 00:52:43.119]  If you look at the Romans taking over Germany, or Gaul, the first thing they did was kill the men, and then kids under 10 boys were kept, and women.
[00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:49.062]  Targeting men by an occupying army is 101 for a takeover.
[00:52:49.062 --> 00:52:59.386]  Yeah, so, I mean, what they're trying to do, I think, they're pushing men to get weaker and weaker, because what is really the only threat to an oppressive government?
[00:53:00.758 --> 00:53:01.559]  It's men.
[00:53:01.559 --> 00:53:04.143]  It's men, families, tribes.
[00:53:04.143 --> 00:53:06.626]  Why do they always make that weird soy boy face?
[00:53:06.626 --> 00:53:10.471]  Like, you have to make the soy boy face to work at BuzzFeed in the New York rego.
[00:53:11.564 --> 00:53:13.025]  I mean, what is that?
[00:53:13.025 --> 00:53:16.847]  I think they hire them based on how weak they actually are.
[00:53:16.847 --> 00:53:23.971]  The more weak you are, the less likely you're going to stand up for yourself and the ideas that you believe in.
[00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:27.493]  They gave you an office in CNN, BuzzFeed.
[00:53:27.493 --> 00:53:30.275]  I saw you confront Oliver Darcy.
[00:53:30.275 --> 00:53:33.016]  He looked like he was going to pee his pants.
[00:53:33.016 --> 00:53:37.059]  I've never seen a man so scared and you didn't even raise your fist.
[00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:37.399]  You didn't.
[00:53:37.919 --> 00:53:48.644]  Do anything wrong, but he looked frightened and it's because CNN hires the weakest people, people who follow orders, people who are desperate for a little bit of glory.
[00:53:48.644 --> 00:53:54.066]  You know, a lot of these journalists, whether they work at CNN or Buzzfeed, they have always been
[00:53:54.466 --> 00:53:56.208]  They've never felt powerful.
[00:53:56.208 --> 00:53:58.630]  They've never felt like they made a difference.
[00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:11.723]  So the only way they can do it today is by tearing men like you down, tearing men like me down, by tattletailing, by running to Amazon, to Facebook, and Twitter, and saying, oh look, Alex Jones said a bad word.
[00:54:11.723 --> 00:54:13.785]  Oh look, Alex Jones is number one!
[00:54:13.785 --> 00:54:15.847]  Oh look, Roosh Fee's number one!
[00:54:15.847 --> 00:54:16.688]  Oh, stop him!
[00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:21.212]  They're only good at tearing people down.
[00:54:21.212 --> 00:54:22.512]  What have they made?
[00:54:22.512 --> 00:54:26.653]  Have they created a video platform, a radio show?
[00:54:26.653 --> 00:54:27.833]  Have they written a book?
[00:54:27.833 --> 00:54:29.693]  All they can do is take people down.
[00:54:29.693 --> 00:54:32.914]  Their sole means of content is attacking.
[00:54:32.914 --> 00:54:37.095]  And what I want to ask you, Alex, since you've been through this, is what can I do now?
[00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:38.815]  What can we do?
[00:54:38.815 --> 00:54:43.776]  I've been de-platformed from PayPal, Shopify, Discus, now Amazon.
[00:54:43.776 --> 00:54:47.197]  What can the little guy do who doesn't have this backing
[00:54:47.677 --> 00:54:50.659]  Who just wants to put out a good book, who wants to help people.
[00:54:50.659 --> 00:54:52.601]  What is the next step?
[00:54:52.601 --> 00:55:04.190]  If you look at these folks that are brainwashed, and are sociopaths, or just trying to serve the system as mercenaries, they think if they're attacked, that means they're losing.
[00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:11.036]  So I think we have to raise the alarm and say, the social engineers believe that we're going to adapt to being slaves.
[00:55:11.977 --> 00:55:14.698]  We have to say it's not work to fight back against tyranny.
[00:55:14.698 --> 00:55:19.019]  It's like lifting weights because it's fun or taking a jog because it feels good.
[00:55:19.019 --> 00:55:21.680]  There's some pain up front but then it becomes an addiction.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:34.384]  We have to get addicted to fighting these tyrants and we have to revel in the fact that we are the human spirit against these horribly greedy technocrats that want to end the human spirit because they're threatened by human free will and renaissance.
[00:55:34.384 --> 00:55:41.306]  And that just like Trump wants success and you want success and I want success, that we do have the light in the dark of the night
[00:55:42.512 --> 00:55:43.573]  And raise the alarm!
[00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:47.675]  And people need to celebrate those of us that are persecuted.
[00:55:47.675 --> 00:55:53.599]  And again, the enemy is accelerating their plan five or six years because they're behind and because they see the global awakening.
[00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:55.601]  So we're actually winning right now.
[00:55:55.601 --> 00:56:02.385]  It's just that those of us at the tip of the spear that get banned first, the enemy has computer algorithms to track who's most effective.
[00:56:02.385 --> 00:56:03.846]  They have models of who to get.
[00:56:03.846 --> 00:56:06.548]  They can see where you're going, where I'm going, our trajectories.
[00:56:06.548 --> 00:56:08.049]  So people need to celebrate
[00:56:08.889 --> 00:56:17.793]  The human weapon systems that we are for success against tyranny and against this cancer of non-competitive globalism, this anti-human, post-human system.
[00:56:17.793 --> 00:56:22.576]  We have to celebrate the people that have been targeted and realize what they're doing.
[00:56:22.576 --> 00:56:23.256]  I know you gotta go.
[00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:26.037]  We'll do five more minutes and after one minute break is when you finish.
[00:56:26.037 --> 00:56:32.701]  We have to celebrate the people that have been attacked first because those are the people that have the antidote.
[00:56:32.701 --> 00:56:33.301]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:42.198]  Yeah, but at the same time, a lot of men, they can't take the abuse from getting de-platformed and banned.
[00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:48.604]  You know, so men like us, we see what is going on and we wake up the next day and say to ourselves, I'm not going to stop.
[00:56:48.604 --> 00:56:49.865]  I'm not going to quit.
[00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:56.831]  And as long as I'm still alive, I'm not in jail, I'm going to still try to put out the work that I believe touches a lot of people.
[00:56:56.831 --> 00:56:57.532]  But we have
[00:56:58.132 --> 00:56:58.932]  Feelings too.
[00:56:58.932 --> 00:57:00.793]  We have a, you know, heart too.
[00:57:00.793 --> 00:57:05.535]  So how much can they give us until we just feel like there's no more options?
[00:57:05.535 --> 00:57:08.716]  It's funny you say this because I have two segments on this because this is the answer.
[00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:11.297]  I know you gotta go, but come back for a full hour next week.
[00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:12.518]  Let's go to break for two minutes.
[00:57:12.518 --> 00:57:16.179]  I'm gonna come back and just try to get into this with you, but just briefly, here's the issue.
[00:57:17.645 --> 00:57:18.846]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[00:57:18.846 --> 00:57:19.867]  I don't like to dish out pain.
[00:57:19.867 --> 00:57:21.209]  I don't like to take pain.
[00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:22.089]  I'm not a masochist.
[00:57:22.089 --> 00:57:27.235]  But, humans have to know how to go through pain for the good of the species.
[00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.356]  It's not a collectivism.
[00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:30.438]  It's individualism, where I'm an individual collectivist.
[00:57:30.438 --> 00:57:31.559]  It's a term I invented.
[00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:41.268]  But the point is, I'm going to try to explain this when we come back in two minutes and let you finish up, is that we have to take this pain, just like gravity causes pain, but that's how we live and walk.
[00:57:42.009 --> 00:57:46.591]  To get to the next level, and we have to realize the stimuli they're hitting at us is because we're winners.
[00:57:46.591 --> 00:57:53.294]  They're attacking us because of that.
[00:57:53.294 --> 00:57:59.017]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.017 --> 00:58:06.901]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:10.042]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:10.242 --> 00:58:15.509]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.509 --> 00:58:18.293]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:58:18.293 --> 00:58:27.286]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:58:27.346 --> 00:58:32.167]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:57.711 --> 00:59:01.472]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.472 --> 00:59:10.234]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:14.775]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:14.775 --> 00:59:16.235]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.235 --> 00:59:19.756]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:31.825]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.825 --> 00:59:39.811]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.811 --> 00:59:46.856]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.856 --> 00:59:49.598]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[00:59:52.890 --> 01:00:04.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:10.166]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:14.510]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.834]  So, Roosh V had nine of his books, including his best-selling book, Game.
[01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:24.942]  Deleted, removed from physical sale and digital download from Amazon about a day and a half ago.
[01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:32.166]  When he was talking, I only know about Hollywood because I was in a few movies and a bunch of TV shows.
[01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:38.550]  I've been out there a few hundred times and went right to the top of the scene because they were trying to get me on board 15 years ago.
[01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:43.293]  And a few years into it, I saw how bad it was and I got out of it.
[01:00:43.293 --> 01:00:48.196]  But when you look at the whole system they're pushing,
[01:00:49.332 --> 01:00:52.894]  Things like, oh women, go to a guy's house, get tied up.
[01:00:52.894 --> 01:00:56.977]  Well, the first time you get tied up, they don't actually kill you, or torture you to death.
[01:00:56.977 --> 01:01:01.680]  But maybe the hundredth time, you don't tell them where you're going, and it all happens, you get deep into it.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.264]  There's a really, and the left is, and the globalists are really into abusing women and children, as you know.
[01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:12.188]  So then they act like men being men is horrible and abusive, when the left is the worst towards women.
[01:01:12.188 --> 01:01:15.790]  So, Roosh V was kind of getting into that.
[01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.352]  His book, You Have a Right to Sell Fifty Shades of Grey,
[01:01:20.197 --> 01:01:24.983]  Uh, and you know, these young women out there and everybody else want you to beat them up, all this other stuff.
[01:01:24.983 --> 01:01:29.750]  So like, beating women up is cool, and torturing them is cool, because it's 50 Shades of Grey.
[01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:35.737]  But if you tell a woman, you're not going to abuse me, and you know, I'm my own man, and I'm confident, and I don't need you if you don't want me, that's fine.
[01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:36.919]  Which is what they're actually looking for.
[01:01:36.919 --> 01:01:38.181]  They want an alpha male that's successful.
[01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:40.366]  Then you're abusing women.
[01:01:40.366 --> 01:01:44.693]  So, torture women, like the NXIVM liberal cult, that's okay.
[01:01:44.693 --> 01:01:47.998]  But, don't tell men to stand up for themselves.
[01:01:47.998 --> 01:01:49.600]  Don't moralize men.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.542]  Demoralize them.
[01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:52.345]  And I think you knocked it out of the park, Rushfi, with that.
[01:01:53.632 --> 01:01:56.333]  Yeah, right now you're not allowed to help man.
[01:01:56.333 --> 01:02:00.254]  Any problem a man faces, that's your problem.
[01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:03.035]  You have to figure that out on your own.
[01:02:03.035 --> 01:02:10.978]  No media company is going to help you, no academic, university system, the government, no one will help you.
[01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:12.099]  You are on your own.
[01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:13.299]  Okay, I'm on my own.
[01:02:13.299 --> 01:02:14.520]  Let me solve these problems.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.701]  Because men are the genetic defense system of the species.
[01:02:18.842 --> 01:02:24.941]  From African Lions to Homo Sapien Sapien, this is so... I mean, if an alien force invaded, they would target our men!
[01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:31.947]  Yeah, and then even when we try to solve our problems, then they say, no, you're not allowed to.
[01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:33.028]  You can't read this.
[01:02:33.028 --> 01:02:34.809]  You can't watch Alex Jones.
[01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:38.452]  You're not allowed to get the knowledge that can help you out.
[01:02:38.452 --> 01:02:47.599]  So they're really cutting off every avenue possible for a normal person, for a man to improve his life, to understand the world.
[01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:51.281]  And that's the most unfair thing that they can actually do.
[01:02:51.281 --> 01:02:53.703]  And I'm not sure what we can do after that.
[01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:54.384]  I don't know if you can
[01:02:54.904 --> 01:03:10.413]  See Alex, but I have a huge picture of Donald Trump in the background and I like him, I support him, but he needs to do something because these tech monopolies are just going to chop our heads off one at a time.
[01:03:10.413 --> 01:03:11.694]  If they can shut you down,
[01:03:12.603 --> 01:03:15.645]  And YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, who can't they shut down?
[01:03:15.645 --> 01:03:17.387]  Everyone else is smaller than you.
[01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:20.289]  You are the big tree in the forest.
[01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:22.330]  They just chopped down the biggest tree.
[01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:24.952]  So of course the smaller trees are going to be easier.
[01:03:24.952 --> 01:03:26.053]  So that's really the message.
[01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.814]  They're mad with the demonetization.
[01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:28.474]  I don't think so.
[01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:53.088]  You know, one thing, they cannot force us to read bad books.
[01:03:53.088 --> 01:04:02.254]  They cannot force us to watch Oliver Darcy read his trash, to watch Huffington Post videos talk about how transgender people have it bad.
[01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:03.835]  They cannot force us yet.
[01:04:03.835 --> 01:04:10.420]  It's not like in Clockwork Orange where they force our eyes open and we have to consume their horrible propaganda.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.222]  We're not there yet.
[01:04:12.222 --> 01:04:20.692]  One thing, a lot of news articles on Gizmodo, Huffington Post, try to say, oh, look how great it is that Roosh is cancelled, but no one is clicking them.
[01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:24.877]  No one is reading them, because people don't read their propaganda.
[01:04:24.877 --> 01:04:30.543]  I was about to say, it is, and they're just such, they're reveling in being classical villains.
[01:04:31.304 --> 01:04:34.867]  I mean, they're just, they're truly evil.
[01:04:34.867 --> 01:04:36.748]  Well, please come back again.
[01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:37.388]  God bless you.
[01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:39.650]  You know, you're now in an elite group, but not for long.
[01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:40.831]  Everybody's getting banned.
[01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:41.751]  Congress must act.
[01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:42.672]  This is racketeering.
[01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:43.833]  This is un-American.
[01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:44.953]  This is very, very dangerous.
[01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:45.474]  God bless you.
[01:04:45.474 --> 01:04:47.075]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:04:47.075 --> 01:04:47.795]  Okay, great.
[01:04:47.795 --> 01:04:53.019]  And if anyone wants to learn about Game in my e-book, they can go to my site, rooshv.com.
[01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:53.459]  That's right.
[01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:56.902]  Roosh, R-O-O-S-H-V-E-E.
[01:04:56.902 --> 01:04:57.362]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.339 --> 01:05:00.701]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.701 --> 01:05:06.965]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:06.965 --> 01:05:15.110]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:24.296]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.

[01:06:11.485 --> 01:06:16.390]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.051]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.051 --> 01:06:20.834]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:25.298]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:06:41.511 --> 01:07:00.635]  Is it strange that if you were to write a science fiction novel about a dystopian world government banning free speech, destroying families, poisoning the food and water supply, sterilize the population, where do you think in that novel written in the 1950s the resistance would come from?
[01:07:00.635 --> 01:07:02.355]  America.
[01:07:02.355 --> 01:07:06.356]  And where would the real fire start?
[01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:06.776]  Texas.
[01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:12.346]  See, that's how a science fiction writer would write it.
[01:07:12.346 --> 01:07:15.567]  Because everybody knows it.
[01:07:15.567 --> 01:07:18.748]  Because art follows life.
[01:07:18.748 --> 01:07:23.309]  The system always tries to make it where life follows art.
[01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:27.030]  But it's art follows life.
[01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:29.810]  Again, the globalists keep saying, Jones, when are you going to learn?
[01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.071]  We're going to destroy you.
[01:07:31.071 --> 01:07:31.771]  We're going to...
[01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:35.444]  physically destroy you if you don't stop.
[01:07:35.444 --> 01:07:38.025]  You're already going to physically destroy me.
[01:07:38.025 --> 01:07:44.549]  They report that children committing suicide from the 1950s numbers is up 20,000%.
[01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:49.331]  That was in the news yesterday.
[01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.673]  They're like, why are children committing suicide?
[01:07:51.673 --> 01:07:57.876]  Because this is an anti-human evil system by design.
[01:07:57.876 --> 01:07:59.557]  We're already dying!
[01:07:59.557 --> 01:08:00.678]  We're dead already!
[01:08:03.177 --> 01:08:10.400]  So, they'll have more suicide prevention classes teaching kids about suicide and how to do it, and we'll have more suicide.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.261]  And we'll give them more drugs that the insert says makes them commit suicide.
[01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:17.923]  And then we'll wonder why suicide goes up.
[01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:19.583]  Riddle me this, Batman.
[01:08:19.583 --> 01:08:23.185]  Ah, Batman, riddle me this.
[01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:24.765]  Everyone's committing suicide.
[01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:26.646]  The pills I give them do it.
[01:08:26.646 --> 01:08:27.567]  It's funny.
[01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:28.707]  Riddle me this, riddle me that.
[01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:31.068]  Don't need to be the Riddler to know the answer to that.
[01:08:35.947 --> 01:08:39.888]  Trump comes out and says there's too many people on opioids, on serotonin and riptide inhibitors.
[01:08:39.888 --> 01:08:43.170]  There's too many people, you know, doing that.
[01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:46.231]  And they're like, oh, shut up and stop telling us what we're going to do.
[01:08:46.231 --> 01:08:47.991]  Trump's like, the vaccines are hurting kids.
[01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:49.872]  Oh, shut up, Trump.
[01:08:49.872 --> 01:08:51.313]  One in 30,000 had autism.
[01:08:51.313 --> 01:08:51.833]  Now it's one in 58.
[01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:55.414]  I go to the mall or restaurant.
[01:08:55.414 --> 01:09:02.437]  Half the kids I look at look like they're real sick and got problems, even in rich neighborhoods.
[01:09:02.437 --> 01:09:03.457]  And a good 10% are gone.
[01:09:08.021 --> 01:09:09.282]  And I started getting tears in my eyes.
[01:09:09.282 --> 01:09:11.062]  My wife's like, don't cry, don't do it.
[01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:18.065]  But man, when you look at some beautiful child who had a beautiful life ahead of him, and they got hit with a chemical bioweapon and their brains fried.
[01:09:18.065 --> 01:09:23.147]  It's meant to give you an IQ reduction of 20 points, but some people it hits harder, especially males.
[01:09:23.147 --> 01:09:24.627]  80% of autism is males.
[01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:30.930]  And you add the pesticides and everything else in, but they add these neuroviruses to the vaccines.
[01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:39.757]  That's declassified and it just hits the cerebral cortex and their operating system, their connection to their subconscious is fried.
[01:09:39.757 --> 01:09:44.621]  Their soul's walled off and they've been put in prison.
[01:09:44.621 --> 01:09:51.466]  They put them in a basically 5 by 9 box and they're pretty pissed.
[01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:53.348]  They're pretty pissed.
[01:09:53.348 --> 01:09:57.031]  That's just one of the more ancient technologies they developed 40 years ago to do that.
[01:09:57.932 --> 01:10:01.394]  And again, they get satanic power off of putting your child in a cage.
[01:10:01.394 --> 01:10:08.559]  You know the amount of demonic energy they get off of the hundred million autistic kids that are in cages?
[01:10:08.559 --> 01:10:10.240]  Because it eats the cortex?
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.821]  So then, you know, they're not getting out.
[01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:13.782]  The soul can't get out.
[01:10:13.782 --> 01:10:15.603]  It's like, I'm in here, get me out of here!
[01:10:15.603 --> 01:10:19.445]  They're like, ha, ha, ha, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[01:10:19.445 --> 01:10:22.247]  Let's soy boy smile!
[01:10:22.247 --> 01:10:23.228]  So, Millie Weaver joins us.
[01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:27.651]  She's been talking to a lot of her sources about things going on in Canada, folks in the Canadian government.
[01:10:28.399 --> 01:10:31.460]  One of our sources has gotten some good infos before, but you can see the build-up.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:40.044]  They say they have a stay-behind network trying to overthrow the President, and they're putting sticky stickers on his back to piss him off, saying he's an idiot, and they got signs over the door saying, entering crazy town.
[01:10:40.044 --> 01:10:46.046]  It's a PSYOP, CNN saying, remove the President, he can't control the White House, while they're the ones engaged in sedition.
[01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:53.609]  And you've got all this insanity going on, the massive censorship, the attacks, 55 days out, it's all building, building, building.
[01:10:54.469 --> 01:10:59.037]  And we've got freedom and salvation and everything just waiting that we just turn back to God.
[01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:00.139]  Millie, thanks for joining us.
[01:11:00.139 --> 01:11:01.742]  Infowars.com reporter.
[01:11:01.742 --> 01:11:03.024]  Chelsea does freelance reporting.
[01:11:03.024 --> 01:11:04.366]  Does a great job.
[01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:05.468]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:11:05.468 --> 01:11:05.949]  How are you doing?
[01:11:06.994 --> 01:11:08.255]  Thanks, I'm doing good, Alex.
[01:11:08.255 --> 01:11:24.863]  Well, I actually have permission from my source to divulge and tell some background information on this source just so people could understand the importance and the credibility of where the information I'm going to lay out is coming from.
[01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:31.446]  This person was the author of the SCI program
[01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.629]  Your Skype's breaking up for a minute.
[01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.472]  It's crystal clear, but it's breaking up audio-wise.
[01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:43.716]  Let's just start over.
[01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:46.761]  But those horses up in Canada, he says there's some big stuff gearing up.
[01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:47.943]  So just continue.
[01:11:49.198 --> 01:11:52.621]  Yes, this is a high level intelligence source.
[01:11:52.621 --> 01:12:00.789]  He was the original author of the SDI program, which was a white paper that Reagan quoted in the 1980s.
[01:12:00.789 --> 01:12:04.673]  He was a former Air Force intelligence.
[01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:09.037]  Basically, this person has a huge background, personally knows the Trudeau family.
[01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:23.344]  Knows Justin Trudeau and essentially contacted us, very alarmed, saying that Canada is, you know, talking about and considering initiating the War Measures Act.
[01:12:23.344 --> 01:12:32.149]  And this, for those of you who don't know, the War Measures Act is the martial law version of what we have in the U.S.
[01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.829]  for Canada.
[01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:45.902]  And he's talking about, Trudeau's talking about essentially enacting the War Measures Act in response to failed negotiations between Trump with NAFTA and Canada.
[01:12:45.902 --> 01:12:58.588]  Basically trying to use a justification that if the negotiations go sour, it's going to hurt Canada enough to where we're going to go ahead and enact the War Measures Act, which is martial law in Canada.
[01:12:58.588 --> 01:13:00.229]  And this has to do with
[01:13:01.402 --> 01:13:09.155]  Um, what's going on right now with the coup and our government because we know that Trudeau is a leftist in Canada.
[01:13:09.155 --> 01:13:11.359]  He aligns himself with the leftist
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:23.265]  In America, the Democrats, the Globalist Deep State, and these Globalist Deep State people, we all know, have been chattering and talking about an overthrow of President Trump.
[01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:28.227]  And let's remember, going back a year and a half ago, we said they were preparing this because it was in white papers.
[01:13:28.227 --> 01:13:29.527]  Now they admit it all over the news.
[01:13:29.527 --> 01:13:38.591]  I mean, they are openly, and now they've got leftists committing violent acts all over the country, firebombing Republican buildings, trying to stab congressional candidates, trying to attack Trump
[01:13:39.611 --> 01:13:39.711]  I'm
[01:13:59.748 --> 01:14:03.192]  You know, sticking his feet down, being stubborn, saying no.
[01:14:03.192 --> 01:14:14.143]  And it really kind of begs the question, has Trudeau been offered a better deal by these Democrats or by these people who are plotting this coup against Trump once they open up?
[01:14:14.143 --> 01:14:14.744]  No, I understand.
[01:14:14.744 --> 01:14:17.927]  But from your source, Canada is obviously in a big trade fight.
[01:14:17.927 --> 01:14:19.749]  They're being cut out of NAFTA because they won't renegotiate.
[01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:23.153]  Trump's like, you can't have 280% tariffs on us and we have none on you.
[01:14:23.153 --> 01:14:24.694]  Just please stop raping us.
[01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:25.956]  And so Trudeau's flipping out.
[01:14:25.956 --> 01:14:28.178]  We see major free speech violations.
[01:14:28.178 --> 01:14:29.880]  We've seen a lot of drills in Canada.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.605]  But you're saying your source says they're getting ready for martial law.
[01:14:34.605 --> 01:14:35.586]  What's the reason for that?
[01:14:35.586 --> 01:14:37.669]  They think destabilization in the U.S.
[01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:41.313]  are trying to stop Canadians rising up or what?
[01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:45.826]  Well, you can actually even look and see in the news headlines.
[01:14:45.826 --> 01:14:56.089]  Just type in Canada War Measures Act on even Google News and several mentions of it will come up in recent articles where Trudeau's making these threats.
[01:14:56.089 --> 01:14:58.469]  It's very vague and ambiguous how they're doing it.
[01:14:58.469 --> 01:15:00.510]  Sure, but I mean your source knows what that means then.
[01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:04.091]  So, so, so, so what do you, what are you thinking is going on or what's your source say?
[01:15:05.373 --> 01:15:09.594]  Well, the source is saying that we have simultaneous things happening right now.
[01:15:09.594 --> 01:15:11.534]  We have globalists inside the U.S.
[01:15:11.534 --> 01:15:14.035]  government on both sides of parties.
[01:15:14.035 --> 01:15:27.338]  That means Democrat and Republican, which are going for the removal of Trump, the impeachment, the coup, the overthrow of Trump, while at the same time you have an activation of Islamic terror cells being activated throughout the U.S.
[01:15:27.338 --> 01:15:31.299]  and Canada, and there's tons of backchatter right now in the intelligence agency.
[01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:34.641]  Oh yeah, we were the first to break the Iranian sleeper cells that have been activated.
[01:15:34.641 --> 01:15:35.582]  Now that's mainstream news.
[01:15:35.582 --> 01:15:36.543]  You're right.
[01:15:36.543 --> 01:15:38.544]  So this is a maximum danger.
[01:15:38.544 --> 01:15:43.087]  They covered up that Islamic cell out in New Mexico.
[01:15:43.087 --> 01:15:44.168]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:15:44.168 --> 01:15:45.349]  Miller-Weaver, stay there.
[01:15:45.349 --> 01:15:47.830]  Let's put the pieces together on the other side.
[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:55.456]  Bottom line, 55 days out, everybody better be watching their six, praying to God, and being politically active because right now history's being made.
[01:15:57.583 --> 01:16:03.026]  When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers and identity thieves can see anything you do online.

[01:16:56.773 --> 01:17:00.656]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:17:26.913 --> 01:17:29.074]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[01:17:29.074 --> 01:17:29.854]  Not true.
[01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.714]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:31.714 --> 01:17:35.715]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:18.463]  You're listening to The Antidote for Fake News.
[01:20:18.463 --> 01:20:19.724]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:19.724 --> 01:20:26.727]  Canada is still a commonwealth of Her Majesty's Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II.
[01:20:33.004 --> 01:20:40.346]  And they have martial law provisions that they can put into effect, and Trudeau has been making some noises about that.
[01:20:40.346 --> 01:20:44.187]  They're already arresting preachers that criticize homosexuality.
[01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:49.209]  They're basically an SJW palace, like Germany or Sweden.
[01:20:49.209 --> 01:20:51.470]  Totally open to radical Islam.
[01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.970]  You name it.
[01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:55.271]  England's releasing people from jail that are admittedly involved in bombings.
[01:20:55.271 --> 01:20:58.172]  That's in the news at newswars.com.
[01:20:58.172 --> 01:21:01.052]  So there are massive Islamic terror cells.
[01:21:01.052 --> 01:21:02.073]  Iran's the big threat.
[01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:04.662]  Inside the Western world.
[01:21:04.662 --> 01:21:10.343]  I told you months before it was mainstream news that they have sleeper cells that they've activated, that are ready to start taking action.
[01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:15.205]  And that's kind of the leftist Achilles heel, they think, on America and Canada and Europe.
[01:21:15.205 --> 01:21:22.788]  That if you don't behave, we've got 5-10% Muslim populations, we snap our fingers, they go on jihad.
[01:21:22.788 --> 01:21:26.109]  So it's kind of like an escape from New York where they put little explosives in his carotid arteries.
[01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:35.415]  That's what Islam is and they put that in and it's like we're Baron Harkin in the Heart Plug in the movie Dune like, you know, I don't like y'all just pull the heart plug out and your blood all pours out of your heart.
[01:21:35.415 --> 01:21:38.196]  I mean, that's basically what this is.
[01:21:38.196 --> 01:21:40.718]  Is there just they're they're mining the bridges.
[01:21:40.718 --> 01:21:41.479]  They're mining the
[01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:46.060]  The cultural dams to blow them.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:46.920]  So it's like a robber.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.161]  When he gets caught robbing a bank, he puts the gun to your head.
[01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:51.762]  And that's why they have to cover up for Islam.
[01:21:51.762 --> 01:21:59.184]  They have to always let people out when they commit terror attacks because they don't want you to know they're letting Islam in to then take your rights.
[01:22:03.905 --> 01:22:08.911]  She's one of the only folks not purged off the precious Twitter, so people can follow her there for now.
[01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:12.035]  Other points on what your source is saying he thinks is coming in Canada.
[01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:20.645]  I think the fact that Canada's gearing up, as you say, for an emergency, from according to your source, with all the other calls to have a coup against Trump, I think that just fits into the overall climate.
[01:22:22.296 --> 01:22:23.277]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:22:23.277 --> 01:22:41.780]  That's the whole point I'm trying to make here is that this source who personally communicates with and knows Trudeau and has privy information is basically saying in a panic, Canada is preparing itself for measures that they could take in the event of a coup or an overthrow in the United States.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:57.284]  And why would they have knowledge of that if it not for the fact that Justin Trudeau himself is a leftist that aligns himself with the left and the deep state that would be talking about and plotting the overthrow of President Trump?
[01:22:57.284 --> 01:23:04.306]  Oh, I mean, it's fair to say that Justin Trudeau is the... it's a very crude term and I hate to use it, but it absolutely fits.
[01:23:04.306 --> 01:23:04.847]  It's true.
[01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:06.067]  I mean, Justin Trudeau
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.962]  Is the butt plug of the New World Order.
[01:23:09.962 --> 01:23:14.988]  I mean, let's just say he's the sewer line of the New World Order.
[01:23:14.988 --> 01:23:16.590]  He's just a horrible creature.
[01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.572]  Says don't use the words mother and father.
[01:23:18.572 --> 01:23:20.334]  He is totally committed to evil.
[01:23:20.334 --> 01:23:22.216]  And I know the Canadians are totally upset with him.
[01:23:22.216 --> 01:23:22.857]  They want to get rid of him.
[01:23:24.511 --> 01:23:41.850]  And what it is is we see this underlying theme here between the NAFTA negotiations as to who's going to go against America and the Trump patriots, and who's going to be standing with the globalists once they try to do this coup, and essentially in some of these articles,
[01:23:42.603 --> 01:24:01.953]  Canada came out and said they felt betrayed by Mexico and Mexico being willing to work with Trump and his administration and Mexico was basically like, well, Canada just stands out for itself and we want to make sure we're on the best negotiating and we can be because both sides don't know what's going to happen here.
[01:24:02.273 --> 01:24:04.654]  They don't know how a coup is going to play out.
[01:24:04.654 --> 01:24:08.636]  And in fact, the deep state doesn't even know how a coup would play out either.
[01:24:08.636 --> 01:24:12.937]  So everyone's just trying to position themselves, make alliances.
[01:24:12.937 --> 01:24:23.041]  And there's a lot of chatter going on right now in the intelligence community about this coup, about also Islamic terror cells being activated inside the U.S.
[01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:30.104]  and Canada, which raises huge red flags again for talk of a potential false flag terror attack.
[01:24:30.544 --> 01:24:34.847]  They could happen around the midterms or sometime after.
[01:24:34.847 --> 01:24:38.430]  Oh, there's no doubt they're going to attack the media and say I'm behind it.
[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:42.993]  But they're not running thousands of articles saying I'm calling for violence and lying when I'm not saying it.
[01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:46.055]  And saying I'm saying get battle rifles ready for the media when I haven't said that.
[01:24:46.055 --> 01:24:47.376]  They're not doing that for nothing.
[01:24:47.376 --> 01:24:49.578]  They are gearing up for false flags.
[01:24:49.578 --> 01:24:54.081]  But the problem is they're real people are trying to stab congressmen, shoot congressmen,
[01:24:55.562 --> 01:25:01.870]  Stabbed congressional candidates, burned down Republican facilities just today, death threats everywhere.
[01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:08.938]  I mean, it is getting redonkulous bonkers crazy right now.
[01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:14.265]  So I don't see how this violent blue wave is going to be blamed on Republicans.
[01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:30.635]  Well, another important thing to note here, Alex, the another thing that points to the fact that there's a coup possible or there's some kind of emergency that's going to happen possible is that President Trump actually made a presidential proclamation on August 31st.
[01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:51.728]  Declaring this month, September 2018, National Preparedness Month, and essentially in his presidential proclamation, which you can pull up on WhiteHouse.gov, he's basically warning people to take measures and actions to get prepared for the inevitable or the unpredicted
[01:25:52.248 --> 01:26:13.929]  Disasters and things that could happen in our nation and yes, he does mention You know disasters in the wake an example with hurricanes and other things like that, but he's also mentioning just Overall being prepared for the unknown whether it's economic whether it's anything and this is a very important thing He initiated this
[01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:29.967]  Proclamation on August 31st and this is all in this timeline when they fully went forward with censoring and banning Alex Jones and InfoWars on August 4th and continuing on throughout the show.
[01:26:29.967 --> 01:26:31.368]  Sure, and now they're purging everybody else.
[01:26:31.368 --> 01:26:33.309]  They're getting the voices silenced.
[01:26:33.309 --> 01:26:36.632]  They don't want live feeds to counter their narrative ahead of the big false flag.
[01:26:36.632 --> 01:26:37.492]  Millie Weaver, great job.
[01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:38.073]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:26:39.551 --> 01:26:40.351]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:40.351 --> 01:26:40.712]  Thank you.
[01:26:40.712 --> 01:26:44.553]  Okay, now we have a bunch of big guests coming up as well.
[01:26:44.553 --> 01:26:49.796]  Eric Bolling, formerly of Fox News, I once joked that I wanted to have a Bare Knuckles boxing match with him.
[01:26:51.343 --> 01:26:52.044]  He's going to beat me up.
[01:26:52.044 --> 01:26:52.604]  It was a joke.
[01:26:52.604 --> 01:26:54.185]  I'm actually scared now.
[01:26:54.185 --> 01:26:57.208]  I ran into him at Trump Tower, and I agree with 90% of what he has to say.
[01:26:57.208 --> 01:27:00.590]  He disagrees with me on a lot of things, or at least what the media has said about straw men.
[01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.072]  He's going to be in here all next hour.
[01:27:03.072 --> 01:27:03.933]  Roger Stone coming up.
[01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:07.055]  We've got Graham Ledger of One American News about the censorship.
[01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.676]  How is Trump going to fight back?
[01:27:08.676 --> 01:27:09.997]  What's the latest in D.C.
[01:27:09.997 --> 01:27:11.699]  on executive orders they say are imminent?
[01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:20.557]  And I've got that from White House sources, campaign sources, and some of the, let's just say, community outreach groups that Trump is involved with.
[01:27:20.557 --> 01:27:22.757]  I think people can probably guess what I'm talking about.
[01:27:22.757 --> 01:27:27.498]  It would have been done weeks ago, but he's being sabotaged, as they now admit.
[01:27:27.498 --> 01:27:29.998]  So that's coming up with Graham Ledger in the next segment.
[01:27:29.998 --> 01:27:35.239]  First off, everybody needs to go to InfoWarsTore.com and support the broadcast.
[01:27:35.239 --> 01:27:35.660]  Obvious.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.460]  That's clear.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:37.340]  We're under attack.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.920]  We're trying to expand.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.340]  The Democratic Party's coming after me.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.401]  Hillary's trying to shut me down.
[01:27:41.401 --> 01:27:42.521]  They've got all these fake lawsuits.
[01:27:44.195 --> 01:27:46.776]  We're beating a lot of these, but it's going to take a lot of money.
[01:27:46.776 --> 01:27:49.097]  So if you want them to win, don't get the products.
[01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.098]  But you are doing it.
[01:27:51.098 --> 01:27:52.319]  You are doing it.

[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:01.743]  So I can no longer secure it from this big oil company where they get it at 12,000 feet, the pure iodine.
[01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.883]  Nobody else has it.
[01:28:02.883 --> 01:28:04.744]  Maybe we'll get it again with another company.
[01:28:04.744 --> 01:28:05.685]  The contract's over.
[01:28:05.685 --> 01:28:06.965]  I can't get a better deal.
[01:28:06.965 --> 01:28:07.986]  They keep raising prices.
[01:28:08.846 --> 01:28:15.090]  We're working on some other suppliers, but you know, you got to go through a bunch of stuff and it's an amazing product.

[01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:44.323]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[01:31:44.323 --> 01:31:57.091]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[01:31:57.984 --> 01:32:08.574]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.574 --> 01:32:10.636]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.636 --> 01:32:13.518]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.518 --> 01:32:15.000]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:21.826]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.826 --> 01:32:23.107]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:32:23.888 --> 01:32:33.596]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.596 --> 01:32:50.429]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.429 --> 01:32:53.592]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:53.712 --> 01:33:01.186]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:01.186 --> 01:33:03.831]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.355 --> 01:33:08.275]  Keep it conditioning!
[01:33:08.275 --> 01:33:09.556]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:33:09.556 --> 01:33:10.376]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:11.057]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.057 --> 01:33:11.917]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.917 --> 01:33:14.798]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:24.422]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:33:24.422 --> 01:33:26.303]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:33:26.303 --> 01:33:30.025]  It's time to confirm there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[01:33:31.626 --> 01:33:36.269]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:33:36.269 --> 01:33:38.931]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:41.953]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:33:41.953 --> 01:33:43.854]  It just pancaked.
[01:33:43.854 --> 01:33:47.977]  He took the baby's own incubators and left me drunken to die on the crosswalk.
[01:33:48.757 --> 01:33:50.758]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:57.819]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:33:57.819 --> 01:33:58.179]  U.S.A.
[01:33:58.179 --> 01:34:01.320]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.900]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.861]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[01:34:05.861 --> 01:34:06.501]  Some former U.S.
[01:34:06.501 --> 01:34:08.941]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:34:08.941 --> 01:34:12.502]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:34:12.802 --> 01:34:18.425]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:34:18.425 --> 01:34:19.926]  Russian scum!
[01:34:19.926 --> 01:34:20.766]  Denied everything.
[01:34:20.766 --> 01:34:22.267]  He called it all fake news.
[01:34:22.267 --> 01:34:25.248]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:34:25.248 --> 01:34:27.409]  This is a national emergency.
[01:34:27.409 --> 01:34:32.912]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:34:32.912 --> 01:34:34.573]  This is a FEMA high-level alert.
[01:34:35.433 --> 01:34:38.095]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:34:38.095 --> 01:34:43.278]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange?
[01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:44.238]  Which base?
[01:34:44.238 --> 01:34:47.060]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.841]  If they can shut us down, you're next.
[01:34:50.021 --> 01:34:54.827]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:54.827 --> 01:34:56.429]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:07.404 --> 01:35:11.345]  Eric Boulding, formerly of Fox News, one of the people they went and got rid of because they didn't like him.
[01:35:11.345 --> 01:35:12.486]  Now with CRTV.
[01:35:12.486 --> 01:35:13.886]  He was just up in Dallas and went back.
[01:35:13.886 --> 01:35:14.767]  Now he's going to be here.
[01:35:14.767 --> 01:35:16.407]  He's a really charming guy in person.
[01:35:16.407 --> 01:35:20.248]  You know, one time he said some smart-ass stuff and I said, I'll get in the boxing ring with you.
[01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:21.769]  And then I met him.
[01:35:21.769 --> 01:35:22.869]  He's built like a boxer.
[01:35:22.869 --> 01:35:25.070]  I'm like, okay, well, I still kick his ass.
[01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.750]  I'm joking.
[01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:27.371]  He's in there in the control room.
[01:35:27.371 --> 01:35:28.651]  He says he's going to beat me up on air.
[01:35:28.651 --> 01:35:29.672]  No, I'm joking.
[01:35:29.672 --> 01:35:30.332]  That's coming up.
[01:35:31.172 --> 01:35:35.959]  Full hour with him next hour, and he's interviewing me for his CRR TV show.
[01:35:35.959 --> 01:35:39.383]  So, pre-game of the Alex Jones interview coming up today.
[01:35:39.383 --> 01:35:42.127]  Before you hate or say anything about it, big hair, don't care.
[01:35:42.127 --> 01:35:44.610]  He does have a lot of hair.
[01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:44.890]  I don't.
[01:35:44.890 --> 01:35:46.252]  I'm kind of jealous.
[01:35:46.252 --> 01:35:47.354]  But seriously...
[01:35:49.454 --> 01:35:55.901]  It's going to be somewhat of a debate, too, because they misrepresent what I've said about 9-11, about Sandy Hook, and I don't want to spend all day on that with him.
[01:35:55.901 --> 01:35:57.823]  But I tell people, go after me.
[01:35:57.823 --> 01:35:58.885]  That's what I like.
[01:35:58.885 --> 01:36:02.328]  No one will come on the show and debate me or argue about stuff, and I'm sick of it.
[01:36:02.328 --> 01:36:03.750]  But Eric Bowling will.
[01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:05.472]  You know, he lost his son recently.
[01:36:05.472 --> 01:36:06.433]  I couldn't imagine that.
[01:36:06.433 --> 01:36:08.135]  I've got a 16-year-old son.
[01:36:08.135 --> 01:36:09.176]  But he's a real trooper.
[01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:12.620]  And the stuff they got rid of him for is just more crap.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.903]  It's like this Serena Williams business.
[01:36:14.903 --> 01:36:16.024]  But let's go to our next guest.
[01:36:16.024 --> 01:36:17.786]  We've only got him for one segment.
[01:36:17.786 --> 01:36:18.988]  And that's Graham Ledger.
[01:36:18.988 --> 01:36:23.513]  I've been on his show on One American News Network, OANN.com.
[01:36:23.513 --> 01:36:27.437]  Talking about censorship, I wanted to get his take because I know he and Jack Posobiec and others
[01:36:28.438 --> 01:36:33.001]  Uh, have really, really, really, really got their, their ear to the ground.
[01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:34.241]  So he's coming up.
[01:36:34.241 --> 01:36:39.604]  Trump executive action on social media censorship being blocked by insiders.
[01:36:39.604 --> 01:36:42.306]  Manafort reportedly pursuing plea deal.
[01:36:42.306 --> 01:36:43.727]  We're going to get into that.
[01:36:43.727 --> 01:36:48.029]  Uh, Fahrenheit 2018, Amazon begins banning controversial books.
[01:36:48.029 --> 01:36:49.890]  It's a men's self-help book.
[01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:50.531]  Strangely enough.
[01:36:51.559 --> 01:36:57.662]  I read one of these guys' books, because I never read a men's self-help book, but I got to know Neil Strauss, because we're going to write a book together.
[01:36:57.662 --> 01:37:06.587]  They've been trying to censor the real secret history of the world and the war for the future that is being done right now.
[01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:10.529]  I should add, it'll make him go crazy at CNN, how dare people publish a book.
[01:37:10.529 --> 01:37:14.891]  But I've read one of his other books, pretty milquetoast stuff.
[01:37:14.891 --> 01:37:18.833]  Pretty milquetoast stuff, how a lot of women won't respect you if you don't respect yourself.
[01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.834]  And it's not even about being assertive or acting like you're
[01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:24.952]  Rebel without a cause, or something.
[01:37:24.952 --> 01:37:28.634]  You just have to actually be confident, not act like you're confident.
[01:37:28.634 --> 01:37:35.617]  Well, they banned that because you can't have men help themselves, because men are bad.
[01:37:35.617 --> 01:37:36.177]  Crazy.
[01:37:36.177 --> 01:37:44.921]  Now, let me do this here, because I've got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to, and obviously I've got tons of news, and I should be taking calls, but so much is going on.
[01:37:44.921 --> 01:37:48.323]  I want to get into the violence that's taking place.
[01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:59.595]  Because I've experienced it, and you've seen Fox News hosts have tea and coffee thrown on them, or people screaming at them, or Candace Owens, people trying to attack her, calling her a white supremacist.
[01:37:59.595 --> 01:38:10.261]  A bunch of soy boy, skinny pants liberals in the face of a black lady saying she's a white supremacist.
[01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:11.462]  It is insane.
[01:38:11.462 --> 01:38:17.265]  And that latest video we showed you yesterday of these Hispanic ladies come over screaming, you're a monkey, white people are bad.
[01:38:18.789 --> 01:38:19.730]  I hate the KKK.
[01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:20.431]  I hate that lady.
[01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:21.673]  She's brown KKK.
[01:38:21.673 --> 01:38:31.646]  The media edited her calling me a monkey saying my mother's married to her brother and then just said Jones attacked this poor veteran and they edited the tape.
[01:38:31.646 --> 01:38:32.227]  And guess what?
[01:38:32.227 --> 01:38:35.912]  Facebook officially pushed that out in partnership
[01:38:37.031 --> 01:38:39.372]  With Snapchat's media production company.
[01:38:39.372 --> 01:38:45.053]  So, 10 million people last time I checked had been force-fed that I'm bullying a Hispanic lady.
[01:38:45.053 --> 01:38:49.354]  And they cut out our, you're a monkey, F your mother, all this stuff.
[01:38:49.354 --> 01:38:53.215]  Your mother's an inbred piece of crap, whites are subhuman trash.
[01:38:53.215 --> 01:38:56.276]  I mean, you heard what the New York Times board member said.
[01:38:58.055 --> 01:39:00.696]  Whites are goblin creatures that live in holes.
[01:39:00.696 --> 01:39:02.958]  I can't wait till they're all dead.
[01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:04.819]  I hate white men more than anything.
[01:39:04.819 --> 01:39:06.399]  I love being mean to white men.
[01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:09.941]  I love bullying white men.
[01:39:09.941 --> 01:39:11.702]  Oh, the New York Times says that's wonderful.
[01:39:11.702 --> 01:39:13.063]  She's an Asian woman.
[01:39:13.063 --> 01:39:14.323]  She's downtrodden.
[01:39:14.323 --> 01:39:18.946]  Asians are just the top nine slots based on race in the U.S.
[01:39:18.946 --> 01:39:20.687]  for wealth.
[01:39:20.687 --> 01:39:22.768]  Then white people are after that.
[01:39:24.042 --> 01:39:25.984]  And then Hispanics, and then black folks.
[01:39:25.984 --> 01:39:33.653]  The richest guy in the world, Lisa Bezos got in there, was Carlos Slim, you know, from Mexico, but it's just a load of manure.
[01:39:33.653 --> 01:39:34.834]  Remember Bernie Sanders?
[01:39:34.834 --> 01:39:38.838]  White people do not know what it's like to be poor!
[01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:46.612]  I swindle colleges and have three $1 million houses and drive $122,000 Audis.
[01:39:46.612 --> 01:39:51.673]  But that's okay, because I have bozo hair.
[01:39:51.673 --> 01:39:56.974]  And if you have bozo hair, you are then allowed to say stupid things.
[01:39:56.974 --> 01:39:58.275]  I am in charge now.
[01:39:58.275 --> 01:39:59.335]  And we can joke about that.
[01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:09.299]  But the Democrats are so, so, so very, very close to bringing in socialism.
[01:40:09.299 --> 01:40:16.704]  From Florida to New York to California, they're nominating communists.
[01:40:16.704 --> 01:40:17.625]  Remember Hugo Chavez?
[01:40:17.625 --> 01:40:19.767]  Oh, I'm not a communist, I'm a democratic socialist.
[01:40:19.767 --> 01:40:20.827]  I'm a socialist.
[01:40:20.827 --> 01:40:22.008]  I'm a socialist communist.
[01:40:22.008 --> 01:40:23.069]  I'm a commie!
[01:40:23.069 --> 01:40:24.210]  I was always a commie!
[01:40:28.561 --> 01:40:29.962]  Can we pull up Cortez?
[01:40:29.962 --> 01:40:37.525]  I mean, no matter what video or photo she's in, she looks like she is being electrocuted.
[01:40:37.525 --> 01:40:52.531]  But, you can't say that or they'll ban you on Twitter, because that's bullying a protected group, like that CNN reporter, Oliver Darcy, who runs around everywhere in hundreds of articles saying, ban me, lying about me, calling me all these names.
[01:40:52.531 --> 01:40:55.032]  I see him and I go, dude, you're a jerk, man.
[01:40:55.032 --> 01:40:56.032]  You're anti-American.
[01:40:56.032 --> 01:40:57.473]  You're like the Hitler Youth burning books.
[01:40:58.507 --> 01:41:02.350]  When it says, you're banned, you don't call someone a Nazi.
[01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.770]  Wow!
[01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:07.994]  The left has Nazi diarrhea of the mouth!
[01:41:07.994 --> 01:41:10.516]  That's all they do, is call people Nazis.
[01:41:10.516 --> 01:41:16.621]  And of course, they're funded and run by a Nazi collaborating dirtbag named George Soros.
[01:41:16.621 --> 01:41:19.683]  Can we pull up the photo you pulled up last week?
[01:41:19.683 --> 01:41:26.949]  Or maybe it was Monday, of Soros with Juncker, the richest Nazi family, was his grandfather, his dad was in the SS, and the
[01:41:27.924 --> 01:41:29.945]  And he got the Nazi wealth.
[01:41:29.945 --> 01:41:30.865]  The Junkers are royal.
[01:41:30.865 --> 01:41:35.266]  They used to be like the kings of Prussia, which is the most important area of Germany.
[01:41:35.266 --> 01:41:38.507]  So, you've got German royalty.
[01:41:38.507 --> 01:41:41.508]  Remember the Junker bombers, the Junker munitions?
[01:41:41.508 --> 01:41:46.469]  With the Nazi collaborator and it looks like they're going on a date.
[01:41:46.469 --> 01:41:47.149]  Now, there's the photo.
[01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:49.430]  For radio listeners, you've got to see this.
[01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:51.430]  I mean, what do you guys search to find that?
[01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:54.851]  Just Soros and Junker.
[01:41:56.674 --> 01:41:57.555]  You see, I already digressed.
[01:41:57.555 --> 01:42:06.723]  I didn't get to the attempted stabbings, the attempted shooting attacks, and the firebombings of Wyoming GOP offices, and what people saying killed Trump and his family, and raped his son.
[01:42:06.723 --> 01:42:08.664]  I mean, my God, you can't even keep track of this.
[01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:10.826]  Meanwhile, you know why they banned the show all over the place?
[01:42:10.826 --> 01:42:13.989]  Because we're saying the truth here, not what they claim.
[01:42:13.989 --> 01:42:18.613]  But think about Facebook, and the productions they push.
[01:42:20.482 --> 01:42:24.526]  Of Jones bullied three innocent Hispanic Native Americans.
[01:42:24.526 --> 01:42:24.987]  Look at him.
[01:42:24.987 --> 01:42:27.489]  He attacked them because they were Hispanic.
[01:42:27.489 --> 01:42:31.253]  And the tape doesn't have them going, your mother's a pig.
[01:42:31.253 --> 01:42:33.955]  Your mother's a white scum filth.
[01:42:33.955 --> 01:42:35.537]  Your mother.
[01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:39.961]  Your mother married her brother, you white monkey.
[01:42:39.961 --> 01:42:41.383]  Go back to Europe, monkey!
[01:42:42.922 --> 01:42:44.843]  Oh, but it's just her going, what?
[01:42:44.843 --> 01:42:46.645]  And then they play sad music.
[01:42:46.645 --> 01:42:48.926]  No one knows why he attacked the women.
[01:42:48.926 --> 01:42:49.747]  No one knows.
[01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:53.409]  That's how stupid Mark Zuckerberg thinks you are.
[01:42:53.409 --> 01:42:57.312]  What an enemy of this country.

[01:46:39.907 --> 01:46:41.629]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:15.675 --> 01:47:20.156]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[01:47:20.156 --> 01:47:24.136]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:24.136 --> 01:47:34.118]  We're going to look at Trump executive action on social media censorship being held up, being blocked by insiders.
[01:47:34.118 --> 01:47:37.219]  We have that from inside the White House.
[01:47:37.219 --> 01:47:43.140]  And breaking, DOJ set to investigate anti-conservative bias among social media giants.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.020]  That came out last night.
[01:47:45.319 --> 01:47:48.861]  We've got more on that coming up as well.
[01:47:48.861 --> 01:47:53.044]  We do have Eric Bolling who is here in the Infowar Studios.
[01:47:53.044 --> 01:47:55.906]  He'll be in studio coming up for the next hour.
[01:47:55.906 --> 01:47:58.108]  We've got a lot to cover there as well.
[01:47:58.108 --> 01:48:00.229]  Roger Stone coming up as well.
[01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:01.811]  But I want to go to a few of these clips.
[01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:08.115]  Like I mentioned, Wyoming GOP offices set on fire less than two days after opening.
[01:48:08.115 --> 01:48:09.256]  Police say it was intentional.
[01:48:10.322 --> 01:48:17.450]  And that ties into Secret Service wants to talk with actress Carol Cook over assassination comment.
[01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:24.118]  CNN refuses to report on attempted stabbing attack on Republican candidate by Democrat screaming F Trump over and over again.
[01:48:24.118 --> 01:48:28.062]  And the person running for Congress had to fight him off with a yard sign.
[01:48:28.062 --> 01:48:29.324]  The police actually witnessed this.
[01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:34.513]  But the media is not reporting on it, the establishment media.
[01:48:34.513 --> 01:48:37.975]  And you look at these guys, they always look like they escaped from mental institutions.
[01:48:37.975 --> 01:48:43.959]  Like, why are liberals, when you go to one of their rallies, so ugly and so crazy looking?
[01:48:43.959 --> 01:48:46.000]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.483]  Liberals are low IQ and stupid and ugly, on average.
[01:48:51.483 --> 01:48:54.285]  Or they're an uppercast that kind of feeds on the idiots below them.
[01:48:55.569 --> 01:48:58.050]  And they've got studies out where they're what?
[01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:00.671]  There's a bunch of different studies for different numbers, but they're all similar.
[01:49:00.671 --> 01:49:06.813]  Six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely to virtue signal and not give to charity.
[01:49:06.813 --> 01:49:16.876]  But they'll tell you nine times more often that they're giving money to people.
[01:49:16.876 --> 01:49:17.796]  They're children.
[01:49:17.796 --> 01:49:19.897]  They're mentally ill, in my view.
[01:49:19.897 --> 01:49:21.137]  So there you go.
[01:49:21.137 --> 01:49:23.018]  F. Trump.
[01:49:23.018 --> 01:49:23.738]  Farzad.
[01:49:25.148 --> 01:49:29.289]  Fazili attempts to stab GOP House candidate.
[01:49:29.289 --> 01:49:31.049]  So isn't that just precious?
[01:49:31.049 --> 01:49:33.210]  Scalise warns some on the left are inciting violence.
[01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:37.491]  You got big putrid blue wave of violence and intimidation.
[01:49:37.491 --> 01:49:49.033]  It's getting crazy and we've got plans for mass shootings and the police trying to find out who's threatening to mass shoot at the Trump Tower and at the Trump Hotel there in DC.
[01:49:50.618 --> 01:49:52.139]  It's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:49:52.139 --> 01:49:55.381]  And what are they going to do with 55 days out?
[01:49:55.381 --> 01:50:00.644]  What are they going to do as all of this begins to unfold?
[01:50:00.644 --> 01:50:04.867]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:50:04.867 --> 01:50:05.207]  D.C.
[01:50:05.207 --> 01:50:08.609]  police respond to mass shooting threat at event in Trump Hotel.
[01:50:08.609 --> 01:50:10.210]  I mean, who are these people?
[01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:12.792]  Threats of rape and strangling forced D.C.
[01:50:12.792 --> 01:50:15.193]  McAllister into hiding after anti-abortion tweet.
[01:50:15.193 --> 01:50:19.576]  People threatening to come to her house and kill her and rape her.
[01:50:19.576 --> 01:50:19.736]  Why?
[01:50:21.007 --> 01:50:25.273]  Because their whole reality is running your life.
[01:50:25.273 --> 01:50:27.616]  The left are control freaks.
[01:50:27.616 --> 01:50:37.770]  I remember when I was moving out of the house when I was 18, and my mom had bought some Oriole rugs, and I'd been out of high school about two months, and I had a job, and I was going to college.
[01:50:39.045 --> 01:50:43.333]  And I was sitting there telling my mom, I don't like these rugs and I don't like the food you've been getting.
[01:50:43.333 --> 01:50:47.321]  And she looked at my dad and she goes, David, get him an apartment now.
[01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:48.142]  Get his ass out of here.
[01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:50.627]  My mom's real nice, but it was that kicked me out of the nest thing.
[01:50:51.604 --> 01:50:57.470]  She was also mad because I was bringing my girlfriends into the house and one of them I think hit on my dad in front of her.
[01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:58.530]  I forgot that part.
[01:50:58.530 --> 01:50:59.872]  I forgot.
[01:50:59.872 --> 01:51:00.833]  Cindy.
[01:51:00.833 --> 01:51:02.354]  Cindy hit on my dad.
[01:51:02.354 --> 01:51:04.016]  She was quite a girl.
[01:51:04.016 --> 01:51:05.877]  Anyways, yeah, that was the real reason.
[01:51:05.877 --> 01:51:08.980]  That was about a day before, but then I'm telling my mom.
[01:51:10.101 --> 01:51:13.562]  About the rugs and how she's getting the wrong couches because they moved to a new house.
[01:51:13.562 --> 01:51:17.684]  And I was bitching and I had the smallest bedroom because they were building another house.
[01:51:17.684 --> 01:51:19.685]  It was a smaller house they were renting.
[01:51:19.685 --> 01:51:21.886]  And she just said, you know, get out.
[01:51:21.886 --> 01:51:24.307]  And so that's how the left is.
[01:51:24.307 --> 01:51:28.048]  They want to run everybody's life because they don't know how to do anything.
[01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:34.171]  They're all obsessed with those of us that have lives and are doing things and have children.
[01:51:34.171 --> 01:51:34.931]  They want to run our lives.
[01:51:34.931 --> 01:51:36.872]  They're like arrested development idiots.
[01:51:38.055 --> 01:51:39.816]  And so, that's what it comes down to.
[01:51:39.816 --> 01:51:42.978]  What's the best way to get thrown out of your house?
[01:51:42.978 --> 01:51:45.920]  Have your girlfriend hit on your dad in front of your mom.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:51.744]  Okay, anyways, let's continue with this clip.
[01:51:51.744 --> 01:51:57.107]  Castro Valley man accused of switchblade assault on GOP congressional candidate from KPIX5 of CBS.
[01:51:57.107 --> 01:51:57.948]  Here it is, San Francisco.
[01:51:57.948 --> 01:52:05.733]  We all know about the political war of words, but here in the East Bay, it got physical.
[01:52:05.733 --> 01:52:06.633]  Tell me what you think.
[01:52:06.633 --> 01:52:07.394]  He would have stabbed me.
[01:52:08.456 --> 01:52:12.058]  I mean, he had it out, saying, I'm going to kill you, MF, or I'm going to kill you.
[01:52:12.058 --> 01:52:15.780]  And he was, you could see his thumb trying to get the knife out.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.782]  Republican Rudy Peters is running for Congress.
[01:52:18.782 --> 01:52:25.426]  Over the weekend, he says he was threatened and attacked at his Republican booth at a fall festival in Castro Valley.
[01:52:25.426 --> 01:52:27.828]  He says it first started with verbal threats.
[01:52:28.348 --> 01:52:32.531]  He picks up the coffee cup to rear back, to throw it at us.
[01:52:32.531 --> 01:52:37.675]  And I jump around the table, he throws the coffee cup, it misses us, it hits the ground and breaks.
[01:52:37.675 --> 01:52:41.838]  So I come out and grab him and wrestle him and throw him down to the ground.
[01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:47.341]  He says that's when 35-year-old Farzad Fazeli of Castro Valley pulled out a knife.
[01:52:47.341 --> 01:52:51.164]  He's screaming, I'll kill you, MF, or I'll kill you, I'll kill you.
[01:52:51.164 --> 01:52:53.626]  And he's kind of circling me trying to get the knife out.
[01:52:53.806 --> 01:52:59.950]  Not only are the facts that are quite serious, but the defendant also has a prior conviction for a 242.
[01:52:59.950 --> 01:53:07.714]  Vazelli made his first court appearance today in custody for possession of a switchblade and threatening to commit great bodily injury or death.
[01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:11.717]  But Vazelli's mother and attorneys say he is the victim.
[01:53:11.717 --> 01:53:17.860]  My client at this point was afraid for his life, afraid for his health and safety.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:21.743]  And I believe that he's alleged he pulls out a folded knife.
[01:53:22.763 --> 01:53:24.185]  Life was never opened.
[01:53:24.185 --> 01:53:26.287]  Mr. Peters got physical first.
[01:53:26.287 --> 01:53:29.910]  Buseli's mother was at the festival at a Democratic booth.
[01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:35.136]  She says she didn't see what happened, but she says she talked to her son before he was arrested.
[01:53:35.136 --> 01:53:42.263]  And he said that Mr. Peters had taken him by the shoulders and just shoved him down to the ground and there was blood on him and blood on his shirt.
[01:53:42.583 --> 01:53:49.811]  Peters says when Fuseli took out a knife, he shielded himself by reaching for one of his election signs for protection.
[01:53:49.811 --> 01:53:51.413]  He says he never worried about his safety.
[01:53:51.413 --> 01:53:52.114]  Okay, that's good.
[01:53:52.114 --> 01:53:56.859]  So the Seahawks says, or Grendel's mother says that he was sweet.
[01:53:56.859 --> 01:53:59.662]  Meanwhile, do you know who the Republicans are running against?
[01:53:59.662 --> 01:54:00.323]  Swallowwell.
[01:54:02.156 --> 01:54:05.937]  Swallowswell is one of the biggest con artists in Congress.
[01:54:05.937 --> 01:54:08.158]  One of the slimiest little dirtbags.
[01:54:08.158 --> 01:54:09.838]  He went on Tucker Carlson, remember?
[01:54:09.838 --> 01:54:16.140]  And when Tucker said the Russia thing was fake, he said, you are a Putin agent.
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:18.400]  Now you talk about swallowing lies.
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.841]  Swallowswell is an amazing individual.
[01:54:21.841 --> 01:54:25.382]  Speaking of that, an amazing individual who really is amazing, Congressman Scalise.
[01:54:25.382 --> 01:54:26.882]  Some on the left are inciting violence.
[01:54:26.882 --> 01:54:28.503]  Yes, the sky is blue.
[01:54:28.503 --> 01:54:29.163]  Let's play that clip.
[01:54:30.285 --> 01:54:49.224]  And yet you've got some people on the left that just want to this idea of resist and ignore the fact that he's president and they want to try to interrupt the ability for Congress to do its job and and then of course you know you've gotten aware with their death threats and literal attacks on lives and there's no place for it in our politics and I frankly what I want to see is the left stand up against this.
[01:54:50.044 --> 01:54:58.450]  We were goaded into some of this stuff when Barack Obama was president, and we stood up against that kind of violence, and we didn't resort to it.
[01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:04.314]  They are, and in fact, some on the left are inciting that kind of violence, and frankly, they ought to be called out on it.
[01:55:06.537 --> 01:55:07.857]  They ought to be arrested for it.
[01:55:07.857 --> 01:55:09.278]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:55:09.278 --> 01:55:12.078]  The way they lie about everybody, the way they attack everybody, it's crazy.
[01:55:12.078 --> 01:55:23.441]  Now, that said, Eric Bolling coming up of CRTV, and we're going to be covering a ton of news, and it should be a heated discussion, a friendly discussion, though he said he's going to beat me up on air.
[01:55:23.441 --> 01:55:24.141]  I'm joking.
[01:55:24.141 --> 01:55:27.402]  He's got the new book out, The Swamp.
[01:55:27.402 --> 01:55:28.722]  All I'm asking listeners to do is this.
[01:55:29.835 --> 01:55:39.862]  Yes, we have record listeners right now since we're totally banned on AM and FM and TV and Infowars.com, but the globalists think it's a dead cat bounce.
[01:55:39.862 --> 01:55:40.423]  They think...
[01:55:42.119 --> 01:55:49.944]  That after you kind of forget about this and move on, not letting us be on social media and stuff will shut us down.
[01:55:49.944 --> 01:55:53.346]  The problem is we were already 90% banned, like other conservatives.
[01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:55.207]  So it already happened.
[01:55:55.207 --> 01:55:58.308]  And they think we're idiots because Congress doesn't understand what's happening.
[01:55:58.308 --> 01:56:07.053]  So we'll get more into Trump executive action on social media censorship, being blocked by insiders, DOJ set to investigate anti-conservative bias amongst social media giants.
[01:56:07.053 --> 01:56:08.054]  Some action is being taken.
[01:56:08.054 --> 01:56:09.095]  People now know it's a problem.
[01:56:09.955 --> 01:56:11.576]  We forced this issue out there.
[01:56:11.576 --> 01:56:14.799]  One reason I was banned.
[01:56:14.799 --> 01:56:16.320]  But it is a fight.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.043]  And so, that's why spreading the word about local stations you're on.
[01:56:20.043 --> 01:56:30.611]  And even if you're listening on a local station, and InfoWars is hard to promote on Twitter or Facebook, you can promote that local station's video feed or audio feed and say,
[01:56:32.182 --> 01:56:36.846]  Tune in to this lineup at two o'clock for verboten info.
[01:56:36.846 --> 01:56:37.826]  Just follow the link.
[01:56:37.826 --> 01:56:40.488]  And then their AI computers look for the name Alex Jones.
[01:56:40.488 --> 01:56:43.971]  They won't see that.
[01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:56.220]  And we've seen folks on Twitter who even only just have a few hundred followers that are tweeting out local radio stations we're on saying, hey, here is some really interesting information.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.082]  Oh, here's some wonderful pro-Democrat info.
[01:56:59.082 --> 01:57:00.484]  The computers then see that.
[01:57:01.334 --> 01:57:02.535]  And pushing.
[01:57:02.535 --> 01:57:07.360]  So on Twitter and Google say, oh, here's some fabulous blue wave info.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.423]  Thank God Trump's about to be gone.
[01:57:09.423 --> 01:57:13.407]  And then you just send the link to the local TV or radio station.
[01:57:13.407 --> 01:57:16.330]  Because it's AI watching and scanning all that.
[01:57:16.330 --> 01:57:18.332]  Don't forget, I didn't plug this hour.
[01:57:18.332 --> 01:57:21.115]  X2, the Deep Earth Crystal Source, iodine, the very best out there.
[01:57:21.115 --> 01:57:21.716]  Did I plug this hour?
[01:57:22.216 --> 01:57:22.956]  It's amazing.
[01:57:22.956 --> 01:57:25.197]  25% off even though we can't get it anymore.
[01:57:25.197 --> 01:57:26.078]  Hopefully we will down the road.
[01:57:26.078 --> 01:57:26.978]  This is the last run.
[01:57:26.978 --> 01:57:29.039]  The contract's broken for Survival Show.
[01:57:29.039 --> 01:57:29.659]  It's amazing.
[01:57:29.659 --> 01:57:31.980]  Discover the good halogen versus the bad halogens.
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:37.643]  Discover why it's got 6,000 plus positive reviews, 98% review rate.

[01:57:40.604 --> 01:57:41.965]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:41.965 --> 01:57:43.525]  And download the Android app.
[01:57:43.525 --> 01:57:44.566]  It hasn't been banned yet.
[01:57:49.668 --> 01:57:50.749]  Travis in Florida.
[01:57:50.749 --> 01:57:51.749]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:57:51.749 --> 01:57:54.651]  You know, I'm really, the country's in deep trouble, but at least we're fighting back.
[01:57:54.651 --> 01:57:59.153]  I'm getting persecuted hard, but you know, it's good to be number two, under attack, under the president.
[01:57:59.153 --> 01:58:03.335]  I'm in good company, and so I, my bones feel good.
[01:58:03.335 --> 01:58:04.676]  I feel close to my ancestors.
[01:58:04.676 --> 01:58:06.257]  I feel like I'm delivering.
[01:58:06.397 --> 01:58:08.718]  You're definitely, you're definitely right there with us, the Patriots.
[01:58:08.718 --> 01:58:11.238]  I guess it is true, truth is treason and the empire of lies.
[01:58:11.238 --> 01:58:13.719]  I want to thank you personally, I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
[01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:16.260]  Anyone who knows, like a hypothyroidism condition.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.020]  I currently, I mean the products, I can just name them all real quick.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:25.362]  Brain Force, X2, Selenium, the Micro-CX, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Prostacar, the coffee, the Chaga Mushroom Blend, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Male.
[01:58:25.362 --> 01:58:27.462]  Let me tell you, it gave me my life back.
[01:58:27.462 --> 01:58:29.743]  Just taking the thyroid medicine alone is just not enough.
[01:58:29.743 --> 01:58:32.284]  Just having these products has saved my life, just back to normal.
[01:58:32.284 --> 01:58:33.184]  I'm working harder.
[01:58:36.929 --> 01:58:40.935]  They are the highest quality you're going to get out there and that's why people love them.
[01:58:40.935 --> 01:58:42.097]  So thank you for the support.
[01:58:42.097 --> 01:58:42.578]  God bless you.
[01:58:42.578 --> 01:58:43.820]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:44.421]  Take care, Travis.
[01:58:47.984 --> 01:58:54.365]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.365 --> 01:58:57.566]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:57.566 --> 01:59:01.287]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.287 --> 01:59:05.988]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:05.988 --> 01:59:09.269]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:21.132]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.132 --> 01:59:29.655]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:59:31.295 --> 01:59:32.896]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:57.406 --> 02:00:15.275]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:15.275 --> 02:00:21.318]  Alright, another one of the political prisoners of the Gulag of the Mind, Eric Bolling, is going to be in studio with us.
[02:00:21.318 --> 02:00:23.319]  He's now with CRTV and all the great work.
[02:00:24.577 --> 02:00:27.359]  They're doing over there, EricBowling.com.
[02:00:27.359 --> 02:00:30.962]  He's going to be in studio with us coming up for the rest of the hour.
[02:00:30.962 --> 02:00:37.307]  And we're going to cover the waterfront about where he thinks political correctness is going, the censorship, what should be done to big tech.
[02:00:37.307 --> 02:00:38.608]  There's so much to get into.
[02:00:38.608 --> 02:00:42.751]  But EU army to increase ranks sevenfold.
[02:00:42.751 --> 02:00:48.516]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU army because it actually come out in documents.
[02:00:49.465 --> 02:01:04.509]  We'd actually gotten documents from someone inside Bilderberg that they were discussing an EU army to stop countries from having their own borders and that they were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists just out of the Middle East.
[02:01:04.509 --> 02:01:05.309]  It's all true.
[02:01:05.309 --> 02:01:05.849]  It all happened.
[02:01:05.849 --> 02:01:07.790]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:14.391]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives brought me secret Bilderberg documents the next year confirming it all.
[02:01:14.391 --> 02:01:16.752]  We published them all.
[02:01:16.752 --> 02:01:17.632]  I did get death threats.
[02:01:20.003 --> 02:01:22.745]  So, that's why they're so scared.
[02:01:22.745 --> 02:01:33.731]  And again, I don't want to say it's a Nazi conspiracy, because these were just criminals that were the Nazis, and so they're criminals now.
[02:01:33.731 --> 02:01:40.915]  But Juncker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU that England didn't vote to enter, but they're in, the UK, he is the grandson.
[02:01:40.915 --> 02:01:42.917]  His father was a top Nazi.
[02:01:42.917 --> 02:01:47.319]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[02:01:47.319 --> 02:01:47.980]  Royalty.
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:48.680]  The Juncker family.
[02:01:50.256 --> 02:01:51.557]  And so I just go back to this.
[02:01:51.557 --> 02:01:52.958]  Literal Nazis.
[02:01:52.958 --> 02:01:55.601]  Leftists walk up to me and they go, Nazi!
[02:01:55.601 --> 02:01:56.422]  Nazi!
[02:01:56.422 --> 02:01:57.162]  Hate speech!
[02:01:57.162 --> 02:01:58.243]  Ban you!
[02:01:58.243 --> 02:01:59.564]  You're Nazi!
[02:01:59.564 --> 02:02:00.906]  You're Nazi!
[02:02:00.906 --> 02:02:03.628]  And then you have an unelected EU that was actually a Hitler plan.
[02:02:03.628 --> 02:02:04.028]  The EU.
[02:02:04.028 --> 02:02:04.569]  Look it up.
[02:02:04.569 --> 02:02:05.810]  That's even BBC.
[02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:06.991]  Type it into a search engine.
[02:02:06.991 --> 02:02:09.433]  EU was Nazi plan.
[02:02:09.433 --> 02:02:13.477]  And then you learn about all this and it's just like, who could make this stuff up?
[02:02:16.587 --> 02:02:24.991]  I mean, when Juncker's dad was a top Nazi, Soros was helping round up Jews, but it's like, well, he gets awards because he did that.
[02:02:24.991 --> 02:02:28.613]  You're a Nazi because your grandfathers both almost died fighting the Nazis, Alex.
[02:02:28.613 --> 02:02:30.654]  A real Nazi's good.
[02:02:30.654 --> 02:02:32.035]  That's the upside-down land.
[02:02:32.035 --> 02:02:33.395]  But this is why they're so mad at Trump.
[02:02:33.395 --> 02:02:35.556]  The optimism, the success, the economy coming back.
[02:02:35.556 --> 02:02:38.638]  We'll be back after this promo with Mr. Bolling in studio.
[02:02:38.638 --> 02:02:38.998]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.193 --> 02:02:49.615]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[02:02:49.615 --> 02:02:56.177]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[02:02:56.177 --> 02:03:00.158]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[02:03:00.158 --> 02:03:01.879]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[02:03:05.755 --> 02:03:10.497]  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[02:03:10.497 --> 02:03:15.320]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:23.504]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[02:03:23.504 --> 02:03:35.090]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[02:03:37.106 --> 02:03:39.288]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[02:03:39.288 --> 02:03:48.958]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[02:03:48.958 --> 02:03:50.980]  He's not a politician.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:56.025]  He's one of us.
[02:03:56.025 --> 02:03:58.167]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[02:04:00.876 --> 02:04:06.621]  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.
[02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:13.007]  Carry yourself with dignity and pride.
[02:04:13.007 --> 02:04:16.230]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[02:04:16.230 --> 02:04:25.198]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
[02:04:25.198 --> 02:04:27.040]  Treat the word impossible
[02:04:28.072 --> 02:04:31.775]  As nothing more than motivation.
[02:04:31.775 --> 02:04:34.638]  Three American hostages are back home.
[02:04:34.638 --> 02:04:39.762]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[02:04:39.762 --> 02:04:51.532]  Seize this moment, believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe once more in America.
[02:04:51.532 --> 02:04:53.674]  I will fight for you with every
[02:04:56.274 --> 02:05:00.237]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.237 --> 02:05:03.519]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.519 --> 02:05:09.784]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:09.784 --> 02:05:12.566]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.306 --> 02:05:17.109]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:23.594]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.594 --> 02:05:28.558]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.298 --> 02:05:33.220]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:40.424]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.424 --> 02:05:45.126]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.126 --> 02:05:51.330]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:55.312]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:05:57.008 --> 02:05:57.789]  We've got it.
[02:05:57.789 --> 02:06:04.134]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:04.134 --> 02:06:08.518]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:08.518 --> 02:06:14.162]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:22.501 --> 02:06:25.802]  Well, Eric Bolling is here in studio for our Bare Knuckles match.
[02:06:25.802 --> 02:06:28.062]  He already beat me up during the break, so he wins.
[02:06:28.062 --> 02:06:33.844]  No, but seriously, censored, demonized for no reason like everybody else that's effective, removed from the airwaves.
[02:06:33.844 --> 02:06:42.226]  We'll talk about what it's like to be out of FOX, but more importantly, launching something truly free on CRTV with a politically incorrect name, AMERICA.
[02:06:42.226 --> 02:06:50.708]  So I'm all behind CRTV and its great success and all the great people that are over there from Mr. Levin to, of course, Mr. Malcolm.
[02:06:50.768 --> 02:06:52.529]  Michelle Malkin, Crowder, everybody.
[02:06:52.529 --> 02:06:58.774]  Really exciting what's going on at CRTV and also EricBowling.com because I just want to win the culture wars.
[02:06:58.774 --> 02:06:59.915]  I'm not in competition with you guys.
[02:06:59.915 --> 02:07:00.776]  So it's good to have you here.
[02:07:00.776 --> 02:07:01.456]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:07:01.456 --> 02:07:02.137]  Thank you very much.
[02:07:02.137 --> 02:07:05.279]  We ran into each other at Trump Hotel.
[02:07:05.279 --> 02:07:06.560]  Correct.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.041]  I was leaving, you were coming back.
[02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:11.784]  I think you were coming back from your little tiff with Marco Rubio, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:07:12.585 --> 02:07:17.549]  I caught you at the bottom of the stairs and I said, hey, Alex Jones, let's talk a little bit.
[02:07:17.549 --> 02:07:21.592]  I refresh your memory that about five years ago, you and I had a Twitter war.
[02:07:21.592 --> 02:07:23.394]  I think we were going to fight on the corner.
[02:07:23.394 --> 02:07:28.237]  And I said, I'll tell you what, Jones, I'll meet you on the corner of Park and Lex at four o'clock today.
[02:07:28.237 --> 02:07:29.739]  And you're like, OK, I'll be there.
[02:07:30.359 --> 02:07:31.500]  There's no corner of Park and Lex.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:32.722]  I just want to point that out.
[02:07:32.722 --> 02:07:40.210]  Anyway, make a long story short, we talked and I said, look, there are a lot of things about you and your theories that I despise.
[02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:41.492]  I can't stand them.
[02:07:41.492 --> 02:07:45.316]  However, we need to have a discussion as to whether or not all
[02:07:45.316 --> 02:07:50.118]  All this pulling you from the media has gone too far, or not.
[02:07:50.118 --> 02:07:52.199]  Maybe it hasn't, maybe it has, but let's have discussion.
[02:07:52.199 --> 02:07:56.141]  And then you said, let's go on each other's show, and I agreed that we would have a co-interview.
[02:07:56.141 --> 02:08:02.163]  That I come on your show, we talk together, co-interview, and you would come on mine, and we do the same.
[02:08:02.163 --> 02:08:03.684]  And here we are.
[02:08:04.554 --> 02:08:05.615]  So I came to Austin today.
[02:08:05.615 --> 02:08:06.116]  Absolutely.
[02:08:06.116 --> 02:08:08.278]  And I'm glad you want to do that because most people won't come on.
[02:08:08.278 --> 02:08:10.121]  They want to just say, oh, you're too evil to go on.
[02:08:10.121 --> 02:08:12.704]  Well, Charlie Manson did hundreds of interviews.
[02:08:12.704 --> 02:08:16.108]  Everybody interviewed from Mike Wallace to Barbara Walters.
[02:08:16.108 --> 02:08:20.092]  How am I supposedly so evil people can't come on the show?
[02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:20.813]  Because here's the thing.
[02:08:21.494 --> 02:08:23.656]  You say some of the things I say are despicable.
[02:08:23.656 --> 02:08:26.058]  A few things I've said turn out to be wrong, and I'll admit my mistakes.
[02:08:26.058 --> 02:08:30.402]  But most of what you brought up when we talked on record and off record in D.C.
[02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.124]  last week are straw men.
[02:08:32.124 --> 02:08:36.347]  It's misrepresentations, just like they say Trump hates all Mexicans.
[02:08:36.347 --> 02:08:39.470]  No, he said a lot of criminals are coming across the border, rapists and murderers.
[02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:41.212]  He didn't say they were all rapists and murderers.
[02:08:41.212 --> 02:08:44.555]  So, again, it's misrepresentations of what they do.
[02:08:45.547 --> 02:08:49.970]  Absolutely true on the Trump argument, but not true on your argument.
[02:08:49.970 --> 02:08:51.291]  I've heard you, Alex.
[02:08:51.291 --> 02:09:03.539]  In fact, the reason why we almost got in that fight, or that Twitter fight way back when, was when you were talking about the inside job that 9-11 was, and I will tell you, I watched the second plane fly into the building.
[02:09:03.539 --> 02:09:07.041]  I lost 16 very close friends in that World Trade Center.
[02:09:07.041 --> 02:09:11.884]  There is no way in the world that I think my government could be part of a conspiracy that would kill 3,000 Americans,
[02:09:13.405 --> 02:09:14.325]  Innocent Americans.
[02:09:14.325 --> 02:09:15.406]  It wasn't a wartime.
[02:09:15.406 --> 02:09:17.426]  It wasn't on the battlefield.
[02:09:17.426 --> 02:09:20.347]  These were innocent Americans going to work.
[02:09:20.347 --> 02:09:22.068]  Some of my closest friends died.
[02:09:22.068 --> 02:09:23.529]  And that really bothered me.
[02:09:23.529 --> 02:09:25.169]  Eric, I want to be clear.
[02:09:25.169 --> 02:09:27.470]  I still don't buy this fact that the government looked the other way.
[02:09:28.792 --> 02:09:39.436]  I'm not saying, just like there's rogue groups in the White House and rogue groups in the CIA fighting America that have been caught working with ISIS and Al Qaeda, and Trump says Obama and Hillary founded ISIS, that's true.
[02:09:39.436 --> 02:09:40.997]  John McCain was involved in that.
[02:09:40.997 --> 02:09:41.837]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:09:41.837 --> 02:09:47.119]  I'm not saying, because I've been to New York and people say, how dare you say firefighters blew up the towers?
[02:09:47.119 --> 02:09:48.059]  I never said that!
[02:09:48.059 --> 02:09:54.121]  I agree with Alex Jones that John McCain was there and did meet with some of the leaders of what would soon become ISIS.
[02:09:54.121 --> 02:09:54.722]  I agree with you.
[02:09:56.149 --> 02:10:05.353]  Explain to me what proof in the world that you have that our government had somehow information that there was going to be two planes flown into our World Trade Center and you don't have any else.
[02:10:05.353 --> 02:10:09.495]  I mean, I want to get into the bigger world and where we agree on things, but I'm happy to debate this.
[02:10:09.495 --> 02:10:11.716]  It would take hours to actually get into all the details.
[02:10:11.716 --> 02:10:15.098]  Just give me one piece, as Trump would say, give me one shred of evidence.
[02:10:15.098 --> 02:10:20.901]  Well, I mean, let me get into that, but what I'm getting at here is I'm not saying the government did it.
[02:10:20.901 --> 02:10:23.402]  I'm not saying, I'm not saying... You think they looked the other way.
[02:10:24.409 --> 02:10:30.872]  The 28, I've had Senator Paul on, I've had Congressman Jones on, they've read the 28 pages.
[02:10:30.872 --> 02:10:40.795]  And it says there was a NORAD stand down ordered and more than 20 FBI agents went public and said they were ordered to not stop.
[02:10:40.795 --> 02:10:43.296]  I believe radical Islam exists!
[02:10:43.296 --> 02:10:44.777]  I believe radical Islam exists!
[02:10:44.777 --> 02:10:45.837]  So do I!
[02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:46.978]  I'm saying they attacked us!
[02:10:47.918 --> 02:10:51.499]  They are using that argument to make a conspiracy theory that has no legs.
[02:10:51.499 --> 02:10:53.560]  Here's what the 28 pages does say.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:11:03.204]  That the United States did not go after what they believed or what turned out to be a link to Saudi Arabia of the bombing, of the terror attack.
[02:11:03.204 --> 02:11:05.165]  It doesn't say that the government looked the other way.
[02:11:05.165 --> 02:11:08.446]  It said they didn't follow up on the involvement of the Saudis.
[02:11:08.446 --> 02:11:11.247]  Well here we are 17 years and one day later.
[02:11:11.247 --> 02:11:11.928]  What about building 7?
[02:11:13.004 --> 02:11:14.145]  I was there.
[02:11:14.145 --> 02:11:15.345]  I'll tell you exactly what happened.
[02:11:15.345 --> 02:11:17.547]  I'll tell you exactly what happened at Building 7.
[02:11:17.547 --> 02:11:22.870]  So when they closed, the day, Tuesday, it was a Tuesday, they shut down Lower Manhattan from Canal Street down.
[02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:25.251]  You could not get there except for military.
[02:11:25.251 --> 02:11:27.572]  I happened to be an oil trader at the time.
[02:11:27.572 --> 02:11:31.435]  Oil was spiking, it was going through the roof, and the US government
[02:11:33.348 --> 02:11:42.490]  He was very fearful of an oil price going to five, six, seven hundred dollars per barrel, so they brought us in to the oil trading center of the world, which is one block from the World Trade Center.
[02:11:42.490 --> 02:11:44.110]  It's the World Financial Center.
[02:11:44.110 --> 02:11:55.052]  I'm telling you, Alex, every single day for the next four months, when no one else was in lower Manhattan, we were locked inside a building, and I can't tell you how many times there was an anthrax scare, or the ground was unstable.
[02:11:55.052 --> 02:11:58.312]  Remember, that whole area was built on landfill!
[02:11:58.312 --> 02:12:00.573]  No, I'm not saying... Listen, here's the deal.
[02:12:00.573 --> 02:12:01.773]  Take a study of
[02:12:02.193 --> 02:12:02.513]  Of course!
[02:12:22.261 --> 02:12:28.045]  So really, all over Twitter yesterday, mainline leftist sites celebrated and said America deserved it.
[02:12:28.045 --> 02:12:31.788]  Reality Winner had a top-secret security clearance and was helping ISIS.
[02:12:31.788 --> 02:12:37.852]  There are so many, the average professor at UT down the street loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[02:12:37.852 --> 02:12:42.836]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry out the attack!
[02:12:42.836 --> 02:12:45.098]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:49.320]  I don't think America deserves it!
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:49.920]  I know you don't!
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.021]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it!
[02:12:52.021 --> 02:12:53.661]  It wasn't your theory, Alex.
[02:12:53.661 --> 02:13:00.543]  Your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to stand down.
[02:13:00.543 --> 02:13:01.763]  A very different theory.
[02:13:01.763 --> 02:13:02.724]  Well, I know this.
[02:13:02.724 --> 02:13:04.704]  The official story does not add up.
[02:13:04.704 --> 02:13:06.285]  Can we talk Sandy Hood?
[02:13:06.285 --> 02:13:07.185]  Sure, and there's the next thing.
[02:13:07.705 --> 02:13:09.987]  9-11 was a big part of what I covered.
[02:13:09.987 --> 02:13:11.449]  I did make four films on it.
[02:13:11.449 --> 02:13:13.171]  I did cover it thousands of times.
[02:13:13.171 --> 02:13:15.513]  Sandy Hook, the general public didn't buy it.
[02:13:15.513 --> 02:13:16.594]  There were some anomalies.
[02:13:16.594 --> 02:13:17.495]  I played both sides.
[02:13:17.495 --> 02:13:22.841]  The media edits clips and then continues to say, Jones, stop saying nobody died.
[02:13:22.841 --> 02:13:24.082]  Stop doxing families.
[02:13:24.082 --> 02:13:25.264]  Never dox families.
[02:13:25.264 --> 02:13:27.866]  It's all edited like Megyn Kelly before she left Fox News.
[02:13:28.615 --> 02:13:29.816]  We've played this tape!
[02:13:29.816 --> 02:13:37.561]  She took me talking about Hillary funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda, responsible for killing kids, played a clip of that, and said that I said it was a pizza place!
[02:13:37.561 --> 02:13:38.942]  This is the level of fraud going on!
[02:13:38.942 --> 02:13:40.343]  Well, I'm not speaking for Megyn Kelly.
[02:13:40.343 --> 02:13:41.744]  I don't know Megyn Kelly.
[02:13:41.744 --> 02:13:47.948]  But I will tell you, I know you've said that this was a quote-unquote Alex Jones false flag operation.
[02:13:47.948 --> 02:13:51.790]  What that means is, it didn't really happen the way it's being portrayed.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.932]  I will give you the next step of evidence.
[02:13:53.932 --> 02:13:55.292]  I'm waiting for your shred of evidence.
[02:13:55.292 --> 02:13:57.074]  I'll give you my evidence why I think it did happen.
[02:13:57.794 --> 02:14:01.595]  I tragically lost my son a year ago in three days.
[02:14:01.595 --> 02:14:03.455]  Three days ago was a year.
[02:14:03.455 --> 02:14:06.356]  During that year, I had to get out of the limelight.
[02:14:06.356 --> 02:14:13.578]  I had to get away from New York and I moved to a town called Roxbury, Connecticut, which is about three miles from Newtown, Connecticut.
[02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:16.519]  I was in such a funk, I needed to see a therapist.
[02:14:16.519 --> 02:14:17.499]  I think Sandy Hook happened.
[02:14:17.499 --> 02:14:18.159]  Let's just get that clear.
[02:14:18.519 --> 02:14:25.821]  The therapist that I was sent to was the same therapist who talked to dozens of parents in the Sandy Hook community.
[02:14:25.821 --> 02:14:31.043]  And I will tell you, that community is distraught over what happened so many years ago.
[02:14:31.043 --> 02:14:32.403]  They are still reeling from that.
[02:14:32.403 --> 02:14:33.064]  No, I believe you.
[02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:34.484]  But let me say this, just so it's on record.
[02:14:35.802 --> 02:14:40.707]  I've literally barely covered Sandy Hook, and the media keeps saying that I'm- Can we do this?
[02:14:40.707 --> 02:14:49.276]  Can we, Alex Jones and Eric Bolling, agree that 9-11, no one looked the other way, terrorists actually attacked the World Trade Center on their own without the help of the U.S.
[02:14:49.276 --> 02:14:56.243]  government, and yes, in fact, a crazy lunatic walked into an elementary school and killed a bunch of kids in Newtown, Connecticut.
[02:14:56.243 --> 02:14:57.004]  Can we agree on that?
[02:14:58.536 --> 02:15:01.757]  I know mass shootings happen, and he was on Prozac, got the gun illegally.
[02:15:01.757 --> 02:15:02.678]  It's a yes or a no.
[02:15:02.678 --> 02:15:03.818]  No, no, no.
[02:15:03.818 --> 02:15:12.682]  I think Newtown happened, but because the lies about babies in incubators that get us in the first Iraq war, which was admittedly a PR firm, people have questions because they've been lied to so many times.
[02:15:12.682 --> 02:15:13.462]  People have questions.
[02:15:13.462 --> 02:15:14.123]  They're not.
[02:15:14.123 --> 02:15:14.663]  Did the U.S.
[02:15:14.663 --> 02:15:16.304]  government look the other way or not?
[02:15:16.304 --> 02:15:17.764]  Oh, I think elements of the U.S.
[02:15:17.764 --> 02:15:18.705]  government did look the other way.
[02:15:18.705 --> 02:15:19.485]  Do you have any evidence?
[02:15:19.485 --> 02:15:22.766]  When we come back, I'll be very, very happy to give you a lot of evidence.
[02:15:22.766 --> 02:15:23.427]  Excellent.
[02:15:23.427 --> 02:15:26.488]  Do you really think two of the hijackers' passports got found in the rubble?
[02:15:27.421 --> 02:15:28.242]  I don't know.
[02:15:28.242 --> 02:15:28.582]  I don't know.
[02:15:28.582 --> 02:15:30.203]  I watched that rubble burn for six months.
[02:15:30.203 --> 02:15:37.247]  I have no idea, but I know that there's... I would never live in an America where our government would look the other way and let 3,000 people die innocently.
[02:15:37.247 --> 02:15:52.196]  Well, I don't think the general public or the people that work, say, at the average FBI agent or the postman, but when we come back, we're going to talk about Building 7, because I heard them on CBS Radio say they're going to control demo Building 7, and then I have the news clips.
[02:15:52.196 --> 02:15:54.157]  If you want me to play them where they said they blew it up, we'll be back.

[02:19:58.726 --> 02:20:08.935]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:08.935 --> 02:20:11.597]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:11.597 --> 02:20:16.762]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:37.154 --> 02:20:39.336]  Alright, I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[02:20:39.336 --> 02:20:42.999]  It's not that I'm running away from it, it's that the media misrepresents what I say about it.
[02:20:42.999 --> 02:20:48.444]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam is one of the number one threats on the planet, probably number one.
[02:20:48.444 --> 02:20:53.869]  I know that there are criminals in our government, like Brennan, who reportedly converted to Wahhabism.
[02:20:53.869 --> 02:20:58.614]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring to overthrow our allies in Egypt, you name it.
[02:20:58.614 --> 02:21:01.497]  And I think that elements let this happen, like PNAC,
[02:21:02.017 --> 02:21:05.878]  wrote to let there be an attack to end up taking our liberties away.
[02:21:05.878 --> 02:21:08.938]  And I've got FBI was warned about flight schools.
[02:21:08.938 --> 02:21:10.859]  That's CBS News.
[02:21:10.859 --> 02:21:12.939]  FBI knew Al-Qaeda pilots were training in the U.S.
[02:21:12.939 --> 02:21:14.179]  in order to stand down.
[02:21:14.179 --> 02:21:15.660]  ABC News.
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:17.640]  State Department lapses aided 9-11 hijackers.
[02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:22.021]  Then they have the airlift of evil flying tens of thousands of Al-Qaeda fighters out.
[02:21:22.021 --> 02:21:23.321]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[02:21:23.321 --> 02:21:24.401]  I don't blame our military.
[02:21:24.401 --> 02:21:25.402]  They'll say, oh, you hate our military.
[02:21:25.402 --> 02:21:26.322]  No, I love our military.
[02:21:26.322 --> 02:21:27.202]  They were ordered to fly out.
[02:21:28.454 --> 02:21:29.475]  And fly to Pakistan.
[02:21:29.475 --> 02:21:33.377]  So they were being protected, not by our main force, but by criminals within.
[02:21:33.377 --> 02:21:35.719]  I saw articles even in the Guardian.
[02:21:35.719 --> 02:21:40.282]  Senior FBI agents, it's like Al-Qaeda has moles above us.
[02:21:40.282 --> 02:21:47.326]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left, and there are people in the government working to protect Islam.
[02:21:47.326 --> 02:21:49.547]  They got this Iman that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[02:21:49.547 --> 02:21:52.189]  After six months, he's being released from British prison next week.
[02:21:54.194 --> 02:21:56.936]  You've said some things that I agree with.
[02:21:56.936 --> 02:22:01.260]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:02.401]  I'll agree with that.
[02:22:02.401 --> 02:22:04.122]  Maybe the left's bigger, though.
[02:22:04.122 --> 02:22:19.475]  Well, I think the left is a different type of threat, and it's a longer-term threat, where radical Islam could kill a lot of people real fast, and the left, it's going to take a while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms, and that would feel like being killed, but maybe not actually kill us.
[02:22:21.596 --> 02:22:24.437]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack like Radical Islam.
[02:22:24.437 --> 02:22:25.597]  It's the left creeping around.
[02:22:25.597 --> 02:22:26.877]  I don't like them either.
[02:22:26.877 --> 02:22:28.158]  I'm on board with that.
[02:22:28.158 --> 02:22:29.338]  I'm not going to play the whole video.
[02:22:29.338 --> 02:22:29.938]  It's on YouTube.
[02:22:29.938 --> 02:22:31.238]  Let's put it up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:22:31.238 --> 02:22:33.419]  It's Kate Stanley, BBC.
[02:22:33.419 --> 02:22:34.939]  I drove to get a pizza that day.
[02:22:34.939 --> 02:22:36.840]  I've been on the air like 10 hours.
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:37.600]  It's 4 o'clock.
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:38.220]  I'm getting a pizza.
[02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:39.380]  I'm eating it in the car like a pig.
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:41.681]  I'm not in great shape like you.
[02:22:41.681 --> 02:22:48.522]  And they're announcing on, this is BBC, but on CBS News, Building 7, Salomon Brothers, they're going to have a controlled demolition to save buildings around it.
[02:22:48.522 --> 02:22:50.343]  They're putting charges in now.
[02:22:50.343 --> 02:22:51.063]  They're going to blow it up.
[02:22:52.048 --> 02:22:52.988]  I go and report it.
[02:22:52.988 --> 02:22:54.449]  The next day they go, Jones is crazy.
[02:22:54.449 --> 02:22:55.909]  He says that they, I saw it.
[02:22:55.909 --> 02:23:00.411]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[02:23:00.411 --> 02:23:00.991]  Have you seen that video?
[02:23:00.991 --> 02:23:02.752]  No.
[02:23:02.752 --> 02:23:04.192]  And it's right behind her.
[02:23:04.192 --> 02:23:04.752]  Well, I can't hear her.
[02:23:04.752 --> 02:23:07.113]  Do you want me to play it for you?
[02:23:07.113 --> 02:23:09.354]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[02:23:09.354 --> 02:23:16.076]  And by the way, you know, Alex, anyone could throw a video, a picture behind it, a news person.
[02:23:16.076 --> 02:23:17.037]  That could be a video screen.
[02:23:17.037 --> 02:23:18.437]  Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[02:23:18.437 --> 02:23:19.858]  They put the story out beforehand.
[02:23:21.124 --> 02:23:22.466]  So I'll tell you what I'll do.
[02:23:22.466 --> 02:23:24.430]  I will take this video of us here.
[02:23:24.430 --> 02:23:27.115]  I know, she's saying it's gone, it's already fallen.
[02:23:27.115 --> 02:23:27.796]  Well, it is fallen.
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:30.581]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:38.489]  I'm going to take this live footage, and then the next day, and I'm going to put all the local news clips of them saying, Building 7 is being blown up, the police countdown.
[02:23:38.489 --> 02:23:40.672]  I will tell you this, let me just do this for you.
[02:23:40.672 --> 02:23:50.262]  I was down there, I was down there, one of the only people that weren't military in that area, there may be a handful of us, maybe two, three hundred people max, trading oil because we had to stabilize the price of oil during that time.
[02:23:50.962 --> 02:23:52.743]  That whole area was unstable.
[02:23:52.743 --> 02:23:54.643]  They were worried about more than just Building 7.
[02:23:54.643 --> 02:23:56.664]  They were worried about some of the satellite buildings to the world.
[02:23:56.664 --> 02:24:01.105]  There were like four or five five-story World Trade Center buildings that were around.
[02:24:01.105 --> 02:24:03.586]  They were worried about those falling, the Brooks Brothers building.
[02:24:03.586 --> 02:24:05.507]  They were concerned that was going to go down, too.
[02:24:05.507 --> 02:24:08.467]  There was mass fear, confusion going on.
[02:24:08.467 --> 02:24:11.969]  That is all landfills.
[02:24:11.969 --> 02:24:13.809]  You're saying it's a false report?
[02:24:13.809 --> 02:24:15.189]  No, it's not a false report.
[02:24:15.189 --> 02:24:19.091]  I'm telling you, I don't think that there was a conspiracy to blow up Building 7.
[02:24:19.091 --> 02:24:19.751]  For what reason?
[02:24:20.925 --> 02:24:21.406]  To what end?
[02:24:21.406 --> 02:24:26.012]  No, no, I was saying, you're saying it was like a mistake, like Edmondson reported.
[02:24:26.012 --> 02:24:30.058]  I'm asking you, who blew up Building 7?
[02:24:30.058 --> 02:24:31.119]  All I know is... And why?
[02:24:31.119 --> 02:24:33.262]  We have the police, who I'm not saying were involved.
[02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:39.945]  Saying, we've been told they're blowing it up, get back, and I talked to... There was a lot of talk about taking unstable buildings down.
[02:24:39.945 --> 02:24:40.846]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:40.846 --> 02:24:42.968]  They were worried about buildings falling and hurting more people.
[02:24:42.968 --> 02:24:44.789]  No question about that.
[02:24:44.789 --> 02:24:48.713]  But, that was, what, the next day that Building 7 fell, came down?
[02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:51.396]  No, it was 4.30 Eastern.
[02:24:51.396 --> 02:24:52.857]  Okay, fine.
[02:24:52.857 --> 02:24:53.518]  5.30 Eastern.
[02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:56.421]  Whatever time it was, they were concerned about many buildings.
[02:24:56.421 --> 02:24:58.243]  Well, they did blow up a few more buildings in the next few days.
[02:24:58.763 --> 02:25:00.284]  Okay, so what's the theory?
[02:25:00.284 --> 02:25:01.005]  I'm saying you're right.
[02:25:01.005 --> 02:25:01.905]  What's the theory here?
[02:25:01.905 --> 02:25:04.707]  What are we trying to... Man, I'm getting outraged about it.
[02:25:04.707 --> 02:25:05.908]  Okay, you're a smart guy.
[02:25:05.908 --> 02:25:06.648]  I've been on TV a long time.
[02:25:06.648 --> 02:25:08.470]  Do you remember 1990?
[02:25:08.470 --> 02:25:09.550]  What got us into the Iraq War?
[02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:10.691]  I'm not saying Saddam's a good guy.
[02:25:10.691 --> 02:25:12.853]  It was 93, I think, wasn't it?
[02:25:12.853 --> 02:25:14.094]  No, 1990.
[02:25:14.094 --> 02:25:14.394]  Okay.
[02:25:14.394 --> 02:25:17.156]  And 1991 was Desert Shield, Desert Storm.
[02:25:17.156 --> 02:25:19.737]  But remember the woman testifying?
[02:25:19.737 --> 02:25:22.940]  I watched the Republican Guard bash baby's brains out?
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:24.701]  Okay, I don't remember that, but okay.
[02:25:24.701 --> 02:25:25.661]  And then it was all a PR firm.
[02:25:25.661 --> 02:25:26.142]  It was all fake.
[02:25:27.125 --> 02:25:30.486]  Remember the famous CNN footage where they're on top CNN Center Atlanta with a blue screen?
[02:25:30.486 --> 02:25:35.628]  They're going, the Scott Mezzles are blowing up, they're putting them, Jacko's putting the mask on, that was admitted to be fake.
[02:25:35.628 --> 02:25:40.969]  I'm not laughing, I just, no, I don't know.
[02:25:40.969 --> 02:25:43.550]  I don't watch InfoWars, but I mean, maybe I do.
[02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:46.571]  Listen, we're not Fox News with 100 people and as slick as you.
[02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:51.692]  But what I'm telling you is, we'll later take this, and we're going to put all the clips in.
[02:25:51.692 --> 02:25:53.353]  And then I'll send it to you and we'll see what you say.
[02:25:54.113 --> 02:25:54.834]  Here's the thing.
[02:25:54.834 --> 02:25:57.676]  I agree with you that... Just understand one thing.
[02:25:57.676 --> 02:25:59.177]  The whole area was on landfill.
[02:25:59.177 --> 02:26:10.087]  And so I had an argument with Jesse Ventura about Building 7, and he kept telling me, um, steel melts at 1,500 degrees, jet fuel only burns at 1,000 or 1,200 degrees.
[02:26:10.087 --> 02:26:11.068]  He couldn't have done it.
[02:26:11.068 --> 02:26:15.712]  And all those theories may be true, or those actual scientific numbers... But you're saying it weakens the steel.
[02:26:15.712 --> 02:26:16.232]  No.
[02:26:16.232 --> 02:26:16.673]  He did.
[02:26:17.475 --> 02:26:18.036]  He did.
[02:26:18.036 --> 02:26:24.466]  I'm telling you that the land underneath the Whole World Trade Center footprint was landfill.
[02:26:24.466 --> 02:26:28.091]  It was not... In fact, weren't they saying that the buildings were already unstable?
[02:26:29.104 --> 02:26:31.525]  They're all on landfill, Alex.
[02:26:31.525 --> 02:26:33.025]  The whole area is landfill.
[02:26:33.025 --> 02:26:35.146]  It's a swamp.
[02:26:35.146 --> 02:26:36.847]  I mean, that's what that whole delta is.
[02:26:36.847 --> 02:26:38.407]  It's just like Mississippi, Louisiana.
[02:26:38.407 --> 02:26:47.651]  I think the island of Manhattan is on bedrock, but there are areas of lower Manhattan that were built from their own cavity of their footprint, of the building's footprint.
[02:26:47.651 --> 02:26:50.172]  And they put buildings up around it on landfill.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:52.760]  Very less.
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:27:00.742]  I don't think you can apply the same science in a controlled experiment in Austin, Texas to a landfill, a building built on landfill.
[02:27:00.742 --> 02:27:08.564]  Well, I've not heard the theory, but I do know that lower Manhattan is like a delta kind of swamp area, like you're saying.
[02:27:08.564 --> 02:27:09.765]  There's a lot of swamps, yeah.
[02:27:09.765 --> 02:27:10.265]  That's one of them.
[02:27:11.992 --> 02:27:13.433]  Why did they build D.C.
[02:27:13.433 --> 02:27:14.834]  on a swamp?
[02:27:14.834 --> 02:27:15.915]  They didn't.
[02:27:15.915 --> 02:27:17.496]  They built the Capitol building on a swamp.
[02:27:17.496 --> 02:27:19.077]  On a literal swamp.
[02:27:19.077 --> 02:27:25.561]  You know, on the inside cover of my book, you can see the Capitol being built in 1860 ballpark and it's a swamp.
[02:27:25.561 --> 02:27:29.543]  And they never got around to draining it.
[02:27:29.543 --> 02:27:31.104]  Do you think Trump will be able to drain the swamp?
[02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:35.440]  Yes, he's well on his way.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.746]  Oh, if you say the sky is blue on my broadcast, they'll say it didn't happen.
[02:27:39.746 --> 02:27:41.448]  Listen, can I ask you a question?
[02:27:41.448 --> 02:27:42.249]  Yes.
[02:27:42.249 --> 02:27:45.353]  Let's talk about what you're doing here.
[02:27:45.353 --> 02:27:50.380]  Look, you have a beautiful operation, gorgeous studio, you've got a lot of fans, a lot of viewers, a lot of listeners.
[02:27:51.061 --> 02:27:54.502]  But some of the things you talk about, you get people riled up.
[02:27:54.502 --> 02:27:55.983]  You're riled up sometimes, right?
[02:27:55.983 --> 02:27:59.604]  Your blood pressure gets up, you're talking, and you're getting people riled up.
[02:27:59.604 --> 02:28:02.185]  Like when the New York Times lied about WMDs and a million Iraqis died?
[02:28:02.185 --> 02:28:03.005]  Sure, okay, whatever.
[02:28:03.005 --> 02:28:03.845]  I could kill a million people.
[02:28:03.845 --> 02:28:05.646]  Whatever the story is, you get fired up.
[02:28:06.266 --> 02:28:08.127]  That's your passion, I get it.
[02:28:08.127 --> 02:28:17.670]  But is your fire and your passion spread through this microphone, sent to people who may not be as, let's call it, in control as Alex?
[02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:20.531]  Eric, we gotta go to break, but this is a classic liberal talking point.
[02:28:20.531 --> 02:28:21.811]  I'm not liberal!
[02:28:21.811 --> 02:28:23.632]  I'm saying it's a talking point.
[02:28:23.632 --> 02:28:26.753]  Jones is going to cause violence, therefore he hasn't taken off the air.
[02:28:27.473 --> 02:28:39.200]  It's not a talking point, it's the reason that they went through this iteration Facebook, Twitter... No, they did it because I'm popular and was getting 20 million viewers and listeners a day and they panicked.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:40.882]  They did it because they panicked.
[02:28:40.882 --> 02:28:43.203]  You might actually get me to agree with you on something.
[02:28:43.203 --> 02:28:48.186]  I'm not the one firebombing Republican offices or trying to switch blade or shooting police.
[02:28:48.186 --> 02:28:48.907]  It's just not true.
[02:28:48.907 --> 02:28:49.387]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.455 --> 02:28:56.676]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.676 --> 02:29:00.597]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.597 --> 02:29:02.138]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.138 --> 02:29:05.100]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:10.642]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.642 --> 02:29:11.843]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.843 --> 02:29:14.784]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.784 --> 02:29:17.005]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.005 --> 02:29:21.447]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:21.447 --> 02:29:23.748]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:25.037 --> 02:29:25.938]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:29:25.938 --> 02:29:28.340]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:36.486]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:29:36.486 --> 02:29:38.428]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:32:59.726 --> 02:33:02.367]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:28.929]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.929 --> 02:33:33.636]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:52.097 --> 02:33:53.498]  All right, Eric Bolling is here.
[02:33:53.498 --> 02:33:56.920]  He's with CRTV and that great operation they're building.
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:01.363]  And I want to specifically talk about CRTV, because usually you're on other people's syndicated shows.
[02:34:01.363 --> 02:34:02.624]  They're just like, OK, here's your website.
[02:34:02.624 --> 02:34:03.465]  Let's talk about us.
[02:34:03.465 --> 02:34:04.225]  No.
[02:34:04.225 --> 02:34:07.047]  I want to see you guys eclipse Fox, because I think it's more pure.
[02:34:07.047 --> 02:34:08.608]  I think it's stronger.
[02:34:08.608 --> 02:34:10.209]  I personally have a subscription.
[02:34:10.209 --> 02:34:11.530]  I personally watch.
[02:34:11.530 --> 02:34:12.571]  My son does as well.
[02:34:13.371 --> 02:34:17.653]  Uh, and so we now just put up on the TV and it's HD and that's what we watch, because, believe me, we're sick of looking at me.
[02:34:17.653 --> 02:34:21.375]  Uh, so the grass is always greener, but tell us about CRTV and what you're doing.
[02:34:21.375 --> 02:34:26.737]  Well, it's a digital venue, so we're not beholden to advertisers, so we can kind of do what we want to do.
[02:34:26.737 --> 02:34:28.718]  I get to get out in the field.
[02:34:28.718 --> 02:34:30.279]  The show itself is amazing.
[02:34:31.039 --> 02:34:32.840]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in D.C.
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:39.202]  and I'll go to Kellyanne Conway's office or Mercedes Schlapp or go right into Jim Jordan's office and interview these guys.
[02:34:39.202 --> 02:34:40.823]  So our show is broken up into three parts.
[02:34:40.823 --> 02:34:42.804]  The top is hardcore right-wing politics.
[02:34:42.804 --> 02:34:45.105]  I'll admit it, I'm conservative and I'm proud of it.
[02:34:45.105 --> 02:34:46.225]  And so we do that up top.
[02:34:46.225 --> 02:34:49.206]  And in the middle, we do something that no one else in the world can do.
[02:34:49.206 --> 02:34:53.528]  We bring on left, center and right, doesn't matter, reporters from D.C.
[02:34:53.528 --> 02:34:55.029]  So I've had the Daily Beast on.
[02:34:55.029 --> 02:34:56.729]  I've had New York Times on.
[02:34:56.729 --> 02:34:58.250]  Oh, that's great to show what idiots they are!
[02:34:58.430 --> 02:35:00.512]  Well, here's what that middle part is.
[02:35:00.512 --> 02:35:01.752]  It's balls and strikes, Alex.
[02:35:01.752 --> 02:35:04.014]  It's not, I think you're wrong or you're an idiot.
[02:35:04.014 --> 02:35:04.434]  I've seen it, yeah.
[02:35:04.434 --> 02:35:06.936]  It's balls and strikes about what we're talking about.
[02:35:06.936 --> 02:35:08.097]  But they're still full of crap.
[02:35:08.097 --> 02:35:08.877]  Oh, fair enough.
[02:35:08.877 --> 02:35:11.759]  But then I get to say, hey, well, this is how our side sees it.
[02:35:11.759 --> 02:35:12.600]  What do you think?
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:20.165]  And then the last part, we go out, well, either in the bar where we were taping or now we're moving to a street location where we talk to people in the streets.
[02:35:20.165 --> 02:35:20.686]  It's phenomenal.
[02:35:21.346 --> 02:35:26.067]  It really is a good show and it makes me feel good to see it's there because let's get to the next subject you wanted to raise.
[02:35:26.067 --> 02:35:28.408]  They're trying to censor everybody.
[02:35:28.408 --> 02:35:29.248]  They got studies out.
[02:35:29.248 --> 02:35:32.269]  96% of news on Google is liberal.
[02:35:32.269 --> 02:35:34.009]  They push feed it on my phone.
[02:35:34.009 --> 02:35:35.389]  It's on my TV.
[02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:36.850]  I turn on YouTube on the elliptical.
[02:35:36.850 --> 02:35:38.650]  It's nothing but leftist crap.
[02:35:38.650 --> 02:35:39.730]  It's all being force fed.
[02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:43.451]  When they lost that election, it was already left-leaning in 2016.
[02:35:43.451 --> 02:35:46.032]  Now we have emails, we have internal documents.
[02:35:46.032 --> 02:35:48.913]  They are saying we will deliver it to the Democrats.
[02:35:48.913 --> 02:35:50.493]  I think it violates the Antitrust Act.
[02:35:51.173 --> 02:35:52.414]  Discriminations against conservatives.
[02:35:52.414 --> 02:35:54.756]  They say these are public commons.
[02:35:54.756 --> 02:35:55.797]  That's how they're under the law.
[02:35:55.797 --> 02:35:57.459]  They have liability protection.
[02:35:57.459 --> 02:35:59.360]  And then a lot of conservatives say, oh, they're a private company.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.322]  But that's not what's happening.
[02:36:01.322 --> 02:36:05.365]  They're basically like two people on a telephone call breaking in and saying, you can't say that.
[02:36:05.365 --> 02:36:07.067]  That's what's happening on Facebook.
[02:36:07.067 --> 02:36:08.548]  What do you think should be done about this?
[02:36:08.548 --> 02:36:12.691]  Well, here's if they're they're sliding down a very slippery slope.
[02:36:12.691 --> 02:36:15.073]  And I will tell you, as I disagree with so much
[02:36:15.834 --> 02:36:20.278]  What you say, I still think you have a right to say it.
[02:36:20.278 --> 02:36:24.422]  You keep saying that because you know they're going to demonize you for coming on the show.
[02:36:24.422 --> 02:36:25.683]  I disagree with you.
[02:36:25.683 --> 02:36:28.566]  During the break, you asked me to go marry you in Vegas.
[02:36:28.566 --> 02:36:30.187]  You said, let's run away to Vegas.
[02:36:30.187 --> 02:36:33.390]  I think you were asking for my hand in marriage, but I'm already married, thank God.
[02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:34.632]  I don't think so.
[02:36:51.873 --> 02:36:58.375]  As despicable as some of the things that people say, maybe you, maybe other people, you still have a right to say them.
[02:36:58.375 --> 02:37:04.496]  But the young turds aired that video where I got in that CNN reporter who admits he got us banned everywhere.
[02:37:04.496 --> 02:37:07.417]  All I say is you're like the Hitler Youth trying to ban me, trying to burn books.
[02:37:07.417 --> 02:37:09.618]  They said, oh, you called a reporter a Nazi.
[02:37:09.618 --> 02:37:10.858]  That's all the left does.
[02:37:10.858 --> 02:37:12.239]  Then they banned me off Twitter.
[02:37:12.239 --> 02:37:17.620]  Look, Jack Dorsey himself said that he was biased towards the left against the right, and he was going to fix it.
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:19.360]  Now I will take that one step further.
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.181]  Jack Dorsey is the founder of Twitter.
[02:37:21.661 --> 02:37:22.942]  You know what I found out yesterday, Alex?
[02:37:22.942 --> 02:37:28.124]  I was trying to tweet something yesterday and I was suspended from Twitter for 12 hours.
[02:37:28.124 --> 02:37:29.784]  What's happening to everybody?
[02:37:29.784 --> 02:37:32.546]  So here's how I was suspended.
[02:37:32.546 --> 02:37:37.908]  Someone said something to me on Twitter and he said, you know, my son passed away, as I pointed out a year ago.
[02:37:37.908 --> 02:37:42.690]  He says, I hope your mother joins your son soon.
[02:37:42.690 --> 02:37:43.010]  Jesus.
[02:37:44.013 --> 02:37:49.317]  And I tweeted, I retweeted his tweet and the email that he sent me.
[02:37:49.317 --> 02:37:50.698]  He sent it to me in an email.
[02:37:50.698 --> 02:37:51.899]  I tweeted his picture.
[02:37:51.899 --> 02:37:54.961]  Not his picture, his Twitter site and the email.
[02:37:54.961 --> 02:37:59.944]  And I violated Twitter's rules by posting the guy's email address.
[02:37:59.944 --> 02:38:00.545]  That's all it was.
[02:38:00.545 --> 02:38:03.467]  No picture, just his email address and his Twitter handle.
[02:38:03.467 --> 02:38:09.971]  You exposed a stalker who's hoping that you're now... My mother joins my deceased son.
[02:38:09.971 --> 02:38:11.412]  It was the most despicable thing.
[02:38:11.412 --> 02:38:12.853]  Now I'll take it one step further.
[02:38:12.853 --> 02:38:13.594]  He had a right to say that.
[02:38:15.014 --> 02:38:17.255]  He had a right to say what he said to me.
[02:38:17.255 --> 02:38:19.595]  And you had a right to say he's a piece of filth.
[02:38:19.595 --> 02:38:21.436]  Oh, I broke the rule!
[02:38:21.436 --> 02:38:23.796]  I know the rule is don't expose someone's email.
[02:38:23.796 --> 02:38:24.797]  I did it, I broke the rule.
[02:38:24.797 --> 02:38:26.437]  But why are they allowed to?
[02:38:26.437 --> 02:38:28.718]  I was suspended for 12 hours and you know what?
[02:38:28.718 --> 02:38:33.699]  We had a Newsday reporter yesterday or two days ago say that he wants to kill me with a pencil.
[02:38:33.699 --> 02:38:35.600]  He said, why didn't somebody kill him?
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:36.720]  I want to kill him with a pencil.
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:37.500]  Scroll down.
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:38.641]  Newsday.
[02:38:38.641 --> 02:38:41.501]  He literally is making jokes still about it and Twitter has done nothing.
[02:38:41.501 --> 02:38:43.102]  He's saying, kill me with a pencil.
[02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:46.202]  It's not joking about having a boxing match.
[02:38:46.202 --> 02:38:48.303]  He says, I want to kill him with a pencil.
[02:38:48.303 --> 02:38:50.325]  Well, OK.
[02:38:50.325 --> 02:38:52.106]  The kill part is a problem.
[02:38:52.106 --> 02:38:53.987]  He could have said, I want to destroy him with a pencil.
[02:38:53.987 --> 02:38:58.490]  I would have taken that to mean he was going to write stuff that expose your or his problems with you.
[02:38:58.490 --> 02:39:00.451]  But kill part, you're right.
[02:39:01.978 --> 02:39:03.679]  But the issue is, he's still there.
[02:39:03.679 --> 02:39:05.160]  The difference is violence.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:10.702]  If you're asking or inciting violence, you need to be... Sure, but you brought that up about me.
[02:39:10.702 --> 02:39:12.143]  I'm not ever bringing up violence.
[02:39:12.143 --> 02:39:20.926]  They have a Media Matters edited tape, where I'm talking about different subjects, and they edit it in two second clips, where it sounds like I'm saying violence.
[02:39:20.926 --> 02:39:26.789]  But everybody knows, if something's different clips and different suits, I'm wearing a blue jacket, a brown jacket, a black jacket.
[02:39:26.789 --> 02:39:29.170]  I mean, it's all edited together like word salad.
[02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:31.291]  Okay, fair enough.
[02:39:31.291 --> 02:39:35.574]  Selective editing is killing journalism and it's happening everywhere.
[02:39:35.574 --> 02:39:37.095]  So what should happen?
[02:39:37.095 --> 02:39:38.155]  Here's my point, though.
[02:39:38.155 --> 02:39:45.300]  Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google, Reddit, they all need to make a decision.
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:52.825]  Are you going to be a bulletin board site where you can say whatever you want and not be taken down for whatever you say, as awful as things may be?
[02:39:53.485 --> 02:39:56.568]  Or are you going to pick and choose what's offensive and what's not?
[02:39:56.568 --> 02:40:00.712]  If you're going to be picking and choosing what's offensive and what's not, you have to be consistent.
[02:40:00.712 --> 02:40:08.339]  They would need literally a million fact-checkers, a million editors to do that, and they're not going to be able to do that.
[02:40:08.339 --> 02:40:12.183]  So we talked about this during the break.
[02:40:12.183 --> 02:40:16.167]  They pick me out because I am flamboyant, I say stuff out of context, they can edit it.
[02:40:17.156 --> 02:40:23.220]  They picked me because they thought I was the perfect straw man, and now the purge is across the board.
[02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:30.724]  So, 55 days out from the election, the left is getting more and more violent, they're trying to undermine the president, trying to 25th Amendment him.
[02:40:30.724 --> 02:40:33.746]  What does he do against this election meddling?
[02:40:33.746 --> 02:40:36.808]  Forget the Russians, we have big tech!
[02:40:36.808 --> 02:40:40.590]  Absolutely gaming this election, not even letting Republican congressmen and women
[02:40:41.997 --> 02:40:45.019]  Tweet their people or reach out or post campaign videos.
[02:40:45.019 --> 02:40:46.020]  It's a problem.
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:53.446]  And when Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, admitted that they had a left-lean bias, that means there must have been massive left-lean bias.
[02:40:53.446 --> 02:40:56.468]  And I guess it's happening across the board on all of them.
[02:40:56.468 --> 02:41:09.758]  Yeah, I think the FCC needs to come in and make a decision on whether or not these groups, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, are going to be bulletin boards and therefore post whatever you want as offensive as it may be.
[02:41:09.758 --> 02:41:10.579]  As long as you're not going...
[02:41:11.039 --> 02:41:14.501]  As long as you're not inciting violence, you can say whatever you want.
[02:41:14.501 --> 02:41:15.462]  Be offensive.
[02:41:15.462 --> 02:41:18.584]  Westboro Baptist Church is the perfect example of this.
[02:41:18.584 --> 02:41:20.285]  Horrible, horrible people.
[02:41:20.285 --> 02:41:25.388]  They have a right to stand across from a military funeral and protest the war.
[02:41:25.388 --> 02:41:27.169]  Let me ask this question.
[02:41:27.169 --> 02:41:31.431]  Gut level, you think we win the midterms, the Republicans keep the House and Senate?
[02:41:31.431 --> 02:41:35.394]  Gut level, I think we win, the Republicans.
[02:41:35.394 --> 02:41:38.976]  And I think the best thing for Trump 2020 is if we lose the midterms.
[02:41:40.056 --> 02:41:43.500]  That's probably true, you're right, because that'll energize people.
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:43.520]  100%.
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.283]  If that happens.
[02:41:47.283 --> 02:41:47.804]  100%.
[02:41:47.804 --> 02:41:54.590]  Look, you get a House that's Democrat, especially if they impeach him, because that's the first thing they're going to do is impeach him.
[02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:58.334]  You know, you need the Senate to remove an impeached president from office.
[02:41:58.334 --> 02:42:04.720]  But if the House impeaches him, there will be a groundswell of support behind Donald Trump to make sure he's back in office.
[02:42:07.597 --> 02:42:10.460]  That goes back to the Civil War, but this is a realignment.
[02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:12.402]  How did that get back to the Civil War?
[02:42:12.402 --> 02:42:15.945]  I'm saying we haven't had a realignment like this since the Civil War.
[02:42:15.945 --> 02:42:19.128]  We had a realignment like that in 2010, in our direction.
[02:42:20.461 --> 02:42:22.743]  Yeah, no, we've had a political realignment, that's what I'm saying.
[02:42:22.743 --> 02:42:31.451]  But what I'm getting at here is that since the Civil War, always in the midterm, you know, the party that has the presidency loses the House, at least.
[02:42:31.451 --> 02:42:33.313]  I think it's a realignment, like we see around the world.
[02:42:33.313 --> 02:42:35.976]  People get how dangerous it is to let the left in.
[02:42:35.976 --> 02:42:39.659]  So I think we're going to win this, and we're going to win 2020.
[02:42:39.659 --> 02:42:42.242]  I think nothing but victory is in our path.
[02:42:42.242 --> 02:42:42.922]  Good, good.
[02:42:42.922 --> 02:42:43.403]  I hope you're right.
[02:42:44.890 --> 02:42:45.671]  Alright.
[02:42:45.671 --> 02:42:46.091]  Amen.
[02:42:46.091 --> 02:42:50.394]  We'll be right back with two more quick segments with Eric Bolling, straight ahead.
[02:42:50.394 --> 02:42:57.759]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and he's with CRTV and EricBolling.com.
[02:42:57.759 --> 02:42:58.820]  Travis in Florida.
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:42:59.821]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:42:59.821 --> 02:43:02.703]  You know, I'm really, the country's in deep trouble, but at least we're fighting back.
[02:43:02.703 --> 02:43:07.226]  I'm getting persecuted hard, but you know, it's good to be number two, under attack, under the president.
[02:43:07.226 --> 02:43:11.409]  I'm in good company, and so I, my bones feel good.
[02:43:11.409 --> 02:43:12.750]  I feel close to my ancestors.
[02:43:12.750 --> 02:43:14.331]  I feel like I'm delivering.
[02:43:14.471 --> 02:43:16.793]  You're definitely, you're definitely right there with us, the Patriots out there.
[02:43:16.793 --> 02:43:19.314]  I guess it is true, truth is treason and the empire of lies.
[02:43:19.314 --> 02:43:20.395]  I want to thank you personally.
[02:43:20.395 --> 02:43:21.796]  I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
[02:43:21.796 --> 02:43:24.338]  Anyone who knows, like a hypothyroidism condition.
[02:43:24.338 --> 02:43:26.599]  I currently, I mean the products, I can just name them all real quick.
[02:43:26.599 --> 02:43:33.424]  Brain Force, X2, Selenium, the Micro-CX vitamin, Mineral Fusion, Frosted Gar, the coffee, the Chaga Mushroom Blend, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Male.
[02:43:33.424 --> 02:43:35.545]  Let me tell you, it's given me my life back.
[02:43:35.545 --> 02:43:37.827]  Just taking the thyroid medicine alone is just not enough.
[02:43:37.827 --> 02:43:40.468]  Just having these products has made my life just back to normal.
[02:43:40.468 --> 02:43:41.449]  I'm working harder.
[02:43:41.449 --> 02:43:42.210]  I'm smarter.
[02:43:42.210 --> 02:43:43.971]  I feel like I'm just, it's unbelievable.
[02:43:43.971 --> 02:43:44.391]  Your products
[02:43:44.411 --> 02:43:44.993]  They're amazing.

[02:47:17.524 --> 02:47:21.568]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:47:21.568 --> 02:47:29.717]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.717 --> 02:47:38.306]  Alright, so we got Eric Bolling here, author of Wake Up America and the Swamp, and he's got his new TV show, America.
[02:47:39.147 --> 02:47:40.608]  You can't spell America without Eric.
[02:47:40.608 --> 02:47:41.468]  You know that, right?
[02:47:41.468 --> 02:47:42.009]  That's right.
[02:47:42.009 --> 02:47:43.029]  That's right.
[02:47:43.029 --> 02:47:44.931]  Well, my wife's name, Erica.
[02:47:44.931 --> 02:47:45.751]  There you go.
[02:47:45.751 --> 02:47:46.952]  Wow.
[02:47:46.952 --> 02:47:48.513]  Anyways, being serious though.
[02:47:50.163 --> 02:47:52.304]  I said, what do you want to cover in these last few segments?
[02:47:52.304 --> 02:47:54.464]  You said, I want to cover Homeland.
[02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:54.925]  Homeland.
[02:47:54.925 --> 02:47:56.125]  I've never watched Homeland.
[02:47:56.125 --> 02:47:59.986]  So, Alex, you were portrayed in Homeland last season.
[02:47:59.986 --> 02:48:00.867]  It was amazing.
[02:48:00.867 --> 02:48:02.467]  That character was awesome.
[02:48:02.467 --> 02:48:04.128]  It was this show.
[02:48:04.128 --> 02:48:07.509]  It was literally, it was you and this show and the actor was phenomenal.
[02:48:07.509 --> 02:48:09.910]  He did his best, Alex Jones.
[02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:11.190]  No, the last two seasons.
[02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:12.250]  I saw him say that.
[02:48:14.031 --> 02:48:15.252]  No, no, I saw the boil-downs.
[02:48:15.252 --> 02:48:16.272]  I thought you didn't see it.
[02:48:16.272 --> 02:48:18.934]  No, no, I saw the boil-downs.
[02:48:18.934 --> 02:48:21.996]  He's literally like, he does a fake show the next day.
[02:48:21.996 --> 02:48:22.916]  I'm throwing a flag.
[02:48:22.916 --> 02:48:25.037]  I'm here with the fake news.
[02:48:25.037 --> 02:48:26.318]  And I got like a hundred boys.
[02:48:26.318 --> 02:48:29.260]  Put up the lies!
[02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:30.160]  It's not me.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:31.121]  A great actor.
[02:48:31.121 --> 02:48:34.583]  I'm a KKK member named Alex Jones.
[02:48:34.583 --> 02:48:36.964]  We're fake news.
[02:48:36.964 --> 02:48:39.045]  That's a bunch of load of bull.
[02:48:39.045 --> 02:48:41.907]  Do you glean that from reading one article?
[02:48:42.859 --> 02:48:43.259]  I don't know.
[02:48:43.259 --> 02:48:45.782]  I saw a few of the clips where he's lying.
[02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:46.242]  There he is.
[02:48:46.242 --> 02:48:47.643]  He's like, I'm here to kill you.
[02:48:47.643 --> 02:48:48.724]  I don't think that was a lame plan.
[02:48:48.724 --> 02:48:50.386]  His president is female.
[02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.067]  I thought it was a wonderful character.
[02:48:52.067 --> 02:48:53.128]  Look, it's television.
[02:48:53.128 --> 02:48:55.290]  It's not supposed to be a documentary.
[02:48:55.290 --> 02:48:57.071]  It was supposed to be entertainment.
[02:48:57.071 --> 02:48:57.892]  It was very entertaining.
[02:48:57.892 --> 02:49:03.277]  Okay, it wasn't exactly Infowars and Alex Jones, but they had the same type of feel to it.
[02:49:04.398 --> 02:49:07.482]  You know what happens to him later in the show, right?
[02:49:07.482 --> 02:49:07.783]  No.
[02:49:07.783 --> 02:49:14.492]  He goes out into the countryside hiding, broadcasting from basements and back rooms, and the FBI is searching him.
[02:49:14.492 --> 02:49:17.176]  It takes them like at least five episodes to find him.
[02:49:17.176 --> 02:49:18.257]  It's phenomenal.
[02:49:18.257 --> 02:49:19.860]  And so the idea is I end up in jail.
[02:49:22.476 --> 02:49:23.197]  Yeah.
[02:49:23.197 --> 02:49:29.906]  So why do you think they had the opposition on Comedy Central about me, this show, which I literally never watch any of.
[02:49:29.906 --> 02:49:31.608]  I watch little clips of them.
[02:49:31.608 --> 02:49:33.490]  Because it's nauseating.
[02:49:33.490 --> 02:49:34.792]  Why are they doing this to me?
[02:49:34.792 --> 02:49:36.094]  Why have I been chosen for this?
[02:49:37.125 --> 02:49:39.467]  Well, I think you scare them, for one.
[02:49:39.467 --> 02:49:53.298]  I think that you clearly have influence, you have an audience, and I think that they're concerned that your audience that you're speaking to, and I'll tell you this, I've heard this a hundred times, they think your audience is what's defined as the alt-right.
[02:49:53.298 --> 02:49:55.160]  And they're very concerned about the alt-right.
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.382]  Is the alt-right, are they violent?
[02:49:57.382 --> 02:50:03.287]  Are they willing to use methods that were, you know... But I'm not the alt-right!
[02:50:03.287 --> 02:50:05.048]  More than... The alt-right hates me!
[02:50:05.048 --> 02:50:05.929]  The alt-right hates me!
[02:50:07.694 --> 02:50:09.435]  Are you sure?
[02:50:09.435 --> 02:50:13.199]  The alt-right is a term Hillary created three months out from the election.
[02:50:13.199 --> 02:50:14.340]  Who are the alt-right?
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:18.163]  They're basically Nazi-like.
[02:50:18.163 --> 02:50:22.186]  I'm Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:50:22.186 --> 02:50:27.110]  I mean, I went and interviewed Louis Farrakhan and asked him to call for peace and to stop racial division.
[02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:29.933]  Louis Farrakhan, why is he still on Twitter, if you're not?
[02:50:30.882 --> 02:50:31.683]  That's my point.
[02:50:31.683 --> 02:50:34.545]  I don't think Louis Farrakhan should be taken off Twitter.
[02:50:34.545 --> 02:50:41.051]  But then I ask, in what world is ISIS, Al Qaeda, Louis Farrakhan, and NAMBLA still on Twitter?
[02:50:41.051 --> 02:50:44.114]  I think they all should be on Twitter, and I think, honestly, I think you should.
[02:50:44.114 --> 02:50:49.098]  Although I disagree with so far everything you've said.
[02:50:49.098 --> 02:50:51.180]  With the exception of Trump's going to win 2020.
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:52.881]  Eric, the sky's blue.
[02:50:52.881 --> 02:50:53.882]  I'll agree with that.
[02:50:53.882 --> 02:50:55.724]  Your jacket is navy blue.
[02:50:55.724 --> 02:50:56.224]  I'll agree with that.
[02:50:56.224 --> 02:50:57.465]  You're wearing an American flag.
[02:50:57.465 --> 02:50:57.846]  That's true.
[02:50:59.049 --> 02:51:01.851]  Uh, EU army to increase rank seven-fold.
[02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:02.792]  True.
[02:51:02.792 --> 02:51:05.574]  Um, on the... Well, no, that's the announcement.
[02:51:05.574 --> 02:51:09.717]  Alphabet plan to beam internet to Earth from balloons just past Big Milestone.
[02:51:09.717 --> 02:51:11.119]  That's CNBC.
[02:51:11.119 --> 02:51:12.239]  Well, it's written there.
[02:51:12.239 --> 02:51:13.280]  I'm not saying I agree with that.
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:15.402]  Eric Boulding says, wake up America, but... True.
[02:51:15.402 --> 02:51:16.923]  Okay.
[02:51:16.923 --> 02:51:20.105]  Uh, we agree on so many things.
[02:51:20.105 --> 02:51:21.667]  Eric Boulding's wearing a toupee.
[02:51:21.667 --> 02:51:22.307]  Not true.
[02:51:22.307 --> 02:51:22.747]  I'm joking.
[02:51:22.747 --> 02:51:23.248]  You can touch it.
[02:51:23.248 --> 02:51:25.129]  No, you're into your... you have good-looking hair.
[02:51:25.129 --> 02:51:25.449]  It's true.
[02:51:25.449 --> 02:51:25.930]  I saw your tweet.
[02:51:25.930 --> 02:51:26.911]  I got that hair on TV.
[02:51:26.911 --> 02:51:27.811]  Hey, this is my hair, too.
[02:51:27.811 --> 02:51:28.432]  It's almost gone.
[02:51:29.414 --> 02:51:30.315]  Look at that huge forehead.
[02:51:30.315 --> 02:51:30.595]  Look at that.
[02:51:30.595 --> 02:51:32.956]  It's like the aliens, like, the Martians have invaded.
[02:51:32.956 --> 02:51:34.717]  They're like, your planet will serve us well.
[02:51:34.717 --> 02:51:35.838]  It's like, I'm here.
[02:51:35.838 --> 02:51:36.378]  Have you seen?
[02:51:36.378 --> 02:51:39.240]  Like, there you go.
[02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:40.641]  Um, is there extraterrestrial life?
[02:51:40.641 --> 02:51:41.622]  Yeah, it's good hair.
[02:51:41.622 --> 02:51:42.602]  It's real too.
[02:51:42.602 --> 02:51:43.303]  You can close up on it.
[02:51:43.303 --> 02:51:44.404]  Let's just zoom in right on that.
[02:51:44.404 --> 02:51:44.964]  It's real.
[02:51:44.964 --> 02:51:48.526]  I don't want to, who's that late night host that like touched Trump's hair and then he got in trouble, right?
[02:51:48.526 --> 02:51:49.727]  Yeah, it was, it was Kimmel.
[02:51:49.727 --> 02:51:50.508]  Maybe, I don't know.
[02:51:50.508 --> 02:51:52.189]  No, uh, Fallon.
[02:51:52.189 --> 02:51:52.889]  Jimmy Fallon.
[02:51:52.889 --> 02:51:53.309]  Jimmy Fallon.
[02:51:53.309 --> 02:51:55.411]  I don't gotta do it.
[02:51:55.411 --> 02:51:58.673]  Let's bring, let's bring the lovely Savannah in to check
[02:51:59.778 --> 02:52:00.299]  He's gone?
[02:52:00.299 --> 02:52:01.640]  She went home for the day.
[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:02.921]  She ran away?
[02:52:02.921 --> 02:52:05.524]  This is so compelling, this interview.
[02:52:05.524 --> 02:52:05.944]  No, we are.
[02:52:05.944 --> 02:52:07.505]  We have to have a female check his hair.
[02:52:07.505 --> 02:52:08.106]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:52:08.106 --> 02:52:11.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is... Oh, there you go.
[02:52:11.089 --> 02:52:12.390]  There you go.
[02:52:12.390 --> 02:52:13.952]  Have you caressed Trump's head?
[02:52:13.952 --> 02:52:14.392]  No.
[02:52:14.392 --> 02:52:15.353]  He's a good friend of mine, no.
[02:52:15.353 --> 02:52:16.594]  I would not caress his hair.
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:18.801]  And it's real.
[02:52:18.801 --> 02:52:20.442]  It's just, you know, it's ridiculous.
[02:52:20.442 --> 02:52:21.983]  Hey, so let's get serious.
[02:52:21.983 --> 02:52:23.304]  What type of guy is Trump?
[02:52:23.304 --> 02:52:31.950]  I mean, look how he's demonized and lied about, and then the economy's going to be 4.8% projected, and we're now the biggest oil exporter in the world.
[02:52:31.950 --> 02:52:40.977]  I mean, how can we, less than two years in, not be thanking our lucky stars, like Trump is a giant leprechaun that craps buckets of gold?
[02:52:41.457 --> 02:52:43.559]  Well, he is doing very well in the economy.
[02:52:43.559 --> 02:52:44.619]  He's doing well in security.
[02:52:44.619 --> 02:52:45.820]  When was the last time we heard him say that?
[02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:46.181]  But just say it.
[02:52:46.181 --> 02:52:51.504]  He's a giant leprechaun the size of King Kong that sprays fountains of gold out of his ass.
[02:52:51.504 --> 02:52:52.845]  Well, that's your assessment of him.
[02:52:52.845 --> 02:52:55.828]  I think he's a brilliant businessman who brought that to Washington, D.C.
[02:52:57.125 --> 02:52:59.826]  And did exactly what I thought he was going to do in 2015.
[02:52:59.826 --> 02:53:03.067]  But if he was a leprechaun, how tall would he be?
[02:53:03.067 --> 02:53:21.332]  When I was excoriated for being pro-Trump, which was not easy being pro-Trump from the very beginning until now, and being loyal to Donald Trump has been very good to me too because now he calls me, now he has me in the Oval Office regularly, now I'm very close with all the senior advisors, and they come on my show!
[02:53:21.332 --> 02:53:23.353]  So it's a wonderful symbiotic relationship.
[02:53:23.413 --> 02:53:24.053]  And that's awesome.
[02:53:24.053 --> 02:53:26.274]  I barely talk to Trump and they act like I'm his brain.
[02:53:26.274 --> 02:53:26.895]  It's not true.
[02:53:26.895 --> 02:53:30.256]  He was way more patriot before I was even born.
[02:53:30.256 --> 02:53:31.917]  But speaking of that, what drives Trump?
[02:53:31.917 --> 02:53:33.058]  Does he act like he's just addled?
[02:53:33.058 --> 02:53:34.218]  Success.
[02:53:34.218 --> 02:53:37.280]  He is driven with success.
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:39.361]  There's no quit in that guy at all.
[02:53:39.361 --> 02:53:41.362]  Even when he does things and everyone goes, what did he just do?
[02:53:41.362 --> 02:53:43.102]  He literally works... Well, you know him well.
[02:53:43.102 --> 02:53:44.823]  Describe the essence of Trump.
[02:53:44.823 --> 02:53:46.344]  Victory for America.
[02:53:46.344 --> 02:53:50.146]  Well, yeah, but also, let's be honest, victory for Trump because he's going to get the credit for it.
[02:53:51.391 --> 02:53:52.812]  People say, oh is he real?
[02:53:52.812 --> 02:53:54.754]  If he doesn't do this, his name is mud.
[02:53:54.754 --> 02:53:58.317]  If he does it, he's bigger than George Washington.
[02:53:58.317 --> 02:54:01.819]  He'll be on the money 500 years from now on Mars.
[02:54:01.819 --> 02:54:06.343]  So there are things I disagree with Donald Trump on, but he's unwavering in that.
[02:54:06.343 --> 02:54:08.304]  I disagree with some of the things he did.
[02:54:08.304 --> 02:54:13.648]  I walked into his office about three months ago, and it was the day that CNN leaked the infrastructure plan.
[02:54:13.648 --> 02:54:17.151]  I printed it out, I read it, and I walked into his Oval and I said, Mr. President,
[02:54:17.891 --> 02:54:18.932]  Uh, the infrastructure plan.
[02:54:18.932 --> 02:54:19.852]  He said, yeah, it's great, right?
[02:54:19.852 --> 02:54:24.975]  I said, no, no, there are two things in here that is blaringly missing.
[02:54:24.975 --> 02:54:31.318]  Number one, where does it say that 90% of the raw materials in a trillion dollar plan are produced in the United States?
[02:54:31.318 --> 02:54:32.279]  He said, well, isn't it in there?
[02:54:32.279 --> 02:54:33.499]  I said, no, it's not in there.
[02:54:33.499 --> 02:54:34.620]  He said, we got to get it in there.
[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:43.465]  And I said, what about, what about allowing local businesses to make the first bids on, let's say you're going to build a school or a wing in a hospital in St.
[02:54:43.465 --> 02:54:43.685]  Louis?
[02:54:43.945 --> 02:54:44.485]  Let the St.
[02:54:44.485 --> 02:54:47.808]  Louis community come up with a business that builds that wing.
[02:54:47.808 --> 02:54:49.049]  Don't pay more for them.
[02:54:49.049 --> 02:54:51.090]  Let them compete with the national brand.
[02:54:51.090 --> 02:54:52.891]  And if they do, they get the job.
[02:54:52.891 --> 02:54:54.252]  He's going to get so many votes.
[02:54:54.252 --> 02:54:56.754]  And she says, you know what, Boeing will get those two things in there.
[02:54:56.754 --> 02:54:57.514]  And guess what?
[02:54:57.514 --> 02:54:59.336]  Here we are three months later, those two things are in.
[02:54:59.336 --> 02:55:00.917]  And that's why he's so scared.
[02:55:00.917 --> 02:55:02.658]  They say, oh, he's rash.
[02:55:02.658 --> 02:55:04.299]  No, he gets good ideas.
[02:55:04.299 --> 02:55:05.300]  The bureaucracy's gone.
[02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:06.400]  He gets it in.
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.121]  He listens to the corporate guys that care.
[02:55:08.121 --> 02:55:08.622]  Exactly.
[02:55:09.042 --> 02:55:11.506]  I mean, literally, you told him stuff that made sense.
[02:55:11.506 --> 02:55:13.148]  He's like, yeah, that makes great sense.
[02:55:13.148 --> 02:55:16.453]  Make sure the materials are from America.
[02:55:16.453 --> 02:55:21.280]  What is it like, then, to talk to him and then see it manifest and save the country?
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:22.101]  It's amazing.
[02:55:22.101 --> 02:55:25.025]  And it's amazing to have that access.
[02:55:25.586 --> 02:55:27.028]  To the most powerful man in the world.
[02:55:27.028 --> 02:55:38.700]  And look, so all these people that when they're afraid of him and they're worried he's going to get too big and this whole new Trump form of conservatism is growing in Washington, D.C., they all push back.
[02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:40.742]  They all start to say he's losing his facilities.
[02:55:40.742 --> 02:55:41.563]  He's losing his mind.
[02:55:41.883 --> 02:55:43.444]  The man is sharp as a tack.
[02:55:43.444 --> 02:55:46.065]  I was about to say, Trump's called me like at 10 o'clock at night.
[02:55:46.065 --> 02:55:46.805]  I'm like tired.
[02:55:46.805 --> 02:55:51.227]  He's like smooth, like he's a voice actor that never made a mistake.
[02:55:51.227 --> 02:55:56.409]  And it's like also, I'm like, I said a five minute conversation and he didn't mumble one time.
[02:55:56.409 --> 02:55:58.730]  I'm like, this is a senile person?
[02:55:59.810 --> 02:56:09.097]  Well, listen, the last time they thought he was losing his mind, about a week later, he brought a bicameral, bipartisan group to the White House, and it was members on immigration.
[02:56:09.097 --> 02:56:11.539]  He brought senators and congressmen from both sides of the aisle.
[02:56:11.539 --> 02:56:12.699]  Lindsey Graham was there.
[02:56:12.699 --> 02:56:19.804]  They were all represented, and he moderated an intellectual immigration debate with, like, a pro.
[02:56:19.804 --> 02:56:22.627]  And they were saying he was done, he was losing his mind.
[02:56:22.627 --> 02:56:25.869]  He, look, he plays, let's be honest, he plays with them sometimes still.
[02:56:26.089 --> 02:56:28.892]  Well he also goes, Kofifi, tell me what you want.
[02:56:28.892 --> 02:56:32.296]  I won't say it's going to happen, but they go, we want total open borders!
[02:56:32.296 --> 02:56:32.977]  End of America!
[02:56:32.977 --> 02:56:33.617]  And people go, whoa!
[02:56:34.673 --> 02:56:36.014]  Trump just tried to... No!
[02:56:36.014 --> 02:56:37.815]  He got them to say what they really wanted!
[02:56:37.815 --> 02:56:38.495]  Yeah.
[02:56:38.495 --> 02:56:39.395]  Well, listen.
[02:56:39.395 --> 02:56:40.296]  He plays with their minds.
[02:56:40.296 --> 02:56:46.139]  You know, Kofifi was one great example where all of a sudden at four in the morning he tweets Kofifi.
[02:56:46.139 --> 02:56:47.920]  And no one knows what's going on.
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:50.521]  And that just rattles their... You know what, Alex?
[02:56:50.521 --> 02:56:59.486]  It rattles their cages the way you rattle the left's cages in Twitter, Facebook, and... Hey, do 15 minutes more with us with the arch-criminal Roger Stone.
[02:57:00.336 --> 02:57:01.017]  He's coming up, okay?
[02:57:01.017 --> 02:57:02.478]  I was just telling him I said hello.
[02:57:02.478 --> 02:57:03.659]  I haven't seen him since the campaign.
[02:57:03.659 --> 02:57:04.700]  You're not too tired, right?
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:05.541]  Can you do 50 more minutes?
[02:57:05.541 --> 02:57:06.042]  Yeah.
[02:57:06.042 --> 02:57:06.462]  You sure?
[02:57:06.462 --> 02:57:07.443]  You didn't nap?
[02:57:07.443 --> 02:57:08.204]  Nope.
[02:57:08.204 --> 02:57:09.625]  Nap!
[02:57:09.625 --> 02:57:10.626]  Dude, I don't sleep much.
[02:57:10.626 --> 02:57:11.367]  I'm joking.
[02:57:11.367 --> 02:57:11.787]  Alright.
[02:57:11.787 --> 02:57:12.788]  Now, you're a pretty muscular guy.
[02:57:12.788 --> 02:57:14.650]  I'm a little bit afraid over here.
[02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:15.872]  Parking Lex.
[02:57:15.872 --> 02:57:17.753]  That's right.
[02:57:17.753 --> 02:57:19.375]  Wait, we'll do the Twitter video.
[02:57:19.375 --> 02:57:20.636]  You want to trade punches?
[02:57:20.636 --> 02:57:21.037]  Which video?
[02:57:21.971 --> 02:57:23.832]  We'll do a Twitter video with Trey Pudgett.
[02:57:23.832 --> 02:57:25.494]  I bet you'll break my arm.
[02:57:25.494 --> 02:57:26.114]  You want to do it?
[02:57:26.114 --> 02:57:26.855]  You're a hot shot.
[02:57:26.855 --> 02:57:28.056]  Pretty tough guy over there.
[02:57:28.056 --> 02:57:29.757]  I'm telling you, he's in good shape.
[02:57:29.757 --> 02:57:32.259]  Hey, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:57:32.259 --> 02:57:33.680]  I didn't plug this hour.
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:35.381]  X2, the Deep Earth Halogen.
[02:57:35.381 --> 02:57:36.362]  We can't get it anymore.
[02:57:36.362 --> 02:57:37.543]  It's selling out.
[02:57:37.543 --> 02:57:39.664]  InfoWarsStore.com, 25% off.
[02:57:39.664 --> 02:57:40.645]  Get some t-shirts as well.
[02:57:40.645 --> 02:57:41.626]  Soros hates it.
[02:57:41.626 --> 02:57:43.707]  InfoWarsStore.com, hour number four.
[02:57:43.707 --> 02:57:44.228]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:45.310 --> 02:57:47.650]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:47.650 --> 02:57:49.811]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:57:49.811 --> 02:57:53.731]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:57:53.731 --> 02:58:05.233]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:58:05.233 --> 02:58:14.335]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:58:14.835 --> 02:58:20.622]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:58:20.622 --> 02:58:26.069]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:58:26.069 --> 02:58:28.332]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:58:28.332 --> 02:58:30.354]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:58:31.195 --> 02:58:35.676]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:58:35.676 --> 02:58:35.836]  It's you!
[02:58:55.307 --> 02:58:57.790]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:58:57.790 --> 02:58:59.192]  You are the InfoWard.
[02:58:59.192 --> 02:59:02.095]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.451 --> 02:59:27.836]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:27.836 --> 02:59:35.820]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:42.864]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.864 --> 02:59:45.605]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[02:59:49.174 --> 02:59:51.768]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.413 --> 03:00:08.076]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:08.076 --> 03:00:13.743]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:13.743 --> 03:00:18.509]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head.
[03:00:18.509 --> 03:00:21.933]  Wrapped up in silence, lost, stuck as the dead.
[03:00:22.353 --> 03:00:26.897]  Alright, we got one more segment left with Eric Bolling, formerly of Fox News, now CRTV.
[03:00:26.897 --> 03:00:28.338]  Very exciting things they're doing there.
[03:00:28.338 --> 03:00:30.240]  It's just their own platform, their own system.
[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:33.763]  But now I've got the censors going after my payment processors.
[03:00:33.763 --> 03:00:35.185]  They already took the sponsors.
[03:00:35.185 --> 03:00:36.205]  People go, oh you have sponsors.
[03:00:36.205 --> 03:00:39.228]  No, those are local radio stations and TV stations and great support them.
[03:00:39.228 --> 03:00:42.371]  No, we air ads as basically filler.
[03:00:42.371 --> 03:00:44.293]  90% of our funding is you buying products at SimForwards.com.
[03:00:45.399 --> 03:00:56.646]  But just other key points about where you think America is, the political realignment, your good friendship with Trump, the fact that he really does want success, he really does want to bring the country back, and he's done it.
[03:00:56.646 --> 03:00:59.008]  How is the left going to deal with a 4.8% growth rate?
[03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:05.311]  I know somebody that was in a meeting with Kudlow, and they were talking about how Trump has a goal.
[03:01:05.311 --> 03:01:07.512]  They say, sir, you can't do it, maybe 6%.
[03:01:07.512 --> 03:01:15.056]  He wants, by six months from the next election in 2019, he wants a 10% growth rate.
[03:01:15.056 --> 03:01:17.697]  And his argument, I've heard, is China's had one for decades.
[03:01:17.697 --> 03:01:18.057]  Why can't we?
[03:01:18.257 --> 03:01:26.762]  Well, we probably can't get there, but I'll tell you what we don't have is a 1.5% growth rate that we had under Obama, who said that was going to be the new norm for America.
[03:01:26.762 --> 03:01:27.863]  He was way wrong.
[03:01:27.863 --> 03:01:30.984]  Don't forget, Trump said we would get to 4% during the election.
[03:01:33.866 --> 03:01:35.967]  He was 100% right.
[03:01:35.967 --> 03:01:38.449]  No one said he could do it.
[03:01:38.449 --> 03:01:41.070]  There's a number that's floating around here.
[03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:48.655]  I will tell you, never in my lifetime have I seen growth rate exceed unemployment rate by this wide of a margin.
[03:01:48.655 --> 03:01:49.395]  It's just insane.
[03:01:49.395 --> 03:01:50.676]  When you're 3.9% unemployment and 4.2% growth, that is perfect
[03:01:55.359 --> 03:01:56.400]  Perfection in the economy.
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:59.624]  It's fully employed and a robust growing economy.
[03:01:59.624 --> 03:02:03.568]  The guy's doing everything right on the economy and on security.
[03:02:03.568 --> 03:02:04.529]  Is he rough?
[03:02:04.529 --> 03:02:05.330]  Is he vulgar?
[03:02:05.330 --> 03:02:06.291]  Is he rough around the edges?
[03:02:06.291 --> 03:02:08.253]  Is he a bulldozer, not a scalpel?
[03:02:08.253 --> 03:02:09.154]  True, yes.
[03:02:09.154 --> 03:02:10.695]  But I'll take the other two.
[03:02:10.695 --> 03:02:12.477]  Well, he ain't a wrecking ball to get rid of the globalists.
[03:02:12.477 --> 03:02:15.460]  But if you look at all those graphs that his chief economic advisor put out two days ago,
[03:02:16.301 --> 03:02:21.388]  He gets elected and they all go straight up, showing that we were artificially being suppressed.
[03:02:21.388 --> 03:02:25.953]  I mean, the Federal Reserve printed five and a half trillion dollars for Obama, nothing for Trump.
[03:02:25.953 --> 03:02:27.235]  They kept interest rates at zero.
[03:02:27.235 --> 03:02:28.997]  They raised them six times on him.
[03:02:28.997 --> 03:02:31.160]  They're clearly working against us and still we're winning.
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:33.962]  Well, what he's done, and he did it day one.
[03:02:33.962 --> 03:02:38.225]  The day he was elected, Bannon and Trump got in a room, and it was a Sunday.
[03:02:38.225 --> 03:02:41.487]  He was sworn in on whatever, Friday or Saturday.
[03:02:41.487 --> 03:02:42.348]  Friday, right?
[03:02:42.348 --> 03:02:45.590]  On a Saturday, he went into the office and started rolling back regulations.
[03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:46.310]  Day one.
[03:02:46.310 --> 03:02:46.951]  Crossed that out.
[03:02:46.951 --> 03:02:47.912]  Nope, we're not doing that anymore.
[03:02:47.912 --> 03:02:49.052]  We're not doing that anymore.
[03:02:49.052 --> 03:02:51.514]  He opened up the business environment in America.
[03:02:51.514 --> 03:02:56.918]  He saw that as the reason that we've been held back under Obama from growing.
[03:02:57.378 --> 03:02:58.099]  And it was work.
[03:02:58.099 --> 03:03:05.945]  So what would happen if the control left and people like Pelosi and other whack jobs like Maxine Waters got their way and removed him?
[03:03:05.945 --> 03:03:07.667]  Trump said yesterday it would cause a depression.
[03:03:07.667 --> 03:03:08.287]  I believe it would.
[03:03:08.287 --> 03:03:08.888]  Removed him how?
[03:03:09.907 --> 03:03:10.387]  Impeachment?
[03:03:10.387 --> 03:03:10.627]  I can't.
[03:03:10.627 --> 03:03:15.650]  The point is, if they got what they wanted, how would they get away with it?
[03:03:15.650 --> 03:03:18.672]  Even if they win the House, they can impeach him, but it's a technical term.
[03:03:18.672 --> 03:03:19.612]  It gets sent to the Senate.
[03:03:19.612 --> 03:03:20.913]  You get 66 votes.
[03:03:20.913 --> 03:03:23.874]  You're not getting 66 votes in the Senate, no matter what.
[03:03:23.874 --> 03:03:26.315]  He's not being impeached.
[03:03:26.315 --> 03:03:26.916]  No, I agree.
[03:03:26.916 --> 03:03:34.760]  In closing, with Trump derangement syndrome rancheting up, and firebombings of Republicans, and switchblade attacks, where is their limit?
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:36.601]  When is peak derangement syndrome?
[03:03:36.601 --> 03:03:37.241]  No, no, no.
[03:03:37.241 --> 03:03:38.082]  You tell me.
[03:03:38.082 --> 03:03:38.602]  What's QAnon?
[03:03:40.293 --> 03:03:46.455]  It's this weird-ass thing that Mueller's good, and that everybody else is evil, and it's just a delude.
[03:03:46.455 --> 03:03:48.855]  Go down the rabbit hole, follow what you're told.
[03:03:48.855 --> 03:03:49.536]  It's like a cult.
[03:03:49.536 --> 03:03:51.016]  It's like a fortune cookie.
[03:03:51.016 --> 03:04:01.379]  Yeah, but the QAnon theory is that there's someone with Q-level clearance inside the White House, which is top clearance, and he's feeding, or he or she is feeding this information.
[03:04:01.379 --> 03:04:03.760]  And then 4chan's our god.
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:05.200]  He goes through 4chan.
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.041]  And the king of the trolls.
[03:04:07.041 --> 03:04:07.981]  And Mueller's going to save us.
[03:04:08.661 --> 03:04:10.942]  That in itself is a conspiracy theory, is it not?
[03:04:10.942 --> 03:04:12.242]  Are they real?
[03:04:12.242 --> 03:04:17.344]  No, I mean, I'm telling you as the King of Conspiracy that QAnon is a load of horse manure.
[03:04:17.344 --> 03:04:19.244]  I'm glad I heard that from you.
[03:04:19.244 --> 03:04:22.345]  Yes, and I think Muslim terrorists attacked us and have been attacking us.
[03:04:22.345 --> 03:04:24.326]  And I agree with you on that.
[03:04:24.326 --> 03:04:26.987]  And I think Sandy Hook had them.
[03:04:26.987 --> 03:04:28.527]  And I totally agree with that as well.
[03:04:28.527 --> 03:04:31.388]  And so people ask you, Jones keeps saying they didn't have it!
[03:04:31.388 --> 03:04:33.829]  I've been saying it happened for years, I only entertain debates.
[03:04:35.685 --> 03:04:37.727]  I do not agree with you on that one.
[03:04:37.727 --> 03:04:39.949]  But I'm telling you.
[03:04:39.949 --> 03:04:42.651]  Alex Jones, you said it didn't happen.
[03:04:42.651 --> 03:04:46.154]  You said 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:04:46.154 --> 03:04:47.075]  I still stand behind 9-11.
[03:04:47.075 --> 03:04:48.757]  But you know what's good?
[03:04:48.757 --> 03:04:52.980]  You're smart enough to learn and have enlightening experience.
[03:04:52.980 --> 03:04:53.561]  We're going to talk more.
[03:04:53.561 --> 03:04:54.281]  We're going to talk more coming up.
[03:04:55.462 --> 03:04:56.903]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:04:56.903 --> 03:05:10.167]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:05:10.167 --> 03:05:19.750]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten.
[03:05:20.130 --> 03:05:21.211]  News Feeds.
[03:05:21.211 --> 03:05:24.213]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:26.075]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[03:05:26.075 --> 03:05:27.136]  Just click on the link.
[03:05:27.136 --> 03:05:30.779]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:05:30.779 --> 03:05:40.226]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:05:40.226 --> 03:05:44.049]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:05:44.529 --> 03:05:47.231]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:05:47.231 --> 03:05:52.335]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:05:52.335 --> 03:05:56.319]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:05:56.319 --> 03:06:05.206]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:40.663 --> 03:06:41.383]  Racism is evil.
[03:06:58.729 --> 03:07:14.218]  And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
[03:07:14.958 --> 03:07:21.463]  We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.
[03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:24.586]  We are equal in the eyes of our Creator.
[03:07:24.586 --> 03:07:27.148]  We are equal under the law.
[03:07:27.148 --> 03:07:31.011]  And we are equal under our Constitution.
[03:07:31.011 --> 03:07:33.373]  How many times do I have to reject?
[03:07:33.373 --> 03:07:34.794]  I've rejected David Duke.
[03:07:34.794 --> 03:07:35.835]  Rejected David Duke.
[03:07:36.696 --> 03:07:40.720]  I've rejected the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:43.363]  From the time I'm five years old, I rejected them.
[03:07:43.363 --> 03:07:48.088]  When I put out that I reject the KKK and David Duke, nobody picks it up.
[03:07:48.088 --> 03:07:48.909]  You know why they're not?
[03:07:48.909 --> 03:07:49.910]  Because they don't want to pick it up.
[03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:55.717]  They pick it up, you pick it up, everyone else picks it up, you so... Simultaneously, practically at the same time.
[03:07:55.717 --> 03:07:56.618]  They don't want to pick it up.
[03:07:56.758 --> 03:08:02.740]  Gateway Pundit journalist Cassandra Fairbanks posted this inviting message on her Twitter.
[03:08:02.740 --> 03:08:05.781]  It simply read, who is going to the MAGA meetup tonight?
[03:08:05.781 --> 03:08:12.323]  A response from Dreamstar Justice that, according to Daily Mail, supports the Democratic Socialists
[03:08:12.603 --> 03:08:19.608]  responded by saying, I am coming with a gun and I expect to get numerous blood-stained MAGA hats as trophies.
[03:08:19.608 --> 03:08:30.815]  DC police vehicles were spotted outside of the hotel where the event was to take place, and a manager confirmed that staff were aware of the threat and taking appropriate security measures.
[03:08:30.815 --> 03:08:41.763]  Meanwhile, the Daily Caller reports, California man Farzad Fazeli was arrested Tuesday for allegedly trying to stab a congressional candidate at a fair on Sunday, police said.
[03:08:42.083 --> 03:08:49.990]  Local media identified the candidate as Republican Rudy Peters who is challenging Democratic Representative Eric Smallwell in November.
[03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:56.896]  Peters survived serious injury thanks to a malfunctioning switchblade, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said.
[03:08:57.116 --> 03:09:06.164]  The attempted stabbing was preceded by Fazzelli making disparaging remarks about the Republican Party and President Trump, according to the Sheriff's Office.
[03:09:06.164 --> 03:09:17.874]  Steve Scalise, who survived a mass shooting by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter, warned on a recent podcast that some on the left are inciting this violence and frankly they should be called out on it.
[03:09:17.874 --> 03:09:22.758]  He added that some Democrats are almost encouraging political violence.
[03:09:23.118 --> 03:09:25.420]  But the Democrats are only getting started.
[03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:30.184]  A 94-year-old actress casually asked, where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[03:09:30.184 --> 03:09:33.346]  Confirming that she advocates assassinating the president.
[03:09:33.346 --> 03:09:38.310]  While the Wyoming GOP office gets torched just two days after opening.
[03:09:38.310 --> 03:09:47.297]  And Mad Maxine Waters, in all of her self-righteous tunnel vision, is still allowed to incite her followers to confront Trump supporters.
[03:09:52.370 --> 03:09:54.651]  My past.
[03:09:54.651 --> 03:09:56.392]  My calling.
[03:09:56.392 --> 03:10:00.574]  My name is Maxine.
[03:10:00.574 --> 03:10:05.596]  I grew up a black woman in a racist, sexist city.
[03:10:05.596 --> 03:10:12.099]  But despite the odds being against me, I made it.
[03:10:12.099 --> 03:10:14.980]  I have a right to my anger.
[03:10:14.980 --> 03:10:17.201]  I call it rebellion.
[03:10:17.801 --> 03:10:27.865]  I'll say to Diane, remember, there are those who said that we lacked civility when I got up and talked about the president's cabinet.
[03:10:27.865 --> 03:10:40.751]  And I said, if you see him anywhere, if you see him at a restaurant, if you see him in a department store, even at a gasoline station, just tell him you're not welcome here anyway.
[03:10:45.988 --> 03:10:48.771]  So it frightened a lot of people.
[03:10:48.771 --> 03:10:54.317]  And of course, the line president said that I had threatened all of his constituents.
[03:10:54.317 --> 03:10:58.642]  I did not threaten his constituents, his supporters.
[03:10:58.642 --> 03:11:01.405]  I do that all the time, but I didn't do it that time.
[03:11:03.621 --> 03:11:15.368]  Be forewarned, the odds of the midterm election season entering the loathsome realm of bad craziness is reaching a fever pitch that is bordering on terrorism.
[03:11:15.368 --> 03:11:18.110]  John Bowne reporting.
[03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:22.893]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:11:22.893 --> 03:11:26.955]  Alright folks, Roger Stone's guest hosting today in this fourth hour.
[03:11:26.955 --> 03:11:27.776]  He's about to take over.
[03:11:28.686 --> 03:11:32.088]  Got more coming up with Eric Bolling and the Oram a little bit later.
[03:11:32.088 --> 03:11:35.010]  Roger will be back then.
[03:11:35.010 --> 03:11:37.472]  We're in an insane time, 55 days out.
[03:11:37.472 --> 03:11:38.833]  There's no mistake there.
[03:11:38.833 --> 03:11:42.255]  And the left has gone on insane rampages of violence everywhere.
[03:11:42.255 --> 03:11:44.456]  It's going to get a lot crazier.
[03:11:44.456 --> 03:11:48.039]  Just now is the time to be focused, to be politically involved, and to know what's going on.
[03:11:49.719 --> 03:11:55.005]  Separately, if you financially fund us, we will defeat Soros and Hillary and the rest of them.
[03:11:55.005 --> 03:11:56.106]  Plus, you'll get great products.
[03:11:56.106 --> 03:12:01.792]  So, if you want Patriot T-shirts to meet like-minded people and spread the word, it's quite an adventure.
[03:12:01.792 --> 03:12:09.740]  Get a Molon Lambe shirt, a Re-Elect 45 shirt, a George Washington battle uniform shirt with a hatchet and a musket.
[03:12:09.740 --> 03:12:10.721]  They're all great.
[03:12:10.721 --> 03:12:11.642]  I'm the resistance shirts.
[03:12:13.058 --> 03:12:14.280]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:17.263]  And yes, it's a great sales tactic because it's true.
[03:12:17.263 --> 03:12:18.565]  It's a bummer.
[03:12:18.565 --> 03:12:21.888]  I can't get Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[03:12:21.888 --> 03:12:23.070]  We had to break the contract.
[03:12:23.070 --> 03:12:24.071]  It's just, it's not happening.
[03:12:24.071 --> 03:12:24.832]  It takes too long.
[03:12:24.832 --> 03:12:25.793]  They're charging too much.
[03:12:25.793 --> 03:12:28.076]  I'm going to try to get another supplier working on it.
[03:12:29.258 --> 03:12:32.959]  But that'll probably take six months or longer to get it back, even if we're successful.
[03:12:32.959 --> 03:12:34.500]  But I'm playing hardball right now.
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:38.141]  We have the best iodine, the best deep earth halogen out there to counter the bad halogens.
[03:12:38.141 --> 03:12:43.303]  If you don't know about the iodine conspiracy, and IQ, and health, and everything else, m4warsstore.com, m4warslife.com.
[03:12:43.303 --> 03:12:45.004]  This is a basic building block of the body.
[03:12:45.004 --> 03:12:46.344]  It's the big missing link.
[03:12:46.344 --> 03:12:48.285]  It's 25% off, even though we're selling out of it.
[03:12:49.045 --> 03:12:54.770]  The current sales rates, so we have 25% off and I've announced this, it's pretty amazing how much we're selling.
[03:12:54.770 --> 03:13:01.255]  Current sales rates in three weeks it will be sold out and six months, a year, who knows until we get it.
[03:13:01.255 --> 03:13:03.177]  But this is the end of X2.
[03:13:03.177 --> 03:13:04.217]  This is the end my friend.
[03:13:04.978 --> 03:13:11.841]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of our elaborate plans, the end.
[03:13:11.841 --> 03:13:14.643]  I'll never look into your eyes again.
[03:13:27.081 --> 03:13:29.482]  40% off BioTruth Selenium that works great with the iodine.
[03:13:29.482 --> 03:13:34.442]  Learn about it for yourself at EnforcedOr.com or EnforcedLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:13:34.442 --> 03:13:37.023]  Roger Stone, taking over here.
[03:13:37.023 --> 03:13:38.763]  A lot going on.
[03:13:38.763 --> 03:13:46.804]  I wanted to ask you, I know we haven't talked to Corsi since he got hauled in by the Mueller and since they've had the folks trying to set me up and everything.
[03:13:46.804 --> 03:13:53.166]  It is a crazy day in America with the economy coming back, the 25th Amendment they're trying to implement.
[03:13:53.166 --> 03:13:55.166]  You've got a lot coming up, so go ahead and take it over, Roger.
[03:13:56.516 --> 03:13:57.556]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:13:57.556 --> 03:14:00.597]  First of all, I want to commend you for having Eric Bolling.
[03:14:00.597 --> 03:14:09.800]  He's a great broadcaster and I really admire the way that he's taken the terrible tragedy in his life and the drug overdose of his son.
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:16.163]  And in his grief, he has used it to try to educate people to ensure that this tragedy doesn't hit other families.
[03:14:16.163 --> 03:14:17.303]  It takes enormous courage.
[03:14:18.231 --> 03:14:22.094]  To have that kind of pain and speak out effectively the way Eric has.
[03:14:22.094 --> 03:14:26.598]  So, I commend him and I admire him and I'm glad you had him on the show today.
[03:14:26.598 --> 03:14:28.799]  I admire him as well.
[03:14:28.799 --> 03:14:29.340]  Please continue.
[03:14:30.533 --> 03:14:42.839]  So, as far as Dr. Jerome Corsi is concerned, ABC News is now reporting that he will testify for the grand jury of Robert Mueller next Friday, this coming Friday.
[03:14:42.839 --> 03:14:45.960]  Now, I've had no communications with Dr. Corsi.
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:50.342]  He is a great researcher, a great writer, and of course he was the D.C.
[03:14:50.342 --> 03:14:52.803]  Bureau Chief for InfoWars until recently.
[03:14:53.403 --> 03:14:56.926]  I can only hope that Dr. Corsi will testify truthfully.
[03:14:56.926 --> 03:14:58.367]  I think he will.
[03:14:58.367 --> 03:15:01.210]  And if he does, it will be entirely exculpatory.
[03:15:01.210 --> 03:15:13.961]  Because you see, it was Dr. Corsi who educated me to the fact that Tony Podesta, along with his brother John, were deeply involved in Ukraine, working for the same political party as Paul Manafort.
[03:15:13.961 --> 03:15:21.467]  But more precisely, that John and Tony were making literally millions of dollars off the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[03:15:22.167 --> 03:15:27.450]  The banking deal, the uranium deal, the gas deal, and so on.
[03:15:27.450 --> 03:15:45.920]  So it is very clear that the special counsel still has both Alex Jones and Roger Stone in his sights, and they recognize that a precursor to an attempted takedown of Donald Trump must be the takedown of Infowars, must be the takedown of Alex Jones,
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:46.861]  Thank you.
[03:15:53.359 --> 03:15:55.220]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.220 --> 03:16:03.824]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:17:09.055 --> 03:17:15.317]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[03:19:57.074 --> 03:20:15.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.050 --> 03:20:19.033]  This is Bernie Sanders, and there's a lot of corruption in this country.
[03:20:19.033 --> 03:20:24.638]  And if you want to hear about corruption, then you'll listen to Roger Stone on InfoWatch, because he tells the truth.
[03:20:28.377 --> 03:20:30.417]  Welcome back.
[03:20:30.417 --> 03:20:34.078]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:20:34.078 --> 03:20:42.840]  That was a terrific lick by the Rolling Stones, circa 1965, a song called Carol, written by the great Chuck Berry.
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:55.642]  Well, I'm pleased to hear that the Republican candidate for Congress, opposing Congressman Eric Swalwell, survived a knife attack on him, clearly designed to take him out.
[03:20:56.266 --> 03:21:05.755]  But what we need to know now is whether the would-be killer had connections to Swalwell's campaign, what Swalwell knew about this attack, if anything.
[03:21:05.755 --> 03:21:08.397]  The American people deserve to know.
[03:21:08.397 --> 03:21:12.581]  I certainly hope the FBI is on the case.
[03:21:12.581 --> 03:21:22.570]  You know, the Senate Republicans are so ridiculously hapless that this past week an extraordinary opportunity slipped by.
[03:21:23.493 --> 03:21:38.902]  John Dean, who the media lionizes as a whistleblower in Watergate, but who is in fact the man who planned, pushed, and then lied about the Watergate break-in was before the U.S.
[03:21:38.902 --> 03:21:40.503]  Senate and under oath.
[03:21:41.161 --> 03:21:59.172]  This would have been a perfect opportunity to ask Mr. Dean about the discrepancies that were discovered by the Watergate special prosecutor between his Senate testimony and what he told individual Watergate prosecutor investigators and the FBI under oath.
[03:21:59.798 --> 03:22:09.084]  There is a memo that you can find in my book, Nixon's Secrets, that outlines the fact that Dean lied.
[03:22:09.084 --> 03:22:25.616]  Additionally, we know that two White House figures, Tony Ulasiewicz and Jack John Caulfield, both of them decorated former New York police officers, working for the counsel's office as investigators,
[03:22:26.276 --> 03:22:42.155]  Say, in both their oral histories and in their biographies, which are out of print but can be found, that John Dean ordered them to case out the Watergate-DNC complex six weeks before the break-in.
[03:22:42.755 --> 03:22:56.562]  A golden opportunity was missed with John Dean, one of the great weasels of all time, when he was under oath before the Senate to testify against the candidacy of Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:22:56.562 --> 03:23:03.426]  Now, Mr. Dean has very carefully styled himself as a leftist,
[03:23:04.068 --> 03:23:08.732]  Biting criticism of the George W. Bush administration.
[03:23:08.732 --> 03:23:12.956]  Even more vicious criticism of the Trump administration.
[03:23:12.956 --> 03:23:15.578]  This is to protect the big lie.
[03:23:15.578 --> 03:23:21.223]  The lie that Richard Nixon knew about or approved the Watergate break-in.
[03:23:21.223 --> 03:23:26.828]  The lie that Attorney General John Mitchell knew about and approved the Watergate break-in.
[03:23:27.308 --> 03:23:33.291]  Mitchell went to his grave denying that because John Dean is the Watergate weasel.
[03:23:33.291 --> 03:23:39.714]  If you want to see 12 questions that John Dean won't answer, go to Watergateweasel.com.
[03:23:39.714 --> 03:23:42.895]  That's Watergateweasel.com.
[03:23:42.895 --> 03:23:46.397]  John Dean, not who you think he is.
[03:23:46.397 --> 03:23:50.619]  President Donald Trump is about to make an extraordinarily important decision.
[03:23:51.391 --> 03:23:59.693]  You see, very recently, the White House consul, Don McGahn, learned that he was leaving the White House.
[03:23:59.693 --> 03:24:02.894]  He learned this in a presidential tweet.
[03:24:02.894 --> 03:24:08.795]  There you have the 12 questions John Dean doesn't want to answer at WatergateWeasel.com.
[03:24:08.795 --> 03:24:18.417]  Mr. McGahn, in my opinion, has given President Donald Trump not only bad legal advice, but most certainly given him bad political advice.
[03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:25.904]  It is Don McGahn, for example, who has consistently opposed the firing of Jeff Sessions.
[03:24:26.607 --> 03:24:56.214]  Jeff Sessions has turned a blind eye to the corruption of the Obama administration, turned a blind eye to the use of a fabricated dossier that was compiled by a former British intelligence agent with the assistance of Russian intelligence, and then used as the underlying legal rationale for the illegal and unconstitutional spying on the campaign of Donald Trump.
[03:24:57.139 --> 03:25:14.567]  When Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News, my great friend and a friend of this program, exposed the fact that Donald Trump was under surveillance, as was his campaign, Judge Napolitano was widely ridiculed.
[03:25:14.567 --> 03:25:19.889]  But it turns out that Andrew Napolitano was absolutely right.
[03:25:19.889 --> 03:25:24.811]  In any event, now the president must decide who will replace Don McGahn.
[03:25:25.558 --> 03:25:33.404]  McGahn was originally recommended by Corey Lewandowski, the fired campaign manager from the Trump campaign.
[03:25:33.404 --> 03:25:48.276]  So it's not surprising that McGahn turns out to be a deep state quizzling, a man who is deeply embedded in the Washington neocon two-party duopoly that's brought this country to its knees.
[03:25:48.276 --> 03:25:52.720]  And then we learned that Mr. McGahn voluntarily gave 30 hours
[03:25:54.382 --> 03:25:57.710]  Of testimony to Robert Mueller.
[03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:58.933]  30 hours!
[03:25:58.933 --> 03:25:59.995]  Think about that.
[03:25:59.995 --> 03:26:02.140]  That's longer than an entire day!
[03:26:02.856 --> 03:26:08.877]  What could Mr. McGann have to say about the president that would be that extensive?
[03:26:08.877 --> 03:26:10.858]  And what about executive privilege?
[03:26:10.858 --> 03:26:11.618]  Never mind that.
[03:26:11.618 --> 03:26:14.439]  What about attorney-client privilege?
[03:26:14.439 --> 03:26:19.160]  What was it that Mr. McGann was in there talking about for 30 hours?
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:22.120]  No wonder this fellow has been canned.
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:25.401]  No wonder he read in a tweet that he was leaving.
[03:26:25.401 --> 03:26:25.641]  Now,
[03:26:26.607 --> 03:26:34.734]  Washingtonians are saying that the president will replace McGahn with an attorney named Emmett Flood.
[03:26:34.734 --> 03:26:43.581]  By all of my research, Emmett Flood is a good man, a fighter, a man who puts his client, not the Washington culture, first.
[03:26:43.581 --> 03:26:56.211]  So the selection of Emmett Flood, who's currently working as one of the counsels for President Donald Trump, as the White House chief counsel would be a step in the right direction.
[03:26:57.105 --> 03:27:12.835]  You know, I think that the president has had a bad week because he allowed himself to be distracted by the anonymous New York Times editorial that was allegedly written by a senior member of his administration.
[03:27:13.570 --> 03:27:24.207]  As I told Chris Cuomo the other night on CNN, I don't believe that anyone in the Trump administration wrote this particular memo.
[03:27:24.207 --> 03:27:28.193]  I think it is a fraud upon the people, a MacGuffin.
[03:27:29.209 --> 03:27:30.230]  A con job!
[03:27:44.239 --> 03:27:45.700]  All the news that's fit to print
[03:28:03.701 --> 03:28:10.267]  Embellished with a left-wing tint, is what it should say in that little box in the corner.
[03:28:10.267 --> 03:28:17.414]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, I'm Roger Stone, and we have a lot more to break down for you, and I will be right back.
[03:28:17.414 --> 03:28:18.375]  But before I leave,

[03:28:53.339 --> 03:28:54.559]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:28:54.559 --> 03:28:58.481]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.481 --> 03:29:00.022]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:29:00.022 --> 03:29:02.983]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:02.983 --> 03:29:08.525]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:29:54.244 --> 03:29:56.607]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:29:56.607 --> 03:30:03.196]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[03:31:10.918 --> 03:31:14.041]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:31:14.261 --> 03:31:17.724]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:31:17.724 --> 03:31:19.805]  It is a classical 360 win.

[03:32:56.687 --> 03:32:59.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.857 --> 03:33:12.959]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:33:12.959 --> 03:33:21.483]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:33:21.483 --> 03:33:32.549]  And there you have the great Wilson Pickett, the wicked Wilson Pickett, with a cover of a terrific Eddie Floyd song, a standard called Knock on Wood.
[03:33:32.549 --> 03:33:35.691]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.371 --> 03:33:41.793]  You know, I've been to the DC MAGA meetup that's held at the Trump Hotel.
[03:33:41.793 --> 03:33:44.414]  You've never been to the Trump International in Washington.
[03:33:44.414 --> 03:33:50.396]  It's a great meeting place for like-minded patriots and I myself have been to the meetup.
[03:33:50.396 --> 03:33:52.857]  I have so many friends that go there.
[03:33:52.857 --> 03:33:56.958]  Among them, the journalists Cassandra Fairbanks and of course Jack Posobiec.
[03:33:57.538 --> 03:34:15.672]  So I was relieved this morning to learn that there was no bloodshed, even though a crazed leftist threatened to use a gun based on his tweet, and as he put it, take home a number of bloodstained MAGA hats as trophies.
[03:34:15.672 --> 03:34:22.217]  This shows you the mental state of the left, the dementia of the far left.
[03:34:22.217 --> 03:34:23.718]  Let's be clear.
[03:34:23.718 --> 03:34:26.660]  Those who advocate violence are wrong.
[03:34:27.302 --> 03:34:30.124]  We denounce white supremacists.
[03:34:30.124 --> 03:34:32.406]  We denounce neo-Nazis.
[03:34:32.406 --> 03:34:35.408]  We denounce the KKK.
[03:34:35.408 --> 03:34:39.691]  We denounce racism in all of its forms.
[03:34:39.691 --> 03:34:42.713]  They are the ones who advocate violence.
[03:34:42.713 --> 03:34:50.638]  They are the ones who have threatened me and my family, even threatening to kill my sweet little dogs.
[03:34:50.638 --> 03:34:54.361]  These people are monsters and it's getting worse.
[03:34:55.061 --> 03:35:02.346]  I can no longer travel in polite society without armed security, and that's a sad factor.
[03:35:25.292 --> 03:35:29.172]  Uh, very, uh, pleased to, uh,
[03:35:30.459 --> 03:35:44.892]  Learn that Dr. Jerome Corsi did not testify for the grand jury last Friday after a seven-hour rubber hose session with the interrogators for Robert Mueller.
[03:35:44.892 --> 03:35:56.583]  You see, Dr. Corsi, as I said earlier, is the individual who educated me in August of 2016 about the Podesta brothers' involvement in Eastern Europe.
[03:35:57.103 --> 03:36:15.949]  Specifically, it was Corsi who pointed out an August 14th article by Peter Schweitzer, the author of Clinton Cash, published at Breitbart News, that outlined the fact that Tony Podesta worked for the exact same Ukrainian political party as Paul Manafort.
[03:36:15.949 --> 03:36:25.932]  Now, as you may know, Manafort has been indicted for lobbying on behalf of that political party without registering under FARA, the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
[03:36:26.528 --> 03:36:37.819]  The problem is that Tony Podesta didn't register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act either, but Tony Podesta has been granted immunity by Mr. Mueller.
[03:36:37.819 --> 03:36:43.024]  Oh, Mueller says, well, we referred that matter to the Southern District of New York for prosecution.
[03:36:43.681 --> 03:36:45.542]  Folks, that's a dead letter.
[03:36:45.542 --> 03:36:50.783]  The Southern District of New York will never prosecute Tony Podesta for anything.
[03:36:50.783 --> 03:36:53.244]  It's a public relations dodge.
[03:36:53.244 --> 03:36:55.265]  A fraud upon the public.
[03:36:55.265 --> 03:36:56.865]  So the bottom line is obvious.
[03:36:56.865 --> 03:37:04.588]  If you're a Clinton-loving Democrat, well-connected to Bill and Hillary and their criminal enterprise, you can break the law.
[03:37:04.588 --> 03:37:09.169]  But if you're poor Paul Manafort, you're held to a very different standard.
[03:37:09.821 --> 03:37:17.283]  Now, I'm told that Dr. Corsi will testify, according to ABC News, this coming Friday.
[03:37:17.283 --> 03:37:19.424]  Well, that's fine with me.
[03:37:19.424 --> 03:37:23.265]  I hope Dr. Corsi will simply tell the truth.
[03:37:23.265 --> 03:37:30.807]  The truth is, I had no advanced knowledge of the acquisition or the publication of John Podesta's emails.
[03:37:31.407 --> 03:37:49.080]  In fact, to infer that, you would have to take my now iconic tweet about John Podesta's time in the barrel, and take out the word THE, because I said THE Podesta's apostrophe S, that's plural possessive, time in the barrel will come.
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:52.562]  It says nothing about John's email.
[03:37:52.562 --> 03:37:55.685]  I never made a reference to John Podesta's emails.
[03:37:55.685 --> 03:38:04.592]  But I do understand why those who have read his emails would like to controversy be over how they were obtained rather than what's in them.
[03:38:04.592 --> 03:38:09.816]  Because there's evidence of criminality, dirty tricks, and worse.
[03:38:09.816 --> 03:38:13.639]  So what better way to distract from the actual content
[03:38:14.139 --> 03:38:14.559]  I don't know.
[03:38:33.052 --> 03:38:37.495]  They confirm its authenticity and they publish it.
[03:38:37.495 --> 03:38:41.057]  So, John Podesta, are any of these emails fake?
[03:38:41.057 --> 03:38:42.518]  Are any of them fabricated?
[03:38:42.518 --> 03:38:44.519]  Are any of them not accurate?
[03:38:44.519 --> 03:38:47.641]  Explain to us what you meant about the kids in the hot tub.
[03:38:47.641 --> 03:38:48.902]  Would you mind?
[03:38:48.902 --> 03:38:52.985]  So, that's where the Corsi matter stands.
[03:38:52.985 --> 03:38:58.969]  If Jerry Corsi goes before the grand jury and he tells the truth, it will be simply exculpatory.
[03:38:59.529 --> 03:39:02.815]  Then there's the question of Randy Credico.
[03:39:02.815 --> 03:39:05.079]  This guy is a trip.
[03:39:05.079 --> 03:39:12.371]  A former left-wing radio host in New York City, Credico was allowed to bring his dog into the grand jury.
[03:39:13.024 --> 03:39:18.346]  But when I checked in New York State, his dog is not registered as a service dog.
[03:39:18.346 --> 03:39:24.108]  In fact, Mr. Credico has no known malady that requires him to have a dog.
[03:39:24.108 --> 03:39:29.870]  Well, Credico tells the media he's a comfort dog and he has a note from his doctor.
[03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:31.690]  No, he doesn't produce it.
[03:39:31.690 --> 03:39:33.071]  There is no such note.
[03:39:33.531 --> 03:39:40.633]  So why would Robert Mueller allow Mr. Credico to take the dog in to the grand jury?
[03:39:40.633 --> 03:39:42.053]  It's very clear.
[03:39:42.053 --> 03:39:47.895]  You see, at one point I learned that Mr. Credico's dog was malnourished, that he wasn't feeding it.
[03:39:47.895 --> 03:39:54.977]  You could tell because you could see the dog's ribs and you could see the dog had some kind of condition regarding its skin.
[03:39:56.588 --> 03:40:02.371]  I did tell Credico that if he didn't feed his dog, I would be forced to take the dog.
[03:40:02.371 --> 03:40:06.173]  Well, they took the email and they no doubt showed it to the grand jury.
[03:40:06.173 --> 03:40:15.158]  You see, Roger Stone is so evil, so cruel, so vicious that he threatened to take this poor man's dog.
[03:40:15.158 --> 03:40:17.059]  Wow.
[03:40:17.059 --> 03:40:19.940]  Will I be allowed to take my dog into court?
[03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:20.861]  I kind of doubt it.
[03:40:21.508 --> 03:40:25.289]  Then there's the larger question of Mr. Credico.
[03:40:25.289 --> 03:40:37.413]  I believe he may have lied to the grand jury, committed perjury, when he said that no, he didn't serve as an intermediary between Julian Assange or WikiLeaks and myself.
[03:40:37.413 --> 03:40:41.434]  You see, I never had any direct contact with Assange.
[03:40:41.434 --> 03:40:46.115]  I never received any allegedly hacked emails from them.
[03:40:46.115 --> 03:40:48.676]  So let's take a look at this brief video.
[03:40:51.277 --> 03:40:54.639]  You've previously denied being the backchannel between Stone and Assange.
[03:40:54.639 --> 03:40:58.020]  Did you say that under oath today?
[03:40:58.020 --> 03:40:59.621]  Probably.
[03:40:59.621 --> 03:41:00.302]  You want me to say?
[03:41:00.302 --> 03:41:01.702]  Uh, yes.
[03:41:01.702 --> 03:41:05.744]  I definitely was not a backchannel to Julian Assange.
[03:41:05.744 --> 03:41:08.926]  If there was even a backchannel to Julian Assange.
[03:41:08.926 --> 03:41:10.667]  And you said that under oath today?
[03:41:10.667 --> 03:41:12.028]  They asked you that and you said that?
[03:41:12.028 --> 03:41:13.308]  Yes.
[03:41:13.308 --> 03:41:15.930]  Why would Stone say you were his backchannel then?
[03:41:15.930 --> 03:41:17.690]  You know, you're going to have to ask him that.
[03:41:19.378 --> 03:41:25.246]  You don't know the guy that was the in-between guy between Assange and Roger Stone?
[03:41:25.246 --> 03:41:26.768]  That's my wife, Kat.
[03:41:26.768 --> 03:41:28.070]  Kat, I'm Randy Credico.
[03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:30.814]  I'm the guy that was connected to Roger Stone.
[03:41:30.814 --> 03:41:32.036]  You remember him?
[03:41:32.036 --> 03:41:34.679]  I'm the guy that's connected now between Stone
[03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:38.211]  And with you, Higgs, I'm very close with Julian Assange.
[03:41:38.211 --> 03:41:40.751]  Have you seen that I got... Bingo!
[03:41:40.751 --> 03:41:45.172]  Bingo, and there you have it.
[03:41:45.172 --> 03:41:47.473]  That's called perjury, folks.
[03:41:47.473 --> 03:41:57.575]  There you have the lying liar lying, Randy Credico, back-to-back, telling one journalist one thing and another journalist something else.
[03:41:57.575 --> 03:41:59.695]  What did he tell the grand jury?
[03:41:59.695 --> 03:42:01.716]  My lawyers can't wait to ask him.
[03:42:02.296 --> 03:42:13.222]  That's the state of affairs here where you have now 12 people that are either current or former associates of mine questioned by the FBI.
[03:42:13.222 --> 03:42:16.423]  At least nine of them questioned about Alex Jones.
[03:42:16.423 --> 03:42:20.445]  What about the relationship between Roger Stone and Alex Jones?
[03:42:20.445 --> 03:42:23.207]  Does Roger Stone work for Alex Jones?
[03:42:23.207 --> 03:42:27.849]  Obviously, nobody at the FBI tunes in to the war room every day
[03:42:28.189 --> 03:42:34.290]  Five o'clock Eastern, where I host a show with my colleague, Owen Schroyer.
[03:42:34.290 --> 03:42:35.450]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:35.450 --> 03:42:41.632]  I'll have more for you on the other side, but in the meantime, go to the Infowars.com store, folks.

[03:44:56.428 --> 03:44:57.508]  Travis in Florida.
[03:44:57.508 --> 03:44:58.509]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:44:58.509 --> 03:45:01.410]  You know, I'm really, the country's in deep trouble, but at least we're fighting back.
[03:45:01.410 --> 03:45:05.891]  I'm getting persecuted hard, but you know, it's good to be number two under attack after the president.
[03:45:05.891 --> 03:45:10.093]  I'm in good company, and so I, my bones feel good.
[03:45:10.093 --> 03:45:11.433]  I feel close to my ancestors.
[03:45:11.433 --> 03:45:12.994]  I feel like I'm delivering.
[03:45:13.174 --> 03:45:15.475]  You're definitely, you're definitely right there with the Patriot Belt.
[03:45:15.475 --> 03:45:17.996]  I guess it is true, truth is treason in the empire of lies.
[03:45:17.996 --> 03:45:19.017]  Um, I want to thank you personally.
[03:45:19.017 --> 03:45:20.477]  I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
[03:45:20.477 --> 03:45:22.698]  Um, anyone that knows, like a hypothyroidism condition.
[03:45:22.698 --> 03:45:25.279]  Um, I currently, I mean the products, I can just name them all real quick.
[03:45:25.279 --> 03:45:32.122]  Brain Force, X2, Selenium, the Micro-ZX Vitamin, Mineral Fusion, Frosticard, the Coffee, the Chaga Mushroom Blend, um, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Male.
[03:45:32.122 --> 03:45:34.223]  Let me tell you, it's given me my life back.
[03:45:34.223 --> 03:45:36.504]  Just taking the thyroid medicine alone is just not enough.
[03:45:36.504 --> 03:45:39.145]  Just having these products has made my life just back to normal.
[03:45:39.145 --> 03:45:39.986]  I'm working harder.
[03:45:39.986 --> 03:45:40.246]  I'm, um,
[03:45:40.606 --> 03:45:42.631]  I feel like I'm unbelievable.
[03:45:42.631 --> 03:45:43.673]  Your products are amazing.
[03:45:43.673 --> 03:45:46.379]  They are the highest quality you're going to get out there.
[03:45:46.379 --> 03:45:47.622]  And that's why people love them.
[03:45:47.622 --> 03:45:48.864]  So thank you for the support.
[03:45:48.864 --> 03:45:49.425]  God bless you.
[03:45:49.425 --> 03:45:50.588]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:45:50.588 --> 03:45:51.189]  Take care, Travis.
[03:45:57.691 --> 03:46:03.418]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.418 --> 03:46:11.307]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.307 --> 03:46:14.451]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:14.631 --> 03:46:22.674]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:22.674 --> 03:46:31.638]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:31.818 --> 03:46:33.199]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:06.821 --> 03:47:12.423]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[03:47:12.423 --> 03:47:15.805]  Right here, on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.805 --> 03:47:22.067]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:22.067 --> 03:47:25.849]  So Randy Credico is taking his dog to Robert Mueller's grand jury.
[03:47:26.607 --> 03:47:30.070]  But the dog is not a registered service dog in New York State.
[03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:31.571]  What's this all about?
[03:47:31.571 --> 03:47:36.795]  Well, Credico plans to tell the grand jury that I threatened to take away his dog.
[03:47:36.795 --> 03:47:37.735]  How cruel!
[03:47:37.735 --> 03:47:39.076]  How heartless!
[03:47:39.076 --> 03:47:41.098]  With a prop dog right there.
[03:47:41.098 --> 03:47:50.925]  What he won't mention is that I did so out of concern that because of Credico's substance abuse and his indigence, the dog is receiving neither food nor medical attention.
[03:47:50.925 --> 03:47:55.369]  I stand second to no one in terms of my record of fighting for animal welfare.
[03:47:56.224 --> 03:48:00.145]  This will not be the first time Mr. Mueller has misled the grand jury.
[03:48:00.145 --> 03:48:05.226]  The stone-cold truth stings.
[03:48:05.226 --> 03:48:18.989]  I really wanted to put that up so people could see my dog, Pee-Wee 2.0, one of two Yorkshire Terriers, along with his sister Mimi, who are my comfort dogs and a great comfort to my wife.
[03:48:19.668 --> 03:48:27.669]  Now, as I said in the last segment, it's the InfoWars.com store that is the lifeblood of what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:48:28.308 --> 03:48:34.512]  You see, we are not subsidized by any fat cat conservative billionaires.
[03:48:34.512 --> 03:48:39.375]  We are not subsidized by any George Soros types.
[03:48:39.375 --> 03:48:45.438]  Our sustenance comes completely and totally from the individual InfoWarrior audience.
[03:48:45.438 --> 03:48:56.945]  You, our loyal patrons, who support us by buying our great products, the nutraceuticals, the books, the t-shirts, and the other great products available at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:48:57.569 --> 03:49:05.431]  This is, without any question, the very best place to get a copy of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[03:49:05.431 --> 03:49:19.175]  And here is a special officer offer that is available only to those who buy it at the Infowars.com store, rather than, say, Barnes & Noble or Amazon or your local bookstore.
[03:49:19.175 --> 03:49:26.177]  It's available in those places, but here's an offer that is available only to Infowarriors who buy it on the site.
[03:49:26.757 --> 03:49:45.403]  If you buy Stone's Rules, my latest book, which is kind of like Alinsky's Rules for Radicals meant for conservatives or people who are launching a career, whether it's in business or politics or media or tech or fashion or agriculture, for that matter.
[03:49:45.403 --> 03:49:52.365]  These are my rules of the road, kind of like Sun Tzu's The Art of War or Niccolo
[03:49:53.045 --> 03:49:55.347]  Machiavellis of the Prince.
[03:49:55.347 --> 03:50:03.812]  These are the maxims and guidelines I've learned in a 40-year career in the American political arena.
[03:50:03.812 --> 03:50:16.559]  But if you buy Stone's Rules today at the InfoWards.com store and you mail it to me, I will gladly personalize it, sign it, and mail it back to you.
[03:50:16.559 --> 03:50:19.001]  No, I'm not using a signature machine, folks.
[03:50:19.321 --> 03:50:23.762]  It'll really be my signature with a personalization.
[03:50:23.762 --> 03:50:26.463]  Buy your book at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:50:26.463 --> 03:50:32.604]  Mail it to me at the following address with your receipt proving that you bought it from InfoWars.
[03:50:32.604 --> 03:50:33.585]  There's the address.
[03:50:33.585 --> 03:50:34.005]  P.O.
[03:50:34.005 --> 03:50:43.447]  Box, Roger Stone, 1007 North Federal Highway, Department 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:50:47.541 --> 03:50:48.801]  Leave it up there for a second.
[03:50:48.801 --> 03:50:57.183]  Buy your book, Stone's Rules, this offer only for InfoWars and people who buy it there and mail it to me at that address.
[03:50:57.183 --> 03:51:02.264]  It will be my honor to sign it, personalize it, and mail it back to you.
[03:51:02.264 --> 03:51:15.326]  I've signed and turned out over 400 books so far from loyal InfoWarriors who know that by buying the book at InfoWars rather than buying it at your local bookstore, you're helping to fortify the fight for freedom.
[03:51:15.726 --> 03:51:23.299]  You're helping to fuel what we do here at InfoWars, which is straight from the shoulder investigative journalism.
[03:51:23.299 --> 03:51:25.283]  You see, because of the InfoWars store,
[03:51:26.351 --> 03:51:37.097]  There's no one telling Alex Jones and the great people at InfoWars what we can and cannot report, what we can and cannot say, what we can and cannot educate people about.
[03:51:37.097 --> 03:51:45.762]  And that's what provides the terrific spirit and the entire rationale that makes us the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[03:51:45.762 --> 03:51:46.963]  We need your help now.
[03:51:46.963 --> 03:51:48.824]  Please go to the InfoWars store.
[03:51:49.404 --> 03:51:56.150]  Alex Jones faces the greatest threat to his broadcasting history in his entire life.
[03:51:56.150 --> 03:52:13.867]  Not only is he facing down multi-million dollar bogus lawsuits, in some cases financed by George Soros and other freaks, but he's also facing a war of censorship where they want to shut InfoWars down across all social media platforms.
[03:52:14.307 --> 03:52:16.088]  Don't let it happen, folks.
[03:52:16.088 --> 03:52:20.791]  We can't fight if we don't have a war chest, and only you can help us.
[03:52:20.791 --> 03:52:24.393]  Please go to the InfoWars.com store now.
[03:52:24.393 --> 03:52:35.280]  Now, as an individual who has a long-standing personal relationship with the President of the United States, I am concerned about his administration.
[03:52:35.280 --> 03:52:40.323]  While I'm not concerned about the direction he's taking in the country, I think that speaks for itself.
[03:52:40.323 --> 03:52:41.524]  3.2 million new jobs.
[03:52:44.910 --> 03:52:52.997]  Five, almost 5%, 4.6% economic growth, that's growth in the GDP.
[03:52:52.997 --> 03:53:06.770]  In this quarter, the appearance that the very next quarter could actually hit five and a half, maybe even 6% economic growth, record growth in wages.
[03:53:07.754 --> 03:53:13.836]  African-American and Hispanic unemployment at the lowest point ever.
[03:53:13.836 --> 03:53:15.997]  A record stock market.
[03:53:15.997 --> 03:53:21.679]  Yes, President Donald Trump is making America great again.
[03:53:21.679 --> 03:53:28.122]  And Republicans, including the president, need to run on a platform of peace and prosperity.
[03:53:28.996 --> 03:53:40.359]  But instead, the president has unfortunately gotten dragged into a fraudulent controversy with both the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[03:53:40.359 --> 03:53:54.703]  The Washington Post has been in the forefront of publicizing the book by Bob Woodward, held out to us as an icon, a man of impeccable integrity who can't be questioned, when in fact, Bob Woodward is a fraud.
[03:53:55.330 --> 03:53:57.332]  He lied about Watergate.
[03:53:57.332 --> 03:54:19.330]  He lied about being a military intelligence briefer in the Navy and briefing White House Chief of Staff General Alexander Haig and plotting with Haig to publicize the 18 and a half minute gap, which wasn't created by Richard Nixon or his longtime assistant, Rosemary Woods, but was put forward by General Haig.
[03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:29.500]  How is it that Bob Woodward learned about the gap before the Senate investigating committee looking into Watergate or before the Watergate prosecutors?
[03:54:29.500 --> 03:54:36.207]  That's because Bob Woodward was a White House insider, a deep stater from the get-go.
[03:54:36.207 --> 03:54:41.353]  Then, of course, Woodward lied about Iran-Contra in the administration of President Donald Trump.
[03:54:42.020 --> 03:54:54.851]  Yes, Woodward says that he snuck into the room, the hospital room, of CIA Director Bill Casey, who had been felled by a stroke, and that Casey gave him an exclusive interview in which he confessed everything.
[03:54:55.470 --> 03:55:01.813]  The problem was that Casey's stroke had left him without the capacity for speech.
[03:55:01.813 --> 03:55:02.813]  How do we know this?
[03:55:02.813 --> 03:55:08.195]  Well, Casey's wife and his daughter and his doctor all say so.
[03:55:08.195 --> 03:55:10.136]  Busted, Bob Woodward.
[03:55:10.136 --> 03:55:23.742]  The president should not dicker with Woodward, nor should the president continue his back and forth, suggesting that Jeff Sessions, of all people, should investigate who the author is of the New York Times
[03:55:24.443 --> 03:55:26.946]  I know exactly who wrote this.
[03:55:26.946 --> 03:55:27.207]  No one.
[03:55:27.207 --> 03:55:27.787]  It's a fraud.
[03:55:40.735 --> 03:55:42.056]  A MacGuffin.
[03:55:42.056 --> 03:55:45.118]  It's a, it's a, it's a con job.
[03:55:45.118 --> 03:55:50.101]  And unfortunately, Donald Trump, who I love, has taken the bait.
[03:55:50.101 --> 03:55:53.444]  Mr. President, your record is incredible.
[03:55:53.444 --> 03:55:56.265]  You are bringing this country back.
[03:55:56.265 --> 03:55:57.726]  Ignore your critics.
[03:55:57.726 --> 03:56:02.350]  Don't get down in the gutter with the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[03:56:02.350 --> 03:56:10.415]  Talk about an incredible record of economic success and your attempts abroad to bring a more peaceful world.
[03:56:11.249 --> 03:56:20.535]  Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush couldn't even get the North Koreans to the table, yet Donald Trump has engaged them in peace talks.
[03:56:20.535 --> 03:56:23.757]  How's that for changing the world scene?
[03:56:23.757 --> 03:56:41.129]  If you want to look at who our real adversaries are abroad, Donald Trump is smart enough to know that the Chinese are the major adversaries for the United States, and that Islamic terrorism is both a problem for ourselves, and of course, the Russians.
[03:56:41.809 --> 03:56:47.352]  That those are the issues the president should run on for this election.
[03:56:47.352 --> 03:56:49.793]  Those who say, oh, we're going to lose the house.
[03:56:49.793 --> 03:56:50.714]  It's over.
[03:56:50.714 --> 03:56:52.475]  There's a blue tsunami coming.
[03:56:52.475 --> 03:56:56.297]  A little premature in my opinion.
[03:56:56.297 --> 03:56:58.438]  The president has the bully pulpit.
[03:56:59.295 --> 03:57:09.102]  It's amazing to me that at no time during his presidency has he given an address directly to the American people from the Oval Office.
[03:57:09.102 --> 03:57:17.207]  The president has the bully pulpit and he can put his imprimatur and his message on the upcoming election.
[03:57:17.207 --> 03:57:20.870]  Time is short, but Donald Trump has the whip hand.
[03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:22.391]  He chooses to use it.
[03:57:23.138 --> 03:57:24.099]  I'm Roger Stone.
