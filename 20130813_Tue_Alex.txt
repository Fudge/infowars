[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:36.440]  Texas Alex Jones I have never seen such a concerted rollout of basically military
[00:36.440 --> 00:44.160]  martial law acclimation conditioning drills going on at a very Indiana they're
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.440]  all over the news showing burning vehicles and terrorists attacking but
[00:48.440 --> 00:52.040]  it's all simulated to create the perception of fear in the general
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.680]  public US Army conducts military occupation drill in small town Wisconsin
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.240]  Kit Daniels has an article on that operation trigger emulates military
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.400]  control of local elected officials that's on record the Army Syops is
[01:06.400 --> 01:11.080]  running that operation and then you've got of course the fake terror drills
[01:11.080 --> 01:16.240]  which they told police were real this week in Austin Texas it just goes on and
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.720]  that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down and covering today and
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.120]  again when you go and read what the Syop groups are admitting this is for
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.200]  America this is brigade homeland that the Pentagon's been talking about for five
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.280]  years and they're taught their enemy is not all kind of this is even in the
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.440]  Washington Times Associated Press their enemy will be the Tea Party they believe
[01:40.440 --> 01:45.360]  that will attack their loving leaders their loving foreign bankers that have
[01:45.360 --> 01:50.400]  taken over their only problem is most the military is waking up to the fact
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.760]  that the command structure is under a corporate foreign coup d'etat which is
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.920]  French for coup d'etat to quote the great philosopher Carlos from the movie
[02:02.920 --> 02:10.240]  hop but ladies and gentlemen to get serious here we haven't an article on
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.120]  this yet but kiosk in libraries everywhere being sent to videos are saying
[02:15.120 --> 02:19.320]  you can't get to info wars calm people shooting video this because it's quote
[02:19.320 --> 02:25.720]  racist and also British library network blocks hamlet for violent content so
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.440]  this is the new they can teach five-year-olds in the UK and the US how
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.600]  to do things that I didn't know about the love is 20 things I won't can't even
[02:36.600 --> 02:42.400]  say on adult radio you know what they teach them but you can't have Hamlet
[02:42.400 --> 02:45.520]  because it's got some sword fight Senate and that's violent you got to learn how
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.040]  to be a minion plus it makes government you know out is corrupt and in very
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.360]  thought-provoking to do to be or not to be that is the question is it no blur the
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.680]  point is is that that's being banned don't worry and info wars calm thank
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.960]  goodness and I mentioned this briefly yesterday but after the show I noticed
[03:03.960 --> 03:15.440]  he'd been banned from the radio circuit blacklisted from the rodeo circuit and
[03:15.440 --> 03:18.560]  they've got representatives saying it's the ugly face of intolerance and
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.760]  racism a rodeo clown dressed up like Obama as part of a skit and don't worry

[03:48.760 --> 03:53.280]  clowns do for folks that never been to a rodeo they're saying that's the threat on
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.320]  the president now that the that the bull chasing me around that's what the
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.440]  clowns do and by the way I've read about rodeos where they did jokes of Nixon
[04:03.440 --> 04:08.640]  Reagan and others that's that's that's part of the deal and I'm sure it was
[04:08.640 --> 04:12.480]  playing to an anti-Obama sentiment but but I can tell you this is the type of
[04:12.480 --> 04:17.880]  stuff that goes on at rodeos so I'm going to commit a thought crime I'm

[10:04.320 --> 10:08.920]  witnesses and video and he was investigating the CIA director that
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.520]  was what he was looking into and that's what he told friends as well when the

[10:40.760 --> 10:50.680]  liberty or any type of freedom that they are mentally ill so that is coming up
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.560]  today in the third hour this first hour of course will be jam packed with the
[10:56.560 --> 11:04.040]  news and information here I want to get into Obamacare now that it's being
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.760]  implemented everything that was in the bill that they wouldn't let us see until
[11:07.760 --> 11:14.800]  days before they passed it two plus years ago is now coming out and if you go
[11:14.800 --> 11:23.560]  up to drudgerport.com it has probably the largest group of stories breaking
[11:23.560 --> 11:31.720]  down exactly what's going on ensures need not set limits on out-of-pocket
[11:31.720 --> 11:37.000]  expenses it's now being announced Sebelius is coming out saying this is
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.080]  not a bait and switch which is exactly what it is continuing McConnell to sing
[11:44.080 --> 11:51.240]  don't open Obamacare exchanges if privacy isn't protected well I mean it's
[11:51.240 --> 11:55.680]  designed under Obamacare to give all your data to every federal state agency
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.960]  and thousands of corporations that's all on record low premium high debatable
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.360]  health plans endangered it was always meant to get rid of health care
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.520]  insurance competition to the big 10 or so insurance companies that wrote the
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.560]  bill with Mitt Romney and then God Obama to ram it through because idiot
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.480]  Democrats will support any fascist gang rape by corporations it was kind of
[12:21.480 --> 12:30.360]  Democrat of it also employer fine will swell despite delay that's right no one
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.080]  gets any free health care unless you're illegal aliens basically and then it
[12:34.080 --> 12:37.520]  cuts the quality of the care let's government tell doctors what care they're
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.240]  going to give with the death panels and is designed to in the next five years
[12:42.240 --> 12:47.560]  rape everyone financially and then implode the health care system 61% of
[12:47.560 --> 12:50.880]  doctors announced they're going to take early retirement that's in big Gallup
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.680]  polls it's designed to absolutely federalize everything else the feds
[12:55.680 --> 12:58.880]  are coming to medical doctors of all types and saying you get with the
[12:58.880 --> 13:02.680]  program join our combines and we'll give you protection from all these new
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.080]  rules that are written to where all of you can be put in jail for anything not
[13:08.080 --> 13:17.520]  dotting an I not crossing a T you name it you're gone you name it it's over you
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.800]  name it it's the end for you unless you sign documents and join us so it is the
[13:23.800 --> 13:29.320]  nationalization the socialization of health care happening right now the
[13:29.320 --> 13:33.600]  destruction of the one of the best health care systems in the world now
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.520]  taken over by the eugenicist and the social engineers to fully run our lives
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.880]  and if you play ball with the new lawyer you'll get your health care if you
[13:41.880 --> 13:45.680]  don't you won't just like if you're not a democratic donor you can't keep your
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.400]  general motors dealership even if you've had it 85 years and then Democratic
[13:52.400 --> 13:57.640]  party donors they get your dealership that and that's all on record I mean it
[13:57.640 --> 14:08.440]  is just the wholesale shutting down of the entire society across the board and
[14:08.440 --> 14:14.440]  this has always been the program this has always been the plan this has always
[14:14.440 --> 14:24.360]  been the operation this is always been the program shut down America pass
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.360]  regulations and taxes that no one can pay except the insiders who are exempt
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.720]  and write the loopholes for themselves this is command and control economy by
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.520]  offshore megabanks that are make the mafia look like sweethearts completely
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.920]  shutting everything down right now
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.360]  meanwhile to divert as they make everything about race as a distraction
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.040]  and a diversion when when black mobs who have been encouraged to do this by the
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.680]  media attack white people every day beating their brains out and shooting
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.880]  them and killing them it never makes it out of the local news I've got cases of
[14:59.880 --> 15:05.240]  that in the local news from different parts of the country in Minnesota another
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.280]  areas yesterday one white guy was beat up by a group of 40 black people his
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.280]  head beat in that's in all the police reports he's in a coma and that's just
[15:16.280 --> 15:21.600]  the way it is one more dead cracker if they take him off the life support MSNBC
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.120]  jokes and says it's time to get the crackers Al Sharpton says it's the
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.400]  cracker asses that have the guns we're going to get them Fox Sports says it's
[15:30.400 --> 15:36.800]  racist whites that have the guns this is meant to invoke whites to become racist
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.560]  to then have a clash of civilizations there it is man in coma after black mob
[15:41.560 --> 15:46.520]  of 50 pommels and world net daily reporting on that but this is the type
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.680]  of issue to again invoke racial division so that then it can selectively be
[15:52.680 --> 15:57.600]  focused on by the media to accelerate the clash while the military trains to
[15:57.600 --> 16:00.840]  take over every major U.S. city and that's coming up at the bottom of the
[16:00.840 --> 16:11.400]  hour from Atterbury Indiana to areas in Wisconsin the US Army psychological
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.560]  warfare practice is taking over U.S. towns and taking over the functions of
[16:15.560 --> 16:24.440]  elected officials in the CA and Cyop operation command battalion so the
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.440]  globalists are getting ready folks it's in the cards I mean they're gonna play
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.600]  the card to invoke race war in this country as a pretext to send in
[16:32.600 --> 16:38.000]  military stabilization forces which we will never basically get out of we're
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.160]  going under globalist receivership globalist reconstruction meanwhile
[16:43.160 --> 16:49.040]  libraries across the world are banning things like 1984 because it quote has
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.200]  sex in it for the children while they teach the children how to have sex at
[16:53.200 --> 16:58.120]  age five and they're banning Hamlet for violent content and in full wars calm
[16:58.120 --> 17:02.960]  for racist content I'm not kidding because we're racist folks you you've
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.040]  heard MSNBC they say Ron Paul is racist they have no evidence they just say it
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.240]  over and over again but even if we were racist we shouldn't have our free speech
[17:10.240 --> 17:17.040]  blocked by Skynet Politico AP Reuters they all report representative William
[17:17.040 --> 17:25.960]  Lacey clay on the clown ugly face of intolerance Obama Obama is supposedly
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.600]  above the law and above criticism he can illegally spy he can he can illegally
[17:32.600 --> 17:36.360]  detain they can disappear people they can give 85 million dollars a month and
[17:36.360 --> 17:39.480]  again he's just the front man of all this so everybody goes after Obama
[17:39.480 --> 17:44.040]  politically he's just the mask of the bankers the mask of the establishment
[17:44.040 --> 17:50.080]  and when they're done doing that ladies and gentlemen they can just bring in a
[17:50.080 --> 17:54.080]  new puppet that we all start attacking and when a Republican does everything
[17:54.080 --> 17:58.120]  Obama's been doing why the conservatives will defend it and the
[17:58.120 --> 18:03.840]  Democrats will decry it it's time for us to unify against anybody that violates
[18:03.840 --> 18:06.640]  the Bill of Rights the Constitution and let me tell you Obama's a lot worse

[24:43.960 --> 24:47.480]  that has put out a letter saying that he has been
[24:47.480 --> 24:50.360]  blacklisted they're very very proud of themselves and clearly the
[24:50.360 --> 24:53.400]  announcer and everybody else were involved in it and it was part of a
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.120]  skit why don't we fire the janitor of the rodeo
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.040]  you know let's look the government fund al-qaeda murder people in mass
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.360]  spy on us illegally persecute the press arrest
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.080]  members of the media for just reporting news you know federalized police the
[25:11.080 --> 25:13.800]  government openly training to confiscate our guns
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.400]  saying the number one enemy is tea party they have the military all over the
[25:17.400 --> 25:20.600]  country trying to take on local governments if they stand up for the
[25:20.600 --> 25:23.720]  bill of rights the constitution just like the county
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.680]  government said they knew the government was planning to do what was it
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.040]  Lubbock last year guys it was Lubbock wasn't it
[25:30.040 --> 25:36.040]  yes so so so so we've got all of that going on
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.840]  and meanwhile the the socialists and people don't like their dear leader
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.480]  people making fun of them and so now don't worry he's been blacklisted don't
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.960]  worry and they're saying it's racist now and all the rest of them and this may
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.240]  even be staged for all we know we've caught him doing racist stuff to go
[25:53.240 --> 25:55.880]  after rand paul we caught him just a few weeks
[25:55.880 --> 25:59.080]  together democrats down there at the trevon martin deal saying we're all
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.160]  racist and saying racist stuff in front of the news cameras so this could be
[26:03.160 --> 26:06.280]  staged well frankly i've watched some of the
[26:06.280 --> 26:09.240]  video of it and seen the photos it looks like it was something real
[26:09.240 --> 26:12.600]  sounds like something they did do and by the way there probably are people
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.200]  out in the middle of nowhere that you know make jokes about black people
[26:16.200 --> 26:19.480]  i guarantee you go to some you know other ethnic event you're going to
[26:19.480 --> 26:22.360]  see people making fun of other groups that's what humans do
[26:22.360 --> 26:26.360]  but the whole point is is it is is it big national news no
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.200]  it's national news because they want to divert us and distract us in there
[26:30.200 --> 26:36.120]  i mean i've got the quotes here they got a musician saying
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.080]  uh it was scary everybody screamed just went wild as the announcer talked about
[26:41.080 --> 26:43.880]  having the bull run down the clown with the obama mask
[26:43.880 --> 26:47.080]  it was at that point i began to feel a sense of fear it was the level of
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.000]  enthusiasm beam a 48 year old musician from higgsville
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.040]  said sunday referring to the reaction from the crowd that filled the fair's
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.400]  grandstand now that's where cnn and the rest of them because i've
[26:57.400 --> 27:00.280]  seen it on tv a really planned on the ignorance
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.040]  most people that hadn't been to erodeo you may have seen bull riding on tv or
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.000]  something professionally but not what goes on during the breaks
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.400]  the clowns always run from the bulls the the the announcer always says that bull
[27:11.400 --> 27:14.440]  don't get him that bull don't you don't run him down
[27:14.440 --> 27:18.360]  that is standard and that is not racist okay
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.600]  they're trying to say they want to run down our god obama who's the puppet
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.280]  frontman for the globalist they're saying they want to run him down
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.800]  oh my goodness it's so evil it's so bad ladies and gentlemen
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.480]  to make fun of our leader no one should be able to even wear a mask of him
[27:35.480 --> 27:40.280]  on halloween because that's racist too you make fun of obama you've seen all
[27:40.280 --> 27:43.400]  these stories about how it's racist to make fun of obama when everybody made
[27:43.400 --> 27:45.960]  fun of bush everybody made fun of ronald reagan
[27:45.960 --> 27:49.880]  i've made fun of bush myself and gone out with joe rogan dressed like what like
[27:49.880 --> 27:53.320]  bush senior he was bush jr and he throws me out of a wheelchair

[28:06.680 --> 28:10.520]  can probably find it so i say this they say you can't
[28:10.520 --> 28:13.880]  can't say that a bull was going to run over a clown and they play on the
[28:13.880 --> 28:16.920]  ignorance of the people going they wanted to have bulls run over obama
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.160]  that's a death threat that's a no it's not but here's the deal this is not a
[28:21.160 --> 28:24.840]  sacred image obama is just a puppet frontman who symbolizes
[28:24.840 --> 28:29.720]  tyranny in this nation and collectivism and don't worry about tyranny and you
[28:29.720 --> 28:32.680]  didn't build your business so now they're saying the secret
[28:32.680 --> 28:35.800]  service might investigate because the bull might but you know is that a threat
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.160]  to obama what a load of bull you know what i'm not intimidated by all this i
[28:39.160 --> 28:41.960]  want nothing to happen to obama because he's a nothing but a frontman of the

[33:45.800 --> 33:50.200]  hypnotism we're it I am the polar opposite of
[33:50.200 --> 33:54.280]  MPR they promote collectivism communism socialism corporate
[33:54.280 --> 33:59.000]  cronyism lies deceit division fraud scamming
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.440]  sucking off taxpayers we support the opposite of that
[34:04.440 --> 34:09.240]  and I do get wound up in here because I read news for hours at night hours in
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.720]  the morning and then I go exercise I come into work
[34:13.720 --> 34:17.880]  and then I just blow up on air a lot it really does happen
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.440]  and I need to settle down and cover the news here it's just that it really gets
[34:22.440 --> 34:25.560]  to me to see what an authoritarian country we're
[34:25.560 --> 34:28.120]  turning into and how the system wants to put out the
[34:28.120 --> 34:31.720]  message that you don't talk about government that that's somehow
[34:31.720 --> 34:35.960]  unpatriotic if you're a radio listener I had a plastic mask of
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.640]  the so-called person that is the front man for the globalist
[34:39.640 --> 34:43.480]  as they dismantle the country I'm very upset about the country being dismantled
[34:43.480 --> 34:46.920]  I'm very upset about them shutting off our energy systems our industrial
[34:46.920 --> 34:50.280]  systems this is acts of war by the globalist on record
[34:50.280 --> 34:55.000]  post-industrial operation and seeing my country destroyed and conquered is very
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.600]  painful so that we can all be collectivized and
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.240]  be be turned into slaves and to watch them pass unconstitutional laws so you
[35:03.240 --> 35:06.840]  can't get your money out of the country or where citizens can't even leave
[35:06.840 --> 35:10.600]  if they say you quote aren't allowed to without even having
[35:10.600 --> 35:16.680]  an indictment or a crime the country is shutting down on every front
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.200]  but the movies theaters are still open there's still all the entertainment and
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.320]  all the distractions in the toxic culture and it really
[35:23.320 --> 35:27.720]  hurts me it really gets to me but here is barack obama
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.560]  and i tore up a plastic mask of our of our king
[35:33.560 --> 35:37.800]  because ladies and gentlemen barack obama is not my king he is not my master
[35:37.800 --> 35:41.080]  he is not my lord he is nothing but a mask of the
[35:41.080 --> 35:43.880]  globalist to bring in their world government
[35:43.880 --> 35:51.080]  and i have sworn total resistance to it and i'm sorry if like a race car
[35:51.080 --> 35:55.240]  sometimes i shoot my rpms up and blow an engine on air
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.400]  but i appreciate everybody joining us so
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.800]  so again ladies and gentlemen i am now obama lector
[36:03.800 --> 36:08.840]  uh cj saying i look like a Hannibal lector now with the lower mandible
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.440]  of barack obama on my face i think we've created a new character
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.280]  where obama tells you the truth hi this is barack obama
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.200]  without my character i was raised by the ford foundation and carnage
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.560]  endowment part of a program over a thousand children raised
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.680]  with one of them targeted to be president as a frontman
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.840]  to bring in the collapse of the united states i am the expression of a hundred
[36:32.840 --> 36:35.960]  year robber baron program to finally bring
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.400]  the united states to its knees soon all of you will learn to serve the
[36:41.400 --> 36:48.040]  collectivization because it's liberal
[36:48.040 --> 36:52.840]  as i double the funding for forced abortions in china and africa
[36:52.840 --> 36:56.600]  as we move forward with the sterilization via garter cell in mexico
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.360]  i will be praised by all the minority organizations and groups
[37:00.360 --> 37:04.120]  because we fund them from the start through the rockefeller foundation in
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.760]  1910 and we control them now and nothing will stop our
[37:08.760 --> 37:12.680]  operation because we do it in a trendy
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.600]  loving way you guys like the new outfit

[37:28.520 --> 37:34.040]  video feed right there i think we should have more visits with our friend
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.360]  obama took his mask off he ripped the pieces aside and
[37:38.360 --> 37:41.560]  there was the new world order technocrats
[37:41.560 --> 37:51.000]  who want to fight racism behind it
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.760]  remember to brush with fluoride boys and girls and take your shots
[37:56.760 --> 38:10.600]  obama loves you
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide or today thank you

[38:26.120 --> 38:29.160]  are you someone to be trampled underfoot by the globalist who think
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.880]  you're a joke you know one of the reasons i've been so upset can we cue it up
[38:33.880 --> 38:39.560]  video of boy praise to obama i've done it now folks in this little to this
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.000]  little boy this would be like desecrating a crucifix this
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.640]  would be like like the federal department of arts paying
[38:47.640 --> 38:52.040]  what was it a million dollars to to have a group of displays
[38:52.040 --> 38:59.560]  mirroring catholic artifacts in in in different types of manure
[38:59.560 --> 39:03.240]  you know hundreds of thousands for crucifix and goblets of urine
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.280]  well i mean how did i just did something far worse
[39:06.280 --> 39:13.800]  for all the little minions out there i desecrated their king their lord
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.040]  their master and we have this video up on info wars dot com
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.440]  set up in the tiles at the easiest place to find it is drudgerport dot com
[39:22.440 --> 39:28.840]  video boy praise to obama in a shocking video feature a child seemingly
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.480]  praised with the commander-in-chief is sparking outrage from conservatives
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.400]  as well as more religious members of the public who view the boys actions as
[39:37.400 --> 39:42.120]  possibly blasphemous well it's not his fault they teach people in
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.440]  all communist regimes where they they have the little kids in in kindergarten
[39:46.440 --> 39:49.240]  pray and ask for a school lunch because you've been
[39:49.240 --> 39:52.280]  collectivized the kids are half starving
[39:52.280 --> 39:54.440]  they don't know they had more food before the communists came in they just
[39:54.440 --> 39:57.400]  know they only get food if they pray and they they you pray to jesus pray to
[39:57.400 --> 40:00.200]  buddha pray to whatever they haven't prayed ever even if it's in asia they
[40:00.200 --> 40:02.120]  haven't prayed a buddha and it doesn't happen
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.520]  then they go now pray to now pray to hochi men
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.560]  and then you pray and there is milk there is oatmeal there is porridge there
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.800]  is eggs there is food and it's pavlovian
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.000]  you pray to the state by the way paul watson is going to post an article
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.880]  later about the embedded messages in government videos where
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.280]  they have you pray to the state and this is the type of stuff that goes on and
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.200]  unless you think this is a isolated case with a bunch of other videos where
[40:32.200 --> 40:37.160]  you're taught to praise him and sing to him and pray to him
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.440]  and on the signpost to perdition on the signpost to tyranny this is a big one
[40:42.440 --> 40:49.080]  so let's go ahead and let's go now to the poor little boy
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.320]  uploaded on his parents youtube as they think obama looks like a pretty nice
[40:55.320 --> 41:00.040]  house profiling it i would guess that these are
[41:00.040 --> 41:03.480]  folks are lower middle class probably government
[41:03.480 --> 41:05.880]  workers
[41:06.520 --> 41:09.640]  and you know or or they may be on welfare but but it looks like a little
[41:09.640 --> 41:13.880]  too nice for welfare unless there's something else going on there
[41:13.880 --> 41:16.840]  but if you expand on that isn't there a separation church and state the way
[41:16.840 --> 41:19.800]  they implement it so that's a government paid for house
[41:19.800 --> 41:22.760]  you're not supposed to have brain going on in it of course that makes sarcastic
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.840]  congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[41:26.840 --> 41:29.560]  prohibiting the fraternization thereof that's the beginning of the first
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.400]  amendment why are there hundreds of laws on religion in this country
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.840]  because it's all unconstitutional how are they spying on us without
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.680]  warrants because we're under an emergency since 1933
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.320]  when we went under receivership to jp morgan chase goldman sacks
[41:45.320 --> 41:49.880]  look up the paperwork we've been under martial law but we were so free
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.480]  it's taken them 80 years to break us 80 years to get us
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.160]  from almost no one on welfare and the wealthiest fastest growing economy in
[41:57.160 --> 42:03.400]  the world on average 12 growth rate from 1789 until
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.200]  1913 look up the numbers the dollar lost almost none of its value in fact
[42:08.200 --> 42:13.160]  they had deflation a lot of the times that actually caused problems
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.080]  how'd you like a 12 growth rate instead of a 3% fake growth rate
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.000]  how'd you like a blue collar job they've got all the studies in the 50s and 60s
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.240]  daddy could be a janitor and you lived at a house and could have two cars and
[42:25.240 --> 42:29.800]  go on three or four big vacations a year and put money in there for college
[42:29.800 --> 42:33.880]  if daddy was a janitor hey janitors can you live like that now
[42:33.880 --> 42:37.320]  no you can't because we're being made like the third world we're not lifting
[42:37.320 --> 42:40.760]  them up if they had real programs
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.960]  to build power plants and build water systems
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.400]  and then and then have the local government sign real contracts back say
[42:47.400 --> 42:50.360]  to a city like let's say austin sponsored some city in
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.120]  mexico and they had real aboveboard programs to lift them up
[42:54.120 --> 42:57.480]  then i'd be for something like that if we voted for it and if locally you
[42:57.480 --> 43:00.360]  voted for that because i want to lift people that's not what's happening
[43:00.360 --> 43:03.320]  they go and they pay in the actuaries to break those cities
[43:03.320 --> 43:08.520]  and those societies down because they want to make you poor as a weapon of
[43:08.520 --> 43:13.320]  control that's how the oligarchs operate that's how feudalism operates
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.160]  that's how it's operated for six thousand years and the renaissance
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.000]  and the enlightenment was the rebellion against that
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.320]  and is the only shot humanity's ever had at a free system of government that's
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.400]  why the media spends all day badmouthing the enlightenment
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.760]  and the renaissance and our forebearers and pointing out
[43:32.760 --> 43:36.200]  the day and age they lived in the bad things they were involved in
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.560]  yeah they don't tell you though compared to everybody else they were the
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.080]  vanguard changing it
[43:43.800 --> 43:47.640]  they don't ever want you to know that folks because if you ever discover
[43:47.640 --> 43:50.920]  those ideas it's over for the elite that want to
[43:50.920 --> 43:53.560]  control everything and want to keep your mind shackled
[43:53.560 --> 43:59.000]  want to keep you praying to a to an incredible betrayer
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.960]  the health care bill was written by the big insurance companies owned by the
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.160]  mega banks on record to make 35 million people that
[44:05.160 --> 44:08.920]  didn't have insurance get it to control what care you get to make it
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.800]  cost more give you less and control what doctors can do and make you dependent
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.880]  and then bankrupt all the small hmo's and health care companies
[44:17.880 --> 44:21.560]  and groups and outlaw the more affordable health care plans
[44:21.560 --> 44:25.000]  and by the way we're only a year into this premiums according to money
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.600]  magazine have already gone up 53 percent on average
[44:28.600 --> 44:32.680]  folks they're going to double by the time they're done by 2015 that's on record
[44:32.680 --> 44:36.200]  it's not going to be 53 or 52 it's going to be over 100
[44:36.200 --> 44:39.320]  percent ladies and gentlemen it is going to
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.000]  devastate everyone
[44:43.560 --> 44:48.760]  hospitals are shutting down all over the country
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.760]  the airlocks blown folks tyranny's coming in we're losing our atmosphere
[44:52.760 --> 44:55.960]  fast okay that's what i'm trying to explain to everybody here
[44:55.960 --> 45:00.360]  that's why i'm freaking out we're seeing a total takeover with the military and
[45:00.360 --> 45:02.440]  i got to get to that but let's play the little boy
[45:02.440 --> 45:05.720]  because he looks like a sweet little boy
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.760]  and he's really there praying for obama and he flips back and forth like
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.560]  obama's a man or as obama god and this is really sick
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.320]  when obama and the people that control him
[45:23.320 --> 45:27.000]  are putting fluoride in that little kid's water
[45:27.080 --> 45:29.960]  they always say we don't know why but every major study that studies it the
[45:29.960 --> 45:32.680]  minority areas have on average like double the fluoride we don't know why
[45:32.680 --> 45:35.560]  you don't know why
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.960]  there's a eugenics cult running things they want to stick him full of bunch of
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.960]  shots folks so he is basically has a lower IQ they want to do that to
[45:43.960 --> 45:47.880]  every child don't care what color the child is
[45:47.880 --> 45:51.960]  and here he is under savage globalist attack as our power plants shut down as
[45:51.960 --> 45:54.920]  our industry shuts down and the only thing you can get is from the
[45:54.920 --> 45:59.800]  government when it gives it to you and here he is praying to the government
[45:59.800 --> 46:02.920]  here's the audio it's disgusting

[46:58.520 --> 47:02.120]  rock obama for some reason our computer is cutting off the very first word he

[47:33.480 --> 47:36.680]  watt of electricity you buy from the local power company

[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.040]  day of august 2013 and we were joined for the
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.600]  balance of the hour by staff sergeant joe biggs who served two tours in
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.600]  afghanistan and one in iraq a lot of really interesting stories you can
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.880]  tell to give you the perspective of a soldier and really likeable guy like
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.360]  all the combat soldiers i've gotten to know i don't think i've met any of them
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.760]  that weren't really nice down to earth's people who also weren't naive
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.200]  because of what they've seen in country it's like a lot of my family are
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.720]  veterans of combat in special operations type things and they're just like
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.400]  of course the government ships in the drugs of course big banks launder money
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:17.480]  of course all this is going on because they saw it going back to vietnam you
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.440]  name it it's only the naive public that really
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.920]  doesn't know what's going on but he's going to tell us some of those stories
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.920]  about the dea and some of the shady stuff he saw that really primed him to
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.440]  know what was happening and maybe even tell the story about how he
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.880]  joined the army he told us yesterday for obama deception too but it was all
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.560]  very interesting i thought we'd get into
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.160]  talk some about it today and then he's already been on three times about this
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.920]  talk about hastings because right on time when he got to town
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.760]  it broke on the local san diego tv stations and in some newspapers
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.840]  that michael hastings was investigating ci director john brennan
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.520]  and there's also other intel he's got from his sources
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.520]  some of the other friends there with michael hastings when he died
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.120]  it's a big deal on an award-winning journalist who says he's going into
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.400]  hiding and on the run and less than 24 hours later his car blows up and then
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.240]  we're told move along it's no big deal nothing to see here
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.800]  that is a that is a big deal so we're going to talk about that
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.440]  with staff sergeant joe biggs at the bottom of the hour buddy it's good to
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.160]  have you here and meet you in person yeah it's great to be here thanks for
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.560]  having me what do you think of the info wars operation
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.200]  it's pretty neat it's uh a lot bigger than i expect it's pretty intense it's uh
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.400]  everyone's pretty motivated and dedicated i like it they're an incredible crew
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.680]  and not every tv radio studio has 50 cows yeah i definitely got to
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.040]  hold on to two of those yesterday that was pretty uh pretty ice
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.480]  next time you're down we got to go out and do some shooting oh definitely
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.200]  i'll be done with obama deception and it'll be a little bit cooler not that
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.960]  you can't handle heat where was the hottest place you ever served
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.400]  um co-weight is definitely the hottest place i didn't serve there but you
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.520]  stopped you there it is a toasty place it goes from about 120 down to about
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.600]  60 degrees at night so that's a huge temperature change at a
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.160]  it definitely shocks your system a bit i bet uh but yesterday i wasn't really
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.680]  intending to get into this stuff with you for the film interview
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.960]  but you started getting into how you started to really wake up
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.520]  tell folks some of the shady things uh without getting anything quote classified
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.880]  uh that you witnessed i mean you perfectly described it how
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.320]  they'd have you as a diversion over here and then meanwhile this would be
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.560]  going over here with the dea and uh how some of the taliban al-qaeda you were
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.720]  saying was fake but then some of it was real that amazing story about the
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.600]  about the phone books in the walls with the list of who they were going to kill
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.520]  in the u.s i mean you've got the floor staff sergeant biggs
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.680]  break down your service what you did and then some of the things you witnessed
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.800]  well when i joined i joined with the intentions that most people or most
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.160]  guys did when they went in you know serve your country you know
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.440]  no one you know i at that point never thought that there was anything wrong
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.400]  with america i was just gung-ho about it and i was
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.480]  pretty blinded by you know this whole perfect
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.960]  nation that i thought we had and repeat how you walked into the plight and
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.640]  what you said well i woke up this this one morning i was
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.760]  like you know i'm going to go do it so i go into the uh
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.840]  the recruiter office i said i want iraq i want combat and i want to go there's
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.880]  fast as possible what can you do and the recruiter looked at me he goes well
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.800]  you just made my job a lot easier i said i just want to do this i need to get it
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.160]  done it's something i have to do and next thing you know i was a basic
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.640]  training and then off to iraq it's a few months later so
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.680]  yeah that was let's get into the shadiness and we'll get into some of the
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.760]  ied stories and stuff but tell folks some of the first shady things you saw
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.560]  well definitely uh one of the missions will there are real terrorists out
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.760]  there a lot of people think that you know that's kind of a fake thing and
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.400]  they're not really out there it's just us making that up
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.480]  i went on a mission personally and uh from what we were told it was just an
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.400]  ied making facility which is an improvised explosive device
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.520]  and what what we found out when we got there was it was a lot more than that
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.320]  uh we were i would go through with the metals
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.520]  scanners and when we were finding anything on the floor so we started going
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.600]  up on the walls and started getting some some reads so we started
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.920]  busting in through the walls started finding
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:22.680]  trapinal passports money explosives phone books a new york city phone book
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.680]  with you know names circled in it all kinds of stuff i mean these guys had
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.600]  the money and the and you said it was public figures
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.040]  and government yeah i mean they had the means to to do something and
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.200]  luckily we were able to find that and stop those people from that but
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.160]  but specifically the type of shrapnel tell them what was in the phone books
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.840]  in the phone books that people you would hear on the news a lot i mean names like
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.960]  that stuff like government officials people like that that were circled in
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.680]  there the stuff the the types of materials they
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.080]  had were glass like marbles so if something did hit you the shrapnel
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.040]  would go into your body and if they scanned you
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.520]  they couldn't find anything so you know it was just a silent killer right there
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.720]  yeah because it's even hard i guess you get to metal out yeah you you've been
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.600]  a victim of that yeah um another one we uh we would get
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.440]  times where the dea would come and stay with us and be embedded with us
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.160]  and go out of missions and they would just be kind of you know we weren't allowed
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.800]  to talk to them until there was time to when they did speak up we would
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.160]  sometimes be asked to go down to opium fields and
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.600]  try to you know cut them down other times we were told to guard them
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.880]  you know and you know they would have us cutting down fields and then they would
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.800]  have us guarding ones and that was just that was what that was kind of weird
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.320]  that's what i've been told by family that was in uh columbia
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.400]  just a few years ago that they have gps grids where they sprayed the
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.360]  the people that don't launder their money with the right banks
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.480]  they had public meetings in columbia back in 99 where they sent the grasso
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.520]  they had the stock exchange went down and met with the head of the park and said
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.400]  you invest with us or we kill all your fields and invade
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.800]  and then they didn't so they kill their fields then grow it and ship it in
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.320]  yeah there was always you know like i was saying like there was this going on
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.200]  what we thought we were doing which is went in the heart to minds
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.960]  and then you know we had these you know operators that were doing something
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.800]  else on the backside so we were at this cover mission and then these guys were
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.200]  kind of off in the back doing other things as well
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.920]  was it mainly dea i mean what would happen after you'd guarded
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.440]  because from what they've admitted they would then process it then ship it out
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.120]  and it was flown out well a lot of times we would capture the people there that
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.320]  ran that and then they would take them back and interrogate them
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.520]  maybe shake them down i mean who knows we weren't really allowed to
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.400]  get close enough to hear what they were saying but all you could hear was
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.000]  screaming you could definitely hear that so torture
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.920]  yeah it's something after hearing that something i'd never
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.960]  wanted to be a part of i tell you that how were they torturing them
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.760]  waterboarding or pulling fingernails out i mean like i said i was outside the
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.440]  building all i could hear was just that you know so that alone just the screams
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.760]  from a person i was told dea uses electricity and
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.120]  little crank bills it's anything was possible at that
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.680]  point i mean i the the yells that i heard i've
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.800]  heard people get shot i've never heard that yell before
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.320]  i've heard people you know scream from being stabbed and
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.160]  the the the yells i heard from a person those were just ungodly
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.040]  and they were wanting to know i guess where the where the stashes were buried
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.480]  too that's worth a lot of money going in our daughter's arms here in
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.360]  yeah here in the us you know i got to ship that in immediately
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.400]  um how often would they torture people um it wasn't like real often maybe every
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.160]  few months it just whatever kind of intel they would get they would use us
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.160]  for covers to go run missions and they would be like oh you know we need to go
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.720]  over here you know we just have to let them go do their thing
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.880]  by the way that's breaking news so you would see dea take farmers in
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.680]  and then torture them well i mean they would
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.520]  wouldn't call them farmers you know they would be like these are taliban people
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.520]  and you know these guys would come in and they're all bearded up guys you know
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.640]  wearing all black you know special tactical gear and all that stuff and
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.600]  they would take them in there and interrogate them and do whatever
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.600]  were they cia were they navy shields we were told dea and then the other term
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.280]  they used was oga other government you know oh yeah
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.960]  other government agencies sure to be clear but i can show clips of fox
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.320]  seeing and going here's the marine corps commander he helps grow the opium
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.600]  yes these are just farmers so so they would call one group farmers
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.200]  and the other group they would call terrorists yeah my point is is that uh
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.120]  how long would the torturing go on for about an hour or so
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.920]  and then they would tell us to take you know control over that uh
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.440]  person of interest and then we would have to go take them to a manor
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.080]  like to a main base and then convoy them out there turn them over to be detained
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.120]  and then eventually they would get let go the next morning
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.960]  oh so it wasn't the long i'm sure you read about you know you may have seen
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.800]  those special torture camps they had that are basically like hell houses you're
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.920]  about those um did you ever see did you ever see
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.120]  them bring kids into the hell houses no no is the army report says they did
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.680]  oh it's possible i mean there was there was definitely a group of kids i would
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.080]  have liked to see going in there one time because uh
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.800]  three kids marched a suicide bomber up to our gate and the guy went off and
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.080]  almost killed a quite a good bit of really yeah and those kids just took off
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.720]  they act like because we saw him sitting there walking with this guy up to the
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.960]  gate and these kids were kids we've seen the whole
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.760]  time we were there so they seem friendly kids
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.480]  they walk up with this guy holding his hands and they're all just like oh you
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.760]  know we've known this guy forever next you know the kids run off the guy throws
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.040]  a grenade and pulls it will string and blows up
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.160]  now i can see was a scout just floating down wow
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.960]  you know the social engineers love war because it corrupts everybody
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:44.520]  yeah it's definitely a uh it's not meant for everybody it's a hard job to
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.320]  to go over there and you know like i said you go over with these peer
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.480]  intentions but at the end of the day truly all you want to do is get home
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.240]  and you just care about your buddy's getting home and it kind of you
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.000]  you know you're not all this you know god bless america this and that you know
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.200]  right now it's at this point where so many bad things going on that you see
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.920]  you're just kind of sick of it and all you can do is just look at your buddy
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.640]  and be like man i just hope you make it out of this
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.760]  you know that that is cultural mind control though
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.160]  you don't have to put them in a CIA mind control base to make them blow
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.440]  themselves up to to blow yourself up uh to try to you know kill
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.040]  people it's just it shows a high level of control the media always calls them
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.640]  cowards but for me that i don't think that's cowardly i don't like what
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.520]  they're doing but i don't think it's cowardly no it's not cowardly i mean

[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:35.160]  years off and on in afghanistan sergeant staff sergeant joe bigs
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.200]  is here with us briefly in the short six-minute segment just because people
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.760]  need to get the perspective i read about some people that have
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.440]  served five six seven eight tours you served three
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.600]  and saw a lot of incredible action what is the max you've heard of somebody
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.320]  serving combat tours upwards of almost two years
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.920]  i mean yeah that's me that's a long time to be
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.760]  in the in the crap in the in the gutter with the blood and it's
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.040]  i mean a year the army has along this appointment there is i mean
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.160]  the marine corps goes for a short amount of time but i mean how many how many
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.320]  tours total oh i've heard of upwards of
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.360]  i mean and the army like i said they're year-long
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.480]  deployments so if how many year-long deployments
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.360]  eight yeah that's that's the max i've heard of
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.520]  and that's that's just mind-blowing but i mean that's over probably a span of
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.080]  you know quite some time i was talking to an air force officer who's who's a
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.120]  pretty high-level officer over military police and he said look all the
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.680]  services fight now when you're over in afghanistan or iraq
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.680]  he said the convoys all the rest of it and he said
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.840]  he's basically the entire iraq war being at one time or another in it
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.720]  and all his buddies have been killed and stuff it was just
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.400]  amazing to think about i guess that convoy duty you've done is one of the
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.760]  worst things oh it was horrible i mean because
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.200]  the easiest way for the insurgents in iraq to stop
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.880]  you know the military from conducting missions was to cut off a fuel supply
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.000]  so what we did was four or five humvees have a humvee up front three or four
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.600]  fuel tanker a humvee three or four fuel tankers so forth so on
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.720]  the whole convoy would spread about a mile mile and a half long
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.920]  sometimes two miles just depending on how we kept our intervals
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.840]  and they would just be setting up bombs small
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.160]  small arms attacks just like ak-47 fire which would be nothing we just kind of
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.440]  laugh and drive through it but a lot of times they'd hit that first
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:31.480]  vehicle which was me then it would stop the convoy rpg attack gunfire and all
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.440]  that so it was uh every day was one of those kind of like
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.320]  puckered up deals where you're like you know every inch of road you go across
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.200]  because it's going to be the last thing you ever see tell that ie day story
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.600]  yeah i was uh in samara iraq we were just leaving to crit and we were going
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.200]  south to balad and uh we were approaching the
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:55.480]  samara bypass and uh right as we were coming over that
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.640]  the hill the sun's coming up and you know how when you're at the airport you see
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.560]  that haze over the runway that weird look you can see that the fuel coming up
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.800]  out of the the pavement and i remember seeing that
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.200]  and i'm kind of was his hate devils yeah and i was like that looks like a
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.040]  boom and then the vehicle just launched up in the air
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.320]  you know when you see explosions on movies you see people and crashes they
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.920]  slow it down and i always thought as a kid that that's just what they did for
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.600]  some kind of effect you know that really happens i remember
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.760]  just being there and like seeing a piece of paper float by my face
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.040]  and kind of looking over and seeing my buddy sergeant william sitting there and
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.640]  his head smashing against the wall and then everything just kind of speeds up
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.520]  and i guess your mind's trying to you know process what's going on
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.720]  you know the vehicle hit the ground all the tires were blown off
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.640]  and the third humby saw my tires which was the convoy commander and after like
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.720]  but i just said earlier a humby three you know fuel tankers a humby that's a
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.160]  good distance back so i mean this that explosion had some
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.600]  pack to it and i was in the asv so it has a v bottom
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.800]  so when it hit the ground it did this and wobbled and then went over and then
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.280]  flipped and fuel started coming out fire and next thing
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.600]  you know actually the guy that i met last night he was one of the guys that
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.360]  helped pull me out all i could hear was uh banging on the
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.600]  armor and eventually they pried open one of the doors and started pulling us
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.800]  out uh the inside of my esophagus was burnt
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.480]  from breathing in those you know the explosives and all that the fumes
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.240]  uh i just had a endoscopy done and inside of it just looks like someone
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.440]  took claws and ripped it through you were saying that's why you can't have white
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.120]  sheets yeah bleed everywhere yeah i also cough up blood the back of my head
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:40.280]  still bleeds and this was september 2006 so
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.240]  i mean for that stuff is that what got your foot with a shrapnel

[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.240]  i was i've been seeing these news articles now where some of the guys
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.120]  will have like half their foot blown off their foot and they got guys with

[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.560]  all right staff sergeant joe biggs is here with us and he's told some of this
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.600]  already but since he's here with us in studio
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.760]  for radio listeners and also tv viewers watching on prisonplanet.tv
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.920]  i thought that we should walk through all of this
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.960]  again what led up to michael's car blowing up the rolling stone
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.720]  associate editor and the reason i made a big deal out of this is
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.560]  in the past the media would go look and see if this was foul play
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:11.800]  just out of hand instead day one they said you don't say it can be foul play
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.600]  that's a conspiracy theory and then just more and more comes out the car not
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.400]  speeding as fast as they said the flash of light
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.560]  uh then it clearly people going looking at the tree including our reporters we
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.480]  sent to la the tree not even really damaged it
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.640]  came to rest up against it the engine uh blown out the back way
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.200]  down the road uh all of this stuff uh and and the fact
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:40.440]  that he sent an email saying basically
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.800]  thereafter me i'm going to go into hiding get ready for the feds
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.520]  and some of uh michael hastings other friends that have talked to joe biggs
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.200]  and of course joe got the email where he said he was
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.840]  basically going into hiding and had a big story he was about to break and get
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.360]  ready for the feds to come everybody else was too scared
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.560]  to even release that email and let me tell you folks when it's not an inside
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.440]  job or foul play they come out and say we're doing an
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:13.480]  investigation for a couple weeks and the car blew up we don't know what did it
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.000]  when it's suspicious they go no foul play this is completely normal
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.840]  happens all the time nobody look at this uh the feds weren't talking to him he
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.640]  wasn't working on a big story there's nothing happening here just to move
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.680]  along when you see that type of behavior ladies and
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.120]  gentlemen that's when the red flags go up
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.320]  and i've seen them kill a lot of journalists gary webb you name it the
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.920]  arkansiding of people uh this is a really serious
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.440]  issue and persecution of press all over the world
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.240]  is a big deal so staff sergeant joe biggs uh good friends with michael hastings
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.120]  they kept in contact with each other in the years after
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.120]  they've been in combat together um said i'm going to stand up for my friend he
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.120]  went to the memorial on the east coast uh was there uh she came up to him i mean
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.920]  he really told the story to tell yesterday and specifically told him
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.040]  i'm going to bring down whoever did this and then to see her up there all
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.080]  glowing oh nothing happened move along i mean
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:11.960]  folks this is really getting getting serious
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.680]  and uh if they can kill michael hastings and nobody investigates it
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.760]  then they can kill alex shones they can kill ron paul they can kill matt drudge
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.280]  they can kill uh bright mart oh i guess he's dead
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.840]  they can kill whoever they want and at a certain point and more people start
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.080]  dying i don't know what we're supposed to do because
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:35.160]  you know i'm not looking to start a fight here but i know it's a big shadowy
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.600]  government and things but uh you know at a certain point
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.240]  we just can't sit here while death squads run around killing whoever they
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.240]  want uh now staff sergeant joe biggs you heard
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.720]  me just lay out some of the basics of what happened but
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.960]  getting back into it talking about remembering michael hastings
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.600]  and just repeating what you said about him in combat compared to all the other
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.280]  press you ever saw and then how scared he was in your own words repeat what you
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.800]  said yet last night to the cameras on record here live on air for our own
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.760]  safety because i want to get everything out you said last night
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.640]  here live on air because i don't want to sit on this tape while we're putting it
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.920]  in the film and then you know we both end up having our own little explosions
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.160]  well like i've said before 2008 uh i find out that uh
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.760]  we're going to get another reporter in bed with us and you know
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.240]  like me and the rest of the guys are kind of like rolling their eyes i call it
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.120]  great here we go again another another you know reporter coming out here
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.640]  saying that they're going to be uh all hard and hard charged and then they're
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.560]  you know dedicated to working on their stories and doing all this and
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.560]  to you know when he gets there it was just a whole
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.080]  different person of what i just had you know in my head
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:47.160]  from all the other guys he jumps in there and he's just like i know what are

[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.160]  few missions with us and he actually was involved in a
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.680]  pretty big one up on a uh mountaintop in pakistan
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.640]  and we came under attack and you know like i've said before with other
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.160]  reporters they would just whimper down and they would you know you know like why
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.360]  did i do this i want to go back home i didn't sign up for this you know and
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.920]  michael's just sitting there with his grin on his face and i'm looking over at
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.040]  him and i just remember kind of sitting there shooting my m4 and i'm looking
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.440]  over and he's just looking up at me smiling with a camera and he's like is
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.560]  this it is there more you know he just had that intensity to that passion about
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.520]  what he did and you described there's a tens helicopters
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:31.640]  mortars going off around you oh yeah there were eight and warhawks coming in
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.560]  we had helicopter shooting hellfire missiles it was it was just complete
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.240]  and total chaos controlled chaos i guess you could it was like a scene out of
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.720]  apocalypse now yeah that's one of those things that you kind of
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.440]  you want to see when you get in the military but then it happened and you're
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.400]  like wow this is not like the movies this is so intense like there's so many
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:55.560]  parts moving you know you know the guys on the ground calling in for the air
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.480]  strikes the artillery the you know all this stuff trying to get clearance from
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.680]  washington can we use a c 130 specter gunship you know can we do this or like
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.560]  no we you know it's not important enough okay
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:11.720]  well there's like 300 of them and 30 of us i think that's pretty important but
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.160]  they tends to care of it for us but you know michael's just that guy he
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:19.400]  he didn't shriek back from the fear he loved it i mean he was just a go getter
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:25.800]  and adrenaline junkie and definitely right at my alley my kind of guy
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.400]  i think there was more to this guy that meets the guy i mean he marries
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.800]  the head spokesperson of the pr flag the scyops officer
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.800]  of the national security council that's the top of the pyramid
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.800]  worldwide because you've got globalist interest in and banksters that own
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.600]  things but the the the united states national security
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.200]  council is telling nato what to do it's telling the un what to do
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.240]  it's making all the decisions i mean that's the top of the pyramid
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.000]  the isauron that's right in the middle of it he marries her
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.440]  two years ago yeah love i guess uh level do crazy things to you
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.560]  and definitely uh it's definitely not one of those uh
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.640]  you know a matchup you would think but you know whatever
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.480]  amazing uh i mean repeat what you said yesterday about uh
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.920]  leading up to this talking to her and then when you're in that restaurant your
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.840]  body goes look up she's on cnn and i mean just your whole take on that
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.120]  yeah you know from the get go of how he was in afghanistan courageous you know
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:31.880]  brave strong kind of guy you know all he did was speak the truth
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:35.080]  and he didn't let anybody hinder you know that he didn't let anybody kind of
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.640]  like persuade him to change his stories his words he spoke the truth
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.520]  and that's just how he was so i get the you know i get this email
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.440]  and that email you know you sound so scared and it just didn't sound like
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.160]  the michael that you know myself or anyone else knew
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.720]  and you said you talked to his other friends who physically talked to him
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.840]  he was looking to repeat all that the feds had come to the house looking under
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.600]  the car he you said he was scared yeah he had uh
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.120]  le pd and then some other people had come by the house come in feds like like
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.160]  he said at that point there was a lot of weird things
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.080]  happening in the days leading up he you know he was seeing looking under his
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.480]  car with his brother um his other buddy a mutual
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.640]  friend of mike and i's uh said that five days out he started
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.240]  speaking in code he was just panicked and on alert
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.200]  you know just seemed like he was constantly looking over shoulders left
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.080]  and right and i knew he was like that in a sense
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.360]  because what happened with the mcrystal story you know he called me a few times
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.560]  and i'd spoke to him and he's like you know i'm kind of scared
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.600]  well you told me people were telling him we're gonna kill you yeah i mean he even
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.720]  wrote that in one of his books i mean he pretty much came out and said that they
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.480]  said that so i mean he definitely the biggest killers
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:51.800]  in the world say we're gonna kill you your car blows up and it's not suspicious
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.840]  yeah i mean everyone just wants to crack up to be some accident i guess it's
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.200]  easier to sweep this away and sweep it under the rug and actually dig in there
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:02.040]  and ask the questions and a lot of people out there just don't want to get
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.240]  into it but you know it's not going to stop me and
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.520]  some other people i know they're still curious and still have all these
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.320]  unanswered questions and we want to find out what's going on but like you said
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.440]  mike would do it for you well of course mike would do it for anybody i mean
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.600]  that was just the kind of guy he did anything
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.680]  any kind of you know unjust act that happened and he didn't feel right about
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.720]  it he get that gut feeling i mean he's going to look into it i mean he was
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.720]  going to find out what's going to happen i can't just not you know i didn't
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.000]  choose for the email to come to me i'd you know i would have
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.040]  saw that and been like you know what's going on and
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.960]  definitely still been curious about the whole thing but it came to me and i
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  would i didn't ask for it to happen but i got this feeling i had to do something
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.760]  but before i even released the email i started contacting the other people
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.800]  that were on there and i'm asking them hey don't you
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:52.680]  think this is weird that we got this email and now he's dead
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.040]  like are you guys at buzzfeed gonna do anything about this
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.720]  and then the response i got was you know about this question mark question mark
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.320]  and then that was it and i kept emailing them back so what are we
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.280]  going to do nothing so i started asking around you
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.680]  know i asked my mom for some advice i was like you know
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.840]  should i should i say something and my mom's like i don't say anything she's
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.120]  like that's some scary stuff i thought about it for a while and i was just
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.880]  kind of like you know my gut tells me i've got to say something so i started
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:26.760]  contacting different people and you know ktla was the
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.360]  one who responded so i forwarded that email and
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.320]  now you know most people aren't thinking this is an accident anymore they're
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.760]  kind of getting that feeling that i had from the get go that's right you brought
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:41.240]  the the fact that he was going into hiding that the feds were coming after
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.520]  him they didn't want that the equation they want everybody to be scared
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:50.760]  but one guy stood up and now more and more is coming out get into
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:54.920]  i mean repeat what you said uh yesterday when we were taping in there
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.560]  for the film about you know what she told you at the funeral then versus what
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.720]  you saw and seeing it in and what you think might be going on there
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:08.440]  yeah i went up to vermont with a uh a mutual friend of mike and i's and uh
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.520]  stayed with him and uh we went to the memorial service
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.120]  and we get there and i kind of do a walkthrough you know shake his father's
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:23.240]  hand his mother's brothers and sit down and it's just kind of one of those
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.920]  sad you know it was just it was it was nice to see that many people who cared
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:30.360]  about him show up but it was just kind of a sad just
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.840]  overall show them yeah so i walked i was like i gotta get out of here so i can
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.720]  get get a water so i'm walking out and as i walk around the lease came around
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.440]  michael's wife and said staff sergeant biggs and i turned around and she goes
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.400]  come here you know i'm sitting here thinking all right this could go one of
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:48.440]  two ways this could be like uh thanks for you know bringing the
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.840]  saliva or you know this isn't in your business why did you release this
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:56.520]  i mean really could have gone either way well he sent you the email yeah
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.720]  so she actually comes up to me and she's crying she hugs me and says thank you
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.040]  she starts talking to me about how mike had spoken about me many times and i
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.640]  mean she knew more about me than i knew about her i mean she was just going
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.160]  from story to story from afghanistan and the conversations we would have and
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:15.160]  she knew everything about me you know and i would kind of put me more to calm
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:18.360]  and then you know after she wiped the tears away you know she got that that
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.040]  pitbull look and she she told me you know we're gonna find out she's like i'm
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:26.040]  gonna find out who did this and i'm you know i'm not gonna like roll over on
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.880]  this this is an accident i will find out who did this
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:33.320]  and that was pretty powerful for me she said this wasn't an accident
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.040]  yeah and and then fast forward a month later you
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.680]  yeah well then i tell her that i'm gonna go to la and do some investigating i
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.000]  want to look around and find out what's going on
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.320]  you know i had a whole checklist of things i wanted to you know cover and go
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.480]  and we have some potential suspects yeah so
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.000]  i think she was threatened but keep going so i send her that and
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.280]  at first she's like okay that's fine you know she just seemed all you know
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.160]  dandy about it it seemed like yeah whatever you know go do it you know
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.400]  that's your friend you can find out whatever you want
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.520]  you know i'm going to do what i'm doing and investigate on my side and you do
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.680]  what you want to do and then the next day i just
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.920]  i wake up and i'm like i took a nap and i had like four or five long
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.680]  text that was right after you've been on my show yeah four or five long text and

[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.440]  it i don't you know i don't want to get into it just don't do it and then i
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.160]  called because i was like you know my heart started pounding i'm like all right
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:39.400]  why the big change and uh when i called she didn't even
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.760]  answer someone else did this lady saying that it was her friend you know and i
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.120]  could kind of hair her off in the background and they were just like you
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:50.200]  know at least doesn't want you to go right now please don't do it cancel the
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:55.640]  the whole trip and so i mean you know you hear
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:00.680]  a widow you know like that and then the so you called me when it was i was in
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:04.040]  two reporters with you at least yeah and a former nsa guy who
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.800]  investigates these things and you said uh let's wait two weeks so we wait two
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.120]  weeks and i didn't even know she was going to
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.600]  be on i texted you about nine i was put my kids is
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.360]  bad i text you hey you know how are you and her doing you heard anything new
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.960]  and you go what are you talking about she's on tv right now yeah so so let's
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.960]  fast forward where are you right then when i'm texting you i was actually having
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.840]  dinner with a butter a buddy of mine spencer and uh
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.720]  you know we were just actually kind of going over some stuff i was talking
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.560]  about he was asking me you know what what are some
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.080]  new leads in the story you know have i made any progress and next thing you
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.840]  know he kind of nudges me and he's like you're not gonna like this but
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.800]  look up and i looked up at the tv and you know
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.880]  Elise jordan you know pierce morrigan and i just kind of got this
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:53.320]  sour gut feeling i was like what really and then the interview goes on and then
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:58.200]  she just seems happy she's saying this is an accident and
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.800]  i my stomach hurt i mean i pretty much paid the bill got up and left i just
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.680]  couldn't even stomach to be there and not even till the next morning that
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.080]  actually after sleeping on it did i even watch the the video on youtube
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:15.400]  it was definitely a 180 change from how she was to
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.880]  this whole other well i think clearly she was threatened
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.880]  i mean i that's the that's the prime approximation
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.920]  oh or like you said you know maybe she wants some of the things she's not
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:30.520]  investigating or something but undoubtedly a major reporter goes into
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:33.720]  hiding and is dead 24 hours later and a suspicious death with a car
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.240]  blowing up i mean this is and now the police tapes have been released with
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.920]  witnesses saying oh it's driving down the road it blows up and then goes off the
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.320]  road into a tree that's what all the other witnesses said
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.720]  yeah so it just keeps piling on i want this to be a regular crash
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.000]  i don't like no one they could come do this to me at any moment i mean it's not
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.320]  like i want this to be a government murder what are your sources saying he was
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.440]  working on well as we all know is what i
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.160]  said from the get-go was a cia more now that's coming out yeah
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.960]  so people are starting to you know come out and say that the other things as
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.560]  well were uh he was in direct contact with barrett brown
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.200]  who was arrested and what was that 2011 in dallas
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:18.040]  2012 somewhere right there because i know he's been in jail for about a year now
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.400]  um michael was talking to him that was a cia guy
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:25.000]  he was a guy that was working on project pm who was uh doing a lot of computer
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  hacking into the government that they were looking they were doing mass spying
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.600]  on americans and he kind of uncovered a lot of that and then
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.280]  they raided the fbi raided his house and put him in jail but he was also talking
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:39.560]  to a former cia guy who was in north africa who they put in prison he's talking
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.440]  to a lot of people yeah yeah i mean he had a lot of things going on but that
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:46.200]  barrett brown thing was a definitely key thing because
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.400]  he even got a copy of the warrant that had all the arresting
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:54.520]  people involved on there so i mean that that in itself
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.480]  the macrystal thing this looking into the cia all these things add up to you know
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.360]  there's a lot of people pissed off at him well uh they killed uh erin schwarz too
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.160]  undoubtedly who was really giving them trouble we're going to come back from
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:12.760]  break and i want to talk about uh why he changed because you talked
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.440]  about this yesterday you know usually he was a lot nicer on tv he wasn't as in
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.400]  the weeks before he's like we got to get him the government's evil
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.680]  we got to get together they're bad they're coming after us and he was like
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.680]  i'm gonna break something big i mean what was it think about this
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.280]  what was it he'd learned that wasn't just oh they're spying on us or something
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.680]  what had freaked him out i think it was 9-11 i i mean my gut
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.960]  tells me he broke into the big stuff and uh because that's the big i mean i
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.440]  interviewed barry jennings who was the deputy head of

[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.440]  seven they had bombs in there they told me he was dead two weeks later
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:54.040]  i mean he just dropped it and the family moved out a week later was like some
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:57.400]  witness protection deal in fact some say that he probably staged his death and

[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:52.120]  talk about i mean repeat what you said yesterday about
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:55.560]  in your own words about the change you saw in him
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:58.360]  in the weeks leading up to his death and now you said you've gone back and
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.520]  reviewed the videos i mean there was real real concern there
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:05.960]  yeah you know when when this all happened i was very suspicious of
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.400]  everything so i kind of sat down i was like i
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.240]  i need to go over a checklist i need to create how he was
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.160]  what things are happening now you know what i know and then try to start trying
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:19.800]  to put the pieces together see if any of this leads up to
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.840]  anything at the time you know this is just you know the days after
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.840]  so i got on youtube and i was like you know i think i'm gonna start looking at
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:32.120]  a lot of his recent or you know interviews from starting about a year back
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:36.680]  and then i want to start seeing them up until i watch his last one that was on
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.440]  the young turks i believe and we gotta do something they're coming for us
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.480]  yeah you know like you know the first interviews i'm watching you know he's
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:48.840]  you know he's very calm and you know you know obama is great we're doing all
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.840]  this good stuff you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know tours in it's
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:55.720]  like you know they're they're trying to keep us from
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:58.760]  you know saying what we want to say they're they're gonna come after us you
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:02.920]  know if we speak the truth you know and he just his whole
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:07.400]  person is shifted and he went from you know being this calm person to
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:10.840]  like you said apparently finding something out in that time frame leading
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:14.440]  up to his death to where he just felt like you know
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:17.720]  the press was under attack and he needed to be a hard charger
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:21.000]  he needed to you know stand up and people needed to see that
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.920]  you know it it's affecting everyone out there that's a normal response to
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:28.120]  tyranny's act like that people go oh it's so strange that's how you're supposed
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.920]  to act when your country's been overrun by crux
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.720]  what do you what does your gut tell you he was discovering i mean we know it was
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.320]  cia it was government hacking it was but i mean is that enough to make him act
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.960]  like that i mean he was working on many stories
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.240]  multiple stories of as we've said i mean any of that all together i mean the
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:48.200]  stuff with project p.m. is a big thing for me because
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.800]  all that hacking stuff to bear brown was involved in was you know bringing too
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.320]  light that the government was mass spying on
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.160]  you know reporters and all these people so i think that probably is it because
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:02.440]  he was like they're persecuting the press they're coming after us we've got
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.960]  to stand up against them yeah and so i think that probably was it from what he
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:09.560]  said on that last interview i mean that's all it could be i mean
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.280]  i'm i mean to have that kind of job to have that
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.480]  his name's out there he's a big person you know as far as you know
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:20.280]  worldwide known you know so to be to see that kind of stuff to see that our
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.920]  government's going to try to you know hush hush everyone
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.000]  that definitely you know is going to upset you and i mean that's definitely
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.800]  what happened we're going to go to brighton come back and have
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.600]  five more minutes it's been great having you here in town we'll finish up
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:37.000]  discussing that but um i'm not calling the young turks out because
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.040]  that's not what i do i'll call people out for what they
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.080]  say that's wrong but they said there were such good buddies with him
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:46.840]  they've gone with the official story like all these so-called liberals that
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.720]  were friends with this guy have just gone with the official story
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.920]  the that's some great friends they have there let me tell you some of those guys
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.400]  that work there they'll even reach out to me they're the ones that helped me
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.600]  confirm that mike had had the cops come there
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.880]  you know that people had visited them and the okay well then maybe i missed it
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.400]  have they done shows on that they haven't said anything they've just told me
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.160]  and emails you know that's what they have said that's even worse
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.600]  yeah so they're out there in la they know about all this
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.880]  and then and then they're not doing anything about it
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.360]  see that shows they're not just dumb liberals they're scared
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.960]  and if everybody gets scared of the tyrants they're going to take over
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:28.920]  don't people get that that only free people that have courage will be free

[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.680]  trying to start a fight with the young turks it just is really lonely and and
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.880]  what's scary is all the cowardice what's scary is that he was friends reportedly
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:57.640]  and hung out with those people listen if somebody kills me man my friends better
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.760]  well come out and and call for an investigation or bare minimum i mean it
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:09.800]  just so dishonorable that i should i guess debrief you better i'm not a cop or an interrogator
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.080]  it's why i don't know how to get all the info out of you you're like oh no i talked to the young
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:16.120]  turks too they you know they're people they're producers they know they're the ones that gave
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:20.120]  me this this and that they're out there with the whole investigation team and then they were
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.320]  telling you oh yeah no this is real fishy uh comments on that or comments on other tidbits people
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:35.400]  told you um that was just the the one thing that kind of helped me like get my investigation going
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.240]  in a certain direction you know when i heard that from them it was that was definitely some helpful
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.040]  helpful things for me to get on the right track i would say and like i said i don't know what they
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:49.160]  put out to the public as far as what they think happened and i'm yeah to be fair i don't follow
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.320]  all of it but i probably would have heard about it i've seen them about him they just go it's too
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:57.800]  bad what a great guy he's gone i mean i watched their memorial thing they did a nice memorial piece
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:03.240]  on him a video of all the interviews they've had and it was really good and i mean from the way that
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:09.000]  michael kind of showed passion on that show it seemed like he did feel safe there with him i mean
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.440]  well my issue is is i could say oh look at those fools having no idea what world we live in but if
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.280]  the producers like oh yeah we know about the feds and all this while the feds are on the news going
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.560]  we didn't visit him but his email says that that's happening it's just like it becomes complicit
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.640]  when when you know stuff's going on you don't say anything i was always curious as to why the fbi
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.240]  released a statement saying they weren't investigating him and that happened before i even released the
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.560]  email so how did they even know that well like you said when you were out at uh in the army
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:43.960]  stationed in uh el paso at what camp bigs that's funny same name as your army airfield yeah yeah
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.000]  that uh they said it's the safest city in the country tell folks what they'd say there's no
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.640]  crime here but the parking lot there was shootings here and then you know there was you get there
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.080]  and you have your uh incoming briefing of how el paso is and they tell you that you know exactly
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.720]  it's one of the safest cities in the u.s and don't believe all that stuff you see on the news and then
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:08.920]  you know i'm out here in the streets of u-tep university texas el paso and there's drive-by's
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.080]  that happen and i mean it's not an everyday occurrence but i mean you said heads on the ground
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:17.800]  though i mean they dig up hundreds of bodies it's unbelievable yeah there was always gang violence
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.200]  and stuff like that you know you'd hear about it the news and or they would find bodies sometimes
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:27.160]  just off to the side of the road and you know but their slogan is safest city in the u.s that's
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.560]  one reason i knew that yeah i thought that was pretty funny i'm not trying to attack el paso but
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:35.480]  that's as close to hell as you can get i mean when i've driven through there and it's all those
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.360]  weird like it's like apocalyptic all those crumbling mountains and antennas and military wreckage
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:45.400]  everywhere i mean it's weird man well this is definitely like being in kawaii i mean you i was
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.400]  scared a lot of times there i mean i told a lot of the guys when i came back from overseas i was
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.120]  like it's almost worse i'd rather go back to afghanistan i kept begging i was like let me deploy
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:04:00.840]  i'd rather be in afghanistan than be in el paso another day i mean i felt safer in afghanistan
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.480]  sometimes yeah you were saying that the apartments you stayed in were just full of fbi dea but you
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:11.000]  hear shootings in the parking lot yeah fbi had their little uh building right across the street
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  from where my apartment was and uh then on base they have something called epic el paso intelligence
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  center and that's dea fbi and all that stuff that they have there that's the safest city in america

[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.000]  town i have seen the incredible camera work you and your camera guy do and when i wanted some
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.120]  just amazing dazzling shots for the new obama deception too we've got great camera people
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.200]  here too but they were nailed down but i gotta say i think you even take the cake this looks
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:58.520]  like stuff you would see in films on discovery or history or bbc where it's all about the
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.640]  cinematography and in the last week you shot this on the east coast for us and you had your own
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:09.000]  little saga doing that uh good to have you here and tell folks what that was like well it's been
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.400]  one heck of an adventure over the last eight or nine days or whatever it's been going from
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.960]  virginia philadelphia new york uh washington dc getting all kinds of great shots for the
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:26.120]  obama deception so it's been quite the adventure we did run into a couple of snags with getting
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:31.800]  harassed and especially washington dc seems to be the place where they have issues uh with people
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.920]  using tripods so we happen to have had a couple of officers come up to us saying hey guys you
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:40.360]  know if you're going to be here you're going to have to collapse those three legs into one
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.080]  because apparently it's okay to use a monopod and not a tripod and one of the officers actually
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.200]  told me that it's because when you collapse the legs it's not going to be as clear not as steady
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.600]  of a shot and the moment you break them into three you're you're going to have a nice shot and i
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:59.320]  guess they don't want that um so we're getting a little by the way i've been there with the national
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:06.920]  film crews uh from i fc you name it they don't give permits in the city it's all a lie there's no
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:12.440]  law it's all fraud and the truth is the secret services told them it could be a missile launcher
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.440]  that's why we won't don't want tripods even if you're five miles from the white house it's just a
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.840]  way to harass people well even with the technology we have now there's image stabilizers there's
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:26.680]  things you can do to get around this stuff so it's really bureaucratic bs really uh we ran into
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:33.080]  similar things in uh new york down by the stock exchange one of the guys actually came up to us
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.440]  and said you know right in the middle of film and he walks up in front of the camera and says you
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:43.080]  know this is all copyrighted we said what is he said all of this we're like the building he said
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:48.280]  yep all of this is copyrighted we have robots that will scan the internet and we'll look for this
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:52.760]  footage and uh we may find what you're using no we have lawyers that'll sue them for that i've
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:57.560]  already had to do that with their fake robots saying my voice is owned or we can't show a building
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.960]  that's all been thrown out plus if it was a disney film wanting to rope it off and shoot it
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:07.480]  they they might want to get an agreement but still probably could beat it this is news i have we
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:11.560]  have a right to put out a documentary into the first amendment and show the stock exchange
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:16.360]  especially when they have embezzled trillions of dollars a taxpayer money exactly and what
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.600]  what about google street view i mean anybody can go on and look at this stuff online no no no no
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:24.840]  it's pure harassment yeah it's pure color law and somebody may have told that idiot that but it
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:30.440]  doesn't mean it's true and the place is filled with tourists i mean everybody around there has a camera
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:35.160]  and uh they clearly singled us out um maybe because of the tripod but singled us well that's
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.760]  like the state police kept saying you can't film the texas capital for commercial uses
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:43.560]  that finally got thrown out in court it's just people making stuff up yeah it was pure pure
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.200]  intimidation um but we basically just stood our ground i told them you know what we know we're
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:53.160]  in a public space right now we know we're allowed to film right now um and uh so they would eventually
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:58.200]  leave us alone but um we certainly had our fair share of hassles on the road from people trying
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:03.560]  to stop us from i gotta say though it's not just your camera work you guys have the eye i mean how
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.280]  did you become such a great uh photographer and a videographer and tell us tell us about your
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:15.240]  associate uh yeah i had my friend steve davies with me on this trip he's an excellent uh camera guy
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:20.360]  and um you know i kind of fell into filmmaking back when i started press for truth in 2006 and
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.480]  just really started documenting protests finding a lot of riot footage going so this is just
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.240]  you're a natural but it shows people don't think they could do stuff like this a lot of people
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:34.920]  just have native talent they should use it yeah yeah you know i just dove in head first and and
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.640]  took a stab at it and you know right going into the first film as well we knew you know we're
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:44.040]  gonna have to license some music or something so i thought hey why don't i take a stab at doing that
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.680]  as well um so i gave that a shot and ended up doing the soundtracks and all the music for all
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:55.160]  five films now because i just tried it and it seemed to work out fine so um yeah it wasn't really um
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:17:00.520]  planned i just kind of fell into this uh kind of work it's just it's just kind of organically
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:06.600]  uh developed um you were angry about losing your liberty got involved in the really smart thing
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:11.880]  made it your business to shelf fund resisting tyranny that's the free market model that the
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:17.560]  globalists are scared of that's exactly it you know and and besides uh focusing on the filmmaking
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:22.200]  i would consider myself an activist first and foremost uh investigative journalist and then
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.480]  you know uh a documentary filmmaker uh as well but first and foremost i would consider myself
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:33.240]  an activist so we do a lot of videos as well not not just full-length feature films um but
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:37.800]  shorter kind of videos for youtube just to expose some of the things that are going on around in
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:42.040]  this world that that learning about let's talk about your five films we carry most of them
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:46.680]  my favorite is the one on the north american union that's a great film to give somebody to
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:51.400]  explain how these corporations are taking over we're not being conquered by the russians or
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.600]  the chinese were being conquered by the new world order i tried that one's united we fall um that
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.840]  took us about two years to make that one we interviewed you know members of the bill deberg
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:05.720]  group members of the council on foreign relations guys in the trilateral commission um basically
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:12.360]  getting both sides of uh of uh the the issue here um to have a fair and balanced film so people can
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:17.160]  make up their own minds about whether or not this north american union concept is something that
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:21.240]  people are going to want to go for because it's being pushed down our throats right now especially
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:26.840]  with uh integrating all the securities at the borders with and you got them to admit things in
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:31.640]  there they were upset about later i mean you got some amazing admissions yeah well the the trick
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.640]  there is to kind of play into their ego in the beginning of the uh you know i've read all your
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:39.800]  books i've been following your work and then they feel good about it and then you wait to hit them up
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.600]  with the harder questions until you know halfway through the interview when the cameras are already
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:50.200]  rolling and then you get those natural reactions from the from the tough questions so um we were
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.960]  able to to get a lot of good information out of these guys because they didn't really know where
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:19:00.600]  we were coming from folks everybody has got to get the film united we fall it's available in
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:05.960]  four store dot com and it just reminds me how many great films are out there how great your films are

[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.200]  with the work you're doing and and the rest of your team and but it just shows
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.080]  that i mean i saw yourself immediately looked really good i was like wow i wish i was a good
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:01.320]  film filmmaker like that and then it just got better and better and i'm just it's got to feel good
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:08.600]  and satisfying to have success from working hard i mean i just that's what i admire is is people
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:12.520]  that are really taking their passion for liberty and putting it to the enemy what is your overall
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:17.480]  view of the state of the world right now overall view of the state of the world well things are
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:22.360]  certainly getting worse before they're gonna get better and that's why we're putting so much effort
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:27.480]  and so much time into into exposing this information getting this stuff out through the medium of video
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:32.520]  which i find is the way to go i mean not a lot of people are reading these days a lot of people
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:38.200]  are looking for information online they're hungry for this information and youtube seems to be the
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:43.160]  place to go so that's why i've kind of been focusing my energies on on creating videos that get people
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:47.400]  thinking putting this stuff out on youtube so people can see some of the things that they're
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:52.680]  simply not getting from the mainstream media and that's just basically what we absolutely and we've
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:56.840]  been so successful on youtube they are doing algorithms and stuff to try to block us now
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:01.320]  the answer is everybody's got to get our info and get it out to everybody your info my info
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.800]  let's show one of these clips of the military coming over to you this was at the big station
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.040]  the train station right in new york yeah yeah i went up to document some of these military guys
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:15.560]  walking around um phil again you know just patrolling uh new york grand central station
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:19.320]  and i walk up to the one of the guys and he happens to recognize me says hey press for truth
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:23.400]  i've seen your stuff and i said oh really what see that's an example the military's more weight
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:28.360]  than anybody yeah i'm saying the new water better better get robots quick let's go to this clip let's
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  go to this clip here it is
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  there comes the military
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.360]  i think i've seen you one time
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.360]  oh really
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.400]  what'd you think of uh what do you think of it
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:53.320]  i guess depends on what you saw yeah well pretty nice yeah yeah yeah you know that's good there's
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.720]  so much background noise and and and you guys weren't shooting for sound you were shooting
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:01.800]  for the image you said the little uh internal mic on it but you can hear him say no i've seen your
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.000]  stuff press for truth and then you asked him you know what he thought he said hey turn your
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.480]  camera off and i'll tell you yeah he basically said he looked like he wanted to talk to me about
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.240]  some of the stuff but he said yeah i can't i can't really because you got the camera going there and
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:17.160]  you know you're you're rolling right now so i can't tell you what you thought but i kind of got the
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:22.760]  sense that he was not not a fan but that he liked this stuff so i don't know if maybe he was awake
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.760]  and maybe that's why he couldn't talk about it i i'm no i mean i mean the guys that buried my great
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:31.000]  uncle two days ago turned out the half of them were waving at me when they drove off were listeners
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.720]  i mean it's just amazing i'm telling you the military is our biggest audience yeah uh what's
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.280]  the next clip uh well there's a couple clips from uh when we were there's one in washington where
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:44.360]  they're telling us to collapse the tripod and then that guy down at the stock market exchange
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.200]  telling us this is all copyrighted footage again it's very off the cuff it just kind of let's go
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.320]  to the next one and i'll describe what it is let's go ahead and play the next one maybe it's
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:28:01.960]  one more display hello this is in dc okay well we're pretty much done yeah we're pretty much done
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.040]  and she's nice compared to what they did to us i mean it's extreme at you
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:16.760]  and again this is mainly for tv viewers to see this radio listeners can't really make it out
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:21.400]  okay there's a lot of people he wasn't filming for sound now all right let's go to the new york
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:26.280]  stock exchange what does he do they do once oh yeah this is it right here
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:40.040]  hey i want to explain something to this guy right now uh you know uh sir we're news gathering a b
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.360]  just because you go pay a company with a bot to go around and make fake claims on people
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.480]  that's when you get a real lawsuit and i know you work at the new york stock exchange you think
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:56.680]  you're god it's in the news today that uh unsealed court documents reveal that banks told trillions
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.000]  worth of homes yeah banks are taking people's homes that were paid for so i mean i guess maybe
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.600]  maybe we're not allowed to film i mean maybe we're not allowed to live unless the new york stock
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:10.520]  exchange says so dan either way this footage will be coming out and i can't wait for people to see
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.760]  all this stuff in the obama deception part two so we're not going to let them intimidate us we
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.080]  certainly didn't there and we certainly are never going to moving forward like you said we
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:23.960]  are gathering news this is reporting on events that are taking place in the world and people
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.440]  deserve to see absolutely what's going on by the way i had the federal reserve in san antonio to
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:32.280]  a fake claim on a second couldn't show their building and i had to file stuff on that i mean

[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.640]  health system dr uh farber believes many people have been wrongly diagnosed with mental disorders

[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:04.280]  you on with us today you know i saw an article today saying i'm a schizophrenic uh in the newspaper
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:11.320]  uh actually uh they were saying i'm delusional that we have a corrupt government psychology today
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:18.120]  uh had a psychology actually he was a psychologist who worked for the obama administration and
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:24.600]  clinton uh come out and say he believes i'm mentally ill uh because i believed in nsa spying
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:28.600]  i believed in secret police i believed in india a that was two years ago now all that stuff's
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.920]  admitted and i guess if i was in nazi germany 65 years ago and said hitler was a bad guy they
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:39.560]  probably would have locked me up too saying i was crazy he used psychiatry and and corrupt
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.880]  psychologists as well so thank you for joining us sir uh you're really one of the leading experts
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:49.880]  on this we also have your amazing book the spiritual gift of madness the failure of psychiatry
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:54.120]  we don't sell it but it's available everywhere we should be selling it tell folks about your
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:59.080]  awakening and what we face and where all this is going and then separately i want to ask you
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:05.560]  about the fact that i do see not what i'd call so much mental illness but people that are really
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:12.680]  screwed up who are nothing but pure kind of a narcissist obsessed with with status obsessed
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:18.440]  with sitcoms drama kind of the madison avenue shallowness that i think robs their humanity
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.440]  because because i do think there is such a thing as screwed up people uh obviously and some people
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:28.120]  that have chemical imbalances but what breakdown your awakening and your stance uh on on on what's
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:34.760]  really going on in the human brain okay but what you said alex reminded me exactly of uh of how the
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:41.720]  psychiatric system was used in the soviet union to uh lock up dissidents and they were called
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:49.720]  schizophenics and to call you uh a leader in the movement against uh the development of an oppressive
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:56.040]  state that deprives americans of their constitutional rights shows in fact that the psychiatric
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:05.080]  institute is not a scientific uh process the process of their their psychiatric bible the dsm
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:11.400]  five and i have been saying this for years that there's really no difference between the way uh
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:17.160]  psychiatry you know little differences but basically it functions as a tool of suppression
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:25.720]  in america as it did in in the soviet union and this has become uh uh for example um you
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:33.240]  were called up i myself uh one time i was a a critic for example of the burgeoning child welfare
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:39.160]  system in in the nineties and i went into court for a there were people who had their children
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:45.320]  i know you talked about this before many people people in new york who had their children taken
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:51.640]  away by the child welfare system and it's just one example and when they protest and if they speak
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:58.600]  of well i think that the court is collaborating with the uh child welfare immediately they got labeled
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:07.400]  paranoid and i when i went into court as an expert witness for a person uh at the end the the other
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:14.040]  side the lawyers for the other side the child welfare tried to prevent me from uh giving my
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:20.280]  expert uh testimony on my client who had her children her child taken away from her the judge
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:25.720]  let me testify but at the end of the whole thing it was me and another social worker and we both
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:34.200]  testified that uh the woman's name with dandrea uh was perfectly sane um now she had was going on
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:40.680]  record as being distrustful of the child welfare system and of the court system well even by their
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:48.440]  own standards uh in the dsm four at the time paranoia is not a distrust of the government
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:54.920]  it's a pervasive distrust as it was defined but what they did was in order to disqualify my
[02:42:54.920 --> 02:43:00.840]  testimony they said that i myself had been inducted into the patients uh my patient's
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:10.120]  delusional system so we see how psychiatry has been used as a tool of political suppression
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.840]  by the way urnist himingway for those that don't know said the fbi was harassing him and tapping
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:19.400]  his phones was declassified about a decade ago that indeed they were harassing him and tapping
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:26.680]  his phones they had him grabbed an electroshock destroying his wonderful mind uh and then he
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:31.240]  and then he later committed suicide because he was so depressed so so that's an example
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:37.000]  of how these people operate and it's ridiculous the new york child welfare system is on record
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:45.320]  testing lethal drugs on kids until they die you better be paranoid of that yes uh we have a terrible
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:52.840]  robert whitaker is documented in his books and peter bragan uh what we have because of the growing
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:44:00.440]  psychiatric pharmaceutical industry a complex we have one fourth of of american women are now on
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:05.720]  psychiatric drugs that don't do any good antidepressants and so-called antipsychotics which
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:12.360]  cause all kinds of there is the the man this psychiatrist did a study an unnerving curse
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:18.840]  wrote a book on it showed that actually the uh antidepressants don't do any better than placebo
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:24.600]  by the way i've i've read your writings and i and i know about you you're obviously hyper
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:28.600]  intelligent what is it i'm not bragging about myself either not that i'm super intelligent
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:36.920]  but i'm not dumb people think of you are electric alive smart inventive that that's weird i see the
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:43.000]  general public acting like zombies and then if i act excited about something about art or anything
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.960]  it's like weird like why are you upset or or why are you excited like i'm only supposed to get
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:55.320]  excited about football or something yes uh increasingly people that's not you i'm going to
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:01.480]  take it away people are labeled uh uh uh manic i mean they have now you know brought in the
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.760]  definition of manic in such a way plus they try to get these people like children who show
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:14.840]  an enthusiasm and in the classroom and uh they uh uh bruce levine the psychologist has written
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:22.120]  about this who uh are often instead of uh they they're not interested in the classwork but if
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:29.000]  you test them intellectually and cognitively they do as well if not better than so-called normal
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:35.560]  children on all the cognitive tests except one route learning and memorization so you know they
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:43.400]  they don't have the same uh uh tolerance of the kind of pablum that they're taught that's right
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:50.680]  they reject pavlovian programming mm-hmm and they get labeled i mean the the clearest example of it
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:59.560]  of the of the fallacious nature of psychiatric labeling of course was the uh 1977 vote uh and
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:05.560]  in the american psychiatric association when overnight homosexuality went from being classified
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:12.840]  as a disease to an illness now you don't vote you don't he find you know especially was voting on
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:21.320]  whether um cancer is an illness or not um and yet this is the way psychiatry proceeds and even the
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:29.080]  uh the the the um the editor of the psychiatric bible uh this diagnosed the consistent manual
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:38.600]  of mental diseases uh who uh wrote wrote in uh the the 1980 edition has become a a critic of the
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:45.480]  other recent edition and he speaks about how we can save normality the whole imperial medicalization
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:50.680]  of normality and a bonza for the former so these gentlemen and a few women mostly gentlemen get
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:57.000]  together and decide what is sane and what is insane exactly it's like some type of papal council
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.560]  deciding on what in the bible is true or not and then they'll contradict what they said 10 years
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:08.040]  before showing that it's all just their opinions and then who finances them but big pharma to where
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  they're now saying i've seen these questionnaires to 11 year old girls do you ever get upset you
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:18.280]  ever have anxiety do you ever cry well you need you need serotonin reuptake inhibitors my darling
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:26.280]  yes and this has spread to the point uh where where francis talks about the medicalization
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:31.720]  and normality you know not not to make you that not i became a critic of the of the of the system a
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:37.480]  few years after my phd and at that time there was still talk about the rosin hand experimented
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:43.240]  people still know about that one because i swear to you that was same thing would happen today they
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:50.760]  made no progress that was when uh david rosin hand the psychologist wanted to test uh how how good
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:59.240]  his fellow colleagues and in in mental hospitals and psychiatric wards were at detecting schizophrenia
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:06.840]  so he and a couple of his about 12 confederates of his uh got into the loony bin by pretending they
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:12.760]  were hearing sounds they didn't actually say voices they all got in they were dog no schizophrenic
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:20.920]  said they couldn't get out they acted normal they could not convince the psychiatrist that they were
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:26.120]  were normal and they were examined by psychologists and psychiatrists and each one said well you
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:30.840]  they had a terrible check when they interviewed them they say well the terrible chartered actually
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:37.800]  produced a predisposition towards schizophrenia so you know americans should not put their trust in
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:43.480]  doctors who can't tell who's saying and who's insane now that was an experiment done in the
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:50.440]  70s but i find the same thing today i my first client was labeled uh schizophrenic he heard a voice
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.240]  and this is what i say may have pride because uh the may have pride movement says people can be
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:02.520]  different without being mentally ill without being stigmatized without meaning there is
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:07.880]  something wrong with them and that was done so beautifully by the development of the mental
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:13.560]  patients liberation movement in the 1970s when he was one of these people that were supposed to be
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:18.440]  that's the other side of the rosin hand experiment these were people who did have voices who did
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:24.280]  have breakdowns but became political activists and say you can't do the to the government
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:30.280]  and to the psychiatric establishment you cannot make us take these drugs because they are killing
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:35.880]  us well let me ask you a question uh what because so many times i see this toxic waste
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:40.200]  and chemicals associated with things like schizophrenia the old mad hatter thing people
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:45.640]  working in factories uh you would have higher ratios of it but but but but i am seeing more
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:50.920]  more and i don't really study psychology but what i would call narcissistic breakdowns
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:56.440]  where where people just have lost touch of what reality is but the system doesn't even call them
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:03.880]  insane that's kind of like a manufactured corporate weirdness but then they don't call that crazy
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:09.720]  i see people going along with the system as mentally ill that's exactly what rd lang said
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:15.560]  hey are you for me with ronald david lang who uh what became became a celebrity in the 60s when
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.920]  he said that normal people are crazy he said they the well adjusted bomber pilot this was during the
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:26.440]  war in vietnam now they have but now they have been dropping bombs without any pilots in the planes
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.880]  on innocent people he said the well adjusted bomber pilot is actually a greater threat to the
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:37.320]  survival of the species than the schizophrenic who thinks there's a bomb inside him so i mean there
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:43.080]  are people in positions of power and authority in america who are doing terrible things who are
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:47.960]  but i mean they're responsible in the psychiatric pharmaceutical complex for putting all these
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:54.200]  children on psychiatric drugs so that i that i don't uh i don't defend i don't excuse i don't
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:59.880]  forgive uh that the number of children who are being labeled attention deficit and even like put
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.680]  on anti psychotics to be since the and for those that don't know that that causes major brain
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:09.400]  damage that's in the news i'm no doctor like you but don't those any psychotics really hurt the brain
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:16.040]  they do they cause uh parkinson's like system called tartar dyskinesia now they they claim the
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.640]  new ones don't but that's because the tests were really rigged but um they caused diabetes um
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:27.480]  and they still do cause tartar dyskinesia uh if you're on them for a long period of time which is
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:31.240]  i did what about this because i know you run about this the really smart people i've known
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:37.080]  like math petitions with 180 iqs and and incredible musicians and people that it seems that and
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:41.640]  throughout history this has been done by the ancients what they call insanity is generally
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:47.400]  paired with hyperintelligence and creativity i mean it is is that a fable or have you seen that
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:51.960]  i have seen that every uh that's why i um i support the man pride moment i thought that
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:52:00.200]  was such a brilliant idea when sasha the brow in 90 in 2005 took a different before that you had the
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:05.160]  mental patients liberation moment which was once again led by group of people who were supposed
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:09.560]  to be incompetent and capable because they were all labeled schizophrenic the majority of them
[02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:16.680]  he gave it a different twist and said a lot of us are hypercreative and we have hyper unusual ways
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:22.120]  of thinking about the world and i i have found over and over again that the person that gets labeled
[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:26.920]  today they get labeled bipolar and when i was in school in the 80s they were labeled schizophrenic
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:33.000]  um they tend to be more creative you will find genetically that uh there's a higher
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:40.280]  amount of uh what's called off well i'll call it off the wall thinking uh discrep and thinking but
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:45.560]  it's really the basis of creativity whereas the normal people uh we would call i would call them
[02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:50.600]  sociopaths i mean because here they are doing these things often or where they're more like
[02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:57.000]  they're more like robots programmable demonic robots right who will i mean i use the example
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.960]  but just it's culturally they're not even like real people they just do whatever they're told
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:09.480]  yes they have no conscience they you're right they're like cobs in the in the machine and uh
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:15.560]  line talked about it he in in the 60s when he said the crazy people were really uh beginning to see
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:19.640]  the people labeled schizophrenic were beginning to see the light and they may be lost and they may
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:25.400]  be having troubles but they were spiritually exploring things whereas the normal people the
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:30.360]  psychologists the ones who made the rules the one who say whether homosexuality is an illness or
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:36.600]  whether whether it's not the one who today are putting all our youngsters on psychiatric drugs
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:42.760]  that are uh and they call them antipsychotics uh that in itself that kind of they are cogs in
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:47.960]  the wheel but what's disturbing as you say is is that they do it without any conscience just as if
[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:53.320]  they're machines just as if they're robots well listen in the in the five six minutes we've got
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:59.320]  left i want to get back up for a full hour sometime to take calls uh i see the artificiality of the
[02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:05.800]  gmo the vaccines all the studies the brain damage the 10 000 percent increases in pediatric cancers
[02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:11.240]  thousands percent Tylen diabetes we know this modern system's killing us and then when we say
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:17.560]  something's wrong in society let's even find the answer we're told you're crazy now the people saying
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:22.840]  this they they know that opposition to corrupt authority isn't mentally ill i mean they they
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:30.520]  would label the founding fathers or gov or voltaire is mentally ill yes but well they have the uh
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:38.680]  the definition oppositional defiant disorder and and uh and so uh they label and that's why compared
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:44.920]  it to russia you have young people who aren't going along with the the system who may you know uh
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:50.200]  don't find school boring but will come home and spend hours on the computer they get labeled
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:54.920]  attention deficit disorder are more likely the people that get those labels are the ones who
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:01.720]  are resistant to authority so there's a political dimension to this whole whole thing and um even
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:08.840]  even even the the the awareness that these drugs are killing them because for example david oaks who
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:14.680]  was the founder of uh mind freedom which is the largest uh mental patients liberation organization
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:19.800]  in the in the country when they first gave him this drug he had a terrible reaction to it
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:25.640]  as most people i do now and i i know do to these after that's why the the establishment is always
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:31.240]  trying to push the drugs on them and say well we need to do this to protect america that's always
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:37.160]  the always the line you know like the national security association we're doing this to protect you
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:42.920]  and you know they they always can find an example of someone who did something threatening and for
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:48.680]  that one person who did something sure sure well my dad going to ut uh you know did his residency
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:53.080]  step part of it at the state mental hospital and he only worked there a few months it couldn't do it
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:58.520]  anymore he said the people running it were 10 times crazier than the people that were in it
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:05.240]  down here uh off shoal creek in austin texas yeah and they're destroyed by the drugs when they want
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:10.760]  to get off the drugs that is called an illness too did you know that alex said just the fact that
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:16.200]  they want to get off the drugs is considered an illness they call it non-compliance there they
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:20.920]  say they they don't really they're authoritarians like there are some problems out there but they're
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:28.520]  authoritarians just using this as a power grab and it's an excuse to be uh abusive because they
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:34.920]  want to carry out these dreams of being sadist exactly and and because they were awarded for it
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:42.200]  now in 1978 the american psychiatric association got together and said we are facing and you can
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:47.320]  read this in my book and in peter bragan's psychiatrist peter bragan's book we are facing too
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:53.480]  much competition from uh social workers and psychologists who are doing therapy um the only
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:59.240]  way that we can survive and flourish is if we accept money they had laws and rules against
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:06.520]  accepting money there were some ethical boundaries there are no ethical boundaries i i like in 1978
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:12.680]  when peter bragan warned against that it was like eisenhower warning against the um the military
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:19.000]  industrial complex because just as we have a military industrial complex that needs wars
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:25.720]  that profits from wars so we have a psychiatric industrial complex that profits from putting
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:33.480]  our children on these awful uh so-called medications that are really destructive drugs
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:38.200]  absolutely well i mentioned children but it's you know adults as well well yeah i mean as you
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.920]  know almost every mass shooter's been on these and their answer is more psychiatric stuff
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:49.000]  more kids on drugs and the insert says can make you go totally delusional and kill people almost
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:54.600]  almost every one of the school shooter was on the uh ssri's the prosact type as the doctor
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:58:00.920]  that studies this what's happening there which i mean why does shrimp swim up to fish and let them
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:07.480]  be eaten when they're on prozac's i mean what is it doing we don't we don't know it's a very strange
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:14.520]  drug because it produces this class of drugs that was lauded by uh the uh peter kramer and then makes
[02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:19.800]  some people go crazy now if you read in the paper about a guy who kills his girlfriend it may not be
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:25.080]  on prozac but if he kills his mother he kills his kids you look closer and then you're gonna find
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:30.760]  that guy is on ssri's they should have been banned by the fda but no kidding stay there let's be
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:33.960]  five more minutes this is too important i gotta get this guy back on no no that's true
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:37.720]  any cop i talk to if somebody let somebody's killed her children for no reason they know

[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:34.440]  gift of madness is very good very thought-provoking the other side of the story look there's no
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:39.960]  doubt psychiatry and psychology is predatory now there's some good people in it that do help folks
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:44.120]  and a lot of them have spoken out i mean so there's some truth to all of it there's truth to art
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:50.520]  types and union psychology there's a lot of good stuff there and my my my humble view and and
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:55.640]  there are good counselors that there's some good there but the thing directing at his big pharma
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.400]  and they know full well what these drugs are doing i know so many people that have car wrecks
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:07.080]  and have a hurt back and they go i think you're depressed you uh here's the the the hospital
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:12.760]  psychology you know you need a we need to put you on lou vox or whatever it is and i know people
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:16.520]  that go on this stuff that are totally different people now if somebody's completely out of their
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:21.800]  mind or whatever trying to kill people psychotic yeah whatever but the point is it's definitely
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:26.600]  predatory it's the new form of slavery and i wanted to give you some final comments dr seph
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:31.960]  farber on this subject because if we live in a country where they can have psychology today
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:37.400]  because i mean i run a crew of over 50 people i'm i've worked 17 hours a day 16 hours a day
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:41.960]  i'm a smart hardworking guy and and and i know what i'm talking about and break national news
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:47.320]  stories every week and they say i'm mentally ill we know this is a political weapon right
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:53.560]  yes they did that the barry goldwater and then in 19 uh when he ran for president in 1960 this
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:59.960]  psychiatrist got together and the thing is they do it to people as you say you if they can do it to
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:04.680]  you think of the poor guy who just doesn't want to do his homework or who isn't getting along with
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:13.400]  his teacher or something this is a a symbiotic relationship between psychiatrists as you say
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:21.560]  it's a parasitical system it's like the military industrial complex it needs diseases now what
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:26.760]  bob whittaker who wrote a book his show now you look at all the statistics and in fact
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:33.320]  so-called schizophrenics and bi-polars are much much much more likely to get better and recover
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:38.920]  if they don't take the drugs now i'm not saying let me give a warning here now please uh you
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:44.040]  know anyone listening to me do not get off these drugs don't just flush them down the toilet they
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:50.680]  are highly addictive drugs and you must get off them slowly but the point is what you see if the
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:56.520]  people who are on these drugs after for the so-called antipsychotics for 10 after two three
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:02.600]  four five years and no longer functioning it turns them into zombies and we find that the people who
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.840]  have made a full recovery and this is without even the best of treatment uh uh when we have the best
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:13.880]  of treatment like we had in satiria house and some of these other places then they get better now i
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:21.080]  have my first client in new york when i came back after my phd was labeled schizophrenic i got in a
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:25.080]  battle with his mother that what you got out of that she was calling up the clinic wanted to get
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:31.080]  me fired because i told him john you don't need these drugs and and what happened to him alex
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:35.560]  i didn't know what happened to him because i got fired from the clinic for encouraging people to
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:40.760]  get off of drugs 10 years later he called me this is a guy that everybody said was schizophrenic
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:48.040]  for seven years and he's not alone there many people like him and today and he got off the drugs
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:52.920]  slowly or maybe a little too quick and it was hard but he'd been off the drugs for 10 years and his
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:58.680]  parents weren't talking to him and now it's 25 years that this person who was labeled a chronic
[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:04.440]  schizophrenic has been off the drugs and this is what happens also in the people in the mental
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:09.800]  patients liberation movement well what about a beautiful mind that's his story he got to where
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:16.120]  he can handle it without drugs in fact that's a perfect example alex because you see again
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:21.720]  how big money corrupts because when they made the movie they have him saying in the movie these new
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:27.480]  drugs were what saved me whereas he said in real life if you read the book he got off the drugs
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:33.240]  completely couldn't spend them new drugs or old drugs the the psychiatric pharmaceutical
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:38.360]  complex has such power in american society today no i read that book and i noticed the movie it was
