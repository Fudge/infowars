[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  In for wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.720]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:26.720 --> 00:30.720]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:30.720 --> 00:36.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36.720 --> 00:38.720]  It's April 28th on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:38.720 --> 00:41.720]  We've got so much huge breaking news coming up in the next segment.
[00:41.720 --> 00:44.720]  And I want to run a special report about by John Bowne, the band I video,
[00:44.720 --> 00:53.720]  that the mask is almost entirely off and then will be right back to kick off the main transmission.
[00:53.720 --> 00:58.720]  If you want freedom, take pride in your country.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.720]  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.720]  And if you want peace, love your nation.
[01:08.720 --> 01:15.720]  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country.
[01:15.720 --> 01:22.720]  First, the future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots.
[01:22.720 --> 01:24.720]  For me, this is all really old news.
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.720]  But I got to remember, hey, you've got a lot of folks doing it every day.
[01:28.720 --> 01:29.720]  They didn't know the basis.
[01:29.720 --> 01:31.720]  People are like, how did Jones know this?
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.720]  I love how they attributed to, like, all these psychic powers and things.
[01:35.720 --> 01:42.720]  No, it's attributed to reading the globalist documents and then watching it all come through later.
[01:42.720 --> 01:44.720]  This is not rocket science, folks.
[01:44.720 --> 01:48.720]  You just got to admit to yourself that it's happening and then say,
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.720]  do I just want to be like concrete it rolls over?
[01:51.720 --> 01:53.720]  Do I just want to be this passive thing that goes along with us?
[01:53.720 --> 01:56.720]  And I really don't think you're that.
[01:56.720 --> 02:03.720]  And I see a whole army of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny.
[02:03.720 --> 02:05.720]  Fight and you may die.
[02:05.720 --> 02:06.720]  Run.
[02:06.720 --> 02:13.720]  And you'll live at least a while.
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.720]  I'm dying in your beds many years from now.
[02:18.720 --> 02:25.720]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance?
[02:25.720 --> 02:32.720]  Just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives,
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.720]  but they'll never take our freedom.
[02:38.720 --> 02:39.720]  Are you going to be ready?
[02:39.720 --> 02:40.720]  Are you going to say no?
[02:40.720 --> 02:41.720]  Are you going to stand up for yourself?
[02:41.720 --> 02:43.720]  That's really the big question.
[02:43.720 --> 02:44.720]  I'm a gorilla.
[02:44.720 --> 02:46.720]  I've got my primitive sides.
[02:46.720 --> 02:50.720]  And I get mad at our enemies and I get hyped up to have the strength to crush them.
[03:16.720 --> 03:27.720]  But you know, I'm transcending that and so are you, because as long as we've got our
[03:27.720 --> 03:33.720]  eyes on God and justice and love, we will automatically transcend them as Christ did
[03:33.720 --> 03:37.720]  and our spirits will resurrect above whatever they do to these bodies.
[03:37.720 --> 03:43.720]  And I've seen, just as Martin Luther King talked about the future and that vision of
[03:43.720 --> 03:48.720]  us together, with our children living an incredible loving future together.
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.720]  And all the attempts that we see to turn us against each other, all this great evil
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.720]  that's unfolding is only because evil wants to keep us from God and keep us from exercising
[03:59.720 --> 04:07.720]  our deed, our paperwork, our promise, our guarantee this planet is an egg, a seed.
[04:07.720 --> 04:15.720]  The enemy knows that, but as the energy of Christ is poured into the planet, the enemy
[04:15.720 --> 04:22.720]  is going to try to block that and is going to run around like cockroaches scared to death.
[04:22.720 --> 04:24.720]  And it can be disgusting.
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.720]  It can be horrible to watch them vomit their poison and spew their lies and engage in all
[04:29.720 --> 04:31.720]  their psychotic behavior.
[04:31.720 --> 04:34.720]  But don't let them get you down with their poison.
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.720]  Don't even let them get you the point of hating them.
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.720]  Forgive them and pray that God can change their heart before they're destroyed forever.
[04:42.720 --> 04:49.720]  The layout of this is getting ready and admitting the universe is big and deep and broad and
[04:49.720 --> 04:55.720]  long and strong and getting into it and stop being afraid and looking down at the dirt.
[04:55.720 --> 04:59.720]  We used to be staring into your grandmother's eyes and up in the universe.
[04:59.720 --> 05:04.720]  It was our number two best-selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.720]  the supply chain and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric
[05:08.720 --> 05:09.720]  formula.
[05:09.720 --> 05:12.720]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.720]  That's why this one's white.
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.720]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[05:15.720 --> 05:16.720]  Get it packaged.
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.720]  Get it to us.
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.720]  Get it shipped out because it's amazing for information.
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.720]  It's amazing for your immune system.
[05:21.720 --> 05:23.720]  It's amazing on so many fronts.
[05:23.720 --> 05:25.720]  Normal turmeric is a three to five percent and it's great.
[05:25.720 --> 05:26.720]  People love it.

[06:13.720 --> 06:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, April 28th of the year.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.720]  It's 2021.
[06:18.720 --> 06:20.720]  I'm going to be live here the next four hours.
[06:20.720 --> 06:22.720]  I'll be hosting a fourth hour as well.
[06:22.720 --> 06:25.720]  And I do intend to double the phones up today.
[06:25.720 --> 06:28.720]  And so we will get that done, especially in the fourth hour.
[06:28.720 --> 06:32.720]  We have a lot of big guests here on the Alex Jones transmission today.
[06:32.720 --> 06:36.720]  It's big national news that Nick Fuentes was put on a no fly list.
[06:36.720 --> 06:39.720]  He was told that by American and by Delta.
[06:39.720 --> 06:42.720]  Then national news wanted proof.
[06:42.720 --> 06:49.720]  He went back last night and shot footage of Southwest telling him he is banned from
[06:49.720 --> 06:52.720]  boarding any flight on a no fly list.
[06:52.720 --> 06:54.720]  This is a big deal.
[06:54.720 --> 06:55.720]  He did not enter the capital.
[06:55.720 --> 06:57.720]  He did not call for any of the capital.
[06:57.720 --> 07:01.720]  He is a very well-spoken, I'd say, mainline classic conservative.
[07:01.720 --> 07:02.720]  So they call him a Nazi.
[07:02.720 --> 07:04.720]  They call Tucker Carlson a Nazi.
[07:04.720 --> 07:05.720]  They call me that.
[07:05.720 --> 07:06.720]  It's just incredible.
[07:06.720 --> 07:09.720]  And this is a true turning point for our country.
[07:09.720 --> 07:11.720]  And the left is now celebrating online.
[07:11.720 --> 07:16.720]  In fact, some quote journalists are saying the word is, is that I'm on a no fly list as well.
[07:16.720 --> 07:22.720]  And so today or tomorrow, I'm going to, I guess, book a flight to Dallas or something.
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.720]  It's just a 35-minute flight just to test it.
[07:24.720 --> 07:29.720]  And so I will be going to the Austin Merchant Airport and finding out for myself.
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.720]  This is just next level training.
[07:31.720 --> 07:40.720]  We also have Daniel McCarthy, who is one of the top experts on the recount that is going on an earnest
[07:40.720 --> 07:49.720]  America County, Arizona, for the election fraud investigation that is in the third hour open phones, 100% in the fourth hour.
[07:49.720 --> 07:53.720]  In fact, probably halfway into the third hour, I'll open the phones up.
[07:53.720 --> 07:59.720]  After we have Daniel McCarthy give us an update and breaking news, a lot of big news on that front.
[07:59.720 --> 08:01.720]  Okay.
[08:01.720 --> 08:03.720]  I'm over-prepared for this broadcast.
[08:03.720 --> 08:06.720]  And I think lately I've really turned the heat up on the New World Order.
[08:06.720 --> 08:08.720]  I've been covering more than I normally do.
[08:08.720 --> 08:10.720]  I'm committed to do that.
[08:10.720 --> 08:18.720]  And so I'm going to have to really space all this news out and make sure that I cover each big piece per segment so I get to everything.
[08:18.720 --> 08:21.720]  But I told you Joe Rogan's a good guy.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.720]  I've known him 22 years.
[08:23.720 --> 08:25.720]  I told you Tucker Carlson's a good guy.
[08:25.720 --> 08:30.720]  He first wanted to come visit with us and said he was starting to wake up and thought I was right and that he'd been wrong 10 years ago.
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.720]  I don't take pleasure in him saying he was wrong and I helped wake him up.
[08:34.720 --> 08:39.720]  And now I think really helped wake him up and now he sees clearer than I do.
[08:39.720 --> 08:46.720]  But that's one of the things I'm proud of is that I was instrumental in deprogramming Tucker Carlson.
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.720]  I think that's the right word.
[08:48.720 --> 08:49.720]  He thought I was crazy.
[08:49.720 --> 08:50.720]  He thought I was nuts.
[08:50.720 --> 08:52.720]  Then he thought well, I was just a little bit off but right about some things.
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.720]  Then he found out that my worldview was absolutely basically dead on.
[08:57.720 --> 09:02.720]  And so he's come out and he's being demonized for saying, hey, if the vaccine works, why do I got to wear a mask?
[09:02.720 --> 09:06.720]  Or if the vaccine works for you, why do I have to have a vaccine?
[09:06.720 --> 09:13.720]  Well, they now admit that the vaccines don't work and you need five to 10 of them a year and they're super dangerous and they're hurting a bunch of people.
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.720]  Joe Rogan looks at the studies and says, young people die less from COVID than the flu.
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.720]  Why should somebody, you know, below the age of 45 take it?
[09:22.720 --> 09:33.720]  You have bigger autoimmune responses when you do take these mRNA vaccines and the other vector virus delivery systems like J&J and of course AstraZeneca.
[09:33.720 --> 09:35.720]  And they're getting banned all over the world.
[09:35.720 --> 09:38.720]  But the media gas lights it like you're weird if you say it.
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.720]  Or a member of parliament in Australia says, hey, people are dying all over the world from the vaccine.
[09:42.720 --> 09:44.720]  The lockdowns don't help studies.
[09:44.720 --> 09:46.720]  Boom, Facebook bans them.
[09:46.720 --> 09:52.720]  Not just Trump that's banned now, it's members of parliament in the UK, they're censoring members of Congress here.
[09:52.720 --> 09:54.720]  This is dangerous.
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.720]  And now it's no fly list that are confirmed.
[09:58.720 --> 10:02.720]  We'll play the video coming up with Nick Fuentes joins us in the second hour.
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.720]  So here's Tucker defending Joe Rogan, which is a great thing.
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.720]  Other talk show hosts generally, even if you're another conservative or another libertarian, they won't defend you because it's all business.
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.720]  It's not about business for Tucker.
[10:13.720 --> 10:15.720]  Tucker doesn't want to run for president.
[10:15.720 --> 10:17.720]  He doesn't want to be part of the power structure.
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.720]  He wants away from it.
[10:18.720 --> 10:19.720]  That's why he's so powerful.
[10:19.720 --> 10:21.720]  That's why Rogan is powerful.
[10:21.720 --> 10:22.720]  He doesn't want to be part of the power structure.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.720]  Neither do I.
[10:23.720 --> 10:25.720]  We want to be left alone.
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.720]  And the media is freaking out.
[10:27.720 --> 10:30.720]  I was top trending with Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson last night.
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.720]  Was Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Nick Fuentes, all number one, number two, number three, number four, despite all the censorship.
[10:36.720 --> 10:43.720]  And the left was panicking saying, oh my God, Carlson and Rogan are both becoming Alex Jones.
[10:43.720 --> 10:46.720]  If we're going to beat this, we're all going to become Alex Jones.
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.720]  It isn't about being Alex Jones.
[10:48.720 --> 10:50.720]  I read the documents 30 plus years ago.
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.720]  I got on there 27 years ago.
[10:52.720 --> 10:54.720]  I knew it was coming because I studied who ran things.
[10:54.720 --> 10:55.720]  I'm not that special.
[10:55.720 --> 10:59.720]  The minute you become me, that just means start looking at the facts.
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.720]  It's game over for the New World Order.
[11:03.720 --> 11:06.720]  The New World Order that's death.
[11:06.720 --> 11:08.720]  Smells like death because it is death.
[11:08.720 --> 11:09.720]  Ooh, that smell.
[11:09.720 --> 11:11.720]  We got to come back with Leonard Skinner next segment.
[11:11.720 --> 11:14.720]  So here is Tucker Carlson knocking out of the park.
[11:14.720 --> 11:18.720]  I'm going to shoot some special reports on this, but the whole thing's a fraud.
[11:18.720 --> 11:21.720]  They're creating a phobia over cold viruses.
[11:21.720 --> 11:27.720]  I mean, we've got to have you be prisoners until the cold is solved and they'll never be solved.
[11:27.720 --> 11:28.720]  Here's the report.
[11:28.720 --> 11:35.720]  If you've gotten a vaccine, why is other people's refusal to get the vaccine a problem for you?
[11:35.720 --> 11:41.720]  If the vaccine is so effective, why are the people who choose to get it mad at the people who choose not to get it?
[11:41.720 --> 11:42.720]  Huh?
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.720]  Do people who've slimmed down from gastric bypass yell at fat people on the street?
[11:47.720 --> 11:48.720]  You wouldn't think so.
[11:48.720 --> 11:50.720]  It's not really their business.
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.720]  Your body, your choice, remember?
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.720]  But your body, your choice is definitely not the standard with the COVID vaccine.
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.720]  With the COVID vaccine, it's your body MSNBC's choice.
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.720]  Watch this guy explain.
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.720]  I don't know how we get to herd immunity unless we normalize the framework around vaccine certification.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.720]  Listen, we're doing it in colleges.
[12:10.720 --> 12:11.720]  Some organizations are doing it.
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.720]  We're in a global crisis.
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.720]  We have to reach herd immunity.
[12:15.720 --> 12:22.720]  And the carrot and stick of you get the vaccine, you'll be able to participate in travel, restaurants.
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.720]  You name it, because that's frankly easier for small businesses to adhere to.
[12:27.720 --> 12:29.720]  Herd immunity?
[12:29.720 --> 12:31.720]  Boy, it seems like not so long ago.
[12:31.720 --> 12:39.720]  Maybe it was back in the 50s or like last week that using the phrase herd immunity was enough to get you yanked off the air as an anti-vaxxer.
[12:39.720 --> 12:41.720]  Now we're bragging about herd immunity.
[12:41.720 --> 12:50.720]  But again, people who've got the vaccine and are totally safe are angry at the people who haven't gotten it because somehow they're endangering the people who already vaccinated.
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.720]  So to protect people who voluntarily taken the risk of not getting the vaccine, we have to hurt those people.
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.720]  We've got to burn the village to save the village.
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.720]  As the doctor on television put it, we've got to use the carrot and the stick, but especially the stick.
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.720]  Colleges love this idea.
[13:05.720 --> 13:10.720]  Many of them are requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of returning to campus in the fall.
[13:10.720 --> 13:20.720]  In the state of California, both of the big state school systems, University of California and the Cal State system, are forcing students returning to campus to prove they've been vaccinated.
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.720]  Schools in New York, places like Columbia, Fordham, Syracuse, the big ones are doing exactly the same thing.
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.720]  What's interesting is that no one has bothered to explain why we're doing this.
[13:30.720 --> 13:33.720]  Virtually no college-age kids have died of COVID.
[13:33.720 --> 13:44.720]  In fact, according to an April report by the CDC, a total of 587 Americans between the ages of 15 and 24 died of the virus last year, most with profound underlying health conditions.
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.720]  Many times that thousands and thousands and thousands died of suicide over the same period, which we're not concerned about.
[13:51.720 --> 14:01.720]  In the state of Michigan, which now requires two-year-olds to wear masks outside, there were just 13 coronavirus total last year for people aged 15 to 24.
[14:01.720 --> 14:03.720]  Compare that to overdose deaths in Michigan.
[14:03.720 --> 14:04.720]  It's a tiny fraction.
[14:04.720 --> 14:06.720]  Not that we care about those either.
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.720]  So the coronavirus doesn't kill a lot of young people, but it does infect quite a few of them.
[14:11.720 --> 14:12.720]  And that's the other problem.
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.720]  Many thousands of college-age kids already have been infected.
[14:16.720 --> 14:20.720]  They have antibodies from previous corona infections they're now recovered from.
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.720]  Science suggests these kids are highly unlikely to be reinfected with COVID.
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.720]  So why are they being forced to get the vaccine?
[14:28.720 --> 14:29.720]  That's a serious question.
[14:29.720 --> 14:31.720]  It's not an anti-vaxxer question.
[14:31.720 --> 14:35.720]  That's a question people who support vaccines and care about them would ask.
[14:35.720 --> 14:38.720]  Because we don't give medicine to people unnecessarily.
[14:38.720 --> 14:39.720]  That is unethical.
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.720]  Meningitis, for example, kills a fair number of people every year.
[14:42.720 --> 14:48.720]  But we don't require everyone to start a regimen of antibiotics before they return to work.
[14:48.720 --> 14:50.720]  That would be crazy.
[14:50.720 --> 14:51.720]  It would be wrong.
[14:51.720 --> 14:52.720]  We wouldn't do it.
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.720]  But we are requiring universal vaccination, even of kids who have already been infected.
[14:57.720 --> 14:59.720]  Is that a medically sound idea?
[14:59.720 --> 15:02.720]  Some physicians are concerned that it's not.
[15:02.720 --> 15:05.720]  Joe Rogan over on the podcast voiced his concern on the air the other day.
[15:05.720 --> 15:07.720]  And here's what he said.
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.720]  People say, do you think it's safe to get vaccinated?
[15:10.720 --> 15:12.720]  I've said, yeah, I think for the most part it's safe to get vaccinated.
[15:12.720 --> 15:13.720]  I do.
[15:13.720 --> 15:14.720]  I do.
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.720]  But if you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?
[15:18.720 --> 15:19.720]  I go, no.
[15:19.720 --> 15:21.720]  Are you healthy?
[15:21.720 --> 15:22.720]  Are you a healthy person?
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.720]  Like, look, don't do anything stupid, but you should take care of yourself.
[15:26.720 --> 15:31.720]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well,
[15:31.720 --> 15:35.720]  I don't think you need to worry about this.
[15:35.720 --> 15:38.720]  Yeah, so if you're at risk, get the vaccine, protect yourself, be happy.
[15:38.720 --> 15:40.720]  Would it be grateful we have the vaccine?
[15:40.720 --> 15:43.720]  And if you're not at risk, maybe you don't.
[15:43.720 --> 15:44.720]  Is that a crazy point?
[15:44.720 --> 15:45.720]  Yeah, it is.
[15:45.720 --> 15:46.720]  That's crazy.
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.720]  Joe Rogan's idiotic advice.
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.720]  Healthy young people don't need COVID-19 vaccine.
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.720]  Steered a headline, a representative headline in TheDailyBeast.com.

[18:21.720 --> 18:25.720]  Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick.
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.720]  One hell of a price for you to get your kids.
[18:29.720 --> 18:57.720]  Oh that smell, can't you smell that smell?
[18:57.720 --> 19:01.720]  The smell of death surrounds you.
[19:01.720 --> 19:04.720]  You fool, you stuck a needle in your arm.
[19:04.720 --> 19:07.720]  You fool, fool, fool.
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.720]  I know the drink would drown you.
[19:12.720 --> 19:16.720]  Stick a needle in your arm.
[19:16.720 --> 19:21.720]  Just a fool.
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.720]  I got so many exclusive stories that during the break I'm running around like a chicken
[19:25.720 --> 19:28.720]  eating a chicken.
[19:28.720 --> 19:31.720]  I can't believe I'm getting a haircut off and getting them ready for you.
[19:31.720 --> 19:34.720]  Believe me.
[19:34.720 --> 19:37.720]  A lot of stuff goes behind the scenes that you don't even know about.
[19:37.720 --> 19:44.720]  Tucker ended that monologue last night saying you know, vaccine passports to be able to get on a plane or have a job.
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.720]  That's Alex Jones stuff.
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.720]  But it's all coming true.
[19:49.720 --> 19:54.720]  We're going to be rolling through that as well as the global, awakening explodes, and the population of the planet awakens the poison vaccines.
[19:54.720 --> 20:01.640]  of Americans have been vaccinated, but CNN runs the headline, oh, up to 60% of Americans
[20:01.640 --> 20:09.440]  have been vaccinated, sub-headline, or plan to be vaccinated. I saw that similar headline
[20:09.440 --> 20:17.880]  in CNN, ABC News, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post, because all I do is scan news headlines.
[20:17.880 --> 20:23.160]  And I see when they're pushing a narrative, you see it as well. But it's not 60%. It sounds
[20:23.160 --> 20:28.880]  like 60% took it. 60% didn't. It's 15%. As of a week ago, new numbers aren't out.
[20:28.880 --> 20:33.040]  It stalled out. They're closing all the big injection centers. Now they're coming into
[20:33.040 --> 20:36.080]  churches, coming into schools, coming into airports, trying to push it on you, trying
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.200]  to make you, because they got to buffalo you, because they got to depopulate you. Hell,
[20:40.200 --> 20:46.640]  I got CNN and Vogue today. Don't have children. It vandalizes the earth. You're bad. It's
[20:46.640 --> 20:52.120]  all coming up. This article went up last night. I'm going to ask them to repost it under the
[20:52.120 --> 20:56.760]  live show feed today with the headline that we have at the top there about the global
[20:56.760 --> 21:01.280]  awakening to poison vaccines explodes under the live show feed. We're going to repost
[21:01.280 --> 21:06.600]  this whole article right under as you can share it. Woman paralyzed from neck down following
[21:06.600 --> 21:14.880]  second dose of Pfizer COVID jab. Now why is that so important? The minute I saw the headline
[21:14.880 --> 21:21.360]  last night, I said, let me watch this newscast because I had a sneak in suspicion. Almost
[21:21.360 --> 21:27.480]  everyone that is getting paralyzed from the Pfizer who isn't old, old people just have
[21:27.480 --> 21:36.600]  heart attacks and die or strokes already had COVID. And what did medical doctors and scientists
[21:36.600 --> 21:40.320]  on this show say? And what does the medical report say? And I printed off a whole list
[21:40.320 --> 21:47.000]  of what Mike Adams talked about yesterday, that ADE, if you've already had COVID and
[21:47.000 --> 21:57.320]  you take this stuff, you have a giant allergic reaction to it. And your body starts just
[21:57.320 --> 22:05.880]  attacking everything. It's insane. Just type in COVID vaccines, mRNA vaccines, and ADE.
[22:05.880 --> 22:09.400]  You'll get hundreds of studies before they did this thing. Don't do it because they've
[22:09.400 --> 22:18.560]  been studying this for decades. Wow. Wow. Wow. Tennessee woman is attributing severe
[22:18.560 --> 22:22.560]  side effects that paralyzed her from the neck down to a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
[22:22.560 --> 22:26.540]  Yeah, lady, that's bad enough. You already had COVID. She says it. They should have told
[22:26.540 --> 22:33.360]  you not to take it. Plus you have supposed immunity. But they go against all the science.
[22:33.360 --> 22:36.000]  And then they're like, no, we're not saying don't take it on the show because you'll get
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.360]  bullied. You'll get censored. Everybody's been told political correctness. First, you don't
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.600]  say the n-word. Next, you don't question the UN and Fauci and Bill Gates. Yeah, it works.
[22:44.600 --> 22:47.760]  You once you've agreed that you don't have one form of speech, you don't have the other
[22:47.760 --> 22:54.480]  or even TV shows. News programs have to have to, oh, we apologize that we're going to tell
[22:54.480 --> 23:01.320]  you this. But any idiot knows that. So almost every young person I've seen die or get paralyzed
[23:01.320 --> 23:10.280]  because you know, the symptoms is either an autoimmune response, an allergic response.
[23:10.280 --> 23:14.080]  And I guess the ADE is part of the autoimmune response. I'm not a scientist. I just read
[23:14.080 --> 23:19.200]  this. I mean, I just know, I just know that major European countries are banning all the
[23:19.200 --> 23:27.320]  vaccines basically and saying they're all worse than the damn COVID. Number three, Jiu-Jitsu
[23:27.320 --> 23:32.080]  black belt in the world. I'm on a UFC or Jiu-Jitsu expert. I was sent this by an expert. I won't
[23:32.080 --> 23:35.080]  say his name. You probably know it. His household name is from an article about it. I mean,
[23:35.080 --> 23:39.760]  Nashville followed it. And it gets into how it almost killed him. We'll cover all that
[23:39.760 --> 23:46.160]  coming up. But first, here is the poor lady paralyzed from the neck down in the great state
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.160]  of Tennessee.
[23:47.160 --> 23:51.960]  New tonight, a Nashville woman is speaking out tonight from her hospital bed unable
[23:51.960 --> 23:58.800]  to walk less than 24 hours after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
[23:58.800 --> 24:04.200]  She was unable to move from the neck down. As news to Alex Dena shows us, she is encouraging
[24:04.200 --> 24:10.160]  others to advocate for their health. It's just like the worst nightmare I can ever
[24:10.160 --> 24:11.160]  mind.
[24:11.160 --> 24:16.040]  Brandy Parker McSadden is confined to her hospital bed at Vanderbilt. Can you walk right here?
[24:16.040 --> 24:17.600]  No, I can't walk.
[24:17.600 --> 24:23.120]  Jess sent 24 hours after receiving her second Pfizer COVID shot. She explains she lost her
[24:23.120 --> 24:25.920]  ability to move from her shoulders down.
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.880]  I thought maybe if anything, I'd probably get like flu-like symptoms because I'd already
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.880]  had COVID. But I never in a million years thought I would never be able to get up and
[24:35.880 --> 24:43.160]  go to the bathroom or get up and walk to the other side of the room or say that I've been
[24:43.160 --> 24:48.760]  hugged by kids. The usually active mother of three is speaking out, not with the intent
[24:48.760 --> 24:49.760]  of causing fear.
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.080]  I'm not saying don't get your vaccine. I'm just saying that COVID is really real.
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.800]  And still, really new, she continues including the vaccine, which is why she feels any possible
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.080]  adverse side effect should be investigated even if it is extremely rare.
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.400]  There's been, I don't know how many people have been vaccinated and been fine, right?
[25:08.400 --> 25:14.120]  But we have to tell everything. Otherwise, we will get nowhere in this thing of COVID.
[25:14.120 --> 25:19.200]  Brandy advocates for women's health on a daily basis. Following a diagnosis of epilepsy,
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.160]  she created a nonprofit called My Epilepsy Story. Now, her fight has shifted from her
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.240]  hospital room, warning of other women with similar symptoms to hers.
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.920]  We do know there's been a couple of cases of a couple of other women, but those women
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.400]  did not have epilepsy.
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.960]  She applauds the investigation into the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which involved six women
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.400]  and rare blood clots. And she's hoping research will be done into these cases of paralysis.
[25:44.400 --> 25:51.720]  This is why I say we need government funding and NIH for all these things.
[25:51.720 --> 25:57.600]  Oh my gosh, we don't have to turn it off. Total Stockholm syndrome. Hey, lady, since
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.400]  they began giving inoculations 600 years ago in the Netherlands, sometimes people died
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.000]  from it and the doctors would say there's a risk.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.480]  Now these are gene therapies. The NIH knew this. They did animal trials under other names
[26:10.480 --> 26:16.240]  and knew it killed most of the animals, including all the ferrets in the Pfizer study. All of
[26:16.240 --> 26:20.200]  the ferrets died. Not good.
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.200]  But we're a lot tougher.
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.920]  Oh, we need more funding. I mean, I still get it, though. I'm glad I took it. I'm glad
[26:26.920 --> 26:33.240]  I can't walk now. It's so wonderful. They lied to you. They said that 4% would die.
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.520]  They said 2.5 million would die. They lie. They lie. They lie. They lie. They lie. They
[26:38.520 --> 26:43.040]  lie. They lie again and they lie again and they lie again and they lie again and they
[26:43.040 --> 26:44.760]  lie, lie, lie, lie.
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.000]  And now it's not just people that already had COVID take the shot and get really sick.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.200]  If you take the vaccine, they're going to come into contact with other viruses similar
[26:53.200 --> 26:56.400]  and it's going to cause an autoimmune response. They admit we're going to have millions of
[26:56.400 --> 26:58.320]  deaths now.
[26:58.320 --> 27:04.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.320]  full versus that. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But I'll tell
[27:09.320 --> 27:16.080]  you this. The technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy
[27:16.080 --> 27:21.400]  all independent forms of media. They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[27:21.400 --> 27:27.160]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.960]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true. So it's now that
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.840]  your credibility is way up. The power structure is going to silence those of us that they
[27:35.840 --> 27:36.840]  can.
[27:36.840 --> 27:44.120]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power. But the sun
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.360]  is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we fight
[27:49.360 --> 27:54.160]  hard right now to make sure that long, dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bearer
[27:54.160 --> 27:59.240]  as you are.
[27:59.240 --> 28:05.360]  CNN has almost no viewers. The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the
[28:05.360 --> 28:09.720]  world as a pack of anti-free speech liars. But that doesn't mean that they don't have
[28:09.720 --> 28:13.400]  power. Just like the Southern Poverty Law Center that's just as bad. They represent
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.640]  the globalist, the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and back's common as
[28:17.640 --> 28:22.560]  China and its death camps. And they back bringing those similar systems here to America and
[28:22.560 --> 28:27.880]  they've even officially called the ADL for my arrest for my speech and for Mark Zuckerberg
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.480]  to be arrested for free speech as well. These are very, very dangerous times. They don't
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.880]  want us to be on air. You funding our operation is critical. You make it easy at infoarstore.com
[28:37.880 --> 28:42.280]  with amazing products like water filtration, air filtration, non-geoma heirloom seeds,
[28:42.280 --> 28:47.600]  t-shirts, books, films. And now, former best-selling product sold out for months, back in stock.
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.400]  These ultimate turmeric formula, vaso beach, cross the guard, alpha power and more, back

[28:59.800 --> 29:05.040]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying. Hell, everybody knows that. I just tell you
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.360]  what I'm really thinking. People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.560]  That's embarrassing. Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me. But
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.000]  I'll tell you this right now. You're nuts if you don't get storeable food. And I've
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.320]  got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food at the lowest price you're going
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.800]  to find. Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that tastes
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.080]  even better? Yeah. Most of the stuff tastes amazing. Some of it tastes okay. The point
[29:30.080 --> 29:33.960]  is it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time. And compared to other
[29:33.960 --> 29:39.080]  competitors, they can't even get close. We've got three months, six months. Your supplies

[30:11.160 --> 30:15.640]  and Facebook making the globalist pull their hair out in anger. But let me tell you, we
[30:15.640 --> 30:20.160]  are tomorrow's news today. And thanks for your support. We're still on air at infowars.com

[30:55.160 --> 31:10.160]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[31:25.160 --> 31:54.160]  Global awakenings of poison vaccines. Explode. Watch mine. And I've got two big stories.
[31:54.160 --> 32:03.160]  One is that we have posted infowars.com. And a special editor called me. We don't normally
[32:03.160 --> 32:08.440]  have editors around here, but a special editor called to correct the UFC story that I contributed
[32:08.440 --> 32:12.640]  to a national file that he's not a UFC fighter, though he's fought in the UFC. He's number
[32:12.640 --> 32:18.640]  three jujitsu fighter in the world. And one of the top commentators out there corrected
[32:18.640 --> 32:22.920]  me on that. So UFC fighter, it's just so cool to have all these people listening to show
[32:22.920 --> 32:30.720]  in real time. UFC fighter, Craig Jones, unable to fight after COVID vaccine causes fluid
[32:30.720 --> 32:36.320]  buildup around his stomach. Well, national file has updated it to video jujitsu, black
[32:36.320 --> 32:43.360]  milk, Craig Jones, unable to fight after COVID vaccine causes fluid buildup around his stomach.
[32:43.360 --> 32:52.560]  Now they tell you the side effect is tumors, liver swelling, kidney failure, menstruation,
[32:52.560 --> 32:59.680]  lack of menstruation, tumors in the uterus, tumors on the testicles. And so it was just
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.560]  crucially painful for him and a lot more. So I got some more details of what happened
[33:04.560 --> 33:07.960]  to him. We're going to be adding that to the article. I sent it over to the great Tom
[33:07.960 --> 33:12.120]  Pappert. We're also going to change the headline to number three jujitsu fighter in the world.
[33:12.120 --> 33:15.680]  And that's all because, again, I contributed some of the story and rushed it through this
[33:15.680 --> 33:22.640]  morning. I collaborate sometimes with the great folks over at nationalfile.com. But
[33:22.640 --> 33:25.120]  let's play this clip. I took Carl's thing because I didn't get to it earlier where
[33:25.120 --> 33:30.240]  he makes the point about COVID passports. I mean, we said over a year ago they're going
[33:30.240 --> 33:34.240]  to have COVID passports to leave your house or have a job and a global social credit score
[33:34.240 --> 33:40.040]  and they're going to tie it into a no fly list because the UN and Bill Gates said so.
[33:40.040 --> 33:47.760]  So again, I keep getting attributed for having a crystal ball when I know how to put the
[33:47.760 --> 33:54.280]  information together. I mean, I've got a large historical palette, a large historical spectrum
[33:54.280 --> 33:59.040]  and I have a lot of guests and I immerse myself in this and I work hard and I'm on fire for
[33:59.040 --> 34:06.520]  freedom. But I did not imagine everything would just magically came true like I'm Jesus Christ
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.200]  or something. I don't have God like powers. I have the good brain God gave me. This is
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.280]  all out in the open and it only gets worse and it's never going to end. I mean, I talk
[34:16.280 --> 34:23.480]  to FBI agents and top lawyers and all sorts of people. You know, there are smart people
[34:23.480 --> 34:27.400]  that I respect and know. They're like, Alex, come on, the mask will be gone in a few months.
[34:27.400 --> 34:32.200]  Oh, Alex, they're not going to have rolling lockdowns. Oh, Alex, come on, the mRNA doesn't
[34:32.200 --> 34:35.760]  change your body. And then I talk to one of the top lawyers and they go, my God, the
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.560]  owner of this giant biotech company tells me it's deadly and a gene right takeover and
[34:40.560 --> 34:46.160]  part of a plan to corrupt the human DNA and it's super dangerous. I mean, it's the truth,
[34:46.160 --> 34:51.440]  ladies and gentlemen. And just because you're not a psychotic mad scientist doesn't mean
[34:51.440 --> 35:02.800]  you can project your normalcy on to other people because they're not normal. They want
[35:02.800 --> 35:14.360]  to rape you. You know, low level retail perverts just want to rape women or children. But see,
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.720]  scientific ones want to rape everybody and change your very DNA. And they've got all
[35:18.720 --> 35:22.920]  these Stockholm victims that are cowards and are chicken necks and believe in the system
[35:22.920 --> 35:26.840]  to take care of them who are domesticated and they can't believe they're being enslaved.
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.800]  Their subconscious knows they are. And so they go into Stockholm syndrome like the woman
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.680]  paralyzed from the neck down and says, Oh, take your vaccines. They're wonderful. Just
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.320]  get more funding and more vaccines is the answer. Instead of they lied to me. They said
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.640]  it was totally safe, but it is it. No, she can't come to grips with the predatory. It's
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.200]  like it's like some black people. I guess with Tuskegee, I never read this, but I guess
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.840]  they weren't as dumb as this lady. They're like, Oh, thank you for giving me syphilis.
[35:51.840 --> 35:59.400]  Thank you for torturing me and killing me. I mean, these are bad people and the same
[35:59.400 --> 36:04.400]  folks who were running Tuskegee trained Fauci. He's an extension of that. And so is Bill
[36:04.400 --> 36:08.520]  Gates. So here's Tucker Carlson talking about it last night. You'll notice that the piece
[36:08.520 --> 36:14.240]  never explained why exactly Joe Rogan's advice was so idiotic. It just dismisses him as a
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.840]  moron. He's crazy. Don't listen to him. He's probably a Nazi or worse, a Trump voter. That's
[36:19.840 --> 36:29.360]  MSNBC's concern. Watch. I don't know how the right got so far ahead on creating such
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.200]  a political connotation around the conversation about vaccine passports. There are all sorts
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.600]  of things you have to do to travel to all sorts of different places. How has that debate
[36:38.600 --> 36:46.280]  become so corrupted so early? I don't know, but it's bad. I live in a state that is the
[36:46.280 --> 36:53.800]  state legislature is dominated by Trumpers, and they are busy making it illegal for a
[36:53.800 --> 37:01.560]  business to require a passport, a vaccine passport. And now they're politicizing the
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.680]  appropriate way to encourage people to get vaccines, which will cost lives.
[37:07.680 --> 37:16.480]  How did it get so political? Says Jeb Bush's former flak in the long time governor of Missouri.
[37:16.480 --> 37:22.200]  Political. See that? All the mouth breathers, the dumb people, the hillbillies, and inbreds,
[37:22.200 --> 37:26.680]  an extra promise on folks to Trumpers are all spun up with their conspiracy theories
[37:26.680 --> 37:32.360]  about vaccine passports. Come on. They're no vaccine passports. That's insane. It's
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.800]  Alex Jones stuff. And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job,
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.800]  you'll need your vaccine papers. And then the less like, well, it's just corporations
[37:42.800 --> 37:46.600]  doing it except the state of Hawaii. Well, now the European Union says, yes, I have one
[37:46.600 --> 37:52.440]  to go to Europe. It's an admitted takeover plan. And remember, doesn't protect you from
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.920]  COVID, even the current variants doesn't protect you from other variants and can give
[37:56.920 --> 38:02.400]  you horrible autoimmune disorders or allergic responses or other things that kill you or
[38:02.400 --> 38:08.760]  make you deathly ill when you come in contact with another coronavirus. Oh, and by the way,
[38:08.760 --> 38:16.000]  that's in all the literature. It will blow your mind. In fact, it's in the article that's
[38:16.000 --> 38:24.560]  on info wars.com. Joe Rogan is right. Science shows young people have mild COVID symptoms,
[38:24.560 --> 38:30.080]  but horribly violent vaccine reactions worse than even the elderly. Can we pull up the
[38:30.080 --> 38:35.840]  full article in four words.com because I updated the headline. There it is. Joe Rogan is right.
[38:35.840 --> 38:41.320]  Science shows young people have mild COVID symptoms worth vaccine reactions than the
[38:41.320 --> 38:48.800]  elderly. And I made the headline even more hardcore for info wars.com. Rogan attacked
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.040]  for saying young, healthy people don't need COVID vaccines, even though the death rate
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.480]  for people above, I mean, below the age of 45 is less than the seasonal flu. So yeah,
[38:59.480 --> 39:04.160]  they've used things like, oh, you want to go to Vietnam or oh, you want to go to Paraguay.
[39:04.160 --> 39:10.000]  Well, those are basically authoritarian states. So they say to go there, you've got to have
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.360]  this shot for yellow fever or you've got to have this or that. And people I know have
[39:15.360 --> 39:20.840]  had violent reactions. A lady worked here who was she told us she got the job. She said,
[39:20.840 --> 39:24.840]  oh, in about six months, I'm going to go to Vietnam. It's all be gone for a month. We
[39:24.840 --> 39:31.640]  said, that's fine. When she took the job and then she got the vaccine for whatever it was.
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.280]  I forget almost killed her said it shut down her immune system. So she was wearing a mask
[39:36.280 --> 39:40.440]  around the office for a few months. And then it got so sick, she had to quit. We never
[39:40.440 --> 39:46.640]  know what happened to her. Well, that's fun, huh? Or my grandma that got polio from the
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.000]  vaccine, they told her that was really fun to be partially paralyzed from like 1954 until
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.400]  she died three years ago. It was wonderful for total torture or or my uncle that almost
[39:55.400 --> 40:03.600]  died of a vaccine or how about two of my employees who lost their children from vaccines? The
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.600]  12 month old baby's totally happy. Walking takes a shot. Start, you know, convulsing
[40:07.600 --> 40:16.280]  and dies a week later. One was 18 months, one was 12 months. I'm gonna leave it right
[40:16.280 --> 40:18.880]  there. I'm gonna stop right there because they get pissed off. I'm gonna talk about
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.680]  it. But I mean, listen, I'm around people losing their children. I've got family being
[40:23.680 --> 40:28.960]  crippled by I live it. I've got Reuters admitting the main cause of polio is Bill Gates's vaccines.
[40:28.960 --> 40:34.200]  They're killing us. And I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore. And I'm not intimidated
[40:34.200 --> 40:38.200]  by the FBI trying to set me up, put me in prison. If I don't shut up about this, I'm
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.160]  not shutting up about any of it. Because I've been told you shut up about Gates, we're gonna
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.960]  set you up, then feel your goddamn hand because you've got God to deal with and you're gonna
[40:46.960 --> 40:52.520]  burn in hell for what you've done, you Nazis. So burn in hell, burn in hell, burn in hell,
[40:52.520 --> 41:02.760]  burn in hell, burn in hell, burn in hell, burn in hell.
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.000]  Granny do right, granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.360]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all
[41:11.360 --> 41:16.000]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.760]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2s
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.360]  over the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.240]  I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you
[41:32.240 --> 41:37.040]  know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.600]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.760]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[41:46.760 --> 41:52.440]  wonderful, you know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so
[41:52.440 --> 41:58.480]  anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[41:58.480 --> 42:02.080]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.040]  I say, thank you for what you've done. Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air. Thank

[44:00.160 --> 44:09.520]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by
[44:09.520 --> 44:15.880]  a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world
[44:15.880 --> 44:22.160]  domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth
[44:22.160 --> 44:27.400]  of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.960]  in hand. The globalist fear this film made 14 years
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.200]  ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world. It is the blueprint for
[44:34.200 --> 44:38.480]  the great reset. It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at
[44:38.480 --> 44:42.520]  InfoWarsStore.com with a zero country code, meaning you can make copies of it anywhere
[44:42.520 --> 44:47.960]  in the world. I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at InfoWarsStore.com. I strongly
[44:47.960 --> 44:52.080]  suggest you make copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell
[44:52.080 --> 44:55.360]  others that you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well. That will
[44:55.360 --> 45:01.920]  trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[45:01.920 --> 45:16.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. The globalist's great error is to believe
[45:16.520 --> 45:22.800]  that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top. The truth is, humanity is coming
[45:22.800 --> 45:29.800]  down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[45:29.800 --> 45:36.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. By the way, not a correction here, but I don't
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.760]  know how the left operates. Everybody knows that I am non-offensive violence, and I don't
[45:41.760 --> 45:51.000]  wish any violence against anybody in the Russian FSB or our equivalent of the KGB, the FBI.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.400]  And I say, fill your hand. I'm saying, the system threatens me. You better back off,
[45:55.400 --> 45:59.120]  Bill Gates. You better back off what you're doing or we're going to get you. You're already
[45:59.120 --> 46:05.200]  getting me. My God, global lockdowns, poison vaccines. Bill Gates is my doctor. Kids wearing
[46:05.200 --> 46:13.800]  masks can't breathe. You already got me real good. I can't lay down to this like the lawyers
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.120]  that run this country. I don't think open borders and human smuggling is funny. I don't
[46:18.120 --> 46:23.480]  think them giving waivers so that hundreds of thousands, millions of kids in total soon
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.280]  to be, it's hundreds of thousands now, in just the last few months, can just be given
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.520]  to anybody. And we just randomly walk into these places and there's a guy going, I want
[46:31.520 --> 46:36.320]  that woman. I want that woman. I'm going to show her the real power of the Lord. Don't
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.840]  want him to have a husband. I want women and children. We're going to make them work. And
[46:41.840 --> 46:51.760]  I paid to get them in the world. Yes, sir. We'll load them up for you. I mean, the bottom
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.680]  has fallen out, ladies and gentlemen. So I say metaphysically, I've got God on my side.
[46:56.680 --> 47:03.600]  I cannot sit here and take being assaulted with forced inoculation and GMO and 5G and
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.000]  the new world order and have this attitude of putting my tail between my legs, rolling
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.920]  over on my back and pissing all over myself like I'm a dog. That is not the American spirit.
[47:13.920 --> 47:22.960]  That's not the spirit of a question. And the reason we're falling apart is people have
[47:22.960 --> 47:27.720]  stopped taking action. Now, I should have started the show with this, but I got so much big
[47:27.720 --> 47:32.960]  news I didn't. And if I don't do some fanfare for it, no one will care. If I say I'm not
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.080]  going to cover this today, I'm going to cover it tomorrow at noon, it would actually have
[47:37.080 --> 47:45.200]  an effect, save lives and turn things around. If I cover this now, no one is going to care.
[47:45.200 --> 47:52.560]  But who knows, I'll even be here tomorrow. So I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going
[47:52.560 --> 47:57.880]  to settle down. I had one cup of coffee, folks. Maybe a second cup will help me. I'm pretty
[47:57.880 --> 48:04.120]  wired. I told you I was going home to rest and take naps this weekend. I usually work
[48:04.120 --> 48:09.360]  seven days a week. This is what two days off did. Climbing the walls, man, the old Alex
[48:09.360 --> 48:18.080]  Jones is here. Of course, not drinking my help, too. But I mean, here we are, ladies
[48:18.080 --> 48:25.400]  and gentlemen, in this insane out of control system. And bowing down to it has gotten us
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.440]  here. I suggest we stop bowing. I suggest we start saying no. So here's what I'm going
[48:31.440 --> 48:37.600]  to do. Nick is going to join us about the no fly list for segment two and three. Maybe
[48:37.600 --> 48:43.920]  a little bit more if he's got more to say. He's always a well-spoken gent. And then I'm
[48:43.920 --> 48:50.360]  going to hit this. And I've got a video from the drifting springs, school board meeting
[48:50.360 --> 48:57.080]  outside Austin, big summer with Austin. I should live out there. And I've got the transcript
[48:57.080 --> 49:03.440]  of what the lady, Amanda, Bill, or Beal had to say. And then I got the Texas law right
[49:03.440 --> 49:14.160]  here. And I'll tell you about it in the fourth segment of the next hour. And then we'll get
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.920]  an article up on infowars.com. They have similar laws around the country. But I'll just go
[49:19.920 --> 49:28.380]  and let the cat out of the bag for you. It's illegal under Texas law to forcibly put a
[49:28.380 --> 49:33.760]  mask on a child's face because it turns out it's some orphanages around the country of
[49:33.760 --> 49:39.160]  the 20s and 30s, eugenicists would torture children putting mouth gags on them or facial
[49:39.160 --> 49:44.640]  coverings. And so you're not allowed to punish someone for not wearing a mask. It is a crime.
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.880]  But of course it is because we weren't insane 50, 60 years ago like we are now. So I'm going
[49:50.880 --> 49:57.320]  to show you the Texas code, show you the law, show it all to you coming up in about 45 minutes
[49:57.320 --> 50:03.320]  from now. The video with the basics is already up. Austin suburb unanimously rejects mask
[50:03.320 --> 50:07.000]  for public school children. That's on Band-Aid video. But the rest of the story is what's
[50:07.000 --> 50:14.440]  in it is the law. It's an hour and a half video. Just every parent was against it. And
[50:14.440 --> 50:17.720]  so they would just turn their mics off. They'd say, I'm against this. You heard the mic
[50:17.720 --> 50:26.360]  turn off. Or you hear the shuffle papers. Oh, sorry, can't hear you. People even say,
[50:26.360 --> 50:30.440]  hey, stop doing that. And people got in their cars and drove there. It went over like five
[50:30.440 --> 50:34.600]  hours. And they go, hey, I saw you at home on the cable. Every time somebody gets up
[50:34.600 --> 50:40.400]  or against it, you turn their mic down. Stop doing that. And hey, stop doing your papers
[50:40.400 --> 50:47.760]  like that. People are getting it, man. The left are a bunch of passive aggressive scum.
[50:47.760 --> 50:52.640]  Must have been 60, 70 parents spoke. We pulled it down to an hour and a half. And all of
[50:52.640 --> 50:58.760]  them were pissed. Not one person. But oh, here's the mask. Shut up. Shut up. Globalist
[50:58.760 --> 51:07.400]  surreal law. Bill Gates law. And I know there are good people in big pharma. There are big
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.160]  people in law enforcement. There are good people that work at the grocery store. But
[51:11.160 --> 51:15.680]  if you don't say no to the corruption, you're part of it. Just like the former Pfizer chief
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.320]  scientist came out and said, this is a takeover. This is evil. This is going to kill a bunch
[51:19.320 --> 51:24.440]  of people. This is wrong. Back in December, when they finally were doing the first releases
[51:24.440 --> 51:28.880]  in England, and he saw the death, he saw the carnage, he analyzed what they admitted was
[51:28.880 --> 51:35.040]  in it and said, why in tarnations would you have jellyfish genes in here for bioluminescence?
[51:35.040 --> 51:38.560]  Why would you? And they go, we're not going to tell you. It's for projury secret. We're
[51:38.560 --> 51:44.600]  going to try to force you to do it. And it's a secret. It's like, I rewatched last night,
[51:44.600 --> 51:47.040]  at least part of it, because I remember it as a kid. I guess it's free on YouTube. It's
[51:47.040 --> 51:53.320]  when we posted it. Invaders from Mars, the 1986 version, because a guest here still on
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.560]  the show, C-12 mentioned the 1958 one. I haven't watched it yet with a mom in it smoking. I
[51:57.560 --> 52:02.080]  think I'm going to have to watch that one tonight. But old bombshell blonde. But the
[52:02.080 --> 52:05.320]  Dan aliens land in the backyard and they're injecting people with a thing that turns them
[52:05.320 --> 52:09.640]  into zombies that have remote controlled chips to control them. I mean, they're 60 minutes
[52:09.640 --> 52:17.200]  actually saying that on TV now. This is crazy town, folks. And a lot of people have gotten
[52:17.200 --> 52:20.520]  on board with the transhumanist because they believe it's the future and you just have
[52:20.520 --> 52:29.840]  to accept it. Well, I'm not going along with it. And Joseph Mingola, you know, said, oh,
[52:29.840 --> 52:38.760]  it's just science. Socky. I'll cover that too. In fact, get Socky ready. Old rancid Socky.
[52:38.760 --> 52:42.040]  She said, hey, you know, you guys are selling baby parts, you know, keeping them alive,
[52:42.040 --> 52:45.640]  what they're doing until they're ready to harvest them. And she goes, it's just science.
[52:45.640 --> 52:49.440]  It's like Jeffrey Dahmer. It's just science for Joseph Mingola. Oh, I'm just torturing
[52:49.440 --> 52:53.840]  thousands of people in medical experiments. It's just science. And they said that at Nuremberg.
[52:53.840 --> 52:58.320]  It's just science. It's just science that you can't see what's in the vaccine. It's
[52:58.320 --> 53:01.920]  just science. We didn't do the trials. It's just science. We've lied to you about everything.
[53:01.920 --> 53:09.200]  It's just science. It's just science. They call it science when they stick an ice pick
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.240]  in the front of your head and slice the front of your cerebral cortex. You'd be brain dead
[53:13.240 --> 53:18.560]  or you'd be a zombie. You'd be a vegetable. And they called it science. It's just science
[53:18.560 --> 53:22.440]  sticking an ice pick in the front of your head. Electroshock therapy. It's just science.
[53:22.440 --> 53:27.080]  30 million, 40 million of our kids on Ritalin brain damage. It's just science. The mass
[53:27.080 --> 53:31.120]  suicides, the death, the collapse of civilization, depression off the charts. It's them running
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.560]  it by design. The wreckage of society, the artificial takedown. It's just science. We'll
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.480]  play that coming up as well. Here she is. It's just science.
[53:41.480 --> 53:48.840]  In the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the leaders of the president's own faith,
[53:48.840 --> 53:53.760]  it is deeply offensive, quote, to millions of Americans for our tax dollars to be used
[53:53.760 --> 53:58.640]  for research that collaborates with an industry built on the taking of innocent lives. How
[53:58.640 --> 54:00.760]  does the White House respond to that criticism?
[54:00.760 --> 54:07.440]  Look, I think the White House respectfully disagrees and we believe that it's important
[54:07.440 --> 54:13.440]  to invest in science and look for opportunities to cure diseases. And I think that's what
[54:13.440 --> 54:14.440]  this is hoping to do.
[54:14.440 --> 54:18.280]  Oh, yeah. By devaluing humanity, by industrially keeping babies alive and then harvesting them.
[54:18.280 --> 54:21.760]  Hell, why not just keep them alive and milk them for their blood? Oh, that's big enough.
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.720]  And merging them with monkeys and pigs and cows, which that was going on 50 years ago.
[54:25.720 --> 54:31.120]  It's now all out in the open. But it's all just science. Like 90-year-old women into
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.760]  the news are having menstrual cycles. They haven't had menstrual cycles in 40, 50 years.
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.720]  But boy, they get that COVID shot and that blood starts pouring. Oh, women that haven't
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.400]  had menstrual cycles who've been around people that got the vaccine that's coming back.
[54:45.400 --> 54:50.560]  You're 75 years old and your husband gets the COVID shot. You're going to have a period
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.600]  again, sweetheart. And young women suddenly have periods all the time. And they tell you
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.040]  it grows tumors in you. They say, never mind if you get an X-ray and they find tumors after
[54:58.040 --> 55:00.040]  a COVID shot. That's normal.
[55:00.040 --> 55:12.280]  Yeah, it's liberal. It's fun. It's good. That's right. Oh, the Bay Area ABC News says it's
[55:12.280 --> 55:15.880]  normal to have screwed up menstrual cycles and your baby might die of you breastfeed
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.880]  when you get it, but it's okay because Tim Cook's gay.

[56:49.400 --> 56:55.520]  CNN has almost no viewers. The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.840]  world as a pack of anti free speech liars. But that doesn't mean that they don't have
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.520]  power just like the Southern Poverty Law Center that's just as bad. They represent the globalist,
[57:04.520 --> 57:09.560]  the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and backs communist China and its death camps.
[57:09.560 --> 57:13.520]  And they back bringing those similar systems here to America and they've even officially
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.920]  called the ADL for my arrest for my speech and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.000]  free speech as well. These are very, very dangerous times. They don't want us to be

[58:22.760 --> 58:28.160]  The U.S. Air Force under Biden's been preparing to do 50 foot flyovers to scare crowds during
[58:28.160 --> 58:33.240]  starvation in upcoming future lockdowns. They even had him fired up and ready on the tarmac
[58:33.240 --> 58:38.000]  a few months ago in Swallow's Wells jurisdiction where he wants to use nuclear weapons on American

[59:30.560 --> 59:36.160]  California is absolutely descending into madness. According to a report from the Los Angeles
[59:36.160 --> 59:42.800]  Times, a California Air National Guard F-15C Strike Eagle was put on alert for a curious
[59:42.800 --> 59:48.240]  domestic mission last March causing pilots to be concerned that they would be ordered
[59:48.240 --> 59:54.160]  to buzz over U.S. citizens. According to the report, California National Guard members
[59:54.160 --> 1:00:00.560]  awaited orders from the Sacramento headquarters to make preparations for any civil unrest that
[1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:06.480]  might arise from the outbreak of the coronavirus, but then came an unusual order. The air branch
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:13.720]  of the Guard was told to place an F-15C fighter jet on an alert status for a possible domestic
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:19.560]  mission, according to four Guard sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Those sources
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:24.880]  said the order didn't spell out the mission, but given the aircraft's limitations, they
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:30.680]  understood it to mean the plane could be deployed to terrify and disperse protesters by flying
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:37.440]  low over them at window-rattling speeds with its afterburner streaming columns of flames.
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:42.480]  Fighter jets have been used occasionally in that manner in combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:46.720]  they said. The jet was fueled and ready to go at a moment's notice with the possibility
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:52.600]  of also intimidating George Floyd protesters and those disputing the November 3rd presidential
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:58.080]  election. The sources said the directives from Guard headquarters made their way down
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:03.600]  orally or in text messages rather than in formal written orders, which was unusual and
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:09.320]  heightened their concerns that the jet would be used inappropriately. Major General David
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:15.320]  Baldwin, who leads the California Guard, did not respond directly to interview requests
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:20.920]  from the Los Angeles Times, but a spokesman for Baldwin, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:26.240]  Sharoma, denied that the F-15C was placed on an alert status for a potential response
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:32.040]  to civil disturbances. Sharoma claimed that no F-15s were contemplated, but then released
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:38.520]  a list of aircraft that he said were postured to support any potential civil unrest missions,
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:45.120]  leading up to the election. It included two planes, a C-130J and an H-C-130J, but the
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:50.840]  LA Times investigated other internal guard documents that revealed that the jet had been
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:56.360]  placed on an alert status for an election week mission and that officers had discussed
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:03.680]  in March 2020 as well as during the summer about using the F-15C for domestic purposes,
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:08.560]  including to intimidate civilians. The week before the presidential election, a Lieutenant
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:14.640]  Colonel also sent messages to guard members who maintained the F-15C, advising them that
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:20.200]  it must be ready to take off within two hours time, beginning the day before the election.
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:25.120]  That meant a pilot and a launch crew had to be available to reach the Fresno base within
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:29.960]  90 minutes of receiving an order to deploy the jet according to sources. The message
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:35.480]  also said something about aircraft availability for a domestic mission which would be at a
[1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:40.680]  premium next week with the election, saying that they may have to work over the weekend
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:46.440]  for the potential mission, and sources said that the aircraft in question was indeed the
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:52.560]  F-15C. This is no longer a drill, this is a harbinger of totalitarianism growing amongst
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:57.280]  the ranks with the American people in its sights. John Bown reporting.
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:02.920]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete,
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:07.640]  making you a domesticated animal they control, they want to censor you, they want to dumb
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:11.840]  you down, they want to poison you, and they want to control your ability to take care
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:17.920]  of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the Info War more than ever,
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:23.080]  and you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.

[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:23.240]  Get your food down. All right, when I tell you this, it is not to say, oh, I'm like
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:30.360]  a movie star or, oh, I'm famous. This is so much fun. I tell you this because you need
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:37.720]  to know how awake people are getting so you have some hope. I'm like a gauge in a car,
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:45.040]  like a probe that's in the radiator to tell you how hot the water is, okay? Or a speedometer
[1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:49.560]  telling you how fast the wheels are turning. The average person is not a public figure,
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:53.760]  which is a big plus, believe me. It's not fun. It's got some pluses, but a lot of minuses,
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:57.800]  okay? Your privacy being gone really sucks, even more so than what we see in the surveillance
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:02.520]  state. And people lie about you. They make stuff up. It's got a lot of negatives. But
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:07.840]  because I'm well known, I get to see the reactions of people. And let me tell you, I could be
[1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:11.480]  in black neighborhoods, white neighborhoods, Hispanic neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods,
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:17.120]  rich neighborhoods, I get mobbed everywhere. I've gotten mobbed for a long time. And since
[1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:21.200]  Trump got in, I got attacked quite a few times as well. I might shake 100 hands, but then
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:24.800]  somebody knocked my cup of tea over or pour coffee on me or spit on me or say they want
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.080]  to kill me. And then when I told them F off, they'd start videotaping and say that I assaulted
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:34.360]  them, but the people would go find their surveillance footage and prove that I got assaulted. So
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:40.160]  when I tell you this, it's not to brag. It's to let you know. Now everywhere I go, everywhere
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:48.160]  I go. I mean, if I go on a gas station to buy a bottle of water, to be an old black man,
[1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:51.680]  be a guy from India, could be a white dude, Alex, appreciate what you're doing. Keep it
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:55.520]  up. You know, we're all Alex Jones now. And you see that trend every week now, we're all
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:01.040]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones was right on even Twitter, even though I'm banned from there.
[1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:05.480]  And so I was, you know, back there getting a coffee during the break and during that
[1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:11.440]  John down report. And one of my oldest producers been here, John Harmon been here, I don't know,
[1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:15.920]  18 years. He said, man, he goes everywhere on the streets and on cyber stuff. All I see
[1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:19.880]  is Alex Jones is right. Well, now they're saying Nick Foyntes was right. And Tucker Carlson
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:24.080]  was right. And Joe Rogan was right. So what I'm saying is these tyrants aren't invincible.
[1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:30.400]  They're trying all this intimidation and blackballing people and taking bank accounts can no fly list.
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:36.240]  Not because they're strong, but because they're weak. Hitler was bad, but he was popular. Joe
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:41.880]  Biden had to steal the election. Hitler was elected. Stalin had to overthrow another authoritarian
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.040]  monarchy, set up his own communist monarchy. And he called himself the next czar, told
[1:06:46.040 --> 1:06:52.800]  his mother, I am just a new czar. And so we are fighting a classical fight of good
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:57.840]  versus evil. We promote open American free market Renaissance ideas where America first
[1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:02.400]  were under attack. So Nick Foyntes has never gotten more support is getting out. That's
[1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:05.240]  good. And even a lot of liberals are saying, whoa, this dude didn't call for violence
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:10.520]  for capital. Why is he on a fly list? He went back to a third airline. People were denying
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:14.440]  us on a fly list. Even the Democrats have all called for it. And he shot Southwest Airlines
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.280]  admitting, yeah, you're on a fly list. TSA says you cannot fly anywhere. That's three
[1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:22.560]  airlines. Tucker Carlson covered it last night as well. So it'll be with us about 45
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:25.920]  after last second of the shower. I'm going to hit this huge news with the Texas state
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:30.800]  law hiding and playing abuses, putting mask on kids and forcing him to wear them is illegal.
[1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:36.400]  That's still the damn law. That's coming up. But I want to play a few clips of Chuckie
[1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:42.040]  Schumer and others calling for no fly list after January 6. And then all over Twitter,
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:47.200]  they're calling for me to be put on one. And they're celebrating Nick Foyntes being put
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:51.920]  on one. This is so dangerous because we're all Nick Foyntes. Now they'll put everybody
[1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:55.800]  on these. That's what the social credit score is. That's what the vaccine passports are.
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:08:00.720]  And these fools are going along with it. But a lot of liberals are finally waking up. It's
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:05.520]  finally gone too far. Even Bill Maher is against the COVID lockdown and admits it's exaggerated
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:10.240]  fraud. And the Democrats think 20 million people died. Something 200 million died. Biden says
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:16.440]  200 million died in the U.S. 2 million haven't died worldwide. So here's the no fly list
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:20.320]  being called for by the leader of the Senate. But then they say Nick Foyntes is making it
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:24.480]  up. Democrats celebrate Nick Foyntes on a no fly list. But it's cough gas. They won't
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:29.080]  tell you why. But then the Democrats say it's great. We love it. Plus you weren't. You
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:32.360]  understand? That's the double thing. Oh, you deserve it. You little bastard. We hope you
[1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:36.360]  go to prison. We hope Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones are put in prison. It's all over Twitter.
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:40.520]  Top trending put us in prison. Kill us murder us. All this. But all it does is bring more
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:44.280]  attention to what we're doing, you little monsters in your little sick echo chamber.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:50.160]  So here's the imaginary. Nobody's being censored. Nobody's being put on no fly list. 5G doesn't
[1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:58.160]  cause cancer. The vaccines work. All of it lies. Here it is. So we know that many stormed
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:05.000]  and breached the capital just days ago, and then they traveled afar. They're on airplanes
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:10.680]  and some were arrested when they arrived at airports. One person was arrested as far away
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:17.720]  as Hawaii. And there are many examples of travel and we have seen online and the authorities
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:24.880]  have seen online desires to come back to Washington and to go to other places to cause more trouble
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:34.600]  and more violence. And there are many examples of this kind of travel. There are many examples
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:45.600]  of this kind of travel. So here we are today and we are concerned about these people getting
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:53.880]  back on airplanes and doing more violence. And so he today ahead of a concern for ahead
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:10:01.120]  of the concern for possible future attacks. And with the law on our side, we are to say
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:07.560]  that these insurrectionists, many of whom are known to be at large should not be able
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:15.440]  to hop on a flight. We are today. We are here today because the folks, the people, the insurrectionists
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:22.360]  who breach the U.S. capital fall under the definition of threats to the homeland and
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:29.160]  should be immediately added to the TSA no fly list. I'm not going to play the other Congress
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:32.480]  people because we've got Nick Fuentes here and he's really the man of the hour, the first
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:37.920]  big domino to fall here. But understand all the big apparatus of enemy combat and secret
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.120]  arrest torture is now us. And then now it's oh, not just if you went in the capital. I
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:45.360]  mean, if you're convicted and then they think you're going to plan another terror attack,
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:49.480]  you still have to process. Now people that are under suspicion can't fly. But now Nick
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.640]  Fuentes wasn't even inside. He's on a no fly list. This is what they want. This is
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:59.080]  the control. The real threat to the homeland is Chuckie Schumer, that un-American monster.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.760]  So I guess they're getting what they want. Nick Fuentes, this is a big national international
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:07.440]  story right now. Give us the latest developments when we come back. We'll show the footage
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:11.440]  you shot at a third airline telling you you're on a no fly list for those in denial. This
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:13.600]  is insane. Thanks for joining us.
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:18.000]  Yeah. Well, thank you so much for having me here again today. Well, the latest development
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.200]  is that a lot of people are investigating this and looking into it. I saw that in particular
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.880]  Elijah Shaper has called the TSA, the DHS, and the FBI. And he's reported there at Blaze
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.520]  TV, which is formerly CRTV and Blaze Network. And I guess that he talked to all these different
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:40.160]  alphabet agencies and not one of them could confirm or deny my placement on the no travel
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.720]  list. Every single one of them said, it's confidential information and we can't share
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:47.960]  that with you. Yeah, that's cough. Yes. We can't tell you why you're on the secret
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:53.200]  list. Well, they can't even tell you that you are on the secret list. I mean, that's
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:57.920]  the thing. You know, I tried to produce proof yesterday of me being on the no fly list because
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:01.840]  some had doubted me. I actually went out and booked another flight at a different airport
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:06.480]  with a different airline to a different destination. And they wouldn't let me on that flight. And
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:11.040]  I filmed it to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt that I am on some kind of a list. But
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.200]  the thing is, even I called the TSA and I asked the people who refused me boarding on
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:20.720]  the plane and they say they can't confirm or deny that I'm on a no fly list. And I guess
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:24.960]  this is just the standard procedure. They put you on a list. They don't have to charge
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:28.800]  you. They don't have to convict you. There's no due process. They don't have to tell you
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:32.440]  that you're on the list. They just tell you can't board a plane. And then even then they
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:37.640]  can't confirm or deny. I guess it's just up to the imagination. So it is Kafka asking.
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:41.840]  We're in this weird situation where we're in limbo. We have no redress. You know, there's
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:46.080]  no way to get an appeal on this. You don't even know that you're on a list like this.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:51.960]  So it's me, a private citizen, a private individual going up against the entire bureaucracy, the
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:56.080]  entire national security apparatus of the United States. And I guess I just got to figure
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:57.720]  it out now for myself.
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:04.240]  Well, I forgot until you got here live with us that my lawyer, he's a famous criminal lawyer,
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:09.200]  also civil rights lawyer. Norm Pattis is authorized to practice law all over the United States.
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:16.760]  He actually wants to represent you. And I think it's for free. But we should definitely
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:22.080]  try to get him on with you today, probably here on there in the last segment. If that
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:24.240]  works, we're going to go to break and come back when Nick pointe says we're going to
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:28.480]  play the footage. And I'm going to try to give him the floor to talk about what this
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.160]  means to him, where this is going, but didn't go in the capital, didn't call for the breach
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:36.720]  of the capital. But because he went all over the country with me, calling for election
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.840]  fraud investigation, which is totally normal. They say they want him to never fly again.
[1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:44.120]  They're also all over Twitter. We've got some examples we'll show you calling for him to
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.360]  be put in prison and killed. And that is allowed to stay up on Twitter. So this is very, very
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:57.920]  dangerous mob psychology, malice, Russian revolution type crap. 170 years ago, the British
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:04.480]  royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:08.200]  That grew into the robber barons and then into the eugenics movement, Kettler. And of
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:12.080]  course, the rest is history. Our film, in game, Blukin for global enslavement has been
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:17.600]  censored on Amazon and many other big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:22.360]  of the charts. It's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy. Ladies and gentlemen,

[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:32.720]  available for years at infowarstore.com. We're selling it for $14.95 for one copy as low

[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:52.200]  fake virus and so much more. That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than

[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:05.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:23.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're going to fix this planet. We're going to fix
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:30.560]  our country by fixing ourselves first in the place of God. It's an inside job. Like it
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:37.240]  always is. Nick Pointes is here, placed on a no fly list by American and by Delta. Then
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:41.800]  he went to Southwest Airlines last night to shoot the video. He wasn't obnoxious about
[1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:44.360]  it. He didn't shoot it right in their face, but I think he should probably go back and
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:48.800]  wear a hidden camera. I know Tucker Carlson and others want to see this footage for themselves.
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.080]  We had a reporter up there right now. We would go with him, but he got it done. He went to
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:57.960]  a third airport, I mean, third terminal at the airport of O'Hare, and this is the footage
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:03.280]  of them confirming what he told us. Here it is.
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:04.280]  You guys got that.
[1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:23.960]  Hey, I'm sorry. What did you say to talk to you down there? Oh, just like a security
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:28.400]  guy. But I'm not sure they'll have an answer for you. Okay. And there's no way I can get
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.400]  on this plane. No, you cannot. They're not letting you fly with Southwest. With Southwest.
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:37.560]  I'm not sure about their airline. Delta, maybe? I'm not sure. Okay. I know that with
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:42.080]  the TSA numbers. I'm not sure if you block them all just so no flight list. Did they
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:48.880]  give you a reason? No. It's a no-fly list, you said? I'm not sure. Okay. They just told
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:56.440]  me that you're not allowed to fly. Okay. That's all they told me. Okay. Bye. Thank you.
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:02.320]  So there's the proof. Great job, Nick Fuentes, part of that long day yesterday. And Obama
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:05.560]  did this to members of Congress, if you remember, to see if you could get away with it. And
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:11.760]  they were told, you can't find out why you're on it or if you're on it. So Nick, lay out
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.160]  what's happening here, where this is going, what you think should happen. Because obviously
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:19.480]  it's a test. If Congress doesn't take action, if we don't take action, your civil rights,
[1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:24.560]  your rights as a citizen have been raped by a secret agency, a secret process. This is
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:31.400]  the real terror threat. This is the real evil. My God, this is true tyranny. Well, yeah,
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.600]  it's the true terror from the government. And you know, we define terrorism these days
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:40.400]  in terms of non-state actors or militant groups or something. But we know that in the French
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:44.520]  Revolution and in the Russian Revolution, the terror comes from the state. And that's
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:48.680]  what we have right now as a state of terror. And I talked about this a little bit yesterday
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:53.720]  when Michael Sherwin, who was handling all the capital charges, went on 60 Minutes. He
[1:18:53.720 --> 1:19:00.040]  said to himself explicitly, they were charging the internet celebrities first in connection
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:04.280]  with the capital to create a shock and awe effect. And he said that they did that deliberately
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:08.920]  to intimidate people to not protest. And this is an extension of that. This is an escalation
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:13.360]  of that. Taking people, like you said earlier, who have not been convicted, people who have
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.560]  not been charged, people who have not even done anything wrong. You know, in my case,
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:22.000]  I'm somebody who didn't even get inside the capital. And the FBI knows that. And the DOJ
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.680]  knows that. They know that because they looked at people's geo-location on their phones and
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:30.880]  they looked at all the surveillance footage, if they could place me at the capital, they
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.600]  would have by now, and they would have charged me and convicted me. So they know that there
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.560]  was no wrongdoing on my part of the capital. Nevertheless, like you said, they went through
[1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:44.520]  this shadowy process. Nobody knows how it works. There's no due process. They don't
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:48.760]  even tell you about it. They put me through the shadowy process where now I'm on some
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:54.040]  kind of a watch list or a no fly list. I don't know the half of it. But all I know is that
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:58.160]  now I can't travel domestically on an airplane. And this is something where, you know, I saw
[1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:02.800]  some liberal people and some other people on Twitter saying, well, you know, flying
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:07.440]  on an airplane is a privilege, not a right. And I'm thinking a privilege. We're talking
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:11.320]  about the freedom of movement here. We're talking about the ability to travel across
[1:20:11.320 --> 1:20:15.880]  the country in a short and a reasonable amount of time. I mean, what if I wanted to go and
[1:20:15.880 --> 1:20:19.760]  visit a friend of mine in Phoenix? What if I wanted to go and, you know, whatever, whatever
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:20.760]  reason, whatever.
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:24.120]  What if you had a business arrangement you had to go deal with? What if you had to visit
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:29.840]  a sick family member? This is absolute internal passports, internal checkpoints, but the borders
[1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:33.920]  are wide open and they give children to people that are child molesters with no background
[1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.120]  check. This is a defunct, bankrupt, criminal government.
[1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.640]  That's right. That's right. And it is internal checkpoints. That's exactly what it is. They're
[1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:46.800]  creating sort of this tiered system where you've got some people who have all the rights and
[1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:51.320]  privileges and the laws don't exactly apply and they don't have to pay their taxes and
[1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:52.320]  everything.
[1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:56.280]  And we know who that is. You know, Black Lives Matter is out there and they storm capitals.
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:01.600]  They stormed the Iowa state capitol earlier this month, earlier in April. And I don't
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.080]  think that even got any press coverage, but they could storm that capitol. They don't have
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:09.440]  the FBI breathing down their necks. And I don't even think they get charged for that.
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:13.720]  Trump supporters fly out to Washington, DC. Some of them enter. Some of them don't enter.
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:18.480]  It doesn't matter. Nevertheless, those people are not now allowed to buy firearms. Those
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:23.520]  people are not allowed to fly on planes. Those people are often the subject of FBI raids,
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:28.360]  surveillance, investigation. And so what it is now is if you are a political dissenter
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:34.400]  and that's what it is, if you dissent against the American regime, against the Biden government,
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:40.240]  against the liberal consensus and their ideology, now you are a target and an enemy of the government.
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:45.760]  And that happens in Russia. That happens in China. That happens in authoritarian countries.
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:49.720]  That happens in North Korea. But America was supposed to be different. And I think a lot
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:55.480]  of people still think that. When we lecture China and Russia about Alexei Navalny in Russia,
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:00.080]  we lecture China about the Uyghurs. There's this perception that here we are rocking in
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:04.720]  the free world and they can't handle our freedom over there. They can't handle all our liberty
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:09.480]  and freedom in Eurasia where they have to deal with autocratic tyrants and they have
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:15.000]  a controlled media and everything. And with each passing day in America, we wake up and
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:20.240]  it's more and more like the Soviet Union. It's more and more like China or North Korea.
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:25.520]  And so they're really losing that moral authority. And the good thing about America is that when
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:31.120]  they do this, it undermines the foundational sort of ideological core of the country. They're
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:36.840]  undermining the social contract. And you alluded to this earlier. As they press dissidents,
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:42.400]  this has a huge capacity to backfire. Because unlike China and unlike Russia, the entire
[1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:48.280]  American nation, the entire American project is founded on the social contract of the Constitution.
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:51.520]  That's right. It's one thing to take Russian presidents or Chinese peasants that have been
[1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:55.960]  under slavery for 5,000 years in the case of the Chinese, 300, 400 years in the case
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:00.400]  of the Russians. Great people, but no history of freedom. And to take us with a spoiled rot
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:03.960]  in the history of freedom used to these rights, there's going to be a large portion of people
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:08.160]  that aren't going to go along. Sure, the little moron leftist drug addict devil worshipers
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:14.520]  are, but not us. It's not going to go well. Exactly. Exactly. Right. The American people,
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:18.320]  they through the consent to the government, because they support the government, that's
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:23.200]  what gives the government legitimacy. The government's authority rests on two things.
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:28.280]  And that's their ability to exercise power, which is they have guns, they have the military.
[1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:31.840]  So if they want you to do something, they could force you to a gunpoint. The other,
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:36.000]  and this is foundational. The other main thing is the legitimacy of the government. The government
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.680]  requires people to believe that their authority and their exercise of authority is legitimate.
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:47.320]  That is the basis of their power is that they've got the means to compel people and that people
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:52.640]  believe that when they compel people, there's legitimacy to that. When the American regime,
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:58.560]  run by bureaucrats, run by national security apparatus, starts to target political dissenters,
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:02.680]  specifically the 75 million people that voted for Trump or the thousands of people that
[1:24:02.680 --> 1:24:07.880]  rallied on January 6th, you're undermining the legitimacy of the government to rule,
[1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:11.520]  undermining its authority. And this is actually a very positive thing. And I think you said
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:16.280]  this earlier too, people are recognizing you and they're saying, hey, Alex Jones was right.
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:19.800]  When he was talking about the chemicals in the water and he was talking about people
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.880]  transfusing the blood of younger people, hey, he seems to be right. More and more people
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:27.840]  are waking up. And when they see that political dissenters are being targeted, they say the
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:32.160]  government has no legitimacy and then people start to open their mind to what needs to
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.160]  happen next. That's right. Nick Foyntes is here with us. He's on the no fly list. And
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:42.680]  when we come back, remember that the Republican ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee,
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:49.560]  Nunez said that they are having the CIA spy on Americans to plan to attack us. It's totally
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:54.600]  illegal. It's totally criminal. We'll come back and talk about that on the other side.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:00.240]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement made 14 years ago, accurately predicted the globalist
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:06.680]  takeover using the great reset and the threat of a virus. This film is now more important
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.400]  than ever. I noticed just a few months ago that suddenly the limited supply we had at
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:16.880]  infowarstore.com had sold out and people were really talking about the documentary because
[1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:21.400]  major platforms like Amazon had banned it because the globalists had openly criticized
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:27.880]  the film like the New York Times. And so we printed 20,000 copies. Now back in print
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:32.800]  and in less than two weeks, we've already sold half of them. This is very, very exciting.
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:37.680]  We're selling them close to cost and 3.95 a piece for you buy them in bulk or 14.95
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:41.760]  you buy them individually. There is a zero country code on it, meaning you can copy
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:46.520]  this anywhere in the world. Get it. Turn copies. Share it with everyone. It's blowing people
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:50.560]  away. It's evergreen. They predicted it all. In-game blueprint for global enslavement. Available

[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:26.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:31.880]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future, not a future that
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:39.120]  will be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:44.440]  what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted
[1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:49.840]  the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:55.760]  has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:30:11.200]  of human freedom. But like everyone in this world, logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:17.840]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth. He's a citizen of the state
[1:30:17.840 --> 1:30:23.520]  but will soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of flesh and because he has
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:39.080]  some mind. Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone.
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:43.960]  I have been told and I talked about it earlier last hour that they are intending to indict
[1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:50.520]  Trump and I know people in the Justice Department that are absolutely saying we live in the
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:57.320]  Soviet Union. But breaking, Biden DOJ raids really Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and
[1:30:57.320 --> 1:31:03.320]  offices up on infowars.com. Federal investigators in the Biden Justice Department. They didn't
[1:31:03.320 --> 1:31:10.480]  raid Hunter Biden. They didn't raid Biden for the president for his saying, you know,
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:13.600]  I told him I'd take a billion dollars away unless they dropped the investigation in Ukraine
[1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:17.800]  and some of the best they did. No, no, not for all those criminal admissions. Federal
[1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:22.160]  investigators in the Biden Justice Department. They shoot a search warrant on Trump's lawyer
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:28.080]  Rudy Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office Wednesday morning. The DOJ employee sees the
[1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:32.320]  former NYC mayor's electronic devices and hopes to learn more about any dealings he
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:38.480]  may have had with Ukraine. Ah, the New York Times broke the story. Prosecutors obtained
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:43.440]  the warrant as part of an investigation whether Mr. Giuliani broke lobbying laws as Mr. President's
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:48.200]  personal lawyer. So they're going to try to flip him against Trump, just like others.
[1:31:48.200 --> 1:31:55.280]  This is incredible, ladies and gentlemen. So there you go. And of course, Giuliani knows
[1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:00.800]  all the secrets about 9-11. You name it, but the globalists don't care. This is about persecution.
[1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:06.280]  It's about scorched earth. It's insane. Nick Fuentes put on a no fly list here in the
[1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:12.040]  New Soviet Union, the U.S.S.A. I was thinking about Rahm Emanuel, the clips on YouTube where
[1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:17.720]  he said 12 years ago, he said, listen, we'll put conservatives on a no fly list. Those
[1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:21.080]  are conservative. And if you're on a no fly list, we'll take your second amendment. No
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:24.880]  judge, no jury. Well, that's kind of like the red flag laws on steroids. Now that's
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:29.120]  what they're doing with this. And Laura Loomer can't get a gun. No judge, no jury. She's
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:34.600]  beyond the no fly list. When she flew back into the United States a month ago from visiting
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:39.400]  friends that was Costa Rica on a vacation, they interrogated her about her political
[1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:45.480]  views. She wasn't even at the Capitol or DC. So this is really, really dangerous. And Congress
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:49.840]  won't act on the censorship. They won't act on anything. They just sit there dead in the
[1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:53.520]  water. Nick Fuentes, why is that?
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:57.680]  Well, ultimately, the people that are in Congress aren't facing the same things that we are
[1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:01.160]  here on the ground. You know, I think we have to consider that the people in Congress are
[1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:06.200]  a part of the American regime. And you take a look at somebody like Liz Cheney in particular
[1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:10.480]  and other Republicans in the House and the Senate, these people aren't even conservative
[1:33:10.480 --> 1:33:14.400]  in any meaningful way. You might as well just call them Democrats. And you might as well
[1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:18.880]  call them all a part of the same globalist regime that are doing these things, elected,
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:23.320]  not elected. They're all part of the system. They're all a part of the DC cartel. So, you
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:27.240]  know, actually, those are the last people that I would have expected to be advocates
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:31.600]  for this kind of stuff, advocates for civil rights. And particularly was interesting after
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:38.360]  the capital situation on January 6th. It was both Republicans and Democrats that condemned
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:44.440]  the protests and specifically condemned Trump for the aftermath on January 6th. And I think
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:48.400]  it was very noteworthy that Chuck Schumer said, well, we're putting people on the no
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:53.840]  fly list because they were able to fly from somewhere as far away as Hawaii to our capital.
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:58.240]  We're going to put them on the no fly list. And in other words, it was almost like a vindictive
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:03.120]  thing because, of course, all the politicians are in DC and they were in that capital when
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:07.680]  people started breaking down the doors and the windows and everything. And so it's almost
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:13.040]  like this petty vindictive vengeful thing where they say, oh, you think that you're
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:17.280]  going to come into the people's house without permission? You think that you can rally outside
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:23.080]  the capital and force our hand at that time challenging the electors on January 6th? Well,
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:28.080]  we'll show you. You can't buy a firearm and now you can't get on a plane. Good luck getting
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:34.360]  to our capital if you can't get on a plane. They're doing it outside of law. If someone's
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:39.680]  convicted of a felony, OK, then they're restricted. But no, not from flying on a plane. Illegal
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:43.760]  aliens are allowed to come in with kidnapped children and the FBI just waves it because
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:49.640]  they're God. This is literally dictatorship of the Democrat bureaucracy. It is. Well,
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:53.960]  and that's a very important contrast with what's happening at the border in particular
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:58.920]  because and I pointed this out on Twitter a couple of months ago at the end of the day,
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:03.080]  what the people did at the capital amounted to trespassing. There were some actions. You
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:07.800]  know, there was some vandalism. They did assault some police officers. But by and large, there's
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:13.040]  been over 400 people charged so far for the most part. And I would challenge anybody to
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:18.520]  contest this. Almost all those people were charged only for trespassing and obstruction
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:24.000]  of justice or or disorderly conduct. These are misdemeanor charges. What do you call it
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:30.560]  when a foreigner from Nicaragua or Honduras walks across our border illegally? It's trespassing.
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:34.720]  The people at the capital, the worst crime that they committed for the most part was
[1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:38.920]  that they were somewhere where it's illegal for them to be. Is that not what all these
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:43.880]  people from Honduras and El Salvador are doing in our country? But when it comes to people
[1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:49.400]  trespassing in the people's house, trespassing in the people's house, you know, in the Congress,
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:53.520]  the House of Representatives and the Senate, well, in that case, FBI is going to come and
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:58.200]  raid your house. They're going to arrest you with 100 marshals with guns pointed at your
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:02.720]  head. They're going to throw you in solitary confinement while you await trial before you're
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.200]  even convicted. And when you trespass into our country, when you trespass into America
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:13.080]  at the southern border in some place that doesn't matter to politicians like Texas or New Mexico
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:17.600]  or Arizona, well, in that case, they put you up at a hotel, literally. And they put you
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:23.080]  on a plane and they fly you to Michigan and Minnesota and Wisconsin. And our own employee,
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:27.640]  Sam Montoya, who went into the capital and shot footage, didn't do anything violent.
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:31.640]  He did it as his own, as a citizen. That's just a fact. I'm not protecting myself because
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.080]  he did it on his own. I would have told him not to, but he didn't commit any crime, in
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:39.720]  my view. They sent 30 FBI agents and federal marshals to his house and the raid on him.
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:46.000]  I mean, this is just out of control. Well, and on that in particular, I saw that story
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:51.200]  and it was outrageous because there were other journalists inside the Capitol too. I remember
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:55.960]  there was a footage that came out. I think it was a Washington Post journalist or New
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:37:00.520]  York Times, but somebody was inside the rotunda of the Capitol, one journalist from one of
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:06.000]  these mainstream publications. National Geographic, all of them. Yeah. Well, in this one in particular,
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.960]  he was caught on the hot mic saying, like, wow, I didn't think we did in here. Now, to
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:14.680]  my knowledge, none of these journalists from National Geographic or Washington Post or
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:18.960]  any of the mainstream media that was involved in this, none of those people got charged.
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:24.200]  And what that tells you is that it's political. People that are documenting this thing from,
[1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:29.240]  if you want to say it's Gateway Pundit or Info Wars, Sam Montoya, people that are not approved
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:32.600]  by the system, well, those people, they're going to throw the book at them. And those
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:36.720]  people, they're going to send the marshals to their house. Guns pointed at their head,
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:40.160]  raid their stuff and everything. If you're in the New York Times, well, then you're okay.
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:45.000]  You make a phone call. Point is, they're all in on the system, the politicians, the media,
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:49.040]  the bureaucrats, they're all a part of the American regime. It's a big club and we're
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:50.040]  not in it.
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:55.360]  And by the way, I'm not ignoring what you're saying, Nick. You're absolutely right. I was
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:01.320]  just talking to Roger Stone about the whole Giuliani thing. So Roger, I'll call you right
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:05.360]  now. What do you make of this whole climate? I mean, this is like a Soviet takeover.
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:10.720]  It is. It's exactly like a Soviet takeover. And there used to be the pretext in this
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:15.440]  country, there used to be this facade or this, you know, there's this premise that this is
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:19.680]  a free country. This is America. And it's laughable even Joe Biden, when he's running
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:25.800]  for office in 2020, he says, this is America, man, come on, we're better than this or whatever.
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:29.360]  And it's like, no, we're not better than this. We're really not that much better than Russia.
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:33.520]  We're not that much better than China. Compare the treatment of Alexei Navalny and the Uyghurs
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.640]  to me and the Trump supporters at the Capitol virtually no different. Well, and he also
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:44.200]  told when he was in office two weeks, he also told CNN, he said, Oh, let him take over Hong
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:47.760]  Kong, Taiwan, let him put the Uyghurs in camps. That's just what China does. We'll be right
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:39:09.360]  back with Nick Fuentes and a top lawyer. I want to talk to him. Stay with us.

[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:58.920]  and South Carolina, go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:03.840]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:07.760]  wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:14.560]  amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:19.800]  saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:25.480]  defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:31.240]  where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:38.080]  to be afflicted and shall kill you. And you shall be hated of all nations for my name's
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:43.600]  sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:48.280]  another. That's right where we're at, brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:52.520]  of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:41:00.360]  created this country. Last week, I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission. They said
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:04.880]  to me, he said, Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:09.120]  and people dying from it and people getting sick. How do I reach out to my friends and
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.640]  family and explain to them and to warn them about the danger? And I said to him something
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:19.280]  very profound because it's so true. Trust your gut, trust your spirit with the Bible tells
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.200]  us. And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:30.200]  vaccine? And his answer was no, they don't feel good about it. So go with your gut. Well,
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:34.800]  let me ask you again. How does your gut feel about getting the storeable food? How does
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:38.440]  your gut feel about getting out in the countryside? How does your gut feel about getting guns
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:42.360]  and ammo to protect yourself? Well, I know what your gut's telling you. We have the best
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:46.600]  storeable food, the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going to find 10% off

[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:00.960]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:06.840]  consenting patients, hundreds of hospitals in the US injected healthy men, women and
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:13.560]  children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non therapeutic to lethal
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:18.360]  killing many of the test subjects. In game blueprint for global enslavement is one of
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:22.560]  the most important films ever made. 14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulder
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.440]  Burnt Groups activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.240]  The film now is more important than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year,
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:36.480]  they banned it. We have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com. Selling them as low
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.000]  as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk and there's a zero country code. So anywhere on
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:44.440]  the planet, you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:50.640]  Revere's 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide in game blueprint for global enslavement available
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:43:01.480]  now at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:26.280]  Our republic really is ending before our very eyes. Every basic system of freedom is being
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:33.840]  abolished, is being abandoned, is being thrown overboard. To process the right to self-defense,
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:37.800]  the right to have a border, the right to as a nation to even exist. The government's
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:43.280]  giving tens of thousands of dollars for illegal aliens to come here. Democrat jurisdictions
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:48.600]  are letting them vote. The FBI gives small children, minimum kidnapped, two pedophiles
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:53.480]  and wave the background checks. I mean, the bottom has fallen out. We're being looted.
[1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:58.280]  Nick Foyntez is here with us. Constitutional lawyer, Norm Pattis is here. He knows the
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:06.200]  procedures and process to fight the draconian Soviet Kafka-esque 1984 Orwellian no fly list.
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:10.280]  It was for the terrorists. Remember, now it's for peaceful journalists like Nick Foyntez
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:14.080]  and I guess Alex Jones. This is a big test. I mean, we already let all the other tests
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:17.920]  fail. We already let all the censorship happen and everything else. So now they took a parrot
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:21.560]  testing the perch. They'll put their beak on it versus see if it'll hold the light.
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.760]  They're getting ready to climb up on top of us even more. So we'll talk about ways to
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:30.240]  redress this. Where are the courts? Where are the states in a moment? But briefly, we
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:33.520]  won't be here if you don't fund us and you have been funding us. I appreciate that. We've
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:37.480]  got a lot of work needs to be done. Plus we have products you need. We have rocket rest
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:41.080]  is one of the strongest natural sleep aids you're going to find out there. It's got the
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:47.200]  five HTP, five milligrams of melatonin and a bunch of other stuff. It's all natural,
[1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:52.000]  very powerful. We have the liquid version of it that also has valerian root down and
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:55.520]  out. That is both those products are 40% off despite the fact they're selling out. They're
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:01.280]  both new products. People really love them. I want you to get a chance to use them infowarstore.com.
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.160]  Your immune system needs deep restful sleep. That's what this does. This is another big
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:09.840]  part of that equation. The other part is all your vitamins, all your essential minerals,
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:14.440]  that is in the great product we have that is vitamin refusion still discounted despite
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:20.480]  the fact it is selling out and winter sun as well. All those at infowarstore.com and

[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.480]  It is incredible. We haven't had it for months and months. I was off of it. I started gobbling
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:36.720]  it last week. You see I've already had my face go down. I've already lost some inflammation
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:42.400]  just having this really super powerful tumor formula from infowarstore.com.
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:47.560]  Nick Feintes, other points you'd like to add briefly. I want to bring Norm Paterson here.
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:50.880]  He can question you. He can talk about the law, talk about history, some of the time
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:55.000]  we have and what the redress is. Anything else you'd like to add? Nick Feintes, you
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  should also tell folks about your excellent nightly news show.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:04.400]  Yeah. Well, thanks a lot. You can check me out at americafirst.live. I do a nightly show
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:08.960]  of money through Friday at eight o'clock central time. I guess I'd just like to add,
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.000]  when I said this on my show last night, too, it's very outrageous that the government has
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:17.040]  put me on an O-Fly list without due process, without committing a crime and everything.
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:20.560]  But what's a little bit more interesting is that conservatives, I think a lot of them
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:25.000]  have been even reluctant to say anything about my situation. They've been reluctant to say
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:30.600]  my name, reluctant to say anything about the fact that I've been put on an O-Fly list.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:34.440]  Even the ones that do, I've noticed a lot of them say something to the effect of, you
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:39.120]  know, it doesn't matter what you think of Nick Feintes or his reprehensible views. I
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.960]  don't agree with him on everything. But I'm thinking we're under attack. We're being
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:48.000]  crushed under the heel of the federal government and all of their corporate backers, right?
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.760]  The bankers and everything like that. We're being crushed to dust for our political views
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:55.720]  and people say, well, I'm not racist, but I think that's a bad thing. I don't agree
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:59.880]  with this guy, but that's a bad thing. So I mean, to me, that's almost even more outrageous
[1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:04.400]  that I'm put on an O-Fly list for my political views and conservatives won't talk about
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:09.080]  me being put on an O-Fly list for my political views because they're afraid of getting banned
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:13.200]  themselves. That's how this coward thing works. They pick somebody, they watch people not
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.960]  stand up for them, just like the old Nazi Germany story of the guy that didn't stand
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:22.320]  up for this group, that group. By the time they got to him, there was nobody left.
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:26.680]  Exactly, exactly. And that's just it. It's that old trope of, you know, at first I didn't
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:30.600]  say anything about this one because I wasn't, I wasn't a groiper. I didn't say anything
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:35.480]  about Al Jones because I wasn't an info warrior. And then when they came for you, nobody had
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:39.940]  anything left to say, right? There was nobody left to say anything. So, and then for conservatives
[1:47:39.940 --> 1:47:44.880]  in particular, that's very salient because it started with years and years ago, people
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:48.800]  that nobody really liked. It started with people that were really out there and now
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:52.840]  it's President Trump. And now it's people like James O'Keefe and Stephen Crowder. You
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:56.600]  know, in other words, it went from people that a lot of people found distasteful or
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:00.680]  controversial. And now it's people that are moderate. Now it's people that are now it's
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:05.240]  people that are now it's people that are America first and 20 years ago, you'd be just a moderate
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:09.120]  Republican. Now you're a super evil person because you don't want to sterilize five-year-olds.
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.720]  Let's bring in Norm Patis, famous criminal and civil rights lawyer. I know he wants
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:16.680]  to work with you. So I'll give you his number when you're off in about 10 minutes. Norm,
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:21.520]  watching this, watching this unfold. What do you make of this?
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:25.840]  I'm stunned if I, you know, again, you and I spoke last night. I haven't spoken to Mr.
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:30.280]  Fuentes. Nice to meet you, Nick. My understanding is that he appeared at an airport and was
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:33.640]  not permitted to board a plane. So he went to another terminal and was not permitted
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:38.520]  to board and then was told he's on a no fly list. My understanding is he went back to
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:43.640]  another airline last night at O'Hare and they said, no, you're on a no fly list. So and
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.200]  my understanding is he was present in the Capitol on January 6th, but no one is alleged
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:51.120]  to engage in criminal behavior. So he wasn't in the Capitol. He was outside the Capitol.
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:54.960]  Okay. He was at the Capitol, but not in the building. So he's exercising his right to
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:59.680]  petition for redress of grievances and to associate with others on the Capitol under
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.600]  a lawful permit. There is no justification for placing him on the no fly list. These
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:09.640]  lists were created in the wake of the September 11th controversy and they have grown over
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:15.440]  time. There is something called the terrorist screening database and it is the aggregation
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:21.320]  of intelligence service reports that are shared with one central office and presumably some
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:27.400]  bureaucrat somewhere has made a finding that Mr. Fuentes is a threat to national security
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:33.840]  or a potential terrorist. Mr. Fuentes has no right to see the report. He has a limited
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:40.800]  right to challenge this. The law is that the government can hide by neither confirming
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:45.640]  nor denying his presence on the list, by neither confirming nor denying how these
[1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:50.160]  journalists have called and done this and recorded it and they will neither confirm
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:56.440]  nor deny. Well, that's a famous dodge that was once used to hide the identity and by
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:04.360]  which the CIA used a submarine to recover, a ship to recover, I think the Gomorrah excuse,
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:08.680]  to recover parts of a sunken submarine. I believe a Chinese submarine, but I don't recall.
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:15.040]  But the point is that we have this secret infrastructure that is unchecked and is unreviewable.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.440]  Now typically a person who wants to appeal at their designation on this list has to take
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:25.320]  their appeal to the DC circuit courts. There's a statute that limits that. But I'm wondering
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:30.640]  whether because this is such a fundamental due process violation, in other words, Mr.
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:35.960]  Fuentes' liberty interest, his right to travel has been limited without any due process,
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:41.040]  without any notice, without any hearing, without a right to review. And the claim is that somehow
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:47.160]  giving him access to data about himself violates national security. I mean, seriously, is that
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:52.360]  what we've come to? When I heard this last night, my jaw dropped because I thought, my goodness,
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:51:00.160]  Chinese social, social scorings has arrived in the United States. If you have disapproved views,
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:03.720]  you're not going to be able to fly. What next? You're not going to be able to get your prescription
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:09.200]  filled or you're going to get a little bit of extra tax assessed on your gasoline when you use
[1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:15.680]  your credit card. Let's not forget for a moment that enormous sums of electronic data, our digital
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:20.320]  footprints are gathered, harvested, and now aggregated and shared with government. And now
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:24.960]  we learn it's the post office. And now we learn the airlines on their owner banning people. I mean,
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:29.120]  we are falling off the cliff of authoritarianism. Norm Pattis, and I'm going to ask Nick this
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:33.160]  next segment, you as well, what needs to happen? What does the Supreme Court need to do? What
[1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:37.080]  a unit? What, how the hell do we, because the left didn't want this for Al Qaeda. And I didn't
[1:51:37.080 --> 1:51:42.280]  either because I knew it would be for us. Now it's for Nick Fuentes. Well, here's an unusual
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:49.120]  wrinkle. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that interstate ground travel is a
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:54.440]  liberty interest, a protected liberty interest under the due process clause, no case has thus far
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:52:01.240]  held that air travel is a protected liberty interest. So somebody's got to bring that case to the
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:06.000]  court and press it to the United States Supreme Court and say, look, guys, this is a small country,
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:11.120]  at least prior to COVID, there were millions of flights per. And that's my next question. So
[1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:14.640]  let me ask you this. We're going to do this segment part of the next. But we're almost out of
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:18.760]  time. What you and Nick need to get together, or if he doesn't use you, another lawyer, what is the
[1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:25.320]  action here to create a case to stop this? Right. So Nick has two options. And whether it's me or
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:29.800]  not, it doesn't matter. But Nick, talk about this with somebody that you trust and whose advice
[1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:35.800]  you can rely on. You should consider filing a notice with the Department of Homeland Security
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:40.960]  challenging your designation and ask for a hearing. When they ignore that or don't give you a
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:45.960]  hearing, then you should take an appeal to the District of Columbia Appellate Court, the Federal
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:50.920]  Circuit Court. There's a statute that says that's the exclusive remedy. Additionally, you should
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:55.720]  consider filing a lawsuit under something called the Ku Klux Klan Act, 42 United States Code,
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:53:02.880]  Section 1983, which gives any person in the United States, aggrieved by a statute or the federal
[1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:07.880]  government, the right to bring an action for money damages and injunctive relief in the federal
[1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:16.560]  courts. There was a decision, and I'll tell you where it was. There was a decision in 2013 in
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:23.560]  Oregon, Latif V. Holder, that was highly critical of the manner in which names were gathered for the
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:26.440]  no-fly list. I will stay there. We got to come back in two minutes. But yeah, they're putting
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:30.080]  three-year-olds on no-fly list, folks. And then they won't let them fly and the kids cry when
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:34.960]  they make a mistake. I mean, it's out of control. It's un-American. It's beyond Soviet. It is a load
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:39.680]  of crap. We have a tyrannical government that stole the election, that's trying to intimidate us to
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:46.000]  shut up, and we won't do it. Hour number three straight ahead. I'm up here working on a Thursday
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:51.400]  night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:56.120]  this incredible crew that has come together over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer, and I
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:54:00.640]  am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:05.280]  love you, and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:10.200]  doesn't matter. You got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:15.880]  children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:20.000]  work with you over the years. And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:26.400]  future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:31.160]  and puts a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:35.240]  with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:40.960]  done. And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully God
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.920]  will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse. God bless. All of the experts agree that

[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:50.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:56:04.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:13.080]  so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:16.720]  All right, Nick Poinches is leaving us here in five minutes. Put on a no fly list. Norm
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:22.000]  Patis just said he's got breaking vaccine news on a case that he is on that just broke. He's
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.480]  one of the top lawyers in the country. He's got irons and a thousand fires. But I wanted to just
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:31.120]  get you guys together to talk about this and how we get pushed back because, again, oh, for
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:37.680]  terrorists, 9-11, oh, a magic group of bureaucrats like out of the movie Brazil, they just put you
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:45.680]  on a list and now you're just on a list. Encapsulating this is an American norm. We need Congress,
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:50.320]  we need the states, we need the courts to act. This is outrageous. I mean, and we know Chuckie
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.360]  Schumer called for basically Trump supporters to be put on no fly list because we might try
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:59.440]  something in the future, but they support Black Lives Matter and Antifa burning the country down.
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:02.400]  Norm, a few comments on that and one closing comments from Nick Poinches.
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:09.360]  People need to stand up and be counted. And if it smells like BS, it looks like BS, it is BS. And
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:14.640]  you need to say something. And there is no such thing as a double standard in the United States.
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:20.000]  Freedom of speech is freedom for all. A Black Lives Matter or Maxine Waters can call for violence
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.320]  if they don't get what you like. And you can call for anti-violence if they try to take from you
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:30.480]  what you've earned. The courts are what I know. I don't know politics, but my view is you need to
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:36.160]  litigate cases in court, press the judiciary to make hard decisions and take your appeals. The
[1:57:36.160 --> 1:57:42.400]  soul of the country is up for grabs. And right now the courts are still open. I defy them to close
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:46.880]  in our face because we'll continue to bring rich every time we see a violation of a fundamental
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:52.960]  right. And Mr. Fuentes' rights were violated. Make no question about it. And him today, you tomorrow.
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:58.320]  That's right. Nick Fuentes, we're all with you. Where do you go next? What do you do next?
[1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:04.480]  Well, I'll be looking into my legal options on this. I obviously want to push back against the
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:10.000]  TSA and hopefully get this overturned. I'd like to be able to fly again. But where we go from here
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:14.720]  is keep on keeping on. You know, I mean, in a lot of ways, and I said this earlier, this is an
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:19.920]  escalation of the same old tactics. And you said it too. The censorship has been going on for four
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:24.640]  years. We weren't able to stop that. Trump administration didn't do much to stop that.
[1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:28.960]  People didn't cover it as much as they should have. And now it's people being put on no-fly list,
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:35.360]  being banned for buying firearms. In some cases, being raided by the FBI. So it's a continuation
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:39.360]  of the same struggle that we've had for a long time, which is against the American regime,
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:44.320]  against the national security apparatus. So immediately I'll be, I think Michelle Malkin
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:48.720]  actually filed the Freedom of Information Act request. I'll be talking to my lawyers to figure
[1:58:48.720 --> 1:58:55.200]  out a solution to this, try and get me back on an airplane sometime soon. And hopefully we could
[1:58:55.200 --> 1:58:59.600]  start to roll back some of this tyranny. I think that, and I said this yesterday on the show,
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:04.240]  the state governments are going to be the place to do this. Unfortunately, you look at the American
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:09.680]  regime, it's almost ubiquitous. It's omnipotent in some ways. And I think the thing that we're
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:13.840]  going to have to count on, and this may sound controversial or something, is that I look at
[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:18.720]  countries like China and Russia. I look at countries like Iran or even Hungary or something. And I
[1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:24.080]  think that it's sad to say, as other countries rise proportionally in global power compared to the
[1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:28.400]  United States, that'll actually be a good thing for American dissidents. Because the problem you
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:32.080]  have now is there's nowhere you can run. There's nowhere you can hide. There's nowhere you can
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:37.360]  go in America where American government can't get your stuff, can't get you, can't find you.
[1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:41.200]  There's nowhere, I believe, in the Western Hemisphere you could go to, unless it's a country
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:46.720]  like Cuba or Venezuela. And there's really nowhere in the world unless you go under the umbrella of
[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:53.200]  a rival power to America. So we have to completely rethink our relationship with the state. It really
[1:59:53.200 --> 1:59:57.520]  is sort of the regime against the American people. And a lot of people don't see it that way.
[1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:02.160]  Well, that's right. The people running our government hate the country, hate God, hate veterans,
[2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:08.160]  hate children. They're just Hollywood trash. That's right. And people, for whatever reason,
[2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:12.160]  they still see the government as us. They say, you know, we, when they talk about the government,
[2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:17.520]  we need to do things. It's not, it's us and it's them. It's those people in that faraway capital
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:22.480]  governing us with an iron fist. And it's us out here under their thumb, totally vulnerable. So
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:27.600]  people have got to stop rationalizing the system, stop rationalizing the police, the military,
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:32.080]  stop rationalizing the State Department and the American regime. We're on our own. It's the American
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:38.240]  people against the world now. All right, Nick Fuentes, God's people talk to you soon. All right.
[2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:41.600]  Thanks a lot. Talk to you soon. Thank you. I'm going to send your number to Norm Pattison,
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:45.920]  vice versa. And I'm going to also try to get you in touch with Carlson. All right. Thank you. There
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:50.640]  goes Nick Fuentes. I'm going to play Rahm Emanuel when he was hit by a stab at the White House calling
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:57.680]  for no fly list for gun owners. Alex Jones here with some really good news. Four of our best selling

[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:07.040]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:21.680]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:30.800]  worldwide, it's Alex Jones. And we are under the emergency COG FEMA government that is human run
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:35.520]  officially under UNESCO. The borders are under human control. Our schools are under human control.
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:41.840]  We are in the grip of a scientific dictatorship. Our old republic is being dissolved by the
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  spider's venom in front of us. Here is Rahm Emanuel, the White House of Staff, 12 years ago,
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:54.400]  saying that they were going to put gun owners basically on no fly list vice versa and then
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:59.760]  extra judicially take your guns. And that's their plan. Now they call it the red flag laws here at
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:08.320]  UNESCO. What do we got to do? Because let's be um, and Sarah's right, people's intimidation
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:13.280]  on this issue is not defined by just republicans. There are democrats intimidated by this issue
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:19.120]  wrongly, but intimidated. They think their politics and their community is such they can't do this.
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:25.120]  The truth is what we need again to get moving on this legislation is put together a crime
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:30.160]  strategy like we had before, which is why we passed the bill today on the cops, putting money back
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:35.680]  into putting police officers on there, getting voices for change, and then making sure that we
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:42.080]  have a president. I cannot put my partisanship aside, a democratic president who will take that
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:48.240]  office and use it to protect the streets and the kids that grow up on those streets and make sure
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:53.280]  that we once again have an assault weapon ban, a Brady bill with the full force of the law on
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:58.320]  the land. Because we need somebody in the Oval Office that moves this Congress. We had an election
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:03.040]  about change. People are clear about the special interests. They are tired of that good luck,
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:07.840]  the special interests caused in Washington. And I think the most simple thing we can do,
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.160]  and we've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election.
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:18.800]  That is, if you are on the no fly list, because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist,
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:26.160]  you cannot buy a handgun in America.
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:30.560]  Norm Pattis, I appreciate you joining us. We've got one of the main guys on the inside of the
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:35.200]  recount in America County joining us with the big developments there next segment. But I wanted
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:41.200]  you to finish up with the end of due process, the whole terrorism apparatus now to be used
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:45.200]  against the American people. The Democrats said we're going to use the CIA against the American
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:49.360]  people. We're going to use the FBI to dismantle Trump supporters. I mean, these are criminal
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:55.120]  declarations. The U.S. prosecutor that was first running things, he had to step down over it,
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:00.240]  said we want to intimidate people. And so these guys are very, very arrogant,
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:03.920]  full of hutzpah, whatever you want to call it, bravada. Just closing comments on that. And then
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:11.520]  you've got some big breaking news on the issue of, well, go ahead and give us that breaking news as
[2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:16.320]  well. All right. So, I mean, just to round out the discussion about the no fly list, this should
[2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:20.240]  terrify everyone. I heard that and I thought, my goodness, am I going to be able to get on my next
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:25.440]  flight? I mean, yesterday, you know, I had a Patreon account that I asked people to support me on.
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:30.560]  I post that on Facebook periodically. It was taken down last night. Why? Is it because I'm
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:36.880]  outspoken? Is it because I appear on info wars? Am I going to be able to get on a plane? Are you
[2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:40.960]  going to be able to get on a plane? We permit government in the name of national security
[2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:46.400]  to keep secret lists of Americans. And we're not told we're on those lists until we're on our way
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:51.600]  to our child's wedding or on our way to sit with a loved one who may be on deaf store. I don't think
[2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:56.320]  we, the people, want to tolerate being governed by secrecy. And I think there ought to be challenges
[2:05:56.320 --> 2:06:02.160]  to the no fly list. What's happened to Mr. Fuentes is breathtaking. If he's on that list, because
[2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:08.240]  of his viewpoint, we really have reached a breaking point. On the breaking news front, Alex,
[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:12.320]  we're going to announce at a press conference in a couple hours that there will be a legal
[2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:19.040]  challenge to Connecticut's decision to ban the religious exemption for children on vaccination.
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:24.800]  Prior to yesterday, if you were a parent of a child who for religious reasons did not want your
[2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:29.600]  child vaccinated, you could make a declaration and they could go to a public school. Governor
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:35.280]  Ned Lamont signed legislation yesterday passed by both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly to
[2:06:35.280 --> 2:06:41.840]  bar or ban the religious exemption. We've been retained by a group of people who believe that
[2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:47.120]  our beliefs about ourselves and the universe come first, government comes second. And among
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:52.400]  the challenges we will raise is we will ask the courts the following. How is it that the substantive
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:58.240]  due process clause has been manipulated in such a way now that it's all right for us to engage in
[2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:04.720]  consensual sodomy? It's all right for men to pretend to be women, but it's not all right for mom and
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:09.680]  dad to say, I don't want you sticking a needle in my son or my daughter for religious reasons.
[2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:16.080]  The door cannot swing both ways. The government is limited in its power. That's right. The left
[2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:20.160]  wants to be able to have sex with their dog and marry it, but they want to put an experimental
[2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:24.880]  secret mRNA vaccine in our children that's already been banned in dozens of countries.
[2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:30.480]  That's right. And so we're going to be announcing at a press conference this afternoon at five
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:34.960]  o'clock that we will soon file litigation. We're working on it right now. Hope to have it filed
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:40.480]  on Monday. And we're going to seek to vindicate the fundamental right of people to believe as they
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:45.680]  will, regardless of what the government says. There is no public health exception to freedom
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:48.960]  of belief in the United States, and that's our position, and we're going to fight for it.
[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:52.400]  Well, they're saying that now about guns. Oh, it's public health because somebody might do
[2:07:52.400 --> 2:07:56.240]  something wrong. You all lose your right. And they're really setting up a medical tyranny.
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:01.920]  You know, the Soviets did that. So do the Nazis. Yeah, a tyranny of virtue. Let me, you know,
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:05.680]  I've told you this before. I think I said it on your very show. I used to be opposed to the
[2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:09.200]  Second Amendment. I'm a criminal defense lawyer. I've seen handguns destroy so many lives and
[2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:13.840]  made my heart ache, but I'll tell you what makes my heart ache even more. Watching on national news
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:18.960]  while cities burn and people are encouraged to engage in mostly peaceful protests at the same
[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:22.560]  time that some of these protesters say, well, we're coming out to your house now. Yeah. How do
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:27.680]  they not put Maxine Waters on a flight list? She says basically go burn down cities. She says get
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:32.240]  violent Maxine Waters calls for violence. She should get convicted. She shouldn't get put on a
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:37.280]  no fly list. I don't think Black Lives Matter should be put on a no fly list. I don't think anybody
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:41.440]  should be put on a no fly list. I mean, freedom is, you know, the freedom to travel is fundamental
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:45.760]  in this country. And I don't want to have to be licensed by the United States government is fit
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:50.720]  to travel from one state to another. I don't want to have to have my speech vetted by the
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:56.000]  government before I enjoy the privileges and immunities of citizenship. We've fought a revolution
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.960]  against Britain over far less than what's going on in our country on a daily basis. I probably
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:05.760]  would have paid a few pennies tax on tea and maybe it'll cut my tea consumption down or just paid a
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:11.040]  little more because it's only a tax on tea. But what I can say where I can travel, who I can
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:16.000]  associate with, how I can educate my children, these are fundamental. And by the way, the red
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.880]  coats were doing all that the tea was just the final straw because they put taxes on everything.
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:26.000]  Norm Pattis. I tell people how they find you was it. Pattis blog.com. Yeah, there's planet
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:30.560]  Pattis blog.com. The foreign law firm is Pattison Smith. We're in New Haven, Connecticut, and I've
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:37.920]  got a new podcast called Law and Legitimacy. So stop in. We need to build a community of people
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:42.400]  who are speaking out, speaking together and joining together. Norm, we're doing it. We love
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:46.880]  you. Thank you, Norm. Great guy, really smart guy, great patriot. All right, I'm going to break
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:52.320]  and I've got our next guest on who I'm told he's a very well-spoken guy. I've seen one of his shows,
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:58.560]  Daniel McCarthy, is a prime mover in the middle of the recount in Maricopa County and the Republican
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:02.960]  Party and all the battles and the inside stuff. He's been drafted by the Republican resistance
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:09.120]  to help, I mean, lead a lot of this. So he's a great guest. He'll give us the latest on the
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:14.400]  Democrats trying to block this and how hysterical they are. And why are they hysterical? Well,
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:18.320]  it's because they say that no one, you know, showed any evidence of fraud. The courts never
[2:10:18.320 --> 2:10:22.960]  allowed that. All we have is evidence, like a USPS driver saying, I have a truck full of
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:28.480]  Mark the same for Joe Biden, uncreased ballots in Pennsylvania. I mean, it got you people pulling
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:32.400]  out ballots from underneath the deals when they shut things down. So there's a water main broke
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:36.400]  and then they're just cramming the same ballots in over and over again for Biden and Georgia.
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:41.280]  They stole it. And we're not going to go away no matter how you censor is where the FBI blows
[2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:46.240]  the doors open. I'm not scared of that. I'm scared of not standing up and not speaking out.
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:50.880]  So if you want to burn me up like Waco, I'll just pour gasoline on me. I won't resist FBI
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:54.320]  because I'll be a martyr. I will not resist. If they come and kill me, I did not resist them.
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:58.880]  I will sit or the FBI could just blow my head off, slip my throat, gouge my eyeballs out with
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:03.280]  poor gasoline on me. I will just Christ like taking FBI that they're probably going to come kill me
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:08.240]  though and say I resisted. It's a lie. They'll shotgun my ass up against the wall. I win. They
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:12.960]  lose. I'm not a pedophile. You'll burn in hell. They think I'm crazy because I don't love G.G.
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:16.960]  Ping because I don't love Biden that skeleton because I don't love all their Satanism and all
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:22.240]  their devil worship and their lawyer cowardly behavior. I'm an American and I will not submit
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:28.240]  to you or your crap. You murderers. The whole damn government's a bunch of pedophiles at the top
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:32.720]  and they're selling baby body parts and keeping babies alive and creating animal human clothes.
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:37.120]  And now they want a microchip everybody and they're ejecting us with deadly poison and mutating us
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:40.640]  because they're the ruling elite and they're the establishment and now the federal government's
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:49.040]  the secret police of G.G. Ping and the New World Order. Nice. We did not submit to your charity.
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:57.200]  No. No. One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:03.680]  Alex Jones was right. But it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter
[2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:08.400]  and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in anger. But let me tell you we are

[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:32.240]  I tell you, fighting the globalists has really got me. I'm so committed to this fight.
[2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:39.840]  There's no way I'm backing down or pulling out now. These tyrants gotta go down.
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:45.360]  Well, a lot is happening in Maricopa County. That's the place where we're finally getting an audit,
[2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:50.560]  a real one, not the same crooks running just a computer simulation. There's been so many
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:54.800]  developments, so many people fighting it. Some people trying to block it. And this gentleman,
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:01.440]  Daniel McCarty is a very successful CEO. He's run for office and experienced different battles
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:07.600]  there. And he joins us to talk about the waterfront of what's happening in Maricopa County,
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:12.720]  what the big developments are. Thank you for joining us, Daniel. Tell us what's unfolded,
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:18.000]  what's happening currently. So, Alex, I can tell you with certainty that the audit that's
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:22.720]  taking place here in Maricopa County is another shell game. It's another smoke and mirrors campaign
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.600]  to distract the public from what's really going on. Let me paint the picture for you in your audience,
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:32.560]  first and foremost, is that this audit is a meaningless audit, meaning that let's say that
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:37.360]  every one of these balances from China, which they probably are, we know that they, for example,
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:42.560]  Alex, this is a great example, one of the county board of supervisors here in Maricopa County,
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:48.560]  his chicken coop warehouse mysteriously burnt down a couple months ago, right? And now all of a
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:54.800]  sudden, we have images from Korean Airlines of ballots coming into Maricopa County, and we're
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:16:00.480]  supposed to expect this audit to be anything but smoke and mirrors. So, it's the GOP on the ground
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:05.680]  in Arizona, which the leader of the GOP here in Arizona, a very corrupt system in Arizona,
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:09.440]  they just admitted to it yesterday that it doesn't matter what the results are
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:13.680]  from the audit, it's going to have no effect on the election results. So, what this is,
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:17.120]  is another shell game. So, why did the Democrats, I'm not disagreeing with you, you're the guy on
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:23.040]  the ground. Why are they fighting it so hard? Well, because it's the same, so for example,
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:27.600]  there's one case right now that's being seen by the Supreme Court that actually has the ability
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:31.920]  to overturn the election results. I'm not saying it's going to, but there's only one case. The same
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:38.560]  attorneys that are defending the government on that case are the same attorneys that are representing
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:43.440]  the Democrat Party to file an injunction on this audit. So, what they're doing is, is they're just
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:48.160]  mudding the waters for the next couple months down here to distract everybody from what's
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:53.600]  important, and you and I both know what's important. We need a vaccine passport ban.
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:59.120]  We have a few state senators that are standing in the way of history in Arizona,
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:03.040]  and what we're doing on the ground is basically muscling them and saying, no more, it's over.
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:08.640]  Like, this is not a game anymore. You're talking about putting an experimental vaccine in my kids.
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:12.000]  So, what do you think a guy like me is going to do? I'm going to stop everything I'm doing.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:17.040]  I'll put, I've got, listen, I'm very, I'm very wealthy. I have no, I, I can do anything I want
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:21.120]  to do. These guys have a big problem on their hands in Arizona. And, and let me tell you what
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:27.520]  else are distracting us from Alex. These guys are trying to put the next governor in, in place,
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:32.480]  which is worse than Doug Roscoe or Doug Ducey, as you guys call him. Doug Roscoe's his real name.
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:40.160]  The next guy that they want to put in is a cartel asset, Marco Lopez. And that's what we're standing
[2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:44.800]  in the way of. So, the problem they've got is, is that the smoking mirrors is no longer working.
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:48.800]  The games, the shell games are no longer working. We're able to decipher this stuff very quickly
[2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:54.640]  now. And we're ripping them to shreds is what we're doing. Well, okay, specifically, I mean,
[2:17:54.640 --> 2:17:58.240]  I knew that you've been in the middle of all this. So, what is going on with the audit?
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:05.040]  What's unfolding? And because I, I mean, I, I believe you that it might be more smoking mirrors.
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:10.000]  That's all we've seen so far. I've seen a lot of the Republican folks that I think are pretty
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:14.480]  smart gateway opponent and others have thought it was, you know, pretty good. I really respect Joe
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:21.840]  Hoft. Are you saying they're wrong? What I'm saying is it's, it's, it's clearly a smoking
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:26.000]  mirrors campaign because they didn't even allocate enough money to do it. The Coliseum's
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:31.600]  wide open. We have reporters here, local reporters on the ground doing segments on local TV,
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:36.000]  showing them going in with their cameras and laughing because they can touch ballots. They
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:39.280]  can go in there. There's, there's no real security. They didn't, the guys know I did
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:42.720]  hear Democrats brag that there's no real security and they're running around and whatever they
[2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:46.000]  want. So you're just saying they're just taking the same old ballots and running them back through
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.280]  again. They're not checking if they don't have creases. They're not checking if they've been
[2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:54.560]  scantroned in by a machine or Alex, Alex, they're not even, they're not even trying to audit the
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:58.240]  down ticket. Like the Senate race or any of those other things are only doing the presidential
[2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:02.720]  race, which you and I both know. Article two, section one of the United States Constitution,
[2:19:02.720 --> 2:19:06.400]  those ballots have no merit on deciding who the president of the United States is. It doesn't
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.800]  matter if they're all from China, like I'm saying, they probably are. And look, there's really good
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:14.640]  patriots out here doing the right thing. And there's really good operatives thinking they're
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:19.280]  doing the right thing, more power to them. I'm just telling you that the reality is, is that it's
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:24.400]  another distraction from what's really important, which is right now, we have three state senators,
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:33.120]  David Livingston, TJ Shope and Tyler Pace. These three establishment swamp monsters in Arizona,
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:38.400]  these monsters, okay, are standing in the way of history in Arizona where we were trying to make
[2:19:38.400 --> 2:19:43.920]  it a felony. If you tried to implement a vaccine passport, and they just watered down that bill,
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:47.760]  by the way, it was because of your guys' shows, because Owen's show on Monday, because we put
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:51.520]  the pressure on them that they said, okay, we got to do something. Well, what they did was,
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:54.960]  is they watered down our bill, and now we're sitting here and we're saying, okay, we don't care,
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:20:01.280]  listen, we're going to fix the voting. Before I run in 2022, you know, for the governor's seat
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:05.840]  in 2022, before I do that, we will have valid elections here in Arizona. We're taking control
[2:20:05.840 --> 2:20:10.800]  of Arizona from the cartels and CCP. This is all happening. But right now, we have a couple
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:15.040]  knuckleheads standing in the way of a very important piece of history, in my opinion.
[2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:20.560]  All right. Well, I wanted to get you on, my friend, about the auditing process. But I think
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:23.680]  we've got the answer from you, and you're probably going to be right. It's going to be a fraud if
[2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:28.720]  people want to know about Arizona politics, which I know is extremely important. What is the best
[2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:34.320]  place for them to visit to find the work you're doing, Daniel McCarthy? Yes, stoptherinos.com.
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:40.720]  We have the largest mobilization. This is John McCain's CIA umbrella here in Arizona. This is
[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:45.760]  the tip of the spear. They've had their way in Arizona for so many years. And what we're doing
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:51.520]  is we're reversing that tide very quickly with very sophisticated tactics. Stoptherinos.com.
[2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:58.880]  This is the, listen, the Patriot Party of Arizona, the Patriot Party of Arizona. Stoptherinos.com.
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:02.880]  What we're, is we're mobilizing the hundreds of thousands of people that supported me,
[2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:07.120]  and we're taking our government back in Arizona. And we're going to, we're not, my kids are not
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:11.760]  living in communism, Alex. I assure you of that. Well, I'm glad you're there, but that's a real
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:16.720]  bummer, because I know you're right in the middle of it, that they are. I mean, how are they,
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:20.800]  I mean, because, I mean, they are checking to see if they were creased. They are
[2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:23.280]  checking to see if they were done by hand, right? Or they're doing nothing. I mean,
[2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:26.720]  what are they doing in the audit? Well, they're doing, you know,
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:29.680]  and they're doing some type of forensic audit where they're doing ultra lights and all that.
[2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:34.400]  Yes, the ballots are fake. We know the ballots are fake. We saw them fly in the ballots. We know
[2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:38.640]  it's, it's all garbage. But that's not going to, then if they find they're fake, that's, that's,
[2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:42.240]  that's proven. But what you're saying, the state officials are saying they don't care what the
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:48.560]  audit does. No, there's, legally, they don't have any, there's no grounds for them to do anything.
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:53.600]  So for example, according to, I mean, politically, if it's found that Trump really won Arizona,
[2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:55.760]  even if the state doesn't act on it, that's a pretty big deal.
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:22:01.120]  I totally agree with you. I mean, but we already know that. We already know they stole the election.
[2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:05.040]  We, I mean, this, these are all things we already know. I know you know that. And I know, I know
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:09.760]  that. But, but, but the Democrats are fighting this for a good reason. Listen, let's do this.
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:14.720]  How long until the audit's over? I would suspect that they're going to drag
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:19.280]  this thing out for months, Alex. I would, I would dare say that this thing is going to take months.
[2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:22.480]  Yeah. I mean, the word is 40 days right now is what I'm hearing. And it does look like they've
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.200]  got a bunch of turtles and they're doing it like they're moving, moving like slots. When we saw in
[2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:30.800]  Georgia and the CNN center where they're just, everybody's out, broken water main.
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:34.960]  Then they start grabbing the ballots and just shoving them in the same ballots over and over again.
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:39.280]  They were acting like they were, you know, sped up or something, but that's definitely
[2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:43.200]  happened here. All right. Thank you so much. Very excited. We appreciate you. When we come back,
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:47.520]  ladies and gentlemen, I've got that news for you on the state of Texas staying mass for children
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:54.000]  is illegal. I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:23:00.720]  the successes and full versus head. If you're paying attention, you know, we've done together,
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:08.960]  but I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:14.160]  all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:19.520]  now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:22.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.960]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence
[2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:33.680]  those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:39.600]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:23:45.280]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come.
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:47.280]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:58.400]  CNN has almost no viewers. The ADL is reviled and hated across the United States and the world
[2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:02.800]  as a pack of anti-free speech liars. But that doesn't mean that they don't have power,
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:06.800]  just like the Southern Primary Law Center, that's just as bad. They represent the globalist,
[2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:11.760]  the big power structure that wants authoritarianism and backs communist China and its death camps,
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:16.320]  and they back bringing those similar systems here to America, and they've even officially called the
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:22.640]  ADL for my arrest for my speech, and for Mark Zuckerberg to be arrested for free speech as well.
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:26.720]  These are very, very dangerous times. They don't want us to be on air. You funding our

[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:03.280]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world of God.
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:08.320]  It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:15.280]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:21.680]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand. The globalist fear this
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.000]  film made 14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.240]  for the great reset. It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement, available right now
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:35.040]  at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:40.640]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com. I strongly suggest you make
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:45.280]  copies and share it. And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:49.680]  that they make copies and share it as well. That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:27:05.600]  we the people cannot be stopped. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:24.560]  The United States is being swallowed by a demonic communist globalist
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:32.560]  boa constrictor. That's a metaphor for the mainstream media says that I believe an
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:39.520]  actual intergalactic snake is eating the planet and the country. They have an AI world government
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:43.520]  takeover plan of technocracy that will direct humans like robots, those that are allowed to live,
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:49.520]  that is, that is beyond any nightmare science fiction fantasy that we could ever imagine.
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:54.720]  And it's now out in the open. And everyone that thinks they're going to serve the system and
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.760]  get ahead are fools. You might survive a month longer, a year longer, maybe a decade longer,
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:06.160]  but the bottom has dropped out. Every thing that made us great and strong and secure and safe and
[2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:12.800]  healthy and happy has been abandoned. Now a lot of people are upset. A lot of people are saying no.
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:19.600]  A lot of people are resisting, but it is a societal rot that has allowed us to get to this point.
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:25.840]  As a fact that people don't see themselves as leaders, don't see themselves in a position to
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:33.040]  take action. Now I mentioned this in the second hour and I said it was coming up in the third,
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:37.040]  and sure enough, we're going to take some time to cover this now. And then later we're going to get
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:43.440]  an article, a blurb written about this and get it up on infowars.com. And it's a big deal whether
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:49.760]  you live in California or Texas or New York, doesn't matter where you live, because there's
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:55.920]  similar laws on the books everywhere, but it's just an illustration how common sense, due process,
[2:28:55.920 --> 2:29:03.200]  the law has been totally thrown aside for the whole COVID rollout. I mean, there's a federal law,
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:08.960]  you can't give people vaccines without animal testing in a long period of stuff because of
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:15.840]  secret testing and experiments before. They just waved all that. And now the FBI waves hundreds
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:19.760]  of thousands of kids being handed over, many of them to complete strangers, no background check.
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:23.760]  There's no law, they can do that, but they have what you call waving it because they're God.
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:29.520]  That is the Justice Department. That is the horribly corrupt and evil attorney general,
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:36.640]  and the horribly corrupt and evil FBI director. I mean, these are bad, bad, bad men. These are
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:42.560]  the bad guys. And they are just getting away with bloody murder. And we're only 100 days into Biden,
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:49.600]  but 102 days. And you notice it just gets worse every day, because no one has stopped them.
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:56.400]  Everyone's too busy. They're still golf courses, still movies. Yeah, you're wearing masks. Yeah,
[2:29:56.400 --> 2:30:00.080]  the economy's falling apart. Yeah, there's homeless camps everywhere, but yeah, the border's collapsing,
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:07.120]  but it's okay. And I got stacks of news here I'll get to in a moment about the shutdown of the
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:15.280]  country. But the good news is this is being done because the globalists know that it's their system
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:20.240]  that is collapsing, and they hope to collapse us with them so they won't get repudiated so they
[2:30:20.240 --> 2:30:26.080]  can actually pose as the saviors as they let you know the global reset, the financial reset,
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:31.440]  the accelerated collapse that's a month off, a year off, two years off. It's coming. I'm not
[2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:37.360]  sure when. So that you will think it's your fault, or you will think it's your fault because the
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:43.760]  universal income or all this crap, we're in serious trouble. I don't say that to be negative. I say
[2:30:43.760 --> 2:30:54.960]  that to be honest with everybody. These tyrants have an instinct to control their control freaks.
[2:30:54.960 --> 2:31:02.160]  They cannot help themselves. When you look at them and their children and the systems of people
[2:31:02.160 --> 2:31:09.600]  like Bill Clinton or Chuck E. Schumer or any of these people, they are mental patients. They are
[2:31:09.600 --> 2:31:20.080]  control freaks. They are villains. And so yesterday after the show, one of our great editors,
[2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:26.000]  researchers, Rob Deuce, said to me, he said, you know, we moved out to Drific Springs to get
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:34.080]  outside Austin. It's a big summer of Austin. I used to live out there. So it was why I was
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:43.520]  trying to watch online because she's a teacher, but teacher's college kids and seniors, but that's
[2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:50.240]  a side issue. She's an education person. She's watching the school board in the big fancy Drific
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:57.680]  Springs auditorium with all the property taxes. And it went on for hours and hours and hours and
[2:31:57.680 --> 2:32:05.680]  hours. Every person was against making the children from first grade kindergarten all the way up to
[2:32:05.680 --> 2:32:10.800]  twelfth grade wear masks for another year. They've already announced basically it's permanent. It's
[2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:14.160]  forever. I told you that a year ago, but now it's official. But always another year, always another
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:17.920]  year, always another year. You're dirty. You're bad. You're evil. It's a sign you're in the cult.
[2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:22.480]  It gives you bacterial pneumonia. It dehumanizes. It's a way to make everybody bad if you don't
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:28.240]  submit the cult. It's a peer pressure cult exercise. And so Rob boiled it down to about an hour and a
[2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:37.520]  half and we posted it to Band-Aid video. Parents reject mask mandates. And maybe we should change
[2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:42.480]  it to all parents. It's incredible. Austin suburb unanimously rejects masks for public school
[2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:47.040]  children. Now, every time somebody gets up, they don't like what they're saying. They just fade
[2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:52.240]  their audio down and start shuffling papers on the microphones in front of the school board.
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:57.520]  So you're like, well, why do we care about one school board in Texas? This is happening everywhere.
[2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:02.880]  This is all UN directed, Bill Gates directed above Congress. It doesn't matter if governors say
[2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:06.960]  reopen things. It just never ends because they're not going to let it in. It's the corporations and
[2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:15.200]  the bureaucracies and the school boards dominate it. But one lady got up and spoke and you can hear
[2:33:15.200 --> 2:33:19.440]  them fade down her audio. So we've boosted it. Sometimes they would just completely cut people's
[2:33:19.440 --> 2:33:29.280]  mics off. And she reads the Texas code that says it's illegal to make children or young adults wear
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:33.920]  masks. And then if you punish them, it's even more illegal. And then it is a form of torture
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:38.160]  because they've actually had it before where they gag students and make them wear masks.
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:42.640]  And it's against the law and the education code to do it. And I'm going to show you that on the
[2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:47.920]  Texas code in a moment. But isn't that amazing? We used to have common sense in this country.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:53.840]  Like Sharia law for women. No, thank you. Now we all wear the burkas, the beehives.
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:33:59.280]  And you notice you took the shot, a lot of you. And now, hey, you still got to wear the mask.
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:05.360]  They're never going to let go like an alligator until they've eaten us or until we get free.
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.760]  So here is a parent, Amanda Beale, tells Texas School Board to end mask mandate and brings
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:18.080]  up the law. Here it is. Make masks optional and return school to normal. Texas Education Code
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:24.080]  section 37.0023 prohibited aversive techniques state. In this section, aversive techniques means
[2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:28.160]  a technique or intervention that is intended to reduce the likelihood of a behavior reoccurring
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:33.840]  by intentionally inflicting on a student's significant physical or emotional discomfort
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:37.760]  or pain. The term includes a technique or intervention that impairs the student's
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:41.440]  breathing, including any procedure that involves obstructing the student's airway,
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:47.200]  including placing an object in, on, or over the student's mouth or nose or placing a bag, cover,
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:51.680]  or mask over the student's face. When I reached out to you, Board of Trustees,
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:54.960]  on March 7th about violating this code, I received the following response from the
[2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:59.440]  President of the Board of Trustees. Your inquiry should probably be addressed to TEA.
[2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:05.040]  I assume this code provision is not accessible because masks are not being used as an aversive
[2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:10.720]  technique. That is simply untrue. Masks are being warned to prevent a student or adult from
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:16.000]  expelling respiratory droplets that may reach others. The masks are causing physical harm
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:20.800]  and emotional discomfort. For months, teachers, administrators, and even you have received
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:25.360]  countless phone calls and emails from parents sharing the details of the harm caused by the
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:31.600]  one-size-fits-all mask policy. Additionally, failure to comply with this policy results
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.480]  in unjust punishments. If you take the mask off an elementary PE, you sit in the penalty box.
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:40.560]  If you speak too loudly in the middle of school classroom, you'll lose your mask break. If you're
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:44.400]  caught without your mask on, it is not assumed you needed a break. Instead, someone reminds you
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.560]  to put it back on. If an individual feels you've taken your mask off too frequently,
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.080]  they threaten to send you to the principal's office or ban you from riding the school bus.
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:57.040]  There is a reason that requiring a student to wear a mask has been specifically prohibited
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:36:03.520]  by the Texas Education Code for years. If it is wrong as a disciplinary tool, it is wrong.
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:08.720]  That is not a school. That is a giant reeducation camp brainwashing facility.
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:13.360]  Right out of Handmaiden's Tale, which they said Christians would do and was Islam doing it,
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:18.880]  and right out of so many other Hollywood films like Avatar. They are flaunting it.
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:24.480]  Here it is, Title II, Public Education, Subtitle VI, Safe School, Chapter 37, Discipline,
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:33.200]  Law and Order. It is a crime to do what they're doing, Section 37.0023. But they don't care.
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:39.760]  They're pushing the entire thing. Subsection 17A and B, look it up for yourself. It's illegal.
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:45.600]  It violates the law, and it's what cults do, and it's all a fraud and it gives you bacterial
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:49.520]  pneumonia. But they don't care if the parents are unanimous against it. They're a pack of
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:53.840]  knuckle dragon criminals. Again, I don't like to lecture people. I'm a very private person,
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.080]  but because of the globalists, they're attacking humanity. I've been forced the last 27 years
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:02.240]  to be a public figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:07.040]  because of God. And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:11.520]  give me a break. The Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian, but now the fact
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.360]  that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. A lot of you have been turned
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:20.480]  off by big churches. A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system,
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:25.920]  and I get it, me too. Believe me, I'm one of them. But it's that relationship with God and just
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:32.080]  God's universe that God created that is so essential. And God created the universe for
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:36.240]  us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what Info Wars is really
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:39.760]  all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading the word about

[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:22.880]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech,
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:26.960]  and the globalist are predatory and are evil. And in the surveillance state, we need to more and
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:31.840]  more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in. These

[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:01.920]  I'm really thinking. People say, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air? That's embarrassing.
[2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:06.880]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this right now.
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:11.680]  You're nuts if you don't get storeable food, and I've got the biggest, best sponsor with the
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:16.320]  highest quality food and the lowest price you're going to find. Can you spend triple or four times
[2:39:16.320 --> 2:39:21.200]  it and get like gourmet stuff that takes even better? Yeah. Most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:25.840]  Some of it tastes okay. The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time,
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:30.880]  and compared to other competitors, they can't even get close. We've got three months, six months,
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:36.560]  your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again,

[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:49.360]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, 10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:56.880]  Get ready while you still can. 170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:02.640]  to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That grew into the robber barons,
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:06.640]  and then into the eugenics movement, Kettler, and of course, the rest is history. Our film,
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.600]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms.
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:16.800]  Sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts, it's been selling online for as much as
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:22.080]  $300 a copy. Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD.
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:27.440]  It is available after not being available for years at infowarstore.com. We're selling it for
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.480]  $14.95 for one copy as low as $3.95 when you buy them in bulk, you share with your friends and family,
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:38.480]  and every DVD has a zero country code, meaning you can burn copies of it anywhere in the world.
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:44.080]  I'm asking you to. I'm begging you to. This film predicted the great reset, the new order takeover,
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:49.120]  the fake virus, and so much more. That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:51.760]  Get it today at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:41:02.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm hosting the fourth hour today. Roger Stone
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:18.080]  was out of the grocery store about an hour ago when he called me back. I was texting him.
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:25.280]  And I said, hurry home because when you talk about Rudolph Giuliani getting rated by the loving
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:30.480]  New York feds. So he's going to be joining us coming out. I got a lot of other stuff to hit
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:33.440]  as well. A lot of news I haven't gotten to. I meant to get the calls today that we've had
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:37.600]  so many surprise guests and so many developments that definitely in the next few days, I'm going
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:41.760]  to do a couple shows with pretty much only calls because I enjoy those broadcasts. I know you do
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:45.440]  as well. Brings up a lot of issues, a lot of topics, a lot of questions that I would not
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:54.560]  remember to cover. So I enjoy the calls. But let's show this right now. We had a few weeks ago
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:42:04.000]  a Connecticut track coach who got fired because he said, I'm not going to make him wear a mask.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:09.840]  It makes him have blackouts. It makes him have lower oxygen. You get spit all over your face.
[2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:14.320]  It's not normal. It's not healthy. And he even showed a medical literature.
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:19.440]  They said, fine, you're fired. And he's doing the right thing. He's got land of his own. He's
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:22.640]  just started his own private track and field thing and people are going to leave for that.
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:26.880]  You got to get out of the public schools. You got to get out of the system.
[2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:29.520]  But that's what I'm trying to force everybody now so we can pitch the lake now.
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:34.320]  And then Katie bar the door, but there's a new article up on info wars.com shock video,
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:39.040]  high school runner collapses, blacks out the coach said she was knocked out at finish line.
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:45.680]  She says, mass restricted breathing. Yeah, up to 25% less oxygen in the study show depending
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:49.120]  on the mask. And then also you get a bunch of spit in there. Once the spit gets on it,
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:57.600]  it's even less oxygen. And so this has happened in Oregon. So humans got to wear mask. You're dirty.
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.320]  Men can be women. A penis is a cervix. They want us to believe things that aren't true.
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:08.720]  That's what cults always get you to do to make sure you've suspended your belief.
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:12.160]  Because they're about to get you to do things that aren't good for you that go against your
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:18.160]  common sense. Stop rebelling against your common sense. Stop rebelling against your gut and your
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:24.960]  spirit. Start rebelling against the globalist. The facts are all there, but also go with the gut.
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:30.320]  The facts show the guts right. Start rebelling against evil. Start going with your spirit.
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:36.320]  So here's the shock video high school runner young lady. Shocking footage from last Thursday's
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:42.480]  800 meter race at Summit High School in Ben shows mask runner Maggie Williams. And by the way,
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:46.160]  our Lord and Savior, Biden already said you don't need to do this, but the school boards
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:51.120]  saying we're going to keep doing it. We want to stay closed. There are a bunch of spoiled brat
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:55.600]  commies. There's still a lot of good educators, but Bill Gates has always wanted to get rid of
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:43:59.360]  the school boards. I don't like school boards either. And I don't like the, you know, the,
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:03.600]  the supposedly local, but they're globally controlled now, the UNESCO policy, but who I
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:08.560]  really don't like is the teacher unions. But the dumb teacher unions don't understand that Bill
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:12.160]  Gates has wanted to get rid of them forever and bring in corporate controlled. They'll still be
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:17.360]  called public schools, but they're going to be globalist schools. And they're walking into his
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:21.920]  trap for him to get rid of all of them and to lay them all off. But they don't care because they
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:26.560]  only think a week out, a month out, how many Netflix programs they want to watch and how
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:31.440]  many Prozac pills they want to take and how much red wine they want to drink. That's your average
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:36.720]  liberal woman. A lazy, stupid, selfish idiot. And don't worry, Bill Gates will game the hell
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:40.640]  out of you, sweetheart. You'll take your mRNA vaccine and get a bunch of tumors and die and
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:45.280]  you'll love it. You'll be too stupid. You'll be on your deathbed going, I'm taking still. I just,
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:49.600]  we need more funding for vaccines. That's why it killed me. Like a woman paralyzed from the neck
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:55.760]  now. I think they're good. We need more funding. The CDC needs to protect me. That's Stockholm
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:01.840]  syndrome. Break her neck. She's like, oh, please protect me, doctor. I'm the guy breaking your neck.
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:09.840]  They're so wedded to lies spiritually that they've been given over to great delusion.
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:17.920]  So very, very sad. But here it is. I mean, my daughters, my son have been in sports and,
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:22.080]  I mean, now they're telling them in Spain, wear a mask in the pool and people are doing it.
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:29.280]  It's all about, I mean, if they told liberals walk on one leg or stand on your head and stick
[2:45:29.280 --> 2:45:33.520]  your thumb in your rear end, I'm sorry, they'd do it. They would. They'll do anything. That's the
[2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:38.560]  thing about Stockholm syndrome. They drink Kool-Aid full of cyanide. They always compare me to Jim
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:43.920]  Jones. This is my last name's Jones. I'm the opposite of Jim Jones. I'm not out at some compound
[2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:48.720]  with thousands of people telling them I'm God and drink Kool-Aid. I'm saying be free, be individual,
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:53.360]  have a personal relationship with God and don't join the globalist cult. I'm the individualist.
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:58.480]  I'm promoting freedom. And I got a stack of articles right here in front of me
[2:45:59.360 --> 2:46:04.320]  where they're going, Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones are the generals with General Flynn. It was like
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:10.160]  trending on Twitter. Arrest them. Put them on no fly list. It's just, they're like, oh, but Jones
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:15.840]  is scared now. I'm real scared for my children, for the future, and for dumbasses like you
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:22.880]  that think tyranny's cute. I remember the New York Times one time tricked their way in here. They
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:25.840]  claimed, oh, we want to talk about your family court trial. We want to get your side of the story
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:29.680]  out. Door closes. We're here about Sandy Hook. We're here about how you made your fortune off
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:34.560]  of it. I go, I don't even talk about that hardly ever. I didn't make any money off that. And then
[2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:39.600]  like, she calls her Uber and I'm looking at the surveillance camera to go, okay, yeah, your Uber's
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:43.920]  not here yet. And it turns out the New York Times, Jones was hiding in the dark, staring at
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:49.680]  surveillance cameras in fear. No, that's you guys. I'm out leading hundreds of thousands of people,
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:55.440]  millions in peaceful rallies against mask and tyranny and election fraud with no body armor.
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:01.040]  I'm all over the place, everywhere. I'm blocking smuggler vehicles. I'm at the front lines,
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.320]  leading from the front. But they got it in your lying, sneaky hunchback in the dark creeping
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:10.720]  around because I'm nice and like, okay, you got your car coming to get you. Well, which side of
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:14.240]  the building is it pulling up to? I don't know. Let's go surveillance camera. Okay, not here yet.
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:18.720]  That's how they work. So that they don't totally lie. They take something and twist it.
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:25.840]  But that's because they're fallen. They're neurotic liars that serve evil. So here's the
[2:47:25.840 --> 2:47:31.040]  shop video, high school runner collapses at finish line says mass restrictions, restricted
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:38.400]  breathing. Well, it does in the damn literature. Here it is. A moment of glory overshadowed by
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:43.920]  this moment of concern. Williams finished in two minutes and eight seconds collapsing as she
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:49.200]  crossed the finish line. I felt like I just wasn't being able to get a full breath and multiple
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:53.600]  times of that happening, not being able to get enough air. It just, I just felt super dizzy
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:59.120]  and then eventually it pause again. But she's got a virtue signal in the damn interview with her
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:05.280]  fricking mask. Take the mask off. Yesterday, I had some demo work done in the little Mexican
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:09.680]  food restaurant right next door to it. I said, let me have a little extra lunch. So I stepped in
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:15.920]  the Mexican food restaurant and I watched people come in and sit down and wait for their food
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:21.840]  before they took the damn mask off. They'll do whatever Fauci the liar says. It's Stockholm
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:29.520]  syndrome and it was in a poor area of Austin. And it's like the poor people are the more they do it.
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:35.840]  And that's just how it works. It's very, very sad folks. We've got to leave these people out of
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:39.760]  darkness. They're trying to bully us. They're trying to tell us that we got to take shots and do
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  all this. Then Tucker says, hey, just say to them, take your mask off. Don't make children wear them
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:52.640]  with these virtue signals. And they say, oh, we're bullying them. No, you're the bullies.
[2:48:52.640 --> 2:48:56.880]  You're the control freaks. You're the politically correct. You're the ones that ruined the colleges
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:49:00.720]  and ruin the society and are collapsing and all. I'm going to cover that next hour after
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:04.640]  Roger Stone leaves us. I've got incredible evidence of it. But let's finish up with a young
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:08.960]  Stockholm syndrome victim still wearing her face diaper after she almost killed her.
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:13.760]  Times of that happening, not being able to get enough air. I just felt super dizzy and then
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:19.440]  eventually passed out. Williams blames her lack of oxygen on the mask she's required to wear during
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:24.240]  competition. Clearly in the past, this has never happened. And then this race that I was wearing
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:29.440]  a mask, it did happen, which I don't think is a coincidence. Her coach echoing that belief saying
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:34.160]  this was not a conditioning issue. It was a mask issue. There was a different response than I've
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:38.560]  seen for kids that have collapsed to the track just because they were exhausted. She wasn't sure
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:46.480]  where she was. She wasn't sure where she was. All right. But don't worry. Mommy and daddy tell
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:50.080]  her they're good because they like people don't have a spirit that almost actually to God.
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:55.760]  And then they want to outwardly show they're good. And I'm not saying she doesn't have a
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:49:59.520]  connection to God or folks. Then other people see that and they follow that. But this is all
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:04.080]  the emptiness. You don't have privacy. You don't have your health. You don't have your future.
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:07.920]  You're being poisoned. You're being robbed of the globalist. But you've got face diapers
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:13.920]  to show how good you are and to show how you're better than other people. It's sick.
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:19.760]  It's disgusting. And it's evil. And it's all illegal mass medical experimentation on the old,
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:24.640]  the young and others. And all of you that went along with it are at one level or another guilty
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:30.080]  of what you've been involved in. All right. I had news from yesterday and today that I didn't get to.
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:34.000]  And I got a much other news. I haven't hit Roger's toes in the join us first. But I want to show you
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:38.960]  the evidence of the globalist being losers and failures and how they're collapsing things because
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:43.520]  they're already collapsed. That is coming up. And I was going to come in tonight and do a live
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:49.440]  show and uncover the joint session of Congress. They don't call it anymore. The state of the
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.680]  union. They do everything different now with the puppet. But you know what? No one's going to
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:58.320]  watch it. No one cares. And I don't think you want to see that, do you? Because he's not even the
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:03.440]  president. He stole the election. So we'll have highlights of it on American Journal tomorrow
[2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:09.200]  morning. And we'll also have highlights of it on my broadcast. And I assume the war room comes
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:16.320]  on 3 p.m. Central. Your daily dose of the Star Spangled Banner that I love so much. Just not so
[2:51:16.320 --> 2:51:22.320]  much to play it every time at the beginning of the show. But we did make a beautiful one for Owen.
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:25.920]  And McBrain did it. It was the best Star Spangled Banner you've ever seen. It's at Bandod
[2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:30.080]  Video. But that's coming up in one hour with the war room. But the fourth hour was yours truly.

[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:50.000]  wearing a mouth. Tell everybody you know the truth lives at Bandod Video and BandThis.tv.

[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:46.240]  Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:51.440]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:52:51.440 --> 2:52:56.320]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:53:02.960]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:08.800]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:15.200]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:22.960]  24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:29.920]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:35.200]  and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:39.360]  on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because
[2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:47.440]  God created this country. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:53:47.440 --> 2:54:03.040]  Take the highway to the end of the night. End of the night. End of the night.
[2:54:03.040 --> 2:54:24.240]  All right. Rudolph Giuliani got raided by the feds this morning and he's supposedly going to go live
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:29.440]  here in a few minutes on ABC News. We'll take that feed even when he ends up coming on. But
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:33.440]  Roger Stone is here with us. This is a short segment. Some stations join us next segment. But
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:39.040]  man, Nick Foyntes on a no fly list trying to fly to Florida for a DeSantis rally to call for a
[2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:43.680]  stop of censorship. Laura Loomer can't buy guns. You know, she has no criminal records. He's been
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:50.240]  told she's on a no gun buy list. Red flag laws, mass persecution, IRS coming after you on a debt
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:56.960]  you basically already paid. Just absolute insanity. And now Rudolph Giuliani. This is real
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:02.880]  tyranny, isn't it, Roger? It's the total weaponization of the U.S. Justice Department. I mean,
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:08.240]  we've seen it before. I have been a victim of it. General Flynn has been a victim of it.
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:15.440]  And we're told that this investigation is about Giuliani's relationships in the Ukraine.
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:21.280]  Wait a minute. What about Joe Biden's relationships in the Ukraine? What about the actual recordings
[2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:28.240]  of Joe Biden talking about matters with the Ukrainian leadership when he was Vice President?
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:33.600]  What about the profiteering that his son did in the Ukraine? You see, it's the two tiered
[2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:40.000]  justice system. Once again, Rudy Giuliani is a former U.S. Attorney, a former Deputy Attorney
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:44.160]  General of the United States, personal attorney for the former President of the United States.
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:50.800]  This is harassment. This is the weaponization of our justice system in which we now
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:56.480]  are trying to jail our political opponents. This is right out of Nazi Germany. This is
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:01.920]  right out of Soviet Russia. This is not the kind of thing you expect to see in the United States.
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:08.160]  This is one-one billionth. I mean, Nixon only thought about doing some stuff like this. They've
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:14.000]  been doing it. Obama did it, but now it's on steroids. Well, this morning, a terrific story.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:20.640]  Joe Biden's asked for an additional $80 million for the IRS to go after, quote,
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:25.200]  rich people who haven't paid their taxes. Well, I know where they can start. When we start with
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:32.560]  Hunter Biden, he just moved into a $4.5 million house in California that rents for $25,000 a
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:38.080]  month. My wife and I are having trouble scraping together the money for rent next month. Those
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:42.480]  are the rich people that the Biden Justice Department should be going after. But Alex,
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:49.840]  as you know, there's two standards here. John Kerry can get caught red-handed in both sedition
[2:56:49.840 --> 2:56:56.160]  and, I think, treason in giving classified information to the Iranians. And there will
[2:56:56.160 --> 2:57:02.160]  be no repercussions. He won't be prosecuted. Yet they make up fake allegations against people
[2:57:02.160 --> 2:57:08.480]  like you and I and General Flynn and others. It's outrageous. The question is, how much
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:15.680]  of this crap will the American people take? The politicization of the DOJ, the weaponization
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:23.040]  of our justice system, is obvious for all to see. And when the laws are not applied equally to each,
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:28.480]  to every person, they are no longer the law. Now they're an instrument of political torture.
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:32.720]  Well, what's incredible is, and if I can get that guy's pull the clip up, the crew's been
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:37.760]  doing the Yeoman's work today, the famous clip of Biden saying, son of a bitch, I said fire the
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:44.240]  prosecutor and they did. I mean, he went on national TV on C-Span and said they were investigating
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:48.400]  me and my son. So I said, I'll give you a billion dollars. If you don't fire the prosecutor, you
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:54.160]  get one hour. And son of a bitch, they fired him. I mean, he brags about criminal activity
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:59.040]  beyond a gangster movie on TV. I always hear the gangster takes them in their restaurants
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:02.480]  talking about crimes and stuff, where I watch Project Veritas videos and I go,
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:05.520]  why do people talk like criminals in front of folks, even if they're criminals?
[2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:09.920]  But this is like on TV saying I'm a criminal. He doesn't get in trouble, Roger.
[2:58:10.720 --> 2:58:16.000]  No, we actually have heard recordings of Joe Biden discussing extraordinarily lucrative
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:22.480]  criminal activities with the Ukrainian president, Poroshenko. Where is his prosecution? Why is he
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:28.160]  allowed to walk? Meanwhile, the U.S., pardon me, the state attorney general in New York
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:34.160]  is having a field day rooting through all of Donald Trump's tax returns and business records.
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:39.040]  They have no evidence of a crime, but their attitude is that there must be one giant
[2:58:39.040 --> 2:58:44.160]  dragnet fishing expeditions. They ought to call the Justice Department jaws. We're going to come
[2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:48.240]  back in 60 seconds to recap this and play the famous clip of Joe Biden admitting crimes.

[3:00:00.800 --> 3:00:07.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:19.920]  All right. Here's Joe Biden out of office on C-Span. This is about four years ago, memory
[3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:25.360]  serves, saying they were investigating my son, investigating me. Should I call him? So that
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:29.360]  prostitute fired. You don't get a billion dollars and I'm going to be leaving in a few hours and
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:35.040]  son of a bitch, they fired him. I mean, that is illegal on every front as illegal as it gets.
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:42.480]  And again, when he was in office, what he did is the vice president of the United States
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:48.160]  bragging in front of a bunch of CFR lawyers that have sold us out to China. This is the
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:52.560]  outrageous, this is probably 10 crimes. I've talked to top lawyers and prosecutors about this
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:59.200]  that he committed right there that they held U.S. policy, a billion dollars over whether
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:04.000]  they stopped investigating him and then he brags about it in front of the world and now Giuliani
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:08.400]  for investigating it, they're trying to indict him. Same thing they did with Manafort,
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:13.840]  going after him because he done stuff decades ago. But oh, oh, but the Podesta brother who was
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.000]  involved in the same deal, he was allowed to evolve the same deal with Manafort. That's how
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  they knew about the deal. Roger can tell you all about it. He used to be at that place 30 years
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:27.840]  ago. He got out of it. But long before it went that way. But here is the admission of crime
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:35.200]  right now by the public president. I remember going over convincing our team or others to
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:41.600]  convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess the
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:47.920]  12th, 13th time to Kiev and I was supposed to announce that there's another billion dollar
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:55.440]  loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:00.080]  would take action against the state prosecutor and they didn't. So they said they had, they were
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:04.000]  walking out to Prescott and I said, no, I said, I'm not going to, we're not going to give you the
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:08.560]  billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. The president said,
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:13.920]  I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars. I said,
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:17.120]  you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. I think it was what, six hours?
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:21.360]  I looked, I said, we've been six hours and the prosecutor's not fired. You're not getting the
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:28.480]  money. Oh, son of a bitch. You have fired. If you're a TV viewer, you can see the smug look
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:32.960]  of Richard and Haas and the other guy. I mean, these are the parasites that sold the country out
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:36.720]  that now that they can put conservatives on no fly list, can take our bank accounts,
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:42.160]  can put us in prison. Roger Stone watching this, seeing an unfolding Rudolph Giuliani
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:49.360]  rated for investigating doing his job. You know, and I saw Giuliani at, on January 6th,
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:54.880]  I'm not putting him down. I've seen him before. He looks super old. I know he's still smart guy,
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:58.720]  but I mean, they're really targeting an old guy here that lost everything he had back in the
[3:02:58.720 --> 3:03:04.160]  president. And it's just a hellish situation, a very, very bold move. Get, cover the waterfront
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:08.960]  for us on this, because you know the inside baseball on this. Yeah, look, there's no,
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:13.680]  there's no crime here. The crimes have to do with Joe Biden, who by the way, if you listen to that,
[3:03:13.680 --> 3:03:20.000]  take carefully, implicated Obama in his illegal activity. Last July, Biden himself was named
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:26.640]  in the criminal action regarding the firing of the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, who was investigating
[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:33.440]  Hunter Biden. Just this past week, as you know, I was accused of hiding a lavage lifestyle,
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:39.440]  having millions of dollars in unpaid taxes, hiding assets. I think they have me confused
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:45.680]  with Hunter Biden. He's the guy doing that, yet there's no prosecution of him. And the media is
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:52.000]  not even allowed to cover or they're blocked from covering the corruption of the Biden family.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:58.240]  It is outrageous, but you can see the direction that this is going. They are going to demonize
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:04.000]  and attempt to prosecute any political opponent of this, of this administration.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:11.520]  Talk about hysteria. Why are they so upset about a simple recount in Arizona? Why are they trying
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:18.080]  to move mountains to stop a recount if they're so entirely confident that the results from Arizona
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:24.240]  are entirely legitimate and that there was no corruption? No, I think that this is in many
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:30.720]  ways meant to distract from the potential of the dominoes falling regarding Arizona,
[3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:35.920]  Arizona. Because if you look too closely in Arizona, you're going to find similar situations
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:43.520]  in Georgia, in Wisconsin, potentially in Michigan. The question about the election is not over. Now,
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:50.000]  if you went on mainstream media and you said that, or if you went on any social media platform
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:57.920]  other than, say, Parler, Gab, BitShoot, and a handful of others, Telegram, why you would be
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:05.920]  immediately banned for life. It's extraordinary the extent to which they will go to silence
[3:05:05.920 --> 3:05:11.200]  truth tellers. You've experienced Alex, you've experienced, I've experienced, our friend Laura
[3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:18.800]  Loomer has experienced. It is mind boggling the extent to which they will go to take away any
[3:05:18.800 --> 3:05:24.000]  criticism of the formal narrative. That's right. It's meant to be a chilling effect to everybody.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  That's the only way they're going to win, but it's so dangerous. I can't believe that what's
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:31.920]  left of the Western ruling class would put in a tyranny this bad. Don't they get it?
[3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:34.400]  It'll bite them in the ass, getting rid of due process?
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:40.800]  Evidently, they do not. What's interesting now is you're starting to have a number of foreign
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:46.480]  leaders from other countries, both allies of the United States and not our allies, questioning the
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:54.160]  mental stability of Joe Biden, questioning whether, in fact, he has dementia. It's not so easy to
[3:05:54.160 --> 3:06:01.120]  censor and to close down those foreign voices. Look, I think that this stunning raid on Rudy
[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:06.000]  Giuliani's apartment and his office, where they took all of his electronic equipment,
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:10.720]  is going to be about as effective as when they raided my house at five o'clock in the morning
[3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:18.320]  and took all of my electronic equipment and found absolutely nothing. So will they fabricate some
[3:06:18.320 --> 3:06:25.680]  crime by Giuliani? Couldn't possibly be as bad as the crimes already committed by Hunter Biden
[3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:32.800]  and his father? I just don't see how they have Hunter Biden on a makeup tour. We building him
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:36.960]  up as a guy that exposes fake news when he admits the laptop's real, when he talks about working
[3:06:36.960 --> 3:06:41.280]  for the head of Chinese intelligence. I mean, they literally have a crack head on tour.
[3:06:43.200 --> 3:06:46.960]  It's gaslighting. I mean, you've been a big Politico. You've been a big analyst.
[3:06:46.960 --> 3:06:50.320]  What do you make of this? I mean, the huge joke that Bill Maher told last week,
[3:06:51.040 --> 3:06:55.360]  even on the show, that he's a smart guy, one week he's saying the COVID thing's exaggerated.
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:06:59.760]  We need to end the lockdown. And then the next week he says, Joe Biden's better than ever.
[3:06:59.760 --> 3:07:04.240]  We should follow him. He's incredibly wise. Joe Biden can't even freaking talk now.
[3:07:04.240 --> 3:07:10.880]  Well, first of all, Bill Maher has a very, very difficult time separating his elbow from his
[3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:17.440]  derriere, if you know what I mean. But I had to chuckle today when I saw that Tucker, that Hunter
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:23.120]  Biden is going to be at Tulane University talking about fake news. Guess what? I'll be in New Orleans
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:27.360]  that day. I'll be at Tulane that day. We're going to talk about fake news. In fact, we're going to
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:33.440]  talk about the crimes of Hunter Biden. That's a great idea. I guess they put us on a fly list.
[3:07:33.440 --> 3:07:36.880]  We've got enough supporters. Maybe someone will pick us up with a power prop or something.
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:39.520]  But when is that date? I saw that on screen. Maybe I should join you.
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:45.040]  They have not announced the date of the class. I'm waiting for that. You know, I live in Florida.
[3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:50.480]  It's not that long a drive to Louisiana, if that's what it takes. Of course, I don't own a car,
[3:07:50.480 --> 3:07:55.200]  but I hope too soon, kind of shopping for something used with a low mileage on it.
[3:07:55.200 --> 3:08:03.440]  This is a campaign of harassment. As you know, Alex, last week they announced a civil indictment
[3:08:03.440 --> 3:08:10.320]  of me, a legal case, because they said I owed back taxes. Yeah, I owed $800,000 in back taxes
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:19.280]  from 2007 to 2008. I paid $890,000 for those taxes. What they are suing me over are the penalties
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:24.000]  and the interest, which are virtually always either diminished or swept away.
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:27.680]  Well, you can usually make a deal with the IRS. If it's a big enough number, you can't pay for
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:31.920]  20% of it. You actually paid it all back, and now they came back. Actually,
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:37.280]  I knew about your problem years ago. And then they indicted you. You spent every time you had
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:43.280]  sold your house. And then again, it's just, it's total vindictiveness. It is. People who want to
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:49.920]  help me can go to stonedefensefund.com. I was hoping to close that down. I was hoping to get
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:55.360]  back to a normal life. I've been producing some great videos for BNTV. You can go there and look
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:01.600]  at them. I thought life would return to normal, but now I have to fight once again to clear my name.
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:04.400]  I know because I was talking to you months ago, you're like, no, no, I don't need to plug the
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:08.160]  defense fund. I got a book coming out and, you know, I'd like to do some reports for you guys,
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:12.320]  and I'm doing some speaking engagements. And bam, you're right back in it again. They literally
[3:09:12.320 --> 3:09:16.240]  hate our guts and want to destroy us. But thank God, the listeners, they keep us on air. I want
[3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:20.720]  to do another segment with you or more. I want to get into big picture and what the governors
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:26.240]  can do, trying to draft General Flynn again, the great job he's doing and just hope for people
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:32.240]  about a wish list, a quarterbacking plan from a great American strategist on how we can turn this
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:37.920]  around with Roger Stone on the other side of how they've now metastasized the censorship Congress
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:41.920]  did nothing about the no fly list. So we said Trump will probably be taken off Twitter. I said
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:46.320]  it too much for the election in the depth happening. Now will Trump be put on a no fly list? We'll be
[3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:53.360]  right back. The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:10:00.320]  non consenting patients, hundreds of hospitals in the US injected healthy men, women and children
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:06.960]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non therapeutic to lethal, killing many of
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:12.080]  the test subjects. Endgame blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:16.720]  ever made. 14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulder Bird Groups activities and they're
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:21.600]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus. The film now is more important than ever.
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:25.440]  When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it. We have it back in print
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:31.600]  available now at info warsport.com. Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece with a bottom and bulk
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:35.200]  and there's a zero country code. So anywhere on the planet, you can make copies. In fact,
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:41.680]  I want you to make copies. You are the Palmer beers. 1776 worldwide. 1776 worldwide. Endgame
[3:10:41.680 --> 3:10:44.960]  blueprint for global enslavement available now at info warsport.com.
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:56.320]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:01.840]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:06.800]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:12.800]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:20.320]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old and I was already
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:24.640]  taking your other supplements that I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:28.800]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean,
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:34.480]  it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay,
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:39.840]  you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't have to
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:45.920]  put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:12:05.760]  cleared up my skin. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Dreaded Alex Jones
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:09.440]  broadcast here only because of your support and your prayers, your word of mouth,
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:18.640]  in battle, but stronger than ever. Thank you all. All right, we're gonna get into how to fight back,
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:24.800]  how to save the Republic, how to build a coalition against the globalist, how to draft General Flynn,
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:29.200]  what Trump can do next segment. But this segment, I want to get back to Joe DeGeneva,
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:34.640]  who's the guy you'd see on handy all the time, about two weeks, the indictments coming by Bill
[3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:39.520]  Barr and all the rest of it. A hard fighting lawyer helped ferret out a lot of stuff. Where it is,
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:46.080]  he got raided along with his wife today in the Ukraine situation for investigating corruption
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:52.800]  into Hunter Biden and Burisma and Joe Biden. This is direct political persecution. What they
[3:12:52.800 --> 3:13:01.120]  claimed Nixon was just dreaming of. And so this is outrageous. I mean, the FBI's name is already bad.
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:05.200]  But I've known some good FBI agents, you know, they cover some real crimes. That's the
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:10.400]  rank and follow FBI, the political FBI, the top, and I'd say the top couple bottom as well.
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:18.000]  I mean, they just love it. They enjoy it. They hate America. They hate freedom. They love tyranny.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:24.240]  They love Chinese spies. They love open borders. It's just incredible. So FISA court-ordering
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:31.200]  target list shows it suspects pattern FBI seeking political dirt. Joe Gevenova says, and that was
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:38.560]  back in April of last year, a year ago. So going to Roger Stone, this is just incredible naked
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:44.800]  political persecution. That's exactly what it is, Alex. This is something you'd see in a foreign
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:49.840]  country. In other words, we are now going to demonize and prosecute our political opponents
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:57.520]  based on fabricated crimes. Rudy Giuliani is one of the greatest men I've ever known. He single-handedly
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:04.320]  cleaned up the city of New York, turned it from a slum to a shining city on the hill. And of course,
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:10.160]  liberal policies have undone that. It's unlivable today. The New York City, Rudy Giuliani left
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:16.320]  behind is long, long gone. But now we have a full-flow witch hunt. Let's call it witch hunt
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:24.080]  3.0 because 2.0 was trying to tie patriots who had nothing whatsoever to do with the stupid,
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:31.280]  ineffective, illegal, harmful activities at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. That has failed.
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:37.120]  So now we're going to invent crimes pertaining to Ukraine. There's a lot of crimes involving
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:43.600]  U.S. policy in Ukraine. Unfortunately, they were committed by Joe Biden and his son Hunter,
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:49.360]  apparently with the approval of Barack Obama. Again, a two-tiered justice system.
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:53.760]  By the way, Alex, something else for the Info Warriors, I'm going to be on the war room today
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:59.200]  with my old co-host, Roland Schreuer. I'm so cranked up about this. I want to talk about it
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:04.640]  some more. Every American out there needs to know what's being done here. This is the destruction
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:10.560]  of our democratic system. It is a farce. The Justice Department is involved in political
[3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:16.880]  prosecutions where there are no crimes. And now they're putting people that even go in the Capitol.
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:21.440]  And by the way, it was trending yesterday, my friend. They were all over the place saying,
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:26.640]  we want Roger Stone, we want General Flynn, and we want Alex Jones on the No Fly List. And I used
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:29.920]  to laugh a couple of years ago when you're like, you know, they're coming after me for Russia.
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:35.040]  And I said, you didn't do any leaks. I was there. You'd say, watch, you got indicted. I'm not laughing
[3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:41.360]  now. Well, as you said, when that mob calls for it, the FBI clicks its heels, jumps and says,
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:47.200]  how high a master? And so they are really calling for us to get it. Yeah, what happens here is once
[3:15:47.200 --> 3:15:54.720]  the vitriol and the hatred reaches critical mass on Twitter, then the newsrooms at the New York Times
[3:15:54.720 --> 3:15:59.120]  and the Washington Post who are in a fierce competition to see which one can be the worst
[3:15:59.120 --> 3:16:05.840]  newspaper in America, Wall Street Journal coming up a third and close third, they immediately
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:13.840]  grab this as a story that in turn nudges prosecutors to start looking for non-existent
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:18.720]  crimes. How much of this will the American people put up with? That remains to be seen.
[3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:24.720]  I know this. Roger Stone has done nothing wrong. And I will not be silenced. I will not have my
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:30.240]  First Amendment rights stripped from me. They have tried now three times. I suspect they'll
[3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:34.480]  try a fourth time, but I'm not going to stop fighting because I love this country. Let's
[3:16:34.480 --> 3:16:40.880]  explain this. There is a path back for us. There absolutely is. You see, Google, Apple,
[3:16:40.880 --> 3:16:46.800]  Amazon, they're very, very influential on the Internet, but they don't own it. And you can
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:52.720]  build a platform on the Internet, which is difficult to de-platform, which cannot be censored
[3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:56.000]  based on. Roger, I want to talk about solutions. And I know this. You're absolutely right. The
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.440]  censorship is the key to everything. But I just want to go back to this for a moment.
[3:17:00.480 --> 3:17:04.960]  Doesn't the average leftist understand that Trump was actually doing policies that helped the economy
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:10.080]  and helped them? No, they don't. But now he's gone out of the equation and they're still supporting
[3:17:10.080 --> 3:17:15.280]  policies that are going to destroy their future. Don't they understand that if you can put non-violent
[3:17:15.280 --> 3:17:20.400]  demonstrators on a no-fly list that no one is safe, don't they get the system wants to target
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:24.880]  everybody? Don't they have common sense? I don't want to see Black Lives Matter on a no-fly list.
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:29.040]  I don't want to see anybody until they've committed a crime or said they're going to blow an airplane
[3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:35.360]  up. I want new process. I want America. Why would anyone want to shred all of the safety
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:40.960]  nets that our forebears fought and died to build? Well, because everything is backwards, Alex.
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:46.240]  Remember, it used to be that liberals were supporters of civil liberties. Liberals were
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:52.560]  the proponents of free speech. Liberals were the proponents of civil rights. Liberals were opposed
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:58.800]  to endless foreign wars. Now liberals are authoritarian. Oh, I disagree with him. Silence him.
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:04.960]  Sensor him. Lock him up. You know why? Because they are devoid of ideas. Because they can't win
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:11.840]  an honest debate over policy or over principles or over ideas. And they also like the power of 40 FBI
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:17.040]  agents, helicopters and boats at your house pointing guns at you and your wife and your little dogs.
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:24.640]  Because they get off existentially or like what reflected glory by it. It's very sick. It's very
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:31.200]  bizarre. Well, I think it's designed to instill fear in patriots. You see, they figure if they
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:36.320]  raid my house, they'll silence other people. Well, they haven't silenced Tucker Carlson.
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:42.160]  They haven't silenced Sean Hannity. They haven't silenced you. They haven't silenced dozens of
[3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:47.120]  other patriots. Even though we are disadvantaged on the internet, we're going to keep fighting.
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:51.120]  We're not going to give up because America is too great. Well, let's talk about that before
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:55.760]  we go to break. You're a smart cookie. If we all capitulated, how bad would it get? How far would
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:58.880]  the left take us? Because they said they want to collapse the whole country. They have such a
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:04.960]  weird hatred of the country. They hijacked. I mean, if I was a robber and I hijacked the car,
[3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:08.960]  I'd take it and sell it. I wouldn't burn it down just because I was thought it was beautiful. I
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:15.440]  don't get why there's such chicken shits. It's a very difficult question because what they don't
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:22.000]  seem to understand is today it's us. Tomorrow it will be them. Ultimately, no one will have free
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:27.520]  speech because if you ban the free speech of one individual, in essence, you're banning the free
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:33.120]  speech of all of us ultimately. That's the part they don't seem to get. So today they can hate
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:38.400]  on Roger Stone, but wait till it comes to their door. And it will, it most definitely will.
[3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:41.200]  So let me ask you, the woman that we had to break will come back with solutions.
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:44.000]  And also the weird explosion right by your office. It looks like Beirut.
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:19:48.880]  How far would they take us? It just seems like they just have a mission to take us to hell.
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:19:53.600]  Well, you know, I look, I have friends who are Democrats. I have friends who are actually
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:58.800]  moderate Democrats who assured me that once Joe Biden was president, that he wanted to have a
[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:03.280]  peaceful nation, that he would reign in the more radical elements. You even went on air and said,
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:08.960]  I wish him well. You tried to just say, stop. Well, look, I want the country to succeed. I want
[3:20:08.960 --> 3:20:14.400]  a booming economy. I want a job for everyone who wants one. I want a good education. Hold it there.
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:18.960]  This is too important. They reached out and said, don't worry, Roger. Just let our Lordship in.
[3:20:18.960 --> 3:20:23.360]  You didn't help him, but you know, you said, and then boom, no, they, because they're a bunch of
[3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:28.720]  weird, crazy people and a bunch of people that never really had real power that just have some
[3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:33.200]  weird existential hatred of America. I mean, I would liken it to a Sigmund Freud claim that
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:37.920]  women have penis envy. I don't think that's really the case, but they definitely have America envy.
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:43.280]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones in full wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:52.000]  You know, listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:58.320]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:20:58.880 --> 3:21:03.200]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all this together. And I, you know, it gets old having
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:07.040]  to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air. But it's
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:10.960]  true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:15.920]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:20.560]  else. They crippled all the other groups and we're still here. And as this whole new world order
[3:21:20.560 --> 3:21:24.880]  comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:21:24.880 --> 3:21:29.200]  That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:34.080]  and America's still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:38.400]  with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:43.280]  ready. So thank you all and get an info war store.com gets some great 2020 election shirts,

[3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:52.720]  thank you. You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've
[3:21:52.720 --> 3:21:56.480]  talked about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility,
[3:21:56.480 --> 3:22:00.320]  but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:05.280]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have time to tell
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:09.200]  you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on. But
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:13.040]  let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end, we're going to stay on air as
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:18.240]  long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products and then forward store.com.

[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:26.560]  you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:32.400]  products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:36.240]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people
[3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:40.720]  like us from the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[3:22:49.600 --> 3:22:56.000]  order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete, making you a domesticated animal
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:00.480]  they control. They want to censor you. They want to dump you down. They want to poison you and they

[3:23:54.000 --> 3:24:01.280]  Alex Jones was right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:06.160]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger. But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news

[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:08.320]  All right, we got about 25 minutes left, 26 minutes left of this transmission,
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:12.080]  the war rooms coming up on Schreuer. Of course, Ryderstone will be joining him again. I'm Alex
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:17.440]  Jones, your host. There was two minutes left of the break. My coffee was cold. I said, I'm gonna
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:21.840]  go stick it in the microwave because I'm gonna work after I get off here. I wanted another
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:27.600]  half cup of coffee and I literally stumbled into the break room, fell against the wall, the cup
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.760]  popping out of my hand, splattering all over my face, all over me. So I don't have time to change
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:35.680]  shirts. There you go. The coffee's on me. It's all real. Who cares? It's a new accoutrement.
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:40.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got the big fashion critic, Ryderstone here with us, but let's get
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:44.960]  serious. I was just asking you that question. I'm gonna go through some of these news stories
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:51.440]  at your take on them, but you were hoping that Biden would just be an American, not sell the
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:56.880]  country out, be rational, and you even hoped that he would do well, because I guess you said you
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:01.440]  had some liberal friends telling you, oh, don't worry, once Trump's gone, all this tyranny will
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:05.680]  end. We only had to do all this tyranny to get rid of the great evil. But as that always works,
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:11.040]  no one's actually intensifying now that they've gotten in. So expand on what you were saying.
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:16.720]  First of all, let's be very clear about who's really running the country right now. You have a
[3:26:16.720 --> 3:26:22.880]  power sharing arrangement between Ron Klain. Ron Klain was Biden's Chief of Staff when he was in
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:29.040]  the Senate. Ron Klain was Vice President Al Gore's Chief of Staff. Ron Klain ran the disastrous
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:37.120]  Florida recount for Al Gore in 2000. I'm very familiar with Ron Klain. He is sharing power with
[3:26:37.120 --> 3:26:44.320]  Susan Rice. That's the woman who illegally masked and unmasked a number of Americans during the
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:50.080]  Russian collusion hoax. These are the two people running the country. Joe Biden, I suspect, is
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:55.760]  locked in a room where they send in gruel every once in a while. Those folks are running this
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:27:02.400]  country today. Ron Klain ran the crimson contagion that was the globalist drill for the whole COVID
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:07.040]  lockdown shut down two years before. And if you notice that Biden, he did it again yesterday. He
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:11.040]  says, I'm going to get in trouble if I talk more. Am I allowed to talk? Am I allowed to speak?
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:15.600]  We're putting a compilation of him doing it like 30 times together. He really acts like he's got
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:21.040]  dementia and doesn't know who he is. This is a real crisis, isn't it? It really is. And I must
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:27.200]  tell you, if Susan Rice continues to treat Vice President Harris the way Jack and Bobby Kennedy
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:34.160]  treated Lyndon Johnson, I think she may regret it if Joe Biden and the actuarial tables turn out
[3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:39.040]  to be true. And by the way, I don't wish Joe Biden any ill health. I don't wish him anything but
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:44.800]  success. I'm an American. I'd like to see a booming economy. I'd like to see jobs for everyone who
[3:27:44.800 --> 3:27:49.680]  wants one. I'd like everyone to have a safe neighborhood, a good education. I think we all
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:55.760]  want that. And yes, I had moderate Democrat friends who assured me all this radicalism,
[3:27:55.760 --> 3:28:00.800]  all of this hate, that was all churned up by Donald Trump, they said. The country will get
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:07.280]  back to normalcy. The more radical wing of the Democratic Party will be in retreat and will
[3:28:07.280 --> 3:28:13.680]  return to centrist policies. I don't see that happening. What I see are FISA courts issuing,
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:19.520]  allowing warrantless searches. I read a story just last week in the Washington Times that
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:24.640]  they have legalized drone strikes against American citizens. Oh, let's raise that next point. Let's
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:29.600]  show some of the HD footage. I've been to your little office and a little restaurant right
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:34.160]  there, the Italian restaurant. I saw that building, literally a stone's throw from you. What the hell
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:41.280]  happened there? It's really quite extraordinary. The old, what used to be the M4 studio in South
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:49.760]  Florida, now where I'm doing business in an industrial area in Oakland Park, Florida, and 250 feet from
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:57.280]  my front door, there was a massive explosion. You see right there what is left. Now, Eric
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:04.480]  Mankow Mueller, a radio legend who you introduced me to, Alex, truly a great American. He was with
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:10.560]  me and he said, we got to go film this. People have to see this. Look at this devastation.
[3:29:10.560 --> 3:29:17.120]  We have no explanation as to what happened here. Now, for the crazy leftists over at
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:23.760]  Media Matters for America, no, I didn't say that this was a drone strike. Others have
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:30.960]  speculated that that is a possibility, but something blew up here. There's some reason
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:37.440]  why this building exploded, and we still don't have any official reason. The devastation here
[3:29:37.440 --> 3:29:42.640]  is really extraordinary. And people can see all the HD footage at Bandot video. Click the left
[3:29:42.640 --> 3:29:51.440]  hand nav bar and go down to the Roger Stone zone or the Roger Stone zone page. And expanding on
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:56.960]  that though, Roger, you have it coming out in documents that the Air National Guard under
[3:29:56.960 --> 3:30:03.040]  Biden's orders scrambled fighter jets to buzz and harass citizens. You have giant barriers up around
[3:30:03.040 --> 3:30:10.160]  the Capitol. You have calls for the CIA to treat Trump supporters like Al Qaeda. You have Saki
[3:30:10.160 --> 3:30:14.720]  in hearings saying you have Congressman Nunes warning he's in hearings, but they said they're
[3:30:14.720 --> 3:30:19.120]  going to use the CIA on Trump supporters and that we're terrorists. So we have to ask that question
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:23.840]  when Swallowswell says he wants to use nuclear weapons on gun owners. I mean, I guess this is
[3:30:23.840 --> 3:30:31.040]  a logical extension. No, you also see it in the harassment of Matt Gaetz. I have still not seen
[3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:36.400]  any actual proof or evidence that Congressman Matt Gaetz has done anything wrong. They want to
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:41.600]  destroy him. Why? Because he's not afraid to take on the deep state, because he's not afraid to take
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:47.680]  on the critics of the America First agenda. It's a smear job. They're trying to destroy this guy.
[3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:52.080]  The way they tried to destroy me, the way they tried to destroy General Flynn. General Flynn
[3:30:52.080 --> 3:30:58.560]  was in South Florida last week, this past week, Alex, and he gave an extraordinary speech on
[3:30:58.560 --> 3:31:04.800]  Saturday to the Defend Florida Rally in Bradenton. I was honored to speak just before him. I'm telling
[3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:10.400]  you, this is a man of destiny. This is a man of courage. This is a man of principle. If Donald
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:17.120]  Trump wants to run in 2024, I'm with him. He can count on me. But if he lets not to run, I think we,
[3:31:17.120 --> 3:31:21.920]  the American people, have got to draft General Flynn. By the way, did somebody take that speech?
[3:31:21.920 --> 3:31:27.040]  Because I'd love to air it. I will get you a copy of it. I'm absolutely convinced.
[3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:31.120]  Let's do this. Upload it to the Roger Stone Stone Zone on Band-Aid video.
[3:31:31.760 --> 3:31:36.560]  All right. We will do that immediately after the show. All right. And we can talk about it on the
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:41.920]  war room. I'm convinced that if the president elects not to run again, and again, if he does,
[3:31:41.920 --> 3:31:48.800]  I'm in his corner 100%. But if not, we have to find somebody, one individual, who can hold
[3:31:48.800 --> 3:31:53.360]  together. Well, let me say, I had a chance to meet Claude for a long time with Flynn,
[3:31:53.360 --> 3:31:58.240]  and it gets really dumb. Super smart. Very guarded. I get why he's been stabbed in the back a lot.
[3:31:58.240 --> 3:32:03.840]  Very presidential. Has that aura. And the people will get behind him. And so I just want to see
[3:32:03.840 --> 3:32:10.400]  him launch. I want to see him really take action in a big way soon. But let me shift gears real
[3:32:10.400 --> 3:32:18.480]  fast. We're going to break with you on this. Biden to pitch sweeping family plan in speech
[3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:22.240]  to Congress. Everything's the opposite. He's destroying our families with debt and control.
[3:32:22.240 --> 3:32:28.880]  Critics of California governor gather enough signatures to force recall of Newsom. Oscars
[3:32:28.880 --> 3:32:34.240]  plunged the lowest ratings in history despite the monopoly of stunt pandering as audience flea
[3:32:34.240 --> 3:32:40.080]  suffocating wokeness. Oscars bombs lowest ratings ever. Black Panther actually get zero awards.
[3:32:40.880 --> 3:32:46.240]  IRS data shows Democrats are the party of the rich. Yeah, they are the elite that they claim
[3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:51.280]  that they're not. Here's a bizarre Schumer watching it. Senator Schumer says excited to be watching
[3:32:51.280 --> 3:32:58.160]  the Oscars with an ice cold plant based beer. Hey, dumbass, they're all plant based. Thanks,
[3:32:58.160 --> 3:33:03.680]  Joe Biden. What the hell does that mean? Coming this summer, gas stations running out of gas
[3:33:03.680 --> 3:33:07.680]  because of the year long lockdown, the people are out of business in bankrupt. They've only got
[3:33:07.680 --> 3:33:12.480]  about 60% of the gas they're going to need. Total hell. And it goes on and on. The point is the
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:18.960]  public and the world is rejecting the left all over the planet, rejecting Hollywood.
[3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:24.320]  And they're trying to implode us the way they're imploding. Is there any way to stop their self
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:32.640]  destruction? Well, and they're apoplectic about any kind of honest recount of the Maricopa County
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:38.960]  Arizona vote. That's 60% of the statewide vote in one county. Why are they so obsessed with this?
[3:33:38.960 --> 3:33:43.200]  Why are they so upset? If they're so certain that there's no improprieties, that there's no
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:49.120]  irregularities, then they should just let the count proceed. But Mark Elias, the number one criminal
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:55.200]  in the Democratic Party, is in Arizona trying everything in the book to stop an honest recount.
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.080]  What are they afraid of? What are they trying to hide? It's so obvious. It's ridiculous. By the way,
[3:34:00.080 --> 3:34:03.920]  this just came in. We'll have it on the other side. Owen Schroeder has been joining us as well ahead
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.880]  of the war. I'm starting with your truly Roger Stone. And that's they just passed by a large
[3:34:08.880 --> 3:34:18.000]  majority in Florida, the ban on vaccine passports. Vaccine passports are officially outlawed in Florida.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  Now the bill passes 76 to 40. All right, we'll be back with Roger Stone on the other side. Please
[3:34:24.720 --> 3:34:28.800]  do not forget. I forgot to plug last hour without your support. We won't be here. We make it easy.
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:32.880]  A lot of great t-shirts. I'm going to go change into one. I just broke off it on myself that got

[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:52.080]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:37:59.760]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world god.
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:05.520]  It's known as the builder bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:11.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:18.720]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand. The globalist fear this film made
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:22.640]  14 years ago. It is the blueprint for their plan to figure the world. It is the blueprint for the

[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:45.760]  that they make copies and share it as well. That will trigger distribution by proxy,
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:39:01.680]  meaning we the people cannot be stopped. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:09.840]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic. I'm Alex Jones. We're about to
[3:39:09.840 --> 3:39:23.440]  end the fourth hour of our global transmission. The former political prisoner will be riding
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:29.360]  shotgun with his old co-host. I really appreciate the listeners. They call in thanking me and I
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.840]  just want them to know that I want to thank you. I'm deep into this fight. I want to stay in the
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:40.000]  fight. I don't fear getting put in prison or killed or any of that. I fear the globalist winning and
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:45.680]  having their way with humanity. I really instinctively associate with humanity. I'm like a baby duck
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:50.480]  that imprinted, you know, on the family dog and it thinks it's its mommy, except I'm not imprinting
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:56.080]  on a dog. I've been printing on humanity. My species is species I came from. I really love you.
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:00.800]  And the psychos, they all think hating people is cool. They think screwing people over is cool.
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:06.000]  That's not who I am. And I just want to say this because I thought about this earlier today
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:09.840]  and I want to say it now with Roger because they take out a context to everything we say
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:15.280]  and lie about it and say that Roger wants violence or I want violence. Violence is how the
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:20.080]  globalists win. I don't want any offensive violence. I want to fix this peacefully. I want
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:24.880]  people to come out of the transfer end who are serving evil. But I'll tell you this, they sent
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:28.800]  40 SWAT team people to Roger's house hoping he'd do something so they could kill him. They had their
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:32.960]  fingers on the trigger when you watch that video. And he's the guy in his shorts with his little
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:37.680]  dog with no history of violence. And I know that they want to raid us. And I'm not scared of that.
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.920]  It's going to work in favor for God in the end. And I'm totally resigned to any of it. In fact,
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:46.160]  the sick level, fine. That's the way it is. Whatever. Let it be because the children are
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:49.920]  being killed. They're being aborted. They're being molested. They're selling the baby body parts.
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:53.920]  They're keeping them alive. That's all coming out. They have animal human clones at a certain
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:58.560]  point. You got to say no. But I want to take this away from the secret police or their crazy
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:05.840]  people or some middle patient they wind up like Sirhan Sirhan or something. I will never
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:12.000]  offensively kill anybody. I will never kill myself. I love life. I will never hurt my family.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:16.480]  I will never attack federal officers if they raid us, which they're all over the newsstand
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:20.240]  they want to do. We have nothing to hide. We're wide open. They want to plant stuff. Go ahead.
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:26.960]  So if I ever get ready to go home or here and they kill me, they 100% killed me because there's
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:31.520]  no gun right here. We've got license security people. That's that. We are law abiding, loving,
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:38.160]  good people. We are not the criminals at the FBI that give waivers to the federal law that they
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:42.400]  can't even do to let people with no background check have children by the thousands every day
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:46.480]  disappearing into rattles. Senate report found they're being placed with child molesters and
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:50.800]  human traffickers. We are not the violent system that burned down Waco and killed all those people.
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:56.640]  I didn't shoot Randy Weaver's wife and his son. Juan Joriyuchi did. I'm not the one
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:02.880]  that blew up Oklahoma City like the FBI and ATF people under Clinton did. I am not these people.
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:09.760]  I am not you. I am not you. And so I am very willing to die, be in prison, tortured,
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:13.680]  have everything taken away because I know God's going to win the end. But I'm really worried,
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:17.760]  Roger. I was talking to a very well-known friend of ours who's let's just leave it at that,
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:21.760]  who's let's just say even more prominent than us. He really feels the next step is they're going to
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:25.600]  try to kill all of us. That's how bad this is, Roger. So let's just get it out there. We're not
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:31.520]  going to commit suicide. And if the feds rate us, we are not going to pull guns on them because the
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:36.960]  word is they just want to kill us. Well, I've already lost everything. I've already lost everything
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:43.520]  in this struggle. And now I'm being harassed by the IRS. Who know? I have no assets. I paid every
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:49.200]  penny in tax that I owed them today. But now they want to torture me over penalties and interest
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:53.760]  because they know they bankrupted me in their phony investigation. You know, I got to be honest
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:59.440]  with you at almost 69 years old. I didn't expect to be working this hard. No, you didn't tell me
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:04.320]  to say this and nobody asked me to. But if I wasn't using brain force, one of the best products
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:10.880]  in the Info Wars line every single day, I wouldn't be able to put in sometimes 16, 17, 18 hour days.
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:16.080]  This is a great product. I'm not being paid to tell you this, folks. I'm being paid. I'm telling
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:21.280]  this because it works for me. So Info Wars needs your support. Very soon, we're going to see the
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:28.000]  revamped version of stonecoldtruth.com, where I'm going to have a daily video podcast. You'll
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:33.040]  be able to hear it on audio. You'll be able to see it because I want to reach more people. But
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:38.080]  these are the fountains of truth. Nothing against the my pillow guy. I'm going to talk to him soon.
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:42.640]  He's a great guy. My pillow guy is a great guy. But he hasn't launched it yet. Trump said he
[3:43:42.640 --> 3:43:45.680]  launched the thing. He hasn't launched it yet. You're not the type of guy to talk about something
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:50.880]  until it's up and going. You are really working with some top people to launch a real social
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:55.920]  network. We really need to have that happen. It's absolutely true. Look, I'm very excited about
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:44:02.160]  what Mike Lindell is building. But I think he's being undermined from the inside. Technologically,
[3:44:02.160 --> 3:44:08.080]  I mean. But we need 1,000 flowers to bloom, as Chairman Mao once said. I want to see hundreds
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:13.760]  of social media sites that allow everybody to speak. Left, right, center, including those who
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:18.320]  are non. And what we need is a patriot crowdfunding site. They're taking banking away and crowdfunding
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:24.240]  from us. Whoever successfully launches that is really going to turn the tide because they are
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:28.960]  financially involved in economic war against us. Roger, let's bring in your former co-host. You'll
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:35.280]  be co-hosting again with today. Owen Troyer. Owen hearing the Giuliani raid. The raid on others that
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:41.920]  expose the Hunter Biden corruption. They're literally raiding them for exposing the corruption
[3:44:41.920 --> 3:44:45.920]  that they were involved in. This is unprecedented. What else you got coming up in the war room?
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:51.440]  Well, honestly, it's just, it's kind of hard to even cover this stuff. I mean,
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:56.880]  we're living in a totalitarian regime right now. We're living in an authoritarian regime right now.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:02.560]  This is creeping tyranny. We're living in the twilight of America. I mean, the gates are closing.
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:08.480]  The walls are closing on everybody. Exactly. Go ahead. So what commentary am I to do? Alex,
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:12.000]  I mean, that's, that's what's so crazy about this. I mean, what commentary am I supposed to do? You've
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:16.960]  got Roger Stone on here who we've had the federal government destroy his life. We've got them raiding
[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:22.000]  Ruly Giuliani. Giuliani, they're obviously going to try to intimidate him to flip on Trump. We've
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:26.080]  got Nick Fuentes added to a no-fly list, never committed a crime. We've got Laura Loomer not
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:30.080]  allowed to own a gun, never committed a crime. We've got the feds up our ass 24 seven. I mean,
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:34.240]  that's the story. That's the commentary. That's what's happening. That's fascism. This is,
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:39.200]  this is tyranny. This is, this should be red alert sirens. So I don't know what it's going to take.
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:44.320]  The problem is most of the media that likes America, most of the media that wants prosperity or the
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:48.240]  individuals on it, they're still in their comfort zone. They haven't had the feds come after them.
[3:45:48.240 --> 3:45:52.160]  They haven't been banned on. So they don't know that they're rapidly devaluing all the global
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:56.000]  currencies. There's about to be a huge collapse. That's why all this is, that's why this is all
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:46:00.640]  happening. They're getting ready to collapse everything and to cover up for the crimes that
[3:46:00.640 --> 3:46:05.200]  they committed to cover up from the theft that they committed from our piggy banks. That's what
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:10.080]  this is all about. Oh, build back better. Exactly. It's, it's, it's, it's birdie made off types to
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:13.520]  the next level that are just going to bring in global tyranny to cover up what they've done.
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:17.440]  The great reset is to cover up their financial fraud. Roger Stone, any comments on that?
[3:46:18.400 --> 3:46:23.360]  I think that's exactly right. Look, I'm not an economist, but you can see where this is all
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:29.840]  headed. Um, I had hoped that Biden would pursue a more moderate course. I had hoped that he would
[3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:37.360]  put America first, but now America is clearly last. And, uh, the Chinese insult our diplomats with
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:43.840]  impunity. They're laughing at us. They know half the Democratic Party's on the take on their payroll.
[3:46:43.840 --> 3:46:50.880]  Yet, um, the, uh, Attorney General in New York state is combing through Donald Trump's tax returns.
[3:46:50.880 --> 3:46:57.680]  Meanwhile, Eric Swalwell, who is actually a red Chinese spy or at least was sleeping with one
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:02.880]  and who had, uh, an actual Russian asset working in his office is on the intelligence committee
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:09.280]  where he has full access to classified information. This is Alice in Wonderland time. This guy should
[3:47:09.280 --> 3:47:13.360]  be removed from the Congress. Never mind the committee. Well, America is in trouble. We're
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:17.440]  being set up for a fall. The Chinese are launching three warships a day. We're decommissioning ships
[3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:20.720]  or decommissioning everything. We're just falling apart. I don't have to be negative. I sense we
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:25.120]  know how much trouble we're in. Pray to God for a global awakening. Uh, Biden's dumping illegal
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:29.680]  banned AstraZeneca vaccine on India. Uh, it's incredible. Guys, you're both going to be hosting
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:33.680]  today. The war room only got 30 seconds. What else are you going to be covering when your show
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:39.280]  starts in three minutes? Well, I think Donald Trump, who I believe is the president, he was
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:43.520]  rightfully elected, but we all know those shenanigans. Donald Trump wants to get back on the scene.
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:47.840]  He wants to get back out in front. He wants to lead from the front. The problem is he's being
[3:47:47.840 --> 3:47:52.240]  harassed on the scenes. As Roger just said, they're, you know, going after his finances. But not only
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:57.200]  that, uh, an interesting story from Politico, which, you know, is the mouthpiece, uh, for the,
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:02.480]  for the deep state, how Trump's renewed election rhetoric is complicating capital riders' legal
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:06.720]  fight. So they're trying to gag Trump by saying, oh, if you say anything, we're going to use it
[3:48:06.720 --> 3:48:10.560]  against your supporters. We're going to get you. You'll be covering this today, but that's exactly
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:13.920]  what's happening. When Trump said, I'm going to go ahead and do rallies, go ahead and get
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:17.280]  Republicans elected. Now they're going to have a Giuliani. The message is we're going to get you.
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:20.400]  So Trump's doing the right thing. He's fighting. We're fighting. We're never going to give up.
[3:48:20.400 --> 3:48:24.720]  Thank you, Roger Stone. Thank you, Owen Shroyer. All right. That's it for this four-hour edition
[3:48:24.720 --> 3:48:28.880]  of the Alex Jones Show. Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central. Pray for us.
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:33.120]  Pray for America. Thanks for keeping us in fighting position and your prayers,
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:36.960]  your financial support that keeps us here. We love our affiliates. We're Patriot Americans. We're
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:40.960]  going to win this together. The enemy's in deep trouble, but they're trying to take us down with
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:44.800]  them. Everybody's fleeing Hollywood. They're fleeing New York. They're fleeing LA, but the
[3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:48.400]  globalists are trying to bring us down with them. So be strong and know that's how we defeated.
