[00:00.000 --> 00:16.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.880 --> 00:24.120]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones grab
[00:24.120 --> 00:28.200]  yourselves in ladies and gentlemen this is gonna be a rough transmission but key
[00:28.200 --> 00:33.000]  to the ongoing fight against the globalist was over a month and a half ago
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.080]  that I said prepare for imminent SJW attacks we'd already seen them shang
[00:37.080 --> 00:40.840]  Hunt Republicans on CNN and Fox News we've already seen Congressmen's
[00:40.840 --> 00:44.800]  police and others shot we'd already seen city council members gunned down with
[00:44.800 --> 00:48.560]  the Democratic neighbors we'd already seen Black Lives Matter of connected
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.760]  groups killing police all over the nation and the knockout game but now we
[00:53.760 --> 00:57.360]  heard them say that their big event was coming this November 4th well Rand Paul
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.400]  has a punctured lung and five broken ribs and we've got a church with 26 dead
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.920]  people from an SJW atheist it's all coming up but first this report
[01:06.920 --> 01:11.600]  Brazil the former head of the DNC has come out and said Hillary stole the
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.920]  election from Bernie Sanders I don't need to hear that from her it's a fact but I
[01:15.920 --> 01:19.040]  know she's telling the truth because what she's written about and got public
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.760]  about in her new book is what happened at the time it's all confirmed but bigger
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.360]  than that mainstream media CNN MSNBC Wolf Glitzer Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren
[01:30.360 --> 01:36.880]  they're all turning against the Clintons now because they know there's no way
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.360]  they can cover up the crimes they've committed you think though that what
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.960]  we're learning from Donna Brazil's books suggests that the campaign that what
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.880]  the Democratic National Committee did meant this election was rigged I think
[01:47.880 --> 01:54.520]  it was it's a pretty powerful charge well what we have to focus on now as
[01:54.520 --> 02:00.200]  Democrats is we recognize the process was rigged they're sort of shocking
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.240]  revelation from the former Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.000]  Brazil is what they don't know they don't know what it was like to be over the
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.840]  DNC during this hacking they don't know what it's like to bury a child I did
[02:11.840 --> 02:15.720]  Seth Rich they don't know what it's like to protect the staff from further
[02:15.720 --> 02:20.600]  harassment they don't know what it's like we broke first that they rigged the
[02:20.600 --> 02:24.560]  nomination process against Bernie Sanders we've been proven correct in
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.880]  triplicate so again we're the real news MSNBC the rest they're the fake news we
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.600]  also broke that Seth Rich clearly was executed and murdered as the head
[02:35.600 --> 02:39.320]  staffer over the emails for the DNC there were major homeland security
[02:39.320 --> 02:46.280]  investigations over Pakistan India Russia China the EU in our servers Hillary's
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.560]  illegal servers they wanted to cover it up Donna Brazil has now come out and
[02:50.560 --> 02:53.840]  said she wanted to go to Homeland Security she tried to get Jay Johnson
[02:53.840 --> 02:58.080]  involved and Hillary and others said shut up don't look at it don't
[02:58.080 --> 03:03.560]  investigate it incredible but that pales in significance to the headline at
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.280]  info wars.com from her book Donna Brazil says she feared for her life after
[03:10.280 --> 03:15.880]  Seth Rich was killed and that she basically thought the DNC or others
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.840]  were gonna try to kill her to cover up what she knew about whatever was
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.080]  happening in those servers this is the rats leaving the sinking ship Donna
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.120]  Brazil is controlled by Biden by Obama and others and they're trying to
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.640]  compartmentalize now the danger but think about this we got hammered we got
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.160]  attacked we got demonized for being the first to expose the Seth Rich was a
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.640]  political murder then WikiLeaks came out and said we don't normally give up
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.080]  sources but basically he's our source we've got a big reward for whoever finds
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.480]  out who killed him that's why they're now so desperate and the fact that the
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.840]  Democratic Party establishment is running from the Clintons right now
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.560]  shows you the whole house of cards is coming down this is Roger Stone for info
[03:59.560 --> 04:05.640]  wars former DNC big Donna Brazil dropped a bombshell in her new book when she
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.680]  admitted that she feared her life in the wake of the murder of Seth Rich that
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.560]  means that Brazil knew that Rich had been murdered for political purposes one
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.440]  need look only at the interview with Julian Assange WikiLeaks where he says
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.240]  three times in regard to Rich that sources to WikiLeaks are in great
[04:24.240 --> 04:28.760]  physical danger and then he posts a twenty five thousand dollar reward for
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.600]  apprehension of Seth Rich's murderer what more do you need to know Roger Stone
[04:33.600 --> 04:40.840]  for info wars what more do you need ladies and gentlemen Donna Brazil the
[04:40.840 --> 04:47.360]  former head of the DNC has now come out publicly and said I fear for my life
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.440]  Seth Rich was probably murdered politically to cover up corruption in
[04:51.440 --> 04:55.520]  the DNC and a bunch of foreign countries inside our servers and I'm not
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.800]  involved and it's incredible stay with us you go to infowarstore.com and get

[06:15.720 --> 06:28.480]  lines of the info war it was the best of times it was the worst of times it's
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.560]  been said that you really find out what kind of people you're dealing with during
[06:31.560 --> 06:37.120]  a crisis and every time there's a tragedy in the state of Texas particularly
[06:37.120 --> 06:44.800]  I'm really proud of how the people come together of every background like we saw
[06:44.800 --> 06:51.600]  in Houston but we saw Charlie Hebdo we saw Hollywood we saw Jennifer Lawrence
[06:51.600 --> 06:58.240]  we saw countless Hollywood people say good I hope all those rednecks die in
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.520]  Houston because they voted for Trump even though Houston is arguably the most
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.520]  diverse city in the United States and Paul Watson chronicle this last night
[07:07.520 --> 07:14.120]  on his Twitter feed in the aftermath of the biggest mass murder in Texas history
[07:14.120 --> 07:20.320]  has even worse than the tower shooting and he chronicled all these prominent
[07:20.320 --> 07:24.480]  Democrat liberal Twitter accounts celebrating it making jokes about it
[07:24.480 --> 07:28.480]  despite the fact that I've looked at the videos the church put on its own
[07:28.480 --> 07:33.320]  YouTube and photos church was about half Hispanic just like South Texas there
[07:33.320 --> 07:38.120]  isn't Hispanic or white it's just everybody's married in together and the
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.000]  church had a lot of Hispanic folks in it and that's mainly who ended up getting
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.920]  killed by the way but the leftist media didn't care they just ran with it that
[07:45.920 --> 07:51.000]  oh see you right wingers in Texas who ride your horses to work and this is a
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.520]  rural area by the way you deserve to basically die then Newsweek wrote a big
[07:56.520 --> 08:06.520]  story trying to spin the whole report that the shooter disarmament discharge
[08:06.520 --> 08:11.800]  Devin P. Kelly from the Air Force for beating his wife and baby of a previous
[08:11.800 --> 08:16.560]  marriage four years ago he was in the brig for it so it's pretty serious for a
[08:16.560 --> 08:22.800]  while he was locked up in jail for much of a year we now know he was a devout
[08:22.800 --> 08:29.320]  atheist an SJW an animal rights activist it was wearing black the
[08:29.320 --> 08:38.280]  customary Antifa for stuionary now that said if you remember the shooting in
[08:38.280 --> 08:47.120]  South Carolina with Dylan roof who went in and shot all of those people yes there
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.720]  was one photo of him with a Confederate flag trying to be rebellious and he
[08:50.720 --> 08:54.840]  probably was a racist and he killed nine innocent black people in cold blood for
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.200]  months every white person was guilty every Confederate flag was evil the
[08:59.200 --> 09:03.040]  South was evil the American flag was evil towards Washington was evil Thomas
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.640]  Jefferson was evil we all had to be collectively guilty for what one idiot
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.360]  turned out on psychotropic drugs a big loser was on because there was one
[09:14.360 --> 09:21.400]  photo of him with a rebel flag well we have Devin P. Kelly on his LinkedIn and
[09:21.400 --> 09:29.520]  on Facebook with a whole list and and him putting out all of his beliefs in a
[09:29.520 --> 09:34.800]  fight fascism movement and they've been trying to pull these down off of
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.200]  LinkedIn and off of Twitter and off of Facebook we've confirmed these are his
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.600]  pages there's some other satire pages that have you know made jokes or photos
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.920]  shopped him in with the Antifa flag that's not real we've tracked it back and
[09:47.920 --> 09:51.200]  that kind of stuff just hurts the truth because in the media and point it and
[09:51.200 --> 09:57.240]  say oh look you know this is all fake no ladies and gentlemen Dylan roof had a
[09:57.240 --> 10:01.560]  rebel flag and was into being a racist that's the rebel flag was racist but for
[10:01.560 --> 10:08.320]  him it was he made it racist and Devin P. Kelly was definitely a
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.640]  anti-Christian globalist now what have I been saying for months building up in
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.480]  October and November I said Christian churches I specifically said Baptist
[10:17.480 --> 10:20.280]  churches we're trying to find the video right now because for some reason the
[10:20.280 --> 10:24.720]  globalist really hate Baptist churches Baptist churches primary schools
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.360]  secondary schools colleges sporting events rock concerts country music
[10:29.360 --> 10:34.920]  events think of the mindset of an SJW that wants war think about their past
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.560]  history and think about what they're gonna do because they can go out kill a
[10:38.560 --> 10:43.560]  bunch of Christian conservatives and then blame the Second Amendment all at
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.600]  the same time because again they want the leftist ideology to dominate and
[10:48.600 --> 10:53.040]  take over the culture and the society so they want guns but they want your
[10:53.040 --> 11:00.280]  guns and this is all the more reason for all of us to have our own self defense
[11:00.280 --> 11:06.440]  in this country now that said we're gonna break all of that down coming up
[11:06.440 --> 11:13.400]  today then we have Trump's incredible visit to Japan and now to South Korea
[11:13.400 --> 11:18.000]  and the tensions there we have the other attacks on Christians and
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.360]  conservatives that happened over the weekend we have Rand Paul tackled from
[11:22.360 --> 11:30.680]  behind by his socialist SJW neighbor another doctor who's anti-Trump a big
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.840]  globalist fan broke five his ribs punctured his lung much more serious than
[11:35.840 --> 11:40.840]  originally known he was given a class for felony that's like walking your dog
[11:40.840 --> 11:46.840]  without a leash absolutely outrageous so Paul has ribs fractures lung contusions
[11:46.840 --> 11:55.960]  after apparent assault by his SJW nature neighbor who was an avowed socialist
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.120]  even though he had a house you can see the photos three times bigger than Rand
[12:00.120 --> 12:05.240]  Paul's half a million dollar house and made a fortune selling quack rice bags
[12:05.240 --> 12:10.920]  that help back pain on home shopping network I love it another virtue
[12:10.920 --> 12:14.800]  signaling socialist who's worth millions of dollars and then assaulting Rand
[12:14.800 --> 12:23.040]  Paul isn't that just special and then of course the really giant news the humongous
[12:23.040 --> 12:29.400]  ultra massive incredibly important news that's coming up Donna Brazil we have
[12:29.400 --> 12:36.040]  the clips I considered replacing Clinton with Biden as 2016 nominee Donna
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.600]  Brazil quote though to hell I won't shut up about Hillary stealing the
[12:40.600 --> 12:48.720]  nomination and Seth Rich's death she called him a friend and a colleague and
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.560]  just keeps pointing out that he was murdered and that she was scared for
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.800]  her life I mean what is she telling you she is one millimeter from saying
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.600]  investigate Hillary for the murder she is crying out for help who have the
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.160]  illegal server Hillary who was involved with the Russians and told Brazil don't
[13:06.160 --> 13:12.080]  let the FBI and Homeland Security in the computers when they tried 22 times to
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.120]  get in and the DNC said no you said why don't they just get a warrant the DNC
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.720]  they thought Hillary's gonna be president she had her FBI director and she had
[13:21.720 --> 13:25.480]  her Homeland Security had in she'd been co-president with Obama basically
[13:25.480 --> 13:30.680]  running the State Department and so they didn't do it but now it's all
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.360]  imploding praise God for that this is really really amazing news and she
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.880]  dedicated her book to the Patriot Seth Rich this is big this is rats leaving the

[20:00.400 --> 20:29.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:30.400 --> 20:40.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[20:40.480 --> 20:47.760]  what we are looking at is good and evil right and wrong before I get into the
[20:47.760 --> 20:57.600]  terrible tragic shooting by a atheist blood thirsty dirt bald and atheists are
[20:57.600 --> 21:01.440]  gonna say hey don't blame all atheists for what he did well I actually agree
[21:01.440 --> 21:06.440]  with you but you blamed all white people the left did for one degenerate crazy
[21:06.440 --> 21:12.600]  white guy that killed nine people up at a black church in South Carolina so I'm
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.760]  just pointing out that you see that conservatives are not blaming all
[21:16.760 --> 21:20.720]  liberals or all atheists for this but we are pointing out he was wearing black
[21:20.720 --> 21:26.720]  that was an Antifa supporter and was a big SJW and this did happen the day
[21:26.720 --> 21:31.320]  after the November 4th he couldn't do it on November 4th because there aren't any
[21:31.320 --> 21:38.160]  churches that were meeting them but there were on November 5th just like
[21:38.160 --> 21:43.120]  Rand Paul had five ribs broken and a punctured lung by his socialist neighbor
[21:43.120 --> 21:49.840]  who hated his guts and reportedly was a huge SJW on his own Facebook drooling
[21:49.840 --> 21:55.560]  over the violence that we've seen so there you go and a lot more of this is
[21:55.560 --> 21:59.560]  happening you see it you don't see conservatives beating up Hillary
[21:59.560 --> 22:03.600]  supporters on the street you see leftists throwing hot coffee on and
[22:03.600 --> 22:08.360]  punching in the face and attacking from behind and knifing the tires and knock
[22:08.360 --> 22:15.680]  out gaming and shooting cops because they want a violent revolution then they
[22:15.680 --> 22:19.480]  played dumb when we pointed out now before I get into that I want to go
[22:19.480 --> 22:24.560]  over some fake news remember a few months ago there was a little boy
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.520]  partially handicapped from the chest down in his chair visiting the White
[22:29.520 --> 22:34.160]  House and Trump spent more time with him than anybody in the room combined talk
[22:34.160 --> 22:38.360]  to him several minutes talk to him again later well Trump's walking by shaking
[22:38.360 --> 22:42.800]  other hands the child reaches out again Trump doesn't see it and the media said
[22:42.800 --> 22:48.480]  look Trump ignored the child what a dirty horrible person even though 20
[22:48.480 --> 22:55.320]  seconds before in the clip you see that Trump was spending time with the child
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.840]  well they've done it again ladies and gentlemen info wars.com story by Paul
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.640]  Joseph Watson up at drudgereport.com as well the middle column triggered
[23:05.640 --> 23:13.200]  media goes into meltdown over Trump feeding fish in Japan now it shows the
[23:13.200 --> 23:17.120]  Prime Minister first show a little bit out and then dump the whole thing in as
[23:17.120 --> 23:23.600]  well but the media only showed Trump doing it and makes it look like Trump
[23:23.600 --> 23:33.000]  did it improperly by the way anybody that has anybody that knows how to feed
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.880]  koi knows that you do dump it in so again CNN video doesn't show that the
[23:38.880 --> 23:46.400]  Prime Minister threw in his whole batch as well it only cuts to Trump dumping
[23:46.400 --> 23:53.360]  the whole thing in to again make it look like Trump is being buffoonish and and
[23:53.360 --> 24:00.440]  being a thug or being a ogre so everything he does must be turned around
[24:00.440 --> 24:07.000]  to be a bad thing or a weird thing that's the rule whatever they see they
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.640]  basically invert it so that story is again up on info wars.com you want to
[24:13.640 --> 24:20.600]  see the full video versus what the CNN folks had edited and whether it's
[24:20.600 --> 24:27.680]  something like like that like what just happened with the koi fish or it's
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.680]  something similar to what happened when the little handicap boy is trying to
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.120]  shake the president's hand after he's already spent more time with him than
[24:37.120 --> 24:41.120]  anybody else and the president is busy shaking other hands and doesn't see it
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.960]  and moves on they turn that into him being a vicious horrible person and
[24:46.960 --> 24:52.000]  again this is what they do on every single front every single time in fact
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.600]  let's keep rolling the video for TV viewers when he first came in he did
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.200]  spend a lot of time with the boy but then when he's spending time shaking other
[24:59.200 --> 25:03.880]  hands and the boy is reaching out Trump is focused on them and does not go back
[25:03.880 --> 25:08.280]  to him they do the same thing with his wife who has impeccable etiquette and
[25:08.280 --> 25:11.920]  he'll be reaching out to her in a crowd as they're supposed to be walking off a
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.400]  runway or whatever and she's focused and will not and will pull her hand away
[25:17.400 --> 25:22.480]  because that's not the etiquette and they spin it that oh his wife hates him
[25:22.480 --> 25:29.240]  or Trump will reach his hand and doubt to another president or first lady or
[25:29.240 --> 25:38.120]  prime minister and they'll shake her hand first they'll cut the video and say
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.400]  that it's being done because they are disrespecting the president because they
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.600]  don't like him and look I know we've got North Korea crises I know we've got
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.320]  Antifa running around attacking Rand Paul and shooting up baseball events of
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.640]  senators and knockout gaming people and burning down buildings and shooting
[25:58.640 --> 26:01.960]  cops in the back and attacking churches I know we've got a lot of serious stuff
[26:01.960 --> 26:07.680]  going on but if you look at how they take just normal Trump etiquette where he
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.520]  does a great job with world leaders has incredible energy incredible stamina
[26:12.520 --> 26:18.680]  running circles around any president in modern history they take that strength
[26:18.680 --> 26:26.080]  and run it down and they just keep running more and more so when I defend
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.640]  the president I'm not defending the president because I'm in some culture
[26:30.640 --> 26:35.760]  personality I'm defending the president because I'm defending reality and because
[26:35.760 --> 26:43.280]  I realize that the social engineers are involved in an attempt to overthrow
[26:43.280 --> 26:48.640]  reality and so I have to defend Trump because if you give in to them they then
[26:48.640 --> 26:53.920]  are able to run the tables and social engineer our country in the world into
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.200]  oblivion and again I know as an audience you understand that we have to
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.800]  continue to expose the fake news newsweek and their entire corporation has
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.600]  laid off half their employees four years ago they laid off a third they are
[27:07.600 --> 27:13.640]  what 20% now of what they were have they gotten better no they write even more
[27:13.640 --> 27:18.720]  deceptive garbage and say that this guy that shot up all these people to church
[27:18.720 --> 27:24.760]  killing 26 including members of his ex-wife's family his second wife's
[27:24.760 --> 27:29.640]  family they're saying there's no connections none of its real it's all
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.280]  made up with no evidence despite the fact the state police the governor's
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.000]  office the lieutenant governor the daily mail all of them are reporting what we
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.720]  reported last night that it is his LinkedIn account it is his Facebook
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.120]  account they've now removed and indeed they've talked to his neighbors they've
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.600]  talked to his classmates they said he was a Christian hating atheist who'd
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.160]  been discharged dishonorably that means he couldn't own guns anymore for
[27:57.160 --> 28:03.600]  assaulting his first wife and child a cowardly sack of garbage wearing the
[28:03.600 --> 28:10.160]  antifa black going into a church where he knew people be disarmed to slaughter a
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.440]  bunch of people because his wife his ex-wife dared to go to a church and he
[28:15.440 --> 28:22.560]  was going to show her who the boss was well he came outside and a middle-aged
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.920]  plumber engaged him shot him through the body armor he was reportedly bleeding
[28:26.920 --> 28:33.200]  when he got his truck they chased him 95 miles an hour down the rug and the
[28:33.200 --> 28:35.600]  police are now saying he shot himself though they do say there was a gun
[28:35.600 --> 28:38.920]  fight between the driving vehicles I think the police are just making sure
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.760]  that the two patriots can't be sued we're doing the right thing and taking
[28:41.760 --> 28:49.160]  this guy out but regardless the cowardly atheist globalist SJW is now as dead we

[33:42.000 --> 33:47.400]  murder shooting in Texas history with an atheist SJW a dirtbag as the mainstream
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.840]  media is desperate to cover that up we have Rand Paul with a punctured lung and
[33:51.840 --> 33:57.000]  five broken ribs after he got attacked by his SJW neighbor who absolutely hates
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.880]  Rand Paul and President Trump and said so we've got all of that I've got the
[34:05.880 --> 34:12.760]  whole counter coup going on in Saudi Arabia on the plate to cover where all
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.600]  the big globalist allies of the bushes and the neocons the people that support
[34:16.600 --> 34:21.360]  the Arab Spring are all getting arrested and some are dying in helicopter

[34:25.400 --> 34:29.640]  their hands up I don't support this authoritarianism but Saudi Arabia is
[34:29.640 --> 34:35.360]  already an authoritarian hellhole for the general public and so the globalist
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.200]  interlopers that have been working with Iran and trying to double deal against
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.680]  the US the true bad guys are getting killed because Trump went over there and

[35:17.320 --> 35:25.040]  sword those that live by the sword die by the sword and just like Obama put us
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.560]  under the TPP and all these other unelected tyrannical groups Trump can
[35:29.560 --> 35:35.120]  kill it with executive power Trump is outperforming what I thought he could
[35:35.120 --> 35:41.040]  ever do in the first four years in the first 11 months I am dumbfounded how
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.280]  real this is is it perfect no is he hiring a lot of globalists because they
[35:46.280 --> 35:49.160]  know where the bodies are buried how to get the job done absolutely but you
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.200]  know what they're doing what he tells them he snaps his fingers and says jump
[35:54.200 --> 36:01.720]  they say how high sir and that's why they ate his guts they want to be in the
[36:01.720 --> 36:05.720]  power they want to be in the structure but they don't like following his orders
[36:05.720 --> 36:12.600]  and as the economy turns back on his prosperity comes back and his optimism
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.760]  comes back and his pride in things that are good and wholesome comes back the
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.120]  whole Hollywood pedophile scumbag network is circling the toilet bowl and
[36:22.120 --> 36:31.200]  then Donna Brazil comes out you say what you want she is a real lady in that she
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.640]  is not reading off teleprompter and that she's a street fighter and that now
[36:35.640 --> 36:41.920]  she's talking and telling really what she thinks she's glowing glowing compared
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.480]  to when she was putting out Clinton talking point she looked like she'd been
[36:44.480 --> 36:47.880]  run over by a truck but now that she's saying what she wants I want to play
[36:47.880 --> 36:53.840]  most of this interview coming up the next hour Brazil shaken and angered
[36:53.840 --> 36:59.840]  again Democrats shaken and angered by Brazil book and she basically says
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.760]  Seth rich was murdered by the DNC the Democrats were in bed with the Russians
[37:04.760 --> 37:07.640]  she didn't want to be part of it they blocked Homeland Security being involved
[37:07.640 --> 37:14.280]  she wanted to remove Hillary off the ticket and put Biden on they stole the
[37:14.280 --> 37:23.040]  election from Sanders we told you all of that with precision at the time and I'm
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.640]  only pointing out why info wars is so demonized by mainstream media and by
[37:28.640 --> 37:32.360]  the globalists by the Democrats by the rhinos and why they struggle to keep our
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.080]  information from the president's desk though now I know that blockade has been
[37:36.080 --> 37:38.280]  lifted
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.880]  general Kelly and others hadn't figured out who was who yet and now there's been
[37:43.880 --> 37:48.840]  some double crossing going on against people in the administration that meant
[37:48.840 --> 37:54.040]  well but that were fooled by deep staters and now there's massive solidification
[37:54.040 --> 37:59.400]  behind the president across the board as it becomes apparent Trump's winning the
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.000]  Trump agenda is winning and the Trump agenda is powered when you open up the
[38:04.000 --> 38:12.720]  engine when you open up the hood you see the Pistons info wars drudge report
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.480]  Sean Hannity but driving those pistons
[38:20.080 --> 38:25.920]  our military the American people those that didn't back down when Americana was
[38:25.920 --> 38:30.400]  demonized and attacked those that went under the peer pressure and didn't care
[38:30.400 --> 38:35.480]  it didn't give in and didn't take it lying down you were the vanguard that
[38:35.480 --> 38:40.680]  made it okay to like free market and to like success and like America and to
[38:40.680 --> 38:44.360]  promote it against the globalist model that is such a failure for the general
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.880]  public but so good for the elites and because of you the gasoline the oxygen
[38:50.880 --> 38:59.040]  in the pistons in the carburetor in the engine the economies come roaring back
[38:59.040 --> 39:04.000]  and we've seen some dirty white smoke and black smoke shooting out the back of
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.680]  the tailpipe there's been some sputtering and some backfires and the
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.560]  engines found it's kind of like it was about to sputter out a couple times but
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.080]  Trump expertly pumped the accelerator just right put it in gear got us rolling
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.640]  down the road put another gear and now we're driving down the road a hundred
[39:20.640 --> 39:24.120]  miles an hour and there's no smoke coming out the tailpipe and all of a
[39:24.120 --> 39:29.320]  sudden the engines hitting on all cylinders and sounds smooth and good now
[39:29.320 --> 39:36.520]  Trump can pull the car in the service station and say let's get this sucker
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.000]  upgraded and even better but he had to get it out of the jump heat where the
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.920]  globalists were about to scrap the country on the altar of the new world
[39:43.920 --> 39:50.320]  order he had to get the old jalopy out of the wrecking yard where they had it
[39:50.320 --> 39:54.240]  ready next to be put in the crusher and boy we snuck in there in the middle of
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.160]  the night and we put gasoline in there and we dump some ether down in the
[39:58.160 --> 40:03.560]  carburetor and we got it on fire quite frankly as we drove that old car out of
[40:03.560 --> 40:08.800]  the wrecking yard she had fire coming out the tailpipe and was sputtering and
[40:08.800 --> 40:14.640]  clanking but we got her down the road baby we got her down the road you want
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.840]  an allegory that's one right there and right now we're about to drive that car
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.800]  into the fine service station of the Free Republic and we are that car ladies
[40:25.800 --> 40:32.760]  and gentlemen we are that old jalopy about to get a new engine a new interior
[40:32.760 --> 40:40.880]  new brake lines new brake pads new mufflers new paint a coat new tires new
[40:40.880 --> 40:45.640]  wheels the whole thing ladies and gentlemen is going in and about to come
[40:45.640 --> 40:51.000]  out the other side and the new world order that know what to do that's not
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.440]  optimism by the way we can do almost anything with the level of technological
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.840]  development we've already reached if we're just not mentally ill and we just
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.160]  don't give into the globalists and the social engineers that want to control the
[41:03.160 --> 41:08.200]  whole thing and don't want free market if we can just deal with our own evil and
[41:08.200 --> 41:13.360]  our own internal problems that's all of us individually to not drink too much not
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.760]  eat too much not be selfish to not be hateful but to be strong and to work
[41:18.760 --> 41:22.720]  hard and to thank God for all the blessings we've been given and to reach
[41:22.720 --> 41:30.160]  out to others then humanity's future is unbelievably bright we have some big
[41:30.160 --> 41:35.600]  obstacles to hurdle first though it's gonna get rougher before it even gets
[41:35.600 --> 41:40.080]  better it's an experience we're going through right now it's a journey and the
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.280]  journey is the destination we're gonna face AI we're gonna face plagues we're
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.720]  gonna face nanotech we're gonna face all sorts of bizarre criminal networks and
[41:49.720 --> 41:55.400]  groups we're going to face the evil side of humanity plugging into really high
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.280]  tech systems but we're also gonna get a chance to see the good side of humanity
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.320]  plugging into all this as well and it's gonna be an incredibly spectacular
[42:04.320 --> 42:12.400]  exciting journey of discovery and contest and warfare and resistance and
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.800]  striving that we're all about to experience or I'm gonna come back and
[42:17.800 --> 42:21.440]  get to the governor's part of his press conference some of the heroes that

[42:32.280 --> 42:37.520]  crap going to show everybody with a little spoiled brat baby he was how he

[46:01.920 --> 46:06.600]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.440]  the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water
[46:11.440 --> 46:16.520]  and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites
[46:16.520 --> 46:21.040]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.160]  right now with all the refugees spreading disease around we have
[46:25.160 --> 46:29.160]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.840]  all the stuff I said there's so many things that are in it you have the name

[46:51.240 --> 46:54.720]  comm thank you doctor group from the global healing center thank you so
[46:54.720 --> 46:58.080]  much for all your work sir on this great product
[46:58.080 --> 47:09.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:09.600 --> 47:25.240]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:25.240 --> 47:31.280]  our hearts and prayers go out to the 26 people's family members that survive
[47:31.280 --> 47:38.160]  the families of the 26 dead down in Sutherland Texas a place I've stopped
[47:38.160 --> 47:43.680]  many times to eat lunch or dinner when I'm driving down to the beach or driving
[47:43.680 --> 47:49.640]  back from the beach you drive right through Sutherland and it's got a
[47:49.640 --> 47:55.680]  post office and a couple restaurants but really it's a one-horse town doesn't
[47:55.680 --> 47:59.840]  even really have a stoplight up to get to the highway and it is a farming and
[47:59.840 --> 48:05.360]  ranching area and it's a bunch of white people in Hispanics down there really
[48:05.360 --> 48:08.920]  don't really see any black folks and they all just get along real well they're
[48:08.920 --> 48:14.800]  all pretty much intermarried and it's it's really really sad to see things
[48:14.800 --> 48:21.000]  happen like this by a foaming at the mouth evil atheist again I will not
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.240]  blame all atheists or all liberals are all antifa for this but when Dylan
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.200]  Roof went and killed nine innocent black people for no reason because he was a
[48:30.200 --> 48:41.040]  degenerate mentally ill scumbag out of his mind the media blamed all white
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.320]  people and Christians and Southerners collectively and there was all the
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.160]  hysteria pulling down rebel flags people getting assaulted at Adam when the
[48:48.160 --> 48:51.360]  rebel flag had nothing to do with slavery today it does because the media
[48:51.360 --> 48:55.640]  made it a race assemble but I'm not going to sit there and get into that
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.720]  debate the point is is that Texas shooter liked atheist Facebook pages and
[49:00.720 --> 49:08.600]  SJW causes we first broke that yesterday Paul Watson did to info wars.com and
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.640]  what we broke is now confirmed daily mail associated press you name it some
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.960]  other people added images of SJW flags to his own site which were not there
[49:18.960 --> 49:23.720]  previously poisoning the true reports so I don't know that's being done on
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.160]  purpose by folks or what's going on but no it is confirmed but but there is no
[49:29.160 --> 49:35.000]  place where he had the SJW antifa flag he just supported it and linked to it
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.360]  and said he was fighting fascism here's another one out of the Daily Mail
[49:41.360 --> 49:44.960]  creepy crazy and weird former classmates say Texas governor was an
[49:44.960 --> 49:49.160]  outcast who preached his atheism online before killing 26 of the state's worst
[49:49.160 --> 49:56.600]  mass shooting ever so by extension all atheists all antifa all SJWs are to
[49:56.600 --> 50:05.560]  blame. Texas shooting suspect suspect denied gun permit governor says well
[50:05.560 --> 50:10.320]  of course he had to be denied it I'm gonna play that first year in a moment
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.840]  governor Abbott because he had a dishonorable discharge you that's a
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.360]  criminal conviction in the military that's one of the reasons under the
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.560]  68 gun control act that you can't buy a gun if you're a felon if you've been
[50:25.560 --> 50:30.440]  adjudicated mentally ill or if you've been dishonorably discharged you can't
[50:30.440 --> 50:35.640]  buy a gun so again he clearly got the gun illegally we're going to find out but
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.320]  the media keeps spinning it meanwhile sharp shooting plumber fired shot that
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.600]  took down Texas church gunman we're gonna get to some of that coming up in a
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.320]  moment imagine if this had been some other state where people weren't armed
[50:49.320 --> 50:57.600]  it could have gone a lot longer now right now let's go ahead and go to Texas
[50:57.600 --> 51:02.280]  governor Abbott confirms Devin Patrick Telly was denied gun license here it is
[51:02.280 --> 51:08.560]  in terms of how to make it less likely that you see a man like this get access
[51:08.560 --> 51:14.480]  to a weapon like this and be able to do what he did here well obviously people
[51:14.480 --> 51:19.640]  want answers but equally obvious here we are less than a day after the event
[51:19.640 --> 51:24.200]  happened where there's a more unknowns there are knowns like let me share with
[51:24.200 --> 51:27.920]  you this one fact that I am told by the director of the Texas Department of
[51:27.920 --> 51:34.880]  Public Safety and that is that Devin Kelly sought to get a license to carry a
[51:34.880 --> 51:39.520]  gun in the state of Texas but the state of Texas denied him the ability to get a
[51:39.520 --> 51:45.200]  gun so how was it that he was able to get a gun by by all the facts that we
[51:45.200 --> 51:51.240]  seem to know he was not supposed to have access to a gun so how did this happen
[51:51.240 --> 51:56.520]  because that is just one of the unknowns out there we are in search of answers
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.400]  these questions and the answers will be coming to light here in the coming days
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.920]  and before we can and as the lieutenant governor said this is clearly an anti
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.760]  Christian targeting like a white guy targets a black church you can pretty
[52:09.760 --> 52:13.360]  much bet he didn't like black people Dylan roof well this guy's targeting a
[52:13.360 --> 52:16.080]  church you can tell he doesn't like Christians and then low and behold he's
[52:16.080 --> 52:22.600]  an atheist who hated Christians this is all two plus two equals four in a
[52:22.600 --> 52:30.920]  motive you know an event you look at who's targeted to find the motive now
[52:30.920 --> 52:34.800]  here is one of the heroes the Texas church shooting tells of card chase
[52:34.800 --> 52:42.960]  after gunman and again he was the second person to join in after the sharp
[52:42.960 --> 52:48.600]  shooting plumber fired a shot that took down the Texas church gunman the man
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.200]  holds a hero for confronting the Texas mass shooter during his rampage is a
[52:52.200 --> 52:56.240]  sharp shooting plumber with no military background who hit the gunman through a
[52:56.240 --> 53:01.760]  gap in his body armor according to report Stephen Willie Ford managed to
[53:01.760 --> 53:05.960]  shoot Devin Kelly before jumping another man's truck and chasing him down the
[53:05.960 --> 53:09.560]  Daily Mail has reported and it goes on to say that they did the police now
[53:09.560 --> 53:18.400]  release more so they had a rolling gun battle at 95 miles an hour and that
[53:18.400 --> 53:23.320]  basically shot him again and made him go off the road and quote wrecked out now
[53:23.320 --> 53:26.800]  the police are saying that he may have died of a soul hooked a gunshot wound I
[53:26.800 --> 53:29.800]  think the police are doing that so that there's no liability for the citizens
[53:29.800 --> 53:34.240]  that actually took him out but but we'll see regardless they stopped him they
[53:34.240 --> 53:40.720]  shot him they drove him off the road here is Johnny Langendorf who drove the
[53:40.720 --> 53:44.680]  other man during the ongoing gun battle like something out of the movie the
[53:44.680 --> 53:49.000]  road warrior here it is I just pulled up to an intersection and saw a gunfire
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.320]  the shooter got in his truck and the gentleman in the right with the rifle
[53:53.320 --> 53:59.280]  came to my truck as the shooter took off and he briefly he briefed me quickly on
[53:59.280 --> 54:03.040]  what had just happened and said that we had to get him and so that's what I did
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.160]  and we hit about 95 going down 539 trying to catch this guy until he
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.920]  eventually lost control on his own and went off in the ditch he just kind of he
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.240]  went off in the ditch hit a hit a hay bale from what I could see and then he
[54:17.240 --> 54:20.720]  just never moved after that he didn't get out he didn't try anything once the
[54:20.720 --> 54:25.320]  police showed up they moved me and the gentleman back and then everybody showed
[54:25.320 --> 54:28.680]  up and they took action I didn't really have time to hear about anything it was
[54:28.680 --> 54:34.160]  more see and do think you know act now ask questions later and he just affected
[54:34.160 --> 54:41.320]  so many people's lives why wouldn't you want to so you see the best and worst in
[54:41.320 --> 54:44.760]  people at times like this
[54:45.080 --> 54:49.320]  a area resident told a paper that willyford and avid biker attends another
[54:49.320 --> 54:52.760]  church learned about the shooting when his daughter called to say a man clad in
[54:52.760 --> 54:56.600]  body armor was shooting worshipers local said that all the willyford had no
[54:56.600 --> 55:00.640]  military background he'd hesitate when it came to face-to-face with a suspect
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.560]  managed to squeeze off around the struck the gunman who dropped his Ruger ar-15
[55:05.560 --> 55:09.840]  variant will effort jumped into a truck driven by another local Johnny Langendorf
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.800]  who just heard from who witnessed the confrontation and the pair gave chase
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.280]  Langendorf later told reporters about the dramatic pursuit I pulled up in the
[55:18.280 --> 55:21.480]  intersection where the shooting happened and I saw too many changing gunfire
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.080]  the other being the citizen of the community he said the shooter of the
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.440]  church had taken off fled his vehicle and the other gentleman came up and said
[55:29.440 --> 55:34.600]  we need to pursue him and then he just shot up the church so that's what we did
[55:34.600 --> 55:40.680]  I just acted and then it goes on to break down what they did
[55:40.680 --> 55:46.360]  Langendorf's girlfriend summer caddell said Kelly died a few feet away from
[55:46.360 --> 55:50.760]  Langendorf the local men said Kelly had already dead when they found him he was
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.200]  bleeding pretty bad the resident told the news outlet of Kelly while he was
[55:54.200 --> 55:58.520]  driving he didn't live much longer than that Martin confirmed police had found
[55:58.520 --> 56:05.360]  Kelly dead so there you go that's what happened and you can read the state
[56:05.360 --> 56:11.160]  police account it basically matches that but that is great that they acted
[56:11.160 --> 56:17.320]  quickly and ended up killing the slime ball because remember Colmo on CNN that
[56:17.320 --> 56:20.840]  wants to ban your guns has his own bodyguards and his thug brother has his
[56:20.840 --> 56:25.280]  own bodyguards and the ruling in class has their own bodyguards as they bring
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.520]  in hundreds of thousands of military aged men from the Middle East carrying
[56:29.520 --> 56:34.640]  out weekly terror attacks on the American people and we've seen the new
[56:34.640 --> 56:40.600]  spin out of a CNN and others saying that well if he'd have been a jihadi we
[56:40.600 --> 56:45.520]  never hear the end of it from people in Texas yes because that's somebody you
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.480]  brought in artificially that wants to kill us we're also upset about mentally
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.920]  ill devil worshipping you know usually a lot of these folks call themselves
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.120]  atheists they really mean they're anti-christian it's going anti if it
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.720]  calls themselves anti-fascist they're really communist and I've told you a
[57:02.720 --> 57:05.880]  lot of these folks are devil worshipers they hate Christians it's what they want
[57:05.880 --> 57:11.000]  to do and everybody needs to be armed to protect themselves legally and
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.440]  lawfully in this day and age because even though statistically it's rare to be
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.320]  shot and killed in this country it's becoming more common in those statistics
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.880]  to be killed by a leftist who's gone and gotten firearms training all right

[59:50.520 --> 59:55.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.880 --> 1:00:11.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:22.400]  Coming up, Mark Fauber, one of the top investors and analyst out there, you know
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:27.160]  him from CNN, MSNBC, you name it. He's gonna be joining us about the world
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:31.200]  economy but also statements he made where he's sick of hearing Europeans being
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:35.440]  demonized. He said thank God you know Europeans colonize the US or it wouldn't
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:43.760]  be here. I've seen this new movement to have bumper stickers or signs put up
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:46.920]  around town that say it's okay to be white. That's why we're gonna put out a
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:51.120]  t-shirt that says it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black, it's okay to be
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:57.160]  red, it's okay to be pink, some kind of pink skin, like a little gecko, kind of
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:08.360]  translucent. It's great to be human and on the back 100% red-blooded infowars.com
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:13.560]  because we've all got one flag, we all bleed red blood, they've been using
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:18.360]  tribalism against us to manipulate us but we are gonna come out with a t-shirt
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:22.880]  and they're calling it racist and evil to have signs saying it's okay to be
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:27.360]  white. Now I think in the face of racism and the global is trying to invoke all
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:32.080]  this race-baiting by white desperate SJWs to say it's okay to be white, it's
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:36.640]  okay to be white but at the end it's great to be human and that's what we all
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:42.000]  are and we've all got red blood, we've all got two lungs, one heart, I mean it's
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.360]  like a black dog versus a white dog, I mean it really is the exact same thing.
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:55.280]  That a black dog has the genes for black fur and a white dog has genes for white
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:02.200]  fur, a black dog usually have brown skin and a white dog will have pink skin, you'll see
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.440]  two guinea pigs you know in a cage together, one's black, one's white, getting
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.400]  along, where did all this start? Well it's tribalism because groups always find a
[1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:14.840]  reason to kill each other like the Star Trek episode and there are real
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:21.120]  differences in variants in groups on average, like long-distance runners, most
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:24.200]  of them are Kenyan, you know the Africans can't even compete but but that's that
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:27.880]  tiny one tenth of one percent and then the other runners from around the world
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:30.960]  are like you know ten yards behind them every time when they lose, it's just a
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:35.360]  tiny fraction type thing, you can argue northern Europeans have the biggest CC
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:39.440]  sized brains and higher IQs but then you can argue it's all how the IQ test is
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:45.200]  given and you know it's that upper end, yes it's true but it's it's all apples
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:50.160]  and oranges folks, we're all human, we're in this experience together and the
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.520]  culture is trying to dumb us all down to make us pliable and controllable and
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:58.040]  that's not just our observations, we have it from government documents and
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:03.320]  white papers and WikiLeaks and eco science that the globalists really are
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:08.240]  trying to control the future and trying to very covetously dominate humanity and
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:14.280]  and dumb people down and that's really the big sin, isn't it? And so that's what
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:19.920]  I'm personally trying to expose best I can. Mark Fauber is gonna be with us for
[1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:24.040]  30 minutes, then I'm gonna open the phones up at the bottom of the hour on
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.280]  your take on the Texas mass shooting and more your take on Donna Brazil, got
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:31.320]  more clips of Donna Brazil coming up saying she would have removed Hillary
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:34.880]  and put Biden in, we said that at the time that was being looked at from our
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.720]  sources, Roger Stone's got incredible sources, let me tell you, we had other
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:46.560]  sources as well and that Seth Rich they believe was murdered for the DNA for the
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:54.240]  DNC leaks and so all that's coming out now, this is rats leaving the sinking
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:04:00.960]  ship, we'll get your take on that as well but whatever you do be sure and tune
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.800]  in in the fourth hour because we have Matt Dubiel, the station manager of our
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:12.280]  Chicago flagship, 1530 a.m. also as an FM station, he's got big
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:14.800]  announcements coming very soon I'm not gonna get to yet but we're very very
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:19.320]  excited about it and then we also have in the third hour Scott Adams of the
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:26.800]  great cartoon Gilbert who is a super smart fellow, always informative, he's
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:31.600]  gonna be joining us with his predictions and a lot more, he's had a lot of
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:36.600]  accurate predictions like Trump would be elected, that's all coming up as well so
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:41.440]  Mark Fauber of the Gloom Doom Report, Gloom Doom Boom Report and then we've
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:48.360]  got of course, Dilbert coming on and so much more, I'm Alex Jones newswars.com

[1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:09.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to
[1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:24.360]  you live from the front lines of the info war. Scott Adams, the creator of
[1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:28.360]  Dilbert, one of the most popular comic strips in history and who is also a
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:33.200]  really smart guy and kind of a futurist in his own right. He also looks at how to
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:36.680]  manipulate words in the media. He's going to be joining us coming up in the
[1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:43.840]  next hour of the next 30 minutes. Dr. Mark Fauber, famed guest of CNBC, you name it,
[1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:49.320]  joins us. I'm going to go over his whole bio from Zurich, Switzerland and the
[1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:54.720]  billions that he's managed and all the big successful predictions he's made.
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:58.720]  He publishes a widely read monthly investment newsletter, the Gloom Boom
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:03.760]  and Doom Report, which highlights unusual investment opportunities. I'm not
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:07.720]  going to go through it all, but he's a best-seller in Japanese, Chinese, Thai,
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:12.120]  German, English, you name it. He's a regular speaker at various investment
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:20.840]  seminars, gloomboomdoom.com. But he also got in big SJW trouble lately. We've
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:25.680]  seen the leftist professors everywhere saying, kill all the white people and
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:29.600]  white people are inherently evil and they're mainly white folks saying this
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:33.560]  and we know in the WikiLeaks they say we want culture war. We want everybody
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:38.440]  fighting with each other while we rob them. But then Fauber simply said, well
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:42.680]  thank God the US got populated by Europeans because they brought in the
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:48.000]  Renaissance and technology or we wouldn't have our modern civilization.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.760]  So we should have some love for the Renaissance, some love for the West. I
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:58.600]  know I like other inventions and things and we get from China or
[1:07:58.600 --> 1:08:02.160]  wherever and I certainly like coffee and things like that from the
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:06.680]  Americas. I mean it all makes us richer, our cultures, but it's really in now to
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:12.640]  demonize white people and so Mark Fauber, not known as an evil white
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:15.640]  supremacist, has gotten a lot of trouble. I've been labeled by the mainstream media
[1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:20.560]  as a racist doctor boom, Mark Fauber fires back. So I wanted to get him on
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:24.280]  about the economy, get him on about Trump, get him on about all this and let
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:29.840]  him to actually respond versus what MSM has been twisting. Mark, good to have you
[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:38.160]  on with us. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be on your show. Where should we start?
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.040]  Wherever you want to start, you know, we can start with the history of
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:48.080]  civilizations or we can start with racism because it comes in many different
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:55.160]  forms and most people actually don't really know what racism is. Well let's
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:58.400]  start with a brief history of the world and then get into race and then let's
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.000]  get into where you see the economy currently and the left now eating itself,
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.760]  the Democratic Party's imploding, the EU globalists are imploding and I think
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:12.520]  they better understand people are rejecting all this race-baiting. Well the
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:19.160]  thing is this, if you look back at let's say recorded history, we go back 5,000
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:28.320]  years to roughly 3,000 BC, then we had civilizations rising and then
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:34.160]  civilizations declining usually through internal strife or decadence and so
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:41.360]  forth. We had cities becoming important and then cities contracting. I wrote the
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:49.440]  book once a long time ago, the rise and the fall of great cities and I mean it's
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:57.160]  very interesting when you look at say year 3,000 BC, the Egyptians, they built
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:03.520]  Karnak, Luxor and they built the pyramids. At that time the Europeans were
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:13.120]  still living in caverns, still on lakes and so we had an incredibly advanced
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:21.200]  civilization in Egypt in the year 3,000 BC and then we had the Assyrian Empire
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:28.280]  and the Persian Empire and then we had the Greeks, Alexander the Greek, who by the
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:34.160]  way was very good at destroying cities and took most of the population right
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:39.640]  the way into slavery. It was the pattern for the last few thousand years.
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:45.560]  Essentially the men were killed and the women were taken into slavery for both
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:53.200]  and so we have this continuous change. We had the Romans, the Romans were
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:58.720]  incredibly advanced and before the Romans in another part of the world, which was
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.000]  not very well known, it was China, the Chinese were incredibly
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:11.640]  advanced and so we have this pattern. Now we come to the discovery voyages. The
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:20.360]  discovery voyages were actually a very risky enterprise. Vasco de Gama, 1497,
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:26.560]  discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, Magellan circumvented the world, Columbus,
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:34.440]  he went to the US. These were not just adventurers, these were people who took a
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:41.080]  huge risk because they took voyages into the unknown and so we have
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:47.280]  essentially the Europeans arriving in the US and we had also the age of
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:55.200]  colonialism and imperialism in other parts of the world and of course the
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:03.640]  white man was cruel. There's no question about this but other people were equally
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:09.600]  cruel or even more cruel than the white man and at least over the last hundred
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:15.120]  years or so we've become somewhat more human although I'm not sure about that
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:20.280]  but the others sometimes they haven't become more human and if we look at the
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:26.880]  history of World War I and World War II, we know very well that other people were
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:33.080]  extremely cruel as well, not just the white man. Exactly, so all you did was point out
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:38.800]  what is admitted known history. They're now saying mathematics is racist, costume
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.320]  parties are racist, it looks like the social engineers are staking out all of
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:52.600]  reality and claiming that everything must go through them like a cult. Yes, it's a
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:59.480]  very unfortunate event because I think that when I look at the world
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:07.280]  development over the last 30-40 years we have essentially globalization starting
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:13.640]  in the 80s and we have the breakdown of the socialist communist ideology starting
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:19.800]  with the opening of China in 1978 under Feng Xiaoping then we have the
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:28.440]  breakdown of the Berlin Wall and Russia turning essentially into a more
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:38.040]  capitalistic oriented economy and when the European expansion really started
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:42.000]  with the so-called Industrial Revolution which had probably begun already around
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:51.200]  1750 but I want to say this, the European Industrial Revolution was of course
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:57.840]  possible because the Europeans and that every historian will point out they
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:05.200]  invented something that the others never had and that is capitalism, but
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:10.320]  capitalism is not conquering another country and just ripping them off but
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:16.280]  it's working for a continuous and recurring profit and you need it double
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:21.520]  accounting, no other country in the world has double accounting standards the
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:31.400]  Europeans had and then because of the age of Renaissance and the age of
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:38.000]  enlightenment we had all these inventors and all these scientists who suddenly
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.680]  said the world is not flat. So the West invented the middle class in
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.200]  capitalism which is now the model of the world so why are the ultra elites and
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:51.920]  the ruling classes waging war against the fount of success? It's because they
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:56.120]  don't want competition, they want this new austerity, they want their new world
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:14:59.560]  order if you agree with me say yes please sir and then I want to expand into
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:08.600]  is globalism in its authoritarian model now falling apart? Yes, the ruling
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:16.360]  European political class as well as the US they may not know but the point is
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:26.560]  simply you know in 1970 China consumed 2% of global industrial commodities by
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:36.640]  1990 it was 5% in year 2000 it was 12% now it's over 50% this is the major
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:42.240]  change it's not that the West has absolutely collapsed but relative to the
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:46.760]  rest of the world they have been contracting massively. That's right let's
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:50.000]  talk about why that's happening and where it's going with Mark Fawbert ladies
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.600]  and gentlemen straight ahead after this quick break we're very honored to have

[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:38.600]  we're gonna be joining us the next segment we're gonna take your phone
[1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:42.960]  calls as well we've only got about eight nine minutes left with Mark Faber of the
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:49.520]  gloom boom doom report that gloom boom doom.com and I wanted him to recap how
[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:53.560]  he's been demonized and attacked for saying we ought to be proud of modern
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:57.040]  western civilization he's written books on the bad parts the good parts he's
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:01.000]  written books on other civilizations he's widely read around the world and
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.080]  admired by you know many other cultures I know that is a fact and so he's so
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:09.520]  demonized why does he think that happened and then let's segue into why the
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:12.880]  west is contracting why it's self loathing and what he thinks of the
[1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:18.040]  Trump phenomenon and where the economy is going and can the nationalism we see
[1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:22.320]  coming up in Europe coming up in other areas as a new revolution against
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:31.200]  artificial globalism can it succeed Mark Faber? Yes I mean this is a very
[1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:38.200]  tough question but I'd like to say that the welfare of the people has always
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:45.880]  been the alibi of the tyrant and you know they tell you well everybody has to
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:50.400]  be the same and get some money and we have basic income eventually and this
[1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:56.320]  and that but basically it's about power and it's about money we know that the
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:00.960]  political establishment has made a lot of money a lot of money has disappeared
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:06.800]  from the defense department from the state department and the same goes in
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:13.480]  Europe and the Americans they go and tell the world about corruption yeah we
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:17.760]  have corruption in Asia but I can tell you I think the big corruption is
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:23.200]  actually where the governments are very big and the biggest governments as a
[1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:27.960]  percent of the economy are in Europe the more government you have the less
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:32.040]  freedom you have Milton Friedman he explained this very well in his book
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:38.640]  capitalism and freedom the larger the government the extreme is of course the
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  communist socialist planning economy where the government controls everything
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:48.960]  and then I suggest you read Animal Farm by George Orwell you know what it is all
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:54.080]  about absolutely I notice you've got a bust of Mao Zedong behind you I don't
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:00.920]  think you're a fan though I'm not the fan of him I'm not the fan of any
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:07.960]  politician except maybe you could argue that at an hour after the second world
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:15.840]  war he was a great leader he healed the germination nation but Mao is of course
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:22.360]  a villain like Stalin like Hitler and like Napoleon but some are perceived in
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:27.760]  a better light than others but they're all kind of evil people but one thing
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:35.800]  about Mao and this is also interesting about Stalin Stalin is the most popular
[1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:43.960]  leader of Russia ever including all the czars because he defeated the Germans and
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:50.680]  the Mao I have to give him credit you see what happened is China and by the way
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:58.520]  also India they had a striving economy and the striving social system until
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:06.760]  about 1780 but by 1780 post big nations that made at the time China and India
[1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:12.880]  60% of the global economy at that time the US much was much smaller they
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:20.440]  started to decay decay was then accelerated also by imperialism and
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:24.400]  colonialism and again you've written about the rise and fall of nations these
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:28.000]  are historical facts you spoke about the West Bank and decline and so we should
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.600]  stop bashing it it's been a good thing overall until his decline they're
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.920]  calling that racist why is there such an internal hatred in the West of
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:39.680]  Renaissance and free market and where do you see the US economy and global
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:48.400]  economy going well it's very difficult to tell but I think that the Western
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:53.680]  leaders subconsciously realized that they have to control the population
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:25:00.200]  somehow and one way to control it is to make everybody more or less equal and
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:08.920]  I just want to mention because many people don't realize democracy and
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:16.120]  social security is an experiment we don't know how long it will last for the
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:21.800]  last 5,000 years we didn't have democracies and now for the last 200
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:28.160]  years we have some sort of democracy but as you know in the US initially only
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:32.520]  some people could vote and not other groups sure so it's paradoxical it
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:37.840]  creates incredible wealth and freedom but it also creates spoiled brats yes
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:44.640]  every civilization went down after they went through a phase of great
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:52.640]  prosperity and usually this period of great prosperity like in Spain after
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:59.840]  the discoveries of gold in Mexico and in nowadays Bolivia Potosi which
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:04.400]  incidentally became one of the largest cities in the world during the silver
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:11.520]  boom but the thing is these rich countries then they also go and borrow
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:17.440]  money so that that's expand and eventually they fail they go bankrupt
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:20.520]  well Mark Popper this is fascinating and I'd love to get you on for a full hour
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:23.680]  we've only got about two minutes left you are I got us really predicted major
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:27.920]  economic developments with incredible accuracy so just briefly without folks
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:32.120]  going to your site they should go there gloom boom doom.com what is your quick
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:38.320]  prognosis on the global economy versus the US can Trump turn the the downward
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:49.360]  spiral off in my view we had a recovery post June 2009 the bull market began on
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:57.960]  March 6 2009 most of the expansion is driven by credit the credit as a
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:04.080]  percent of the global economy has expanded we have artificial low interest
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:11.160]  rate can you imagine I went through the 87 crash that time in 87 interest rates
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:15.960]  on the 10 years treasury had gone from 7 to 10 percent so the bond market was
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:22.320]  not in a bubble stage in year 2000 the 10 years treasury went to six and a half
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:28.280]  percent in year 2007 when the last crisis occurred it was at five and a quarter
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:37.160]  percent now we are 2.3 percent Portuguese bonds and you believe they yield 2%
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:45.960]  Spanish bonds 1.7 and so forth so I mean we have a completely distorted money
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:51.840]  market and some people they say well I'm not gonna put money at zero interest
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:56.280]  rates all next to zero interest rates in bonds I buy stocks why buy real estate
[1:27:56.280 --> 1:28:04.920]  or bitcoins but it's gonna be end very badly we are not in one bubble we have
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:08.760]  multiple bubbles no no I totally I totally agree and I like the fact that
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:11.360]  Trump's at least trying to get taxes cut for the general public and try to
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.360]  control spending but I think like Ron Paul says you'll never be able to
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:21.120]  completely fix it how long can the bubble sustain with money printing you
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:28.440]  can sustain it for a while but you can't sustain it forever and the longer
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:35.640]  doesn't lead to a crisis recession the harshest recession absolutely so we're
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:38.960]  headed towards some big times here absolutely some people need to batten

[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:37.000]  ago you know what I tell them go to hell I'm gonna tell my story I want to tell
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:41.360]  my story George because this is a story of a young girl who started in American
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.920]  politics at the age of nine who continues to fight each and every week of
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:51.440]  her life I I went down to Virginia last week to kick off the canvassing campaign
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:56.400]  nobody paid me to do that nobody nobody I'm not on the payroll George I care
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:00.960]  about my country I care about our democracy and I say go to hell because
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.600]  I'm also why am I supposed to be the only person that is unable to tell my
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:13.360]  story that's right you're supposed to be in a cult when you're a Democrat coming
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:20.240]  up the next hour after the artist behind Dilbert joins us we're going to play
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:24.160]  some excerpts of the 14 minute interview very powerful I don't like
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:27.240]  Democrats I don't like globalism I don't like what they're trying to set up I
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:31.040]  don't like the unions that sold out their own jobs that to them have to have
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.640]  got but Brazil coming out saying her books dedicated to Seth Rich and that
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:40.240]  his murder should basically be looked into and that she feared for her life
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:47.840]  and that Hillary stole the election that's all true and it's amazing I want
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:51.060]  to take a few your calls about the mass shooting in Texas to get your
[1:34:51.060 --> 1:34:55.160]  perspective on it and the fact that two good guys with guns took out the bad
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:59.440]  guy that went into the church that was a small church meeting it turns out not
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.680]  even the majority of the church and basically shot everybody in there and
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:09.880]  then finishes working left that's why out of 20 you know 728 people inside a
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:15.640]  church please please please have a deacon or have an usher that's trusted
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:19.920]  a good person with a firearm because globalists love to target churches
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:24.360]  Islamists love to target the Antifa folks have been calling for targeting it
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.600]  if your congressman or women out you know in a baseball team or softball team
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:33.960]  you better have somebody armed as well because hashtag hunt Republicans that's
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:41.040]  the season we live in and that's what's going on now as soon as we get Rob do's
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:50.080]  connection going from the site of the shooting in South Texas while he gets
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:55.600]  that connection going that's having having some basic problems there from
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:36:05.920]  Sutherland I wanted to just mention a story that I see in the news without
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:16.960]  looking every week and I've seen this story for 20 to plus years on air
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:27.480]  reading the news now this is from mainstream news if you actually read
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:32.680]  medical news or you read watchdog news it's even more prolific and that's what
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:38.440]  so frustrating is it's just like I remember Bernie having the nomination
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:41.720]  stolen from him I don't need Donna Brazil a year and a half later to tell
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:47.360]  me I was there we broke the news we reported on it but it's just vindication
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:53.280]  I know Roger Stone talked to the president and he said he was thinking
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:56.480]  about releasing it and so we told you that and sure enough the president did
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:04.280]  it but the media said we were making that up it's the lying they engage in but
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:15.480]  here is the New York Times mumps makes a comeback even among the vaccinated now
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:24.920]  again how are you supposed to get the disease or get the pathogen if you've
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:28.640]  already been vaccinated you know that's not what they say arrest anyone who's
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:32.640]  not vaccinated because they'll give it to you so you're saying the vaccine does
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:38.240]  it protect you well the inserts of most vaccines for for human papillomavirus
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:42.360]  Gardasil or for measles mumps for Bella for the flu says it's not proven to be
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:47.880]  safer effective and it's not proven to protect you it's it's the biggest
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:51.920]  hoax ever are there some learned immunities you can get from vaccines
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:56.040]  absolutely but they've got vaccine damage protection but here they are
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:00.440]  saying oh it's made a comeback they try to spin it because there's unvaccinated
[1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:03.840]  but you actually study the big MMR and whooping cough outbreaks to keep
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.040]  happening especially in California in other areas it's illegal aliens and or
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:12.480]  it's people that have had outbreaks who've been vaccinated just like the
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:17.840]  shingles outbreaks and here it is mumps is transmitted by droplets of saliva or
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:21.640]  mucus it can be spread by coughing and sneezing but also by sharing cups and
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:26.400]  close contact neither recent outbreaks occurred in college dorms are among
[1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:31.000]  athletic teams has happened with the Syracuse University men's workers women's
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:36.240]  lacrosse team and they go on to say they're seeing it and people that are
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:41.560]  vaccinated mumps vaccine is now come out with measles rubella vaccine given to
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:46.600]  one and four but the immunity waves over time so their answer is go get more
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:50.040]  inoculations right now
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:56.320]  now we're gonna get more into this and I want to go to your phone calls as well
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:05.520]  the toll-free number to join us is 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 if you want to
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:12.760]  see his prolific reports they're on info wars.com and news wars.com but just to
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:17.120]  give us a recap of what he's discovered what he's seen briefly is Rob Dew
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:23.640]  info wars news reporter a news director who hurried down there right after news
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:29.000]  of the shooting occurred with Travis Knight yesterday and follow him at Dew's
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:35.480]  news on Twitter so Rob just just recapping what you've witnessed so far
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:41.400]  and tracking the path of the killer and more what have you seen well from where
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:44.920]  we're at now is the other side of the highway this is actually the front of
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:49.120]  the church you can see their little steeple up there and in front of that
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:52.960]  they've built a triage unit they've have pulled all of the bodies out of the
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:56.800]  church as at this point and they are transporting him to Bayard County where
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:01.680]  they're going to be doing autopsies the shooter was transported to Travis County
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:04.800]  and they said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound now they
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.440]  said he had four guns in total that he purchased and alex this is where I was
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:12.840]  listening to the show earlier this is where things are gonna start getting
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:16.440]  wonky now the governor came out and said he tried to get a license to carry
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:21.480]  handguns in Texas and was denied but the ATF officials are saying he purchased
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:25.160]  and it was at a press conference earlier today that he purchased two guns in
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:29.880]  Texas and two in Colorado and he had with him he had two handguns and he dropped
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:33.400]  the rifle in the parking lot how did he do that if he was dishonorably discharged
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:37.320]  you can't own a gun after you've done that or can't buy a gun well I talked to
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:41.160]  a government source that I have and what he was court-martialed for what he how
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:45.320]  he was discharged from the army was a bad conduct discharge which they refer
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:48.920]  to as the big chicken dinner and it would not preclude him from purchasing a
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:53.080]  weapon this is a direct quote it is it is not the equivalent of a felony so
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:57.480]  apparently there is something going on where you could be court-martialed
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:02.040]  dishonorably discharged from the armed forces for bad conduct for abuse of your
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:06.000]  wife and child and still be able to get a handgun so this might be something that
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:09.200]  they might look at here in the future but it is interesting that the governor
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:13.600]  said oh he was trying to get a handgun license here in Texas and he couldn't
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.760]  get there saying he purchased two guns here in Texas trying to get a
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:22.440]  gun still carry so now that's clear well he's a classic SJW a socialist a
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:28.120]  anti-christian atheist we saw a shooter in South Carolina then all
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:31.160]  Christians were to blame all whites were to blame for that according to the media
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:35.320]  I'm not saying all atheists are blamed for this guy but clearly he's got the cut
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:40.480]  of an SJW he's wearing a black outfit he's going to take out his second wife's
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:46.720]  family I mean what's your take on that there's even creepier details that have
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:50.720]  come forth he actually put on a mask with a skull on the front Alex and went
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:56.080]  in there to do this carnage and yes it was going after his estranged second
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:01.120]  wife's mother-in-law who attended this church so that's very disturbing but of
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.400]  course the story that we've been talking about is the good guy with a gun who
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:09.120]  stopped the carnage and then the other hero Johnny Langendorf in his truck
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:13.560]  where they pursued the shooter until he ran off the road and then then killed
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:17.720]  himself now I've also heard reports that the shooter had a hostage inside his
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:22.200]  car so I haven't heard much about that lately either so I'm anxious to talk to
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:24.920]  some law enforcement I'm gonna let you get back on the ground then and continue

[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:00.560]  executive order because obama care gave the president unilateral power because
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.080]  they thought hillary was going to be getting in so they transferred all these
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:08.440]  powers under law to the presidency and now trump can use that to roll up their
[1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:14.560]  operation well ran paul predicted it we first wrote the stories dr. coursey
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:19.720]  hammering it that was picked up by the white house i can tell you hand
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:23.680]  delivered to the president repeatedly no wonder the deep state doesn't want him

[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:19.160]  for holding her on the air from Sweden hi Alex welcome long-time listener big
[1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:23.000]  fan of your show thanks for putting up with me I just want to say I just want
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.400]  to say I'm real star but what happened is that tragedy it's also disgusting
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:37.080]  people means history what happened there yes sir and say that the result thing
[1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:42.520]  if I as a sweet living on the company side of not the Sweden can understand
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:50.360]  that this is a democratic look up any anybody can sure he's wearing black
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:57.080]  he hates Christians he loves Antifa he goes and targets a church I mean
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:01.600]  clearly he hated his wife's family but he also hated Christians I mean I think
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:06.200]  that's overwhelmingly clear what do you think yeah of course of course when they
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:13.560]  they try to pull this thing in it didn't work to bend the gun so what do they do
[1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:17.600]  they shot shoot up a bunch of Christians and things okay now that the
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:20.640]  conservative from our side now they're gonna put down the arms now we're gonna
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:27.200]  just arm themselves and just bring yourself to us speaking of that Sweden you've got
[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:31.200]  the Islamic right gangs and the government bringing ISIS fighters back
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:37.240]  just like the UK's doing they aren't only bringing them back they've given them
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:42.760]  money they mean in 13,000 swish Crohn's that that is about the $6,000 that now
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:48.960]  as far as $600 a month to let them stay here they can educate themselves they
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:54.440]  can spread your propaganda and everything but last week a Swedish
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:00.080]  nationalist he was 15 he was arrested by the authorities took away from his
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:06.120]  family and everything just because he was a nationalist and now with it's a lot
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:16.560]  of LWU we stand for law for upholding young citizens in custody
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:23.160]  I saw that 15-year-old was kidnapped because he didn't want to
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.120]  be in the EU and didn't want open borders and taken from his family for
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:33.560]  re-education exactly yes and now he's locked up basically he's locked up
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:38.880]  you know what you can call a juvenile Christian just the world he got
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:44.960]  everything he's gonna be there for six months to two years without trial without
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:48.680]  anything just because he's a nationalist if I'm quite true as they call it and
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:52.240]  what's crazy is it's gotten so normal in Germany and Sweden other places that I
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:56.080]  even accepted I saw the article about people being sent for re-education
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:55:59.920]  because they don't want to be part of the EU now they're threatening the EU army
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:03.200]  to invade countries to try to pull out God bless you Robin thanks for calling

[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:19.000]  the mainstream media reaction to the anti gun violence let me just say this
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:24.120]  they they're sociopathic psychopaths that they're not even in the morgue yet
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  and then they come out and they say we got to take your guns and I've seen all
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:32.640]  these actors and I could tell they don't have any real human emotion it's like
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:36.600]  the left when they take over like the EPA or any toward any type of
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:39.400]  organization like that they don't actually help the environment they just
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:44.040]  use it as a vehicle to control the native population yes everything is about
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:47.040]  control it's all about cold-blooded power and you'll confront them and they
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:49.720]  laugh at you and say of course it's about power they're all about being
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:55.480]  sociopaths yeah I I'm so emotionally like angry right now because I you know
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:00.280]  these people were were murdered in cold blood by an anarchist a little pecker
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:04.800]  person that wants to murder you imagine though being the spoiled rotten
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:08.560]  little thug that he got thrown out of the military for beating up his wife and
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:13.960]  baby and then now he just goes in like a little thug and kills a bunch of people
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:17.880]  at a Baptist church including children what a big nasty bloated
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:23.680]  graph he knows he went in there thinking like I'm gonna murder these people I'm
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:27.880]  such a little person I gotta prove to the world that I'm a man that I'm work
[1:57:27.880 --> 1:57:32.400]  something in my life this is the moment I get back I mean it's sociopathic
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:35.400]  they're reaching for human emotions and the only way they get it is on a
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:38.920]  drill absolutely that's really astute what you said psychopaths and sociopaths
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.720]  only get emotion when they're doing something that's really really horrible
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:47.200]  they're only living when they do something terrible I want to plow into all

[2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:18.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:25.640]  infowars.com studios it's alex jones there's a big story up on dredgerport.com
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:29.840]  from infowars.com we played the video earlier but it's amazing to talk about
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:35.840]  media deception how to take everything and twist it and it's the prime minister
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:41.480]  taking a few scoops out of the box for the koi the goldfish and then dumping the
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:46.560]  whole thing and then Trump mimics him exactly and seeing in only cuts to the
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:49.920]  prime minister doing a few scoops then Trump dumping the whole thing and say
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:54.400]  how barbarous it is editing and blowing up the video so you can't see that he
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:59.080]  mimicked the prime minister exactly. Of course I just tweeted out and asked the
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:03.600]  question you know why is Trump in trouble for this because the Clintons
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:08.880]  literally feed people to the fishes so French news agency properly showed
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:15.080]  Trump mimicking the prime minister exactly but not seeing in if your TV
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:18.840]  viewer were showing you this seeing in just showed the prime minister doing the
[2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:24.560]  two scoops out then they zoomed in and blew it up on seeing in to make it look
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:28.600]  like Trump just lazily dumped it in and then the left went crazy and said look
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:32.920]  what a moron he's hurting the fish he doesn't know what he's doing he's
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:36.640]  hurting everybody now watch they blow it up right at the point where the prime
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:46.360]  minister dumps it all out so that it looks like Trump did the wrong thing
[2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:52.400]  this is how they deceive boom they blow it up and then show Trump dumping it out
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:56.560]  taking every cultural gesture everything there is and turning it bad making
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:00.720]  culture itself evil see that was racist that was politically incorrect he dumped
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:05.680]  it he was just respectful even though he copied the prime minister with total
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.440]  precision I know I've been harping on this but remember the little boy he
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:13.920]  shakes his hands spends more time with him in the wheelchair then walks away and
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:16.800]  the little boy reaches out they said oh he ignored a little boy and show the
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:21.880]  edited video this is how they deceive Ethan in Georgia then Brandon in Texas
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:27.600]  and Sue in Kansas Ethan you're on the air go ahead Alex is good to finally talk

[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:52.080]  in and just let them come and kill us even though that's anti-biblical where
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:56.960]  Christ said sell your garment and buy a sword in the garden of gas in there yes

[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:54.160]  with me in the fourth hour from our Chicago affiliate covering a whole bunch
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:58.960]  of big developments but first it was such a fascinating interview that I wanted
[2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:07.320]  to play some more excerpts of it because Donna Brazil has come out and said
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:12.880]  that she talked about removing Hillary from the nomination that Hillary stole
[2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:19.480]  the nomination from Bernie Sanders and that you can go to hell she says I will
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:24.720]  not shut up this is on ABCs this week now this is bigger than just Donna Brazil
[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:28.520]  I don't just believe Donna Brazil I know everything she basically talked about
[2:07:28.520 --> 2:07:33.920]  we covered at the time so it's true what she's saying including she feared for her
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.040]  life with the whole Seth Rich thing which they were trying to cover up they
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:40.200]  were so desperate and that Hillary ordered them to not let the FBI to the
[2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:44.520]  servers that were being hacked into this completely blows up in the face of
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:47.920]  Robert Mueller so here's a short compilation of some of the highlights
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:52.200]  and then we're gonna go to our guest here is Donna Brazil one of the chief
[2:07:52.200 --> 2:07:58.800]  rats former head of the DNC leaving the sinking ship here it is it sounds like
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:01.680]  you had a pretty dysfunctional relationship with the High Command
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:04.800]  Hillary's campaign you even talk about telling them at some point I'm not
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:09.000]  patsy the slave yeah I'm not patsy the slave because I got sick and tired of
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:12.160]  people telling me how to spend money when all I was trying to do I wasn't
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:16.600]  getting a salary I was basically volunteering my time and what I was
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:20.760]  trying to do George was to increase the level of enthusiasm and passion for
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:23.960]  Hillary Clinton and the rest of the ticket all across the country but here's
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:27.400]  what they don't know they don't know what it was like to be over the DNC
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:31.080]  during his hacking they don't know what it's like to bury a child I did Seth
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:35.520]  Rich they don't know what it's like to protect the staff from further harassment
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:39.720]  they don't know what it's like because the the High Command of Brooklyn the
[2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:43.840]  people who were making the decisions even for the DNC they didn't come and work
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:48.440]  with us they told us to shut up and basically let them win the election and
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:53.280]  when we tried to intervene we had to spend money we raised to try to help
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:57.400]  them win and that's that was my job as chair to party George for those who are
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:00.360]  telling me to shut up they told Hillary had a couple of months ago you know what
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:05.120]  I tell them go to hell I'm gonna tell my story he just mentioned Seth Rich who
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:09.640]  of course was killed during the campaign did you feel under threat every day do
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:13.920]  you agree with Elizabeth Warren that the primaries were rigged I I don't think
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:18.960]  she she meant the word rig because what I said George as you well know after I
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:23.040]  left this show back on July 24th I said I will get to the bottom of everything
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:26.720]  and that's what I did and I called Senator Sanders to say you know I wanted
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:29.920]  to make sure there was no rigging in the process I'm all the rules and bylaws
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:35.040]  committee I found no evidence none whatsoever I know I sent emails of course
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:40.080]  so I'm not denying that you sent this easy George I'm not I'm not I first of
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:45.320]  all I said straight up I said look if this was sent I know why I sent it I
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:51.040]  apologize I spent the entire month of August apologizing for the lead tagged
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:58.480]  emails which is a crime all right so that is a rat leaving the sinking ship now
[2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:02.320]  joining us is Scott Adams blog.dilbert.com don't have to tell you
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.480]  everything about him he predicted Trump would win before anybody else did other
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:13.000]  than maybe us and then he would win the nomination in the general election he
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:16.160]  endorsed Hillary Clinton for his personal safety you've seen me get hot
[2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:20.120]  coffee thrown on me and more so it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek there and he
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:24.360]  goes on to say that writing about Donald Trump ended my speaking career and has
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:28.480]  already reduced my income about 40% as far as I can tell but I'm in less
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:32.560]  physical danger than I was so he's paid a lot to promote the American way of
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:36.760]  life a fellow thought criminal Scott Adams of Dilbert thank you for joining
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:41.880]  us thanks for everything where should we start I mean I want to get into more
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:46.160]  predictions and why you predicted Trump would win and so much more but but what
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.920]  do you think of the Democrats from Wolf Blitzer to Donna Brazil throwing
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:54.680]  Hillary under the bus I think that shows that Obama and the party know that as a
[2:10:54.680 --> 2:10:59.960]  poster child Hillary's killing him yeah they're really going to need to reinvent
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.200]  themselves because I think they realized that the last horse they rode
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:08.720]  didn't get them as that far and if they keep riding that horse it's not going to
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:14.640]  work too too much I was reading today that the Democrats are thinking about
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:19.280]  getting more of an economic message next time and I thought to myself how is
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:24.800]  that going to work if we have GDP of 4% and record low unemployment by the time
[2:11:24.800 --> 2:11:29.280]  the 2018 election comes around that it seems like they're being herded into a
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:33.720]  narrow ravine it's like the worst place they could possibly be assuming the
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:40.040]  economy stays strong wow that's really boiled down when you put it that way
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:44.920]  the saying a day late a dollar short just doesn't go far enough they only
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:48.760]  seem to now know that they're turning their party into a coastal elite party
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:53.960]  what they said was about to happen the Republicans is happening to them yeah
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:59.800]  the their old technique of identity politics didn't work and their new
[2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:04.440]  approach seems just even on the surface like it couldn't possibly work unless
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:10.560]  they know something we know about some downturn between now and 2018 but how
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:15.120]  long can the bullying the intimidation the calling everybody KKK members that
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:18.640]  don't want to be socialist or don't live under you know Hillary Clinton how
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:21.880]  long can that work because they've really as you know been pressing and getting
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:24.880]  more and more vicious more and more threatening and it seems to be actually
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:28.600]  making people get madder who are even Democrats it seems to be blowing up in
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:33.680]  their face yeah you know both sides do the trick where you you try to
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:40.280]  characterize the entire other party by their worst 20% or 10% I don't see that
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:44.040]  ever changing because it sort of works you know and people keep doing what
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:49.560]  works but it does seem to me that the Republicans are sort of becoming the
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:54.880]  the party that loves the Constitution and the rule of law and the Democrats are
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:59.520]  sort of accidentally becoming the party that just hates other people exactly
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:04.080]  exactly exactly it seems the Republicans are reforming themselves getting
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:07.400]  back to American roots they've been incredibly corrupt and the Democrats are
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:11.760]  just getting more extreme more bullying and an attempt to hang on only making
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:16.680]  people hate them that much more yeah I think it's exacerbated by what I call
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:21.400]  the the massive cluster bomb of cognitive dissonance that happened on
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:26.760]  election day so on election day about half the country believe that they were
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:31.400]  smart and wise and kind and many other good things about themselves and their
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:35.680]  candidate would surely win and there was no way in the world that this Donald
[2:13:35.680 --> 2:13:41.800]  Trump character could become president and on election night they realized that
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:45.160]  some of the most fundamental things they've ever believed are just completely
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:50.160]  wrong and they had to reinterpret their entire world and so I think many of them
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:55.520]  reinterpreted it not as gosh I guess I was under informed maybe I haven't talked
[2:13:55.520 --> 2:14:00.080]  to enough Republicans maybe I've missed the entire story maybe I've ignored the
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:03.680]  middle class I mean all the things they could have said to themselves about why
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:07.280]  the result came out differently than they imagined I don't think they did I
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:11.840]  think what they decided was well the other side must be far worse than I ever
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:16.640]  imagined there are far more terrible racists who are supporting this this
[2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:20.360]  monster for president so they had to come up with a story that kept their
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:26.240]  original worldview at least mostly intact and so in that worldview not only
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:30.840]  were they right all along they were they were right in the right direction but it
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:35.280]  was even worse than they thought which is a lot like being right so I think
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:39.520]  that's that's the you know the spontaneous hallucination that people are
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:44.400]  dealing with and I mean hallucination in the literal sense it seems to me and
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:48.960]  you know fact-check me on this because you've been following politics longer and
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:52.000]  more closely than I have really I've just sort of been getting into it in the
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:59.280]  last couple years but it seems to me that in the old days people used to just
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:03.720]  sort of lie about the other side and stretch the truth but they knew they
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:08.400]  were doing it it seemed to me there was a an awareness there yeah I'm just gonna
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:12.680]  say something about the other side because this will be a good strategy but
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:17.680]  now it seems and this is my observation subject to you know anybody else's
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:22.880]  opinion on it it seems that they actually believe what they're saying this
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:26.960]  time like they actually believe there's a monster in the White House well you
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:30.440]  said it better than anybody ever heard they smoked their own dope and in the
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:34.560]  process of self-fulfilling prophecy they became the monsters that they were
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:39.080]  projecting on to us yeah and I don't think that they realize that at all I
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:42.800]  think that in their minds if you're fighting Hitler in their minds that's
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:47.360]  what they're doing then whatever you do is justified so I think that's their
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:53.360]  moral cover wow I gotta say this guy right here it just crystallized it so

[2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:30.120]  this is our land these are our people the workers the strikers the builders
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:41.960]  these are our people we are they they are the dark armies the dark murdering armies
[2:20:41.960 --> 2:20:50.840]  the answer to 1984
[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:55.000]  is 1776
[2:20:55.880 --> 2:21:01.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show all right folks i've seen him on other
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:06.760]  television programs he's been on with us once before about a year ago and i got
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:10.440]  to say i am really impressed not just with dillbert over the years and reading
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:15.720]  it for decades but with the way he boils it down you know it's true when you hear
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:20.040]  it especially when you've experienced it and then what's even crazier is you
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:22.840]  don't hear what he's saying almost anywhere else
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:27.320]  even here because i was never even a republican or a democrat i've been a
[2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:30.440]  libertarian and the republicans have horrible problems but
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:34.360]  the populace have been taking that over most of folks i knew that put trump
[2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:37.320]  into office were the old obama voters in fact the
[2:21:37.320 --> 2:21:42.360]  demographic showed it but now they've gone so crazy
[2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:46.840]  that they've radicalized to the point of where they've just dehumanized
[2:21:46.840 --> 2:21:51.560]  everyone out there just like that passage from 1984
[2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:55.320]  we just played as we came in live so i'm gonna ask him to recap
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:59.400]  what he just said and then expand on it and then predict again
[2:21:59.400 --> 2:22:03.640]  you know as a linguist you know as somebody that's written and studied
[2:22:03.640 --> 2:22:07.880]  the art of persuasion and and made a lot of accurate prediction
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:11.000]  where he thinks this is going as a best-selling author
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.600]  and researcher again the creator of dillbert scott adams because
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:18.040]  again folks know i don't just say hey that's profound all the time i think
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:22.120]  everybody understands we heard the truth there so looking at this mass mental
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:27.000]  illness where does it go next and how do we not become so radicalized
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:30.520]  by fighting it because when you're faced with the abyss as nishi said
[2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:36.040]  you tend to become the abyss right um well first of all i i've got uh
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:40.280]  it all the big book yeah when yeah tell me about
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:43.880]  so it's win bigly and it's uh the story of uh uh
[2:22:43.880 --> 2:22:47.880]  how persuasion in a world where facts don't matter is everything you need to
[2:22:47.880 --> 2:22:51.320]  understand what happened in the last two years
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:54.680]  so i'm a trained hypnotist by background and
[2:22:54.680 --> 2:22:58.120]  been studying persuasion in all its all its forms
[2:22:58.120 --> 2:23:02.120]  for years and so when i looked at the election uh cycle i was looking at it
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:05.640]  through a different window just looking at it through a persuasion window
[2:23:05.640 --> 2:23:09.000]  and one of the things that uh you learn to look for when you're
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:13.560]  when you have this kind of a background is you look for what i'd call the trigger
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:18.280]  for cognitive dissonance it's the it's the thing that caused people to flip
[2:23:18.280 --> 2:23:22.520]  out and become irrational a specific thing and the specific thing was the
[2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:25.480]  election itself when most of the world thought they
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:28.840]  understood the world and surely this donald trump
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:33.320]  character could never be elected president and then he was and they had to
[2:23:33.320 --> 2:23:36.280]  suddenly reinterpret their world to make sense of it
[2:23:36.280 --> 2:23:40.280]  without changing the basic thing that they wanted to maintain which is
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:43.480]  well i've been right all along i'm a pretty smart person
[2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:47.400]  so whatever is going on here has it must be something that
[2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:50.920]  i'm still right about that's the way normal brains work by the way so i'm
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:55.080]  not mocking democrats with this this is a normal way things work
[2:23:55.080 --> 2:23:58.360]  now the reason it would affect the democrats more than the republicans
[2:23:58.360 --> 2:24:02.520]  in this specific case is that the republicans got what they wanted and
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:05.880]  expected which was a president trump overall
[2:24:05.880 --> 2:24:10.840]  the democrats got nothing they wanted and they certainly didn't expect it so
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:14.520]  that was a perfect setup for a trigger for cognitive dissonance
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:18.600]  now the other way you could confirm that that's what's happening as opposed to
[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:22.600]  people having reasonable opinions is you look for the
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:27.000]  the oversized reaction the reaction that if you brought in
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:31.080]  a third party observer who hadn't been watching any of the election and just
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:33.720]  said to him hey could you look at this person
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:38.040]  and tell me do you think this reaction that the size of their emotional reaction
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:44.280]  does this seem normal to you or have people organized to literally go
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:48.840]  outside and scream at the sky actually that's
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:52.280]  actually what's happening that people are screaming at the sky
[2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:57.640]  they're putting masks on you know i feel sorry for poor
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:01.880]  ran paul you know he's been i think the victim of
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:05.640]  possibly two attempted murders in one year
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:10.040]  and i would think that at least one of them for sure was politically motivated
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:13.800]  and the other one i've got my suspicions right that meant there may have been a
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:17.320]  political motive to that and now he has five broken ribs
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:22.680]  a pierced lung and is in serious condition. Yeah add that on top of
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:27.400]  Trump supporters during the election who were beaten in just San Jose you know
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:32.440]  a short drive from where i live so when during the election when i famously came
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:36.280]  out and said that i'm going to change my endorsement to Hillary Clinton
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:39.960]  for my personal safety which i always appended to the end of that
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:44.920]  i wasn't joking i did that actually literally for my personal safety
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:48.760]  and i believe it helped because the moment i said that people didn't care
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:51.560]  why i was changing sides even though it was somewhat
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:55.160]  transparent that i was doing it for a specific reason
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:58.280]  they just said well okay now we got another one on our side let's let's go
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.280]  scare somebody else so when you see gigantic
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:05.960]  oversized reactions like like we're seeing people marching
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:09.720]  in the streets because they think you know a Hitler monster has been elected
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.080]  even though we're not seeing the evidence of that and it's been many months
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:17.320]  seems like we would have and even if people don't really become
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:22.360]  Hitler at age 70 you know that that's something we don't really see
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:26.280]  so if they're screaming at the sky they're they're bringing guns to places
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:30.120]  to shoot republicans because they're that worked up
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:35.480]  that's probably cognitive distance and i even saw some studies showing brain
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:39.720]  scans of hardcore democrats that they'd gone through PTSD and the brain actually
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:44.280]  showed signs of real trauma yeah this is real
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:48.920]  you know if if you're uh if your mind goes to that dark place and stays there
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:52.120]  long enough you've got a problem now keep in mind i've
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:54.920]  called this out and i write about this in wind bigly
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.800]  that the the clinton persuasion game was terrible
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:04.680]  right until bernie dropped out and then it went to weapons grade do you
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:08.120]  remember as soon as the republican convention was over
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:10.920]  the moment it was over and they switched to the pundits
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:16.760]  every pundit used the same word it's dark it was a dark speeches dark dark dark
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:20.680]  that was the moment i called uh that there must be a professional
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:24.120]  maybe somebody was helping bernie until he dropped out because it was the
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:29.080]  timing of a of clinton's improvement in this area was sort of suspicious
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:32.600]  so as soon as she started saying that everything he was doing was dark and
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:36.840]  dark and dark it activated fear so she went to fear
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:40.520]  persuasion which is the strongest she had started with
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:44.680]  i have experience things are going okay and let's do more of the same
[2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:47.480]  you know let's not have these republican ideas
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:52.040]  somewhat of a policy-based experience-based persuasion and it wasn't
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:55.400]  very effective but by the summer she had picked up
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:28:00.760]  you know the the dark theme and that was just a magnet for every bad idea that
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:04.680]  everybody separately trump was optimistic for a new
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:08.360]  better future but pointing out that they were the ones that were negative
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:11.400]  and they were the ones putting out the negative message so it was true
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:15.640]  now he's gotten in now he's partially delivered uh like you said earlier how
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:20.440]  are they gonna say it's all a nightmare uh when we see the economy coming back
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:24.280]  yeah i had predicted prior to inauguration day that you would see the
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:28.040]  following story arc play out in the real world
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:31.320]  that they would start by saying my god we've elected hillar and it would just
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:36.040]  be non-stop hillar hillar hillar until several months had passed i predicted
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:40.200]  and he hadn't done any hillar stuff because you know after a while
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:44.200]  you just can't maintain the image stay there we gotta go to break i'm gonna

[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:15.480]  i see fair moon horizon
[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:19.640]  we now take you live to the central texas comments on me
[2:33:19.640 --> 2:33:24.600]  in the heart of the resistance is alex jones
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:27.720]  steven bandon calls it a war for the republic
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:31.800]  and then they act like he invented that no politics is war
[2:33:31.800 --> 2:33:35.080]  and as the creator of dillbert scott adams was just saying
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:39.000]  he's a technologist engineer before he ever created dillbert and then
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:42.920]  all his other best-selling books
[2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:46.760]  but for me i don't promote fear-based stuff to manipulate people they are
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:49.800]  coming after our guns they are selling out our industry
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:53.960]  they are doing one-sided deals as long as you're scaring people with the truth
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:33:58.920]  to get them to take action like if your house is on fire to get out
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:03.320]  then i see it as a good thing so for me i've never studied persuasion i just go
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:07.800]  with my gut and with what's common sense
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:11.480]  and now that trumps delivered so much on what he said he would do so
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  early compared to the politics of lying
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.640]  where you lie to people you manipulate them and then
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:25.640]  you don't deliver to them on purpose because you're such a sociopath you
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:31.160]  think it's it's chump-like to actually care about people
[2:34:31.160 --> 2:34:35.400]  whereas a real ruling class would want prosperity that produces more technology
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:39.720]  more medicine more science so they could skim off the top and be even more rich
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:43.480]  but see there's a chicken you know what factor a chicken
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:48.120]  sh you know what i call the chicken bleep dimension
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:52.840]  that that that we see in in cultures that become decadent where the grandkids
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:56.120]  of the people that actually made the money made the inventions just become
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:00.200]  these jerks that hate flyover country and want to dominate and control
[2:35:00.200 --> 2:35:04.120]  everybody and that's what i see but i'm telling you i'm going to read
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:08.360]  win bigly i'm trying to carry it at the info wars bookstore online
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:11.640]  because i already read two of his other books persuasion
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:16.360]  in a world where facts don't matter and then it goes into the summer 2015 scott
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:20.920]  madams was in the middle of a planned career pivot a guy who created the
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:24.520]  delbert comic to a maverick political pundit and i like the fact that they
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:27.640]  persecuted him he didn't back off he got deeper
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:31.400]  into it and has now created a whole another career for himself
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:35.000]  win bigly persuasion in a world where facts don't matter
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:38.600]  and there's other books he's written as well
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:43.400]  but he gets into the whole way of linguistic skills linguistic kill shots
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:46.760]  setting the table visual persuasion how about this
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:51.000]  they want the tpp a secret global group to control and run my life trumps
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:54.600]  against it that makes perfect sense how about they want my guns and want to
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:35:58.600]  bankrupt the economy to control me and make me be a renter and not an
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:02.360]  owner in my own life how about that's authoritarian i'm against it i mean
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:05.880]  at a certain point is it fear mongering a good thing
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:12.520]  scott adams if it's true well the ideal situation is the one that
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:17.160]  trump used i call him a master persuader because he's he's good at this stuff
[2:36:17.160 --> 2:36:21.400]  and what he did is he would show you the optimistic view you know if you elect
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:23.480]  me everything's going to be great we'll have
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:28.520]  you know x percent gdp will will be in a golden age making America great again
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:31.800]  but at the moment we're in this bad situation
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:35.640]  so he'll describe the current situation as terrible while contrasting it with
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:38.520]  the amazing times ahead and if you think about it
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:41.880]  as soon as i say that you say to yourself well isn't that just normal
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:44.440]  people say it's bad i'm going to give you something better
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:48.520]  but if you look at the the clinton campaign
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:51.880]  you didn't see a lot of the world is going to be great under my
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:55.320]  administration i didn't see the i didn't see the upside
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:58.680]  presented as part of the sale that's because they want to break our will it's
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:00.680]  in the wiki leaks they want to permanent underclass
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:05.560]  i mean obama said you can't have cars in air conditioning to africans
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:09.240]  well i don't i don't know about their secret thoughts one of the things that
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.000]  i always caution against is that we imagine we can tell what's in the
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.520]  minds and motivations of people and we're terrible at that
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:20.520]  then maybe hillary's just super super stupid because if you know
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:24.280]  she's not promoting prosperity how's that going to create optimism to get the
[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:28.280]  stock market up well whatever biggest problems that i
[2:37:28.280 --> 2:37:31.400]  read about in the book is that she used to say in her tweets if you remember
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:35.800]  this pattern she would say imagine president trump and then
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:39.000]  then the next part if you click through which a lot of people didn't
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.280]  would be something bad he might do if he were elected president
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:46.040]  but the first part was a persuasion mistake of the first order
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:50.760]  she was telling people to imagine the very thing that he was also trying to
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:54.680]  tell them to imagine him as president exactly until you could
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:58.680]  until you could wrap your head around the fact that this this crazy you know
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:02.440]  i guess they called him a cheeto jesus at one point
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:06.360]  so until you could take the the comical clown
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:09.720]  you know brand that they tried to put on him from the start
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:13.160]  and you could even imagine him being in the white house
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:17.000]  you know you couldn't vote for him so she actually solved one of his biggest
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:24.040]  problems accidentally by saying imagine president trump over and over again
[2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:27.560]  it shows why the democratic establishment tried to get rid of hillary
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:31.240]  but she was able to hold on didn't she understand that
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:34.600]  by again making trump front the center she was actually creating
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:39.080]  her own political demise yeah there's a lot of things
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.640]  she didn't understand what let me tell you you're you're reminding me of my
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:47.720]  my best prediction in the book which some say didn't quite happen but i've
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:52.440]  predicted early on that that by the end trump would be
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:57.720]  effectively running unopposed and i i thought that i detected a
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:00.600]  a variation in the way she looked from day to day
[2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:04.920]  that often suggests an underlying health problem now i'm not a doctor
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:09.000]  but hypnotists learn to look at micro changes and facial and
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:12.840]  and other movements someday she looked like she'd been run over by a truck and
[2:39:12.840 --> 2:39:15.720]  drank four bottles of vodka the other day she just looked okay
[2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:20.280]  the woman looks like hell yeah and compared that to trump who kind of
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:24.520]  looks exactly the same every day his energy level is pretty much the same
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:28.280]  and and that's a sign of good health now we know from
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:32.360]  donna brazil's book now that there was a point where at least she was concerned
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:36.360]  that her health was so bad that maybe they should consider taking her out
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:39.160]  so that's that's about as close as you could get to
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:43.880]  running unopposed although not not literally or technically true
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:47.000]  so it's all being vindicated they were thinking about removing her and putting
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.400]  biden in she was basically fixing the
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:53.160]  nomination process is it too little too late can the
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:59.320]  democrats reverse their political sepac who that they've committed
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:03.160]  well before you go on for that i just have to point out something i haven't
[2:40:03.160 --> 2:40:07.080]  heard anybody say but when donna brazil was saying we're
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:11.880]  going to replace maybe hillary and tim can with possibly biden and i think
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:16.840]  cori booker what happened to tim cane like what what did he do
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:20.760]  wrong was he never the right choice to begin with it was kind of an odd choice
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:23.640]  that he would be thrown under the bus now of course
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:27.320]  we imagine that the reason was because they wanted to you know play to their
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:30.840]  identity politics and they just they just couldn't have what two white
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:35.080]  guys running for office so it uh so it was the most
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:41.560]  blatant confession of racism that i think we've ever seen
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:46.280]  and completely um not noticed well that's a big point
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:50.360]  that's a big point and let's expand on that she also admits well we couldn't
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:53.560]  get rid of hillary because she was a woman and that would
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:56.920]  make women man you should have whoever the best candidate is woman or man
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:41:00.760]  it shows how it's all identity politics the opposite of what martin Luther
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:04.600]  king talked about yeah i think in the end
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:09.080]  one of her biggest problems you know if you don't count the basket of deplorables
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:13.240]  which you know i think we would all count as her biggest mistake
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:17.160]  just the fact that she said i'm going to make a thing about being a woman
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:22.440]  you know even one of her proposed slogans was i am with her calling out the
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:26.680]  the gender advantage as she said it she actually said it would be an advantage
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:29.800]  in some ways that women could listen better she said that in public
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:33.560]  now i'm not saying whether that's true or false i'm saying that as a political
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:37.400]  statement to say my critical you can't say men are better at
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.160]  certain things under their cosmology but then she's saying they can say women are
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:44.680]  better it's like the pigs in in animal farm
[2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:48.760]  saying you know four legs good two legs bad unless we're pigs and we walk on two
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:52.680]  legs then it's okay right now compare that to
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:56.920]  who i would call another master persuader president obama
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:01.320]  even if you don't like his politics he was he was very good at this
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:04.680]  and he ran for president as the first you know
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:08.840]  african-american who had a really good chance of winning and he never made that
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:12.840]  a theme he never said elect me because i'm an african-american
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:16.280]  he never said elect me because i'll be your first african-american you may have
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:19.960]  you mentioned it a few times in passing but it wasn't a theme
[2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:23.720]  and i think that allowed people to say okay as long as you're not making that
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:27.480]  the theme we'll we'll we'll look at the the politics and we'll look at the
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:30.680]  policies they were very smart knowing a lot of conservatives would go for it
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:34.200]  for real equality because he wasn't making it racial
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:37.880]  right yeah that was that felt like a step forward for everybody well scott

[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:15.960]  some of the next hour getting your phone calls for those that have been
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:19.080]  holding we're gonna have our chicago affiliate uh broadcaster and
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:24.040]  station manager joining us always love having him on just briefly
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.480]  my dad is an oral surgeon in dentistry he's about to retire
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:31.000]  about 15 years ago he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:33.560]  for now it causes brain damage and lower iq and dental
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:37.720]  furlosis and he said son i don't care who you have on the air that's a bunch of
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.640]  bull you need fluoride or you die and i actually showed him what was in the
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:43.880]  water supply in the florida so this is incredible
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:47.560]  this is grignard reagents heavy metals they're they're covering for it
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:53.800]  calling it florida law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:57.480]  exactly now cnn had to admit last month in utero
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:02.040]  and in children massive iq reductions well six years ago
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.240]  the epa said reduce it in water by half you don't drink your sunscreen but
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:12.520]  hydrofluorosalicylic acid is a hopped up version of fluoride it's it's
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:15.800]  been turned into an acid and it's an adjuvant it's very toxic
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:19.080]  that's why my dad and i developed with the same folks that make toms of main
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:23.080]  it's private labeled super blue non fluoride toothpaste with
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:27.720]  colloidal silver and high quality iodine which you die without iodine massive
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:30.360]  iodine deficiencies in the country but you drink the stuff that's at the store
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:33.800]  it'll kill you that's different type of iodine this is the real medical grade
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:37.800]  super blue toothpaste available at infowarstore.com
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:44.280]  but there is the cnn headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:49.880]  is causing iqs to drop precipitously and for seven years the
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:53.160]  american dental association says don't brush children's teeth until age six
[2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:56.760]  with it why does it say nurse free water that at the store with added fluoride
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:48:59.960]  and they didn't add calcium fluoride boys and girls they added
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.560]  hydrofluorosalicylic acid it's 33 off right now
[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:06.760]  and we have the bubble gum natural flavor organic flavor for children that
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:09.640]  doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it because it says concentrated
[2:49:09.640 --> 2:49:12.120]  toothpaste your purchases make everything we hear
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:16.040]  do possible including dna force now back in stock
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:20.200]  now going to scott adams of blog.dilbert.com
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:25.160]  and of course also on twitter at ask at scott adam says
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:29.240]  how about the book win bigly what about the censorship because they've gone
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:33.880]  through cognitive dissonance they've gone through traumatic panic attacks
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:37.400]  they believe hitler has taken over they ignore that the economy is getting
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.960]  better and that unity is increasing in polls
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:45.160]  what do you expect to happen next uh as the establishment democratic party
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:48.120]  seems to just get more mentally ill we know donald brazil's
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:52.680]  kind of trying to right the ship but they don't appear to be listening to her
[2:49:52.680 --> 2:49:56.280]  well i think as long as they're not successful they're going to have to
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:01.480]  find a new approach so i think just coming hard at
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:04.680]  trump supporters uh is not a path that's
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:07.160]  that's going to be productive for them so they're good they're going to be
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:09.960]  flailing around looking for something that works
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:13.320]  now the problem is that if they're dealing with a successful
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:17.800]  presidency and it's starting to look like that's a little harder to deny
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:21.960]  as the economy does well isis is defeated immigration is down
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:25.800]  you know we're out of trade agreements i would say
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:29.320]  if you're going to look to the future about what's the biggest
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:33.080]  wild card you know the the the black swan if you will the thing that could
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:36.120]  change everything about everything it would be something
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:41.080]  happening with north korea and now i'm not going to go
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:44.920]  you know predict that we're going to have some great success there
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:48.600]  but i also don't think there's going to be any kind of a nuclear war coming out
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:51.560]  of that because nobody wants it it's it's the one thing
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:57.640]  that nobody wants including the north but for the first time i think you're
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:01.480]  seeing a situation where the north korean leader little rockaman
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:06.120]  probably wonders every day if he only has a month left to live
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:09.960]  and i don't think that the leaders of north korea have ever had that feeling
[2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:15.560]  before so the president has given this them this sense of genuine uncertainty
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:18.840]  about their future that i would think would make them a little bit more
[2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:22.040]  flexible if there's some way that they can get what they need
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:25.640]  at the same time we can get what we need which will be the real trick
[2:51:25.640 --> 2:51:29.480]  scott adams clearly north korea had gotten more belligerent more
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:32.280]  delusional so we had to put some pressure on them
[2:51:32.280 --> 2:51:35.240]  most defense analysts agree with what the president's done japan
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:38.840]  certainly agrees china is having to now put more pressure on north korea
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:44.200]  but when you pull back at saudi arabia uh the princes that were
[2:51:44.200 --> 2:51:47.960]  going against the u.s going against trump involved funding isis
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:51.080]  they all just died in helicopter crashes or got killed at their houses
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:54.840]  i'm not endorsed or arrested i'm not endorsing any of this but it is an
[2:51:54.840 --> 2:51:58.440]  authoritarian regime but it does seem almost magic
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:01.400]  how all the enemies suddenly in the u.s and of trump
[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:05.240]  and of anti-globalism every election is going against the globalist
[2:52:05.240 --> 2:52:09.240]  every election is going against socialists everywhere the trend is
[2:52:09.240 --> 2:52:12.520]  the new world order is in deep deep deep deep manure
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:16.360]  and trump just keeps coming up aces every time
[2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:20.200]  i'm kind of pinching myself i mean i didn't expect trump to deliver this
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:23.880]  good just ten months in i mean this is crazy and then i learned from his
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:28.040]  family and others that his dad was a super anti-communist
[2:52:28.040 --> 2:52:31.240]  so was he they were donating the john bursa society by the way nobody even
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:34.680]  knew this they had their whole democrat face being nice in new york
[2:52:34.680 --> 2:52:37.800]  and now we have a super libertarian americana
[2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:42.360]  sleeper cell with a guy with incredible energy who's obviously a genius
[2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:46.760]  now is the president of the united states and and and just the communist
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:51.960]  chinese the islamicists they're all crapping their pants right now
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:55.160]  yeah you know you you mentioned saudi arabia if it's true
[2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:58.680]  the reporting that the the the new leader over there
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:01.880]  actually wants to move them toward moderation
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:07.160]  that's the biggest story in the world that's the biggest story
[2:53:07.160 --> 2:53:11.000]  in 10 years 20 years exactly what is a bigger story than that
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:14.840]  now we don't know if you'll succeed but it is saudi arabia
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:17.720]  right i mean they're regarding the holy sites and
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:22.280]  and you one would think that whatever they do would have a ripple effect
[2:53:22.280 --> 2:53:26.040]  and could be the beginning of an extraordinary change
[2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:30.040]  that we don't know if the president trump had anything directly to do with
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:32.600]  that but we do know he's getting along well with
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:36.440]  with them over there and and that can't hurt
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:39.160]  so i mean i don't want to be too messianic here because obviously trump's
[2:53:39.160 --> 2:53:41.800]  just a person bringing back classic americana
[2:53:41.800 --> 2:53:44.600]  that's why everybody wanted to move her to begin with it's not like he invented
[2:53:44.600 --> 2:53:47.560]  this we're just coming back to this people are hungry for it
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:51.880]  uh i mean how would you describe this whole trump phenomenon nationalist
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:55.160]  phenomenon from from austria to italy to the
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:59.720]  check republic to to poland to island to australia
[2:53:59.720 --> 2:54:05.320]  to brexit to the u.s i mean what happened
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:10.360]  yeah i i'm not enough of a student of world affairs to know
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:14.120]  if there's some common theme that runs across all these all these countries
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:17.480]  because sometimes it's easy to imagine a pattern where there isn't one
[2:54:17.480 --> 2:54:20.760]  in the united states one of the things that
[2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:24.360]  president trump and before that candidate trump did so well
[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:27.560]  is he gave people different reasons to like him
[2:54:27.560 --> 2:54:31.480]  so if you know if you liked populism or you
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:35.880]  you liked his immigration policies you'd say that's what i like if you liked
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:40.600]  maybe lower taxes you like that but my my favorite is
[2:54:40.600 --> 2:54:44.200]  he he does what something i would call strategic ambiguity
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:48.360]  meaning that people can read into him things that they want to see
[2:54:48.360 --> 2:54:52.040]  for example if you're very religious and that matters to you
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:55.160]  you would see that he talks about the bible he says he's very christian
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:54:59.080]  mentions it often and you'd say oh yes i'm christian he's christian
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:02.760]  i like that but if you didn't think religion was terribly important and you
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:05.880]  didn't really want it to be a big feature of the government
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:09.560]  you would also say to yourself yes he says these things because that's good
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:11.720]  politics and we don't know what's in his heart
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:15.480]  but he doesn't seem to be a big church guy i'm comfortable with that
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:19.560]  so it's amazing how many times he'll he'll present two completely different
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:23.000]  visions and people can be comfortable in the one that works
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.800]  exactly he's very very pragmatic but let me give you some of the secret sauce i
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:28.360]  know you're a smart guy i'm in the technologies before he became a best
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:31.960]  selling author let me look globalism is anti free
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:35.960]  market it's anti home rule it's anti nationalism from tpp to
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:39.560]  rescuing our borders he's bringing back national identity
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:42.840]  and from all over the world it is an anti globalist
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:47.320]  anti radical islamic uh system of not wanting to be colonized
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:52.280]  by the modern liberal ethos of world government powered by socialism
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:57.000]  communism authoritarian islam and it's the fact that he did that
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:00.920]  that has put energized other nationalist movements
[2:56:00.920 --> 2:56:05.000]  and made it sexy now creating a new wave behind trump
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.280]  uh that is anti new world order of my listeners i will tell you
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:11.800]  you kept Nigel Farage will say half their supporters came from empowers
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:15.560]  we allowed the critical mass our listeners to push this over the edge
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:20.360]  globally so i want people to know the secret sauce is our audience
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:24.200]  well well that may be i mean you've you've got a tremendous speech
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:27.640]  and certainly the things you're saying are compatible with the the things who
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:32.040]  are voting on the winning team um it's it's hard to figure out
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:36.360]  whose persuasion whose whose factor is really the key variable in these
[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:40.760]  multi-variable situations but i totally agree it's a giant spectrum
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:44.600]  i just want our listeners to know being involved being active busting their
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:48.040]  butts to stand up for americana all these years and getting bullied
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:51.800]  baby it we're hitting pay dirt we're starting to turn the tide
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:55.720]  you know i think you just used a word that is very active
[2:56:55.720 --> 2:57:01.800]  and this the bully word that the the feeling that the people who who other
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:05.960]  other people thought were in charge the people who
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:09.080]  others thought were in charge were actually feeling bullied
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:13.160]  so a lot of trump supporters and i would put myself in that
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:16.520]  camp in terms of the bullying we actually felt
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:20.760]  like this was no longer a you know a discussion about what's the best way to
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:25.080]  run things it just felt like bullying after a while and you didn't take it

[3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:11.080]  from the front lines from the front lines of the information war it's alex
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:17.640]  jones if you just joined us in the last hour
[3:00:17.640 --> 3:00:24.600]  we had an intriguing guest on scott adam's he is a former technologist
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:26.920]  working for some of the top companies in the world
[3:00:26.920 --> 3:00:31.160]  that became a top cartoonist and now best-selling author
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:35.400]  and political pundit and at the end of the interview
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:38.600]  that's extremely informative and powerful about the nature of the election
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:43.240]  where we're going populist movements the collective insanity of the left
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:47.160]  where they began buying into their own propaganda that they were putting out
[3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:51.880]  during the campaign and fell into a deeper mental illness
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:56.280]  during that intriguing interview towards the end
[3:00:56.280 --> 3:00:59.720]  he was saying that out of all the different complexities and different
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.360]  systems of persuasion he couldn't put his
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:11.160]  finger on the dominant thread that got president trump elected
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:14.840]  and i told him that thread i said it's the audience of this
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:20.760]  radio show and the drudge report basically that understood that the
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:24.760]  globalist for conquering this country that understood they wanted austerity
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:28.440]  that understood that they wanted to bring in a permanent underclass system
[3:01:28.440 --> 3:01:32.200]  and defeat the american renaissance system forever
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:36.280]  and sew up society sew up technology
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:39.640]  get rid of the ladders up into middle class and wealth
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:43.480]  and that the people said no to that fundamentally and that it was
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:47.320]  our info wars audience that got trump over the edge
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:52.840]  and won him the nomination and that fought in real time to counter
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:57.080]  globalist disinformation and to tell the truth about election fraud
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:02:01.000]  and bernie sanders having the election stolen and bill clinton's illegitimate
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.920]  child and bill clinton's rape and hillary's uranium one
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:10.280]  and to get threatened and to be attacked and that's why hillary came after us
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:14.040]  and that's why obama came after us because they knew
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:17.560]  what was hurting them and what was affecting them and i don't tell that
[3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:21.320]  story to make us sound big or to make you feel big
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:25.240]  it's because the globalist already know it and are already targeting us
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:28.680]  and going after us to destroy us politically
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:31.560]  because they know we've got their number
[3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:35.000]  understanding the past is the key to the future
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.400]  those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:41.560]  and we have gotten a major beachhead not just here but globally
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:45.800]  to the unelected private corporate world government running these politicians
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:49.400]  and systems and as i've said 10 000 times probably
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:54.600]  once you identify globalism as an authoritarian unelected
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:03:00.360]  anti-human anti-prosperity system there's no way for them ever to get
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:04.200]  their program finished now does that mean we've got some utopia
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:07.640]  does that mean we defeat them everything's okay no
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:10.680]  but at least we've got a shot because we don't have people in there
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:15.880]  fundamentally working against prosperity because it creates too much competition
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:20.200]  we're promoting the american system of renaissance
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.360]  and the world hears it and the world knows it and the enemy knows it
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:27.640]  so it's time for all of our affiliates and all of our sponsors
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:31.160]  and all of our listeners and this incredible crew
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:36.840]  to understand you are part of one of the most important battles politically
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:42.760]  in the history of humanity and you are helping to change the world
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:46.280]  fundamentally and you put up with the bullying
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:49.560]  you put up with all the garbage you put up with the peer pressure you put up

[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:59.080]  you went through the attacks you stayed the course
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:03.400]  and you were trailblazers and you changed the world

[3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:23.080]  trying to work it out to get him to co-host the show five days a week
[3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:27.640]  i promised i'd go to tim bryan sue faith tal and others and i'm going to get out
[3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:31.160]  here and let him host the show he's been preparing for all day
[3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:34.920]  but i promised to go to your calls but you were left over from before
[3:06:34.920 --> 3:06:39.560]  i guess we leave the best for last when we had scott adams on so we're going to
[3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:42.120]  go to your calls and let you have your take on the
[3:06:42.120 --> 3:06:46.280]  tragic events in texas before i get out of here and then eat my lunch while i
[3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:49.160]  actually watch and listen to matt dibby l but matt tell folks what you've got
[3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:51.720]  coming up today
[3:06:52.920 --> 3:06:56.920]  about texas a little bit about chicago there's there's been some
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:07:00.600]  shootings in chicago that people forget about and i just like to remind people
[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:07.160]  that donna brazil's book is a hot topic and and why i think she's a massive
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:10.600]  very very good persuader and i know that scott was talking about persuasion
[3:07:10.600 --> 3:07:15.880]  he's the expert but i saw her doing some things so we'll get into that
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:18.920]  i tell you why do you think she's doing this i think to cover her own butt
[3:07:18.920 --> 3:07:23.880]  she's needy for all the corruption well for starters uh she's she wants to sell
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:28.440]  books we we know that and uh her her publisher wants her to sell books and
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:31.400]  that's what she's got to do to begin with uh secondly
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:35.160]  i think that her dedicating her stuff to uh seth rich
[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:38.120]  is uh kind of a big deal because it's a persuasion technique it gets to the
[3:07:38.120 --> 3:07:42.280]  rest of us to go oh she's not so bad
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:46.840]  it signifies that she knows they're loath and hated
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:51.880]  she's trying to join our side yeah well and it's and i think scott would say
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:56.280]  it's a persuasion tactic to get people to uh kind of rally behind her and say
[3:07:56.280 --> 3:07:59.160]  she's not so bad i wouldn't be surprised if she ran for office
[3:07:59.160 --> 3:08:02.680]  uh it doesn't have to be national office could be a senate seat or you know
[3:08:02.680 --> 3:08:06.040]  congress someplace but i'm sure she's going to be doing that
[3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:10.440]  so this is her attempt at a facelift and shows that the clintons really have
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:14.120]  wrecked the democratic party brand i mean how would you describe it they are
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:18.120]  now a coastal elite party they're loathed by their own constituents
[3:08:18.120 --> 3:08:21.720]  the demonization of trump is wearing off as the proof in the pudding
[3:08:21.720 --> 3:08:26.200]  that his presidency is not failed in fact it's maverick and beautiful so far
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:29.560]  how would you describe then the state of the party the democratic party
[3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:33.880]  delusional psychotic burning itself down out of control
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:37.800]  well you know my grandfather was first generation american born chicago
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:41.400]  democrat his father was a uh was an alderman in chicago
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:45.160]  and back then the democrats would get out in the streets and they were
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:48.040]  you know they would talk about trying to get president kennedy elected and they
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:51.480]  had pride in america they were connected to america
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:55.480]  this democratic party and other republicans too if they're not careful
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:08:58.680]  um all the things that the tide has changed but this democratic party for
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:03.720]  sure is completely disconnected from the core of america exactly why are they
[3:09:03.720 --> 3:09:07.720]  so anti-american they literally hate the country
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:13.560]  i don't it's it seems like suicide to me uh i don't know what the hell is
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:15.160]  going on exactly because i was hearing you know the
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:18.600]  delbert creator talking about persuasion and fearing fear mongering
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:22.840]  they do want our guns they do hate us i mean they they do the scaremongering
[3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:26.040]  forest they really are worse than we can say
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:31.000]  i mean they're just crazy people they're completely disconnected i i tweeted
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:32.840]  yesterday and i'm not a big twitter guy but
[3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:36.760]  i was god bless or ran paul and i hope that he's recovering well
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:40.200]  but i mean what struck me was that he was mowing his own lawn
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:43.560]  how many democratic leaders in the united states of america pump their own gas
[3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:46.920]  buy their own groceries mow their own lawn they're completely disconnected
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:50.040]  exactly i mean most of democrats are worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:53.240]  they're in 15 20 million five million dollar houses
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:09:56.920]  here he is in a 300 000 house in the middle of the countryside
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:00.440]  mowing his own yard and then a rich democrat from down the street i saw the
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:03.880]  guy's house four times as isaas shows up and tries to kill him
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:07.560]  and it's it's basically now admitted he was an sjw
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:10.600]  these people have lost their minds and the worst thing they can do
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:15.000]  is disconnect i mean if if i'm a mexican american if i'm an african american
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:19.400]  if i'm a minority of any kind i am not backing that party in any way shape or
[3:10:19.400 --> 3:10:23.560]  form and if i'm a minority leader i'm not necessarily i'm not trying to get
[3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:27.000]  people to back me over there i'm moving over to the other side
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  they are the ones killing their own party let's go to some phone calls
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.680]  let's go to who's holding the longest brian in north carolina that's sue
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:39.560]  brian you're on the air go ahead hey alex thanks for taking my call
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:44.120]  you bet uh first thing i wanted to tell you was the nasa eye dying
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:50.520]  i found out it's great for abscesses on the gum line like if you have an abscess
[3:10:50.520 --> 3:10:54.680]  or a kinger sore the nasa eye dying is awesome for
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:10:57.160]  that well that's why we put it in the toothpaste
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:01.560]  again without iodine you die there's just all these toxic forms out there
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:04.200]  they're just topical and they still do some good
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:07.800]  ours is the deep earth pure source in the toothpaste so so thank you but that
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:11.160]  that's why we put it in the toothpaste yeah it's great stuff
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:15.640]  um originally i wanted to call about the uh texas shooter
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.240]  and uh i guess initially i would have mentioned
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:23.320]  i am the atheist but i gotta tell you i love my christians
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:27.480]  and i'll tell you why because i'd rather stand beside somebody who's going to
[3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:31.960]  pray for me than somebody who's going to pray on me
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:35.720]  and that's that's the simplest i can put it i gotta steal that saying i'm going
[3:11:35.720 --> 3:11:38.840]  to stand by somebody that's going to pray for me instead of pray on me and
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:42.680]  listen i know they're diverse atheists who are brought up in oppressive churches
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:46.040]  or other religious stuff that are total cults and are dangerous and bad
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:49.960]  you have a total right i respect that i understand why a lot of people
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:55.240]  are agnostic or atheist that said the liberal fake atheists that hate christians
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:58.920]  it just like the dylan roofs come back to kill the nine black people
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:02.920]  and then all whites got blamed i'm not blaming all atheists but i'm saying the
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:06.680]  left if this guy had been a christian they'd be blaming all christians or
[3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:12.120]  other groups right now now let me i keep hearing everybody
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:14.920]  ask why is this happening why is this going on
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:19.880]  this is all very simple if you look at the source or the sources the global
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:22.680]  sources that we talk about every day
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:26.920]  george soros our most formative years are in our youth
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:34.920]  he was brought up as a hitler youth am i correct yes and if you look at what's
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:39.320]  been happening globally and where he's been putting his money
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:43.880]  like in friday you know pence mentioned that he was
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:49.560]  that we're putting millions into the u.s. aid the u.s. a.i.d.
[3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  fund which george soros is also putting his money into
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:56.840]  that's true but now they're specifically bypassing the ngo's
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.440]  and going right to the christian churches i gotta jump ryan but it shows
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:03.080]  how informed you are thank you for the support
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:06.440]  let's talk to sue in kansas you're only here with matt dubiel and myself go
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:10.840]  ahead hey i'm watching you on the very first
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:17.240]  24 seven info wars tv channel kgp t26 yeah well you know what i'm not good at
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:19.560]  promoting our affiliate because i'm so busy on air
[3:13:19.560 --> 3:13:22.920]  but we have a lot of tv stations and cable systems picking us up now
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:25.640]  and i need to do a better job of promoting these sue
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:29.240]  in fact i knew about that station the last few months in kansas
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:36.200]  tell folks to call letters everything again kgp t26 which is hot
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:39.320]  that's right i knew about that i mean so many exciting things are happening
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:45.320]  right now we uh go ahead okay i saw on fox news this morning
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:48.440]  that devin kelly was wearing one of those skull
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:53.560]  masks and it took me back to over the weekend when i was looking at laura
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:58.440]  lumers twitter page and she had retweeted a picture
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:05.480]  from a four-chan uh posting that shows several guys in these skull masks
[3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:09.880]  dressed in black and camo holding rifles and some weird looking flag
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:13.560]  and at the bottom it says watch the news for texas tomorrow
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:18.040]  something big is coming so they posted this on friday
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:21.800]  and i know when we were watching oan on saturday a couple different people
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:25.400]  called in a man and a woman saying to be aware that
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:29.080]  something was supposed to be happening yesterday
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:33.320]  so i don't you know instead of saturday you know what i mean
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:37.800]  sure well let me um go pull up laura lumers twitter she does a great job
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:40.600]  reporting just out there's an independent reporter we certainly
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:44.520]  look at a lot of her work and look at that i know that his his linkedin and
[3:14:44.520 --> 3:14:47.800]  other sites he was a basically like an atheist globalist
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:52.200]  anti christian guy so thank you so much so what do you think motivated this guy
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:56.200]  i mean i think it was 50 50 doesn't like christians uh you got the whole antifa
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:14:58.280]  thing going so killed two birds with one stone
[3:14:58.280 --> 3:15:05.480]  doesn't like his mother-in-law matt uh yeah you know the the old mother-in-law
[3:15:05.480 --> 3:15:09.080]  excuse i think guy's off his rocker number one
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:12.600]  and and everybody that wants to lump them in with some other group
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:17.000]  whether it be white males or whatever they should just extrapolate that and go
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:21.640]  the guy's nutso to begin with he's probably on some psychotropic he's
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:24.760]  probably on something i'm sure that that will come up that's one of the first
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:27.000]  things i want to know whenever i hear about these people
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.960]  it seems to me they end up being on something because they're depressed or
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:33.640]  they're uh something's going on with them that's right all right matt dubio

[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:21.560]  chicago it's matt dubial filling in for alex jones from the wckg studios uh
[3:20:21.560 --> 3:20:25.960]  thanks for listening to info wars all day long now there's been some changes in

[3:20:29.880 --> 3:20:34.520]  knight and the war room and those shows are so important and now more than ever
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:38.760]  that we've actually added those to our lineup here so in chicago we're wall
[3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:43.240]  to wall with info wars because here we truly are on the front lines
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:49.320]  while there is terrible tragic news in texas and terrible tragic news i mean
[3:20:49.320 --> 3:20:53.480]  pretty much you could throw a dart at the united states map
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:56.760]  and no matter where you're gonna hit there's something going on in the
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:21:01.000]  country that needs our attention whether it's fires whether it's
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:05.160]  hurricane relief whether it's gunshots chicago
[3:21:05.160 --> 3:21:09.640]  it's las vegas every month in chicago and i'm gonna repeat it until i'm blue in
[3:21:09.640 --> 3:21:12.920]  the face i'm gonna repeat it every time i have the
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:15.880]  the good pleasure to sit in here for alex for the fourth hour
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:19.240]  because uh in september there were 59 deaths
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:24.120]  in chicago from gunshots now you might expect if you were uh
[3:21:24.120 --> 3:21:27.080]  on the left that i might use this as an argument
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:31.880]  for gun control you might expect that 59 gunshot deaths
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:37.400]  in chicago would be an argument for uh comprehensive gun law reform or
[3:21:37.400 --> 3:21:40.680]  comprehensive universal they like to use those words
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:44.360]  comprehensive and universal and there's a reason for that
[3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:47.480]  uh because a lot of people are confused by that stuff it makes it sound
[3:21:47.480 --> 3:21:50.760]  important it makes it sound like those people that are elected to office are
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:54.040]  doing something we had a senator in uh in illinois dick
[3:21:54.040 --> 3:21:57.880]  durbin who's been in office uh since christ was a corporal
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:02.120]  and i don't know why he keeps getting elected into office actually i i do
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:05.320]  know why it's because it's illinois and chicago and that's how the machine
[3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:08.200]  works but he hit the radio this morning and he
[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:12.040]  immediately started talking about universal background checks
[3:22:12.040 --> 3:22:17.560]  universal background checks 59 people shot and killed in chicago in september
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:21.960]  there were 58 people that were killed in las vegas
[3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:26.520]  in the las vegas massacre uh this is a competition i don't want to win
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:30.600]  but chicago won the death toll competition sadly
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:35.080]  in september and jimmy fowlin jimmy kimmel uh all the jimmies
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:38.600]  uh didn't cry for chicago there have so far been
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:46.040]  3197 people shot this year not killed just shot
[3:22:46.040 --> 3:22:55.560]  just shot 3197 in chicago in 2017 we have i mean we do live in amazing times
[3:22:55.560 --> 3:22:59.240]  you'll hear alex talk about it all the time we live in amazing times we live
[3:22:59.240 --> 3:23:03.320]  in very amazing times we can zip things on the internet we can
[3:23:03.320 --> 3:23:06.360]  send information we can we all have television studios in our
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:10.200]  pockets we live in amazing times we can share
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:14.360]  likes and and comments with people on the other side of the planet
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:18.120]  we can share pictures of our grandchildren or kids with the grandparents
[3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:22.120]  and yet we're still turning up with 3100 people
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:26.920]  that are getting shot in the streets of chicago and why is that
[3:23:26.920 --> 3:23:30.440]  why is that when you have a mayor that says he's going to fix it and a
[3:23:30.440 --> 3:23:34.120]  governor that says he's going to fix it and one is a republican and one is a
[3:23:34.120 --> 3:23:37.320]  democrat it can't be the parties
[3:23:37.320 --> 3:23:42.120]  why is that why are there so many problems in the united states of america
[3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:46.120]  i think it's because we have too much time
[3:23:46.120 --> 3:23:48.600]  in the united states of america i think it's because
[3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:52.520]  most people spend their time doing things that don't do anything
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:59.000]  in the united states of america most people think that the heroes are only
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:02.360]  firemen i happen to think that the heroes are
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:05.640]  everyday americans middle class americans people like you and i
[3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:09.480]  like those two men god bless those two guys in texas
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:16.200]  that stopped a lunatic a lunatic that took up firearms and went to a church
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:20.840]  on sunday when people that he knew
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:28.680]  were worshiping vulnerable in front of god and he took firearms there
[3:24:28.680 --> 3:24:34.120]  to harm them for some personal vendetta some
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:38.040]  theological vendetta and and now it's coming out if
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:42.520]  if you believe what you read online that he's he's tried bribing underage girls
[3:24:42.520 --> 3:24:46.760]  to date him this guy i'm not going to say his name
[3:24:46.760 --> 3:24:50.360]  he doesn't deserve to have his name spoken
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:53.080]  you know they do that in the harry potter series where they won't say the bad
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:55.960]  guy's name they say he who shall not be mentioned
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:00.040]  somebody i saw somebody tweeted uh my twitter is at mad on air if you're on
[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:01.880]  twitter and by the way i'm going to get to the twitter
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:05.960]  connection to las vegas and the twitter connection to the problems in the united
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:09.000]  states and the twitter connection to the economy
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:12.680]  and the twitter connection to cnn and the new york times
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:16.520]  and the twitter connection to our president and not all the connections are
[3:25:16.520 --> 3:25:20.120]  good but i've been on twitter since like 2006 and
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:24.120]  only got on it because i'm in the media for the most part regular everyday
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:27.160]  people if i was a regular if i was not in the media i would not be
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:30.280]  fooling around on twitter i would have no reason for it
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:33.480]  makes sense for people in the media to get on twitter and share information and
[3:25:33.480 --> 3:25:36.600]  share news stories now it makes more sense for regular
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:40.680]  people all over to share things and connect because you can communicate
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.720]  there but by and large it's mostly used by elite media people like
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:49.320]  anderson cooper and maybe donna brazil and we'll get to her
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:52.760]  too coming up but there's something going on with twitter
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:56.680]  and there's something going on with las vegas
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:03.960]  and the real story in my mind is the american heroes in texas
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:08.360]  this is one of the cool things about texas texans remember
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:13.640]  that we're all together and americans our neighbors were family were brothers
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:18.680]  were sisters and two american patriots took up arms they
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:21.320]  took up pickup trucks they took up whatever they could
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:24.840]  to go and make sure that this bad guy was stopped immediately
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:28.520]  in small towns in middle america where there's only 500 people sometimes
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:32.440]  there isn't a big police force sometimes the police
[3:26:32.440 --> 3:26:36.440]  if there are some aren't going to make it there anytime soon
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:40.360]  that's a big reason that's a big part of the reason why 3100 people are shot in
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:43.960]  chicago by the time the gunshot thing happens the police
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:47.800]  you know they can't even get there and i have friends
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:53.160]  people i love dearly that are police officers retired police officers
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:27:00.280]  guess what they've been de-panced by the president the previous president
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:03.160]  barack obama they've been de-panced by the media
[3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:08.040]  where they've been paralyzed because if they do their job
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:11.480]  immediately afterwards they're called into question about their ethics about
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:15.400]  their motives about their profiling so who you
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:18.120]  going to call when things go bad who you going to call when
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:21.560]  when it hits the fan you're going to call the cops that you
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:25.000]  bastard eyes and demon eyes for doing their jobs
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:28.280]  those are the guys that you're going to call
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:33.560]  imagine imagine if every time you did your job somebody gave you grief
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:37.560]  imagine if every time you did your job somebody held it over your head and
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:41.480]  said well maybe we're going to put you in jail
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:45.160]  maybe the cops need a little bit of better training in some situations yes
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:48.440]  maybe there are some bad apples in some areas
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:53.080]  but to nationally and locally shame the police officers
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:28:00.040]  and then after that to suggest that we make it illegal
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:03.720]  for law-abiding american citizens to take up arms
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:07.880]  and protect themselves be it from bad guys
[3:28:07.880 --> 3:28:13.560]  be it from uh be it for hunting be it from tyrannical governments
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:17.640]  to suggest that we take their arms away
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:23.320]  and then have the police paralyzed would leave you vulnerable
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:29.640]  and you're already under attack the middle class is already under attack
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:34.600]  you're not going to have a chance if you don't have your firearms and you don't
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:37.560]  have your police we're going to talk about the
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:40.600]  the twitter connection we'll talk about why donna brazil wants you to be her

[3:34:10.680 --> 3:34:15.960]  liz kroken shared the pictures of um president barack obama
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:19.160]  when he visited i think it was japan and then
[3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:23.480]  now president donald trump when he visited japan and if you can see him
[3:34:23.480 --> 3:34:27.880]  you'll see a a notable difference uh you
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:31.720]  have uh uh you know and i don't know if if barack obama never
[3:34:31.720 --> 3:34:34.840]  watched the karate kid uh but when you bow
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:38.200]  it's my understanding you're supposed to look i at least that's what mr meag he
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:42.520]  said look i always look i and uh barack just went for the full
[3:34:42.520 --> 3:34:46.440]  bend over um facing down i don't know if that was out of
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:50.280]  habit i don't know why he was doing that uh but now look at the picture if
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:55.160]  you're watching go to info wars dot com slash show info wars dot com slash show
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:34:59.320]  on the internet share that link shared on twitter shared on facebook and you see
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:03.240]  a very commanding very presidential
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:09.080]  american man and a very um proud japanese i think he's the japanese um
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:13.880]  prime miss prime minister and they're shaking each other's hands
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:17.000]  like men looking at each other's in the each other in the eye
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:22.520]  it's very refreshing to me now uh i'm still going to watch the president very
[3:35:22.520 --> 3:35:26.840]  carefully i'm not going to put him up on a pedestal but i will say to you
[3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:31.640]  that uh it's very encouraging and very exciting to have a president
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:35.400]  who carries himself as a president despite what the
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:39.080]  media the bought and paid for media would have you believe
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:41.960]  i i said that we were going to talk a little bit about twitter
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:46.120]  and it's been my experience that when it comes to social media
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:50.040]  regular people like you and i for the most part are not on twitter
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:53.480]  i joined twitter back in 2006 in the early days
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:57.160]  back when i didn't have as much gray hair and i did that because i work in radio
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:36:00.680]  and i work in the media and we try to stay on top of things like that
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:03.960]  but for the most part most of the people it's even come out in
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:08.920]  in the news that the twitter has inflated their uh user statistics they've
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:12.280]  inflated their follower counts there's many bots there's
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:15.800]  many computers that pretend to be followers and things
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:21.400]  and twitter is mostly used by elite media superstars like anderson cooper
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:26.200]  and kathy griffin and other people now uh it was very curious to me in the
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:29.640]  beginning that uh and by the way i remember
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:32.920]  i will not forget i have something important to tell you that you're going
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:35.720]  to want to know and i'm just saving it for in a minute because i want to prove
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:39.160]  a point uh twitter was the darling of the
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:43.560]  mainstream media specifically television and for years and years it
[3:36:43.560 --> 3:36:47.960]  didn't make money and it was curious to me that the major
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:52.680]  money behind twitter was this prince this this guy this al-awid prince something
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:57.160]  al-awid from saudi arabia and i would watch and
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:00.760]  hear the news about this prince al-awid and be like well what is this
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:03.800]  guy doing and why is he investing in this dog
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:07.720]  twitter is a dog as it as investments go i'm no um
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:12.600]  e.f. Hutton but uh i would not invest in twitter the company doesn't make any
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:16.040]  money and it's got nothing but problems the best thing to
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:19.080]  happen to twitter has been the president like you know in many other
[3:37:19.080 --> 3:37:22.120]  arenas so i thought why would this why would this
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:27.000]  al-awid this prince al-awid go into uh invest in twitter by
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:31.160]  the way he owns big parts of city group so if you take your
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:34.520]  wallet out you know you see those commercials what's in your wallet
[3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:37.880]  what's in your wallet are you financing prince al-awid's
[3:37:37.880 --> 3:37:41.880]  shenanigans because if you're with city group you may want to rethink that you
[3:37:41.880 --> 3:37:45.240]  may want to kind of restructure that it's time for the middle class to start
[3:37:45.240 --> 3:37:47.720]  doing stuff like that i'd say get off twitter
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:51.560]  but most people are not on twitter most people in middle america
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:55.000]  like you and i if you're on social media at all
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:59.400]  you're on facebook or you're not on it at all and it's probably not a bad idea
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:01.960]  to stay the heck away from that stuff unless of course you're sharing that
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:05.160]  the links from from info wars and stuff like that
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:08.760]  i mentioned that i want to tell you about something that is very excellent
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:13.000]  news and here's here's why i waited a second uh i started taking

[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:28.680]  and i was like get out of here come on you think this stuff is really that big
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:32.200]  of a deal i mean i figure it's okay he says no man you gotta try it

[3:39:31.400 --> 3:39:35.560]  store dot com back to twitter i just want to track a series of
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:39.320]  events here and i don't have a lot of time this time goes by quickly
[3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:42.600]  when you're filling in for alex jones uh from chicago
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:46.680]  twitter has some curious things happening okay so in the beginning nobody
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:51.000]  was using twitter and what you noticed was cnn was pushing it hard
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:55.160]  the mainstream media was pushing it hard every newscaster had it in the lower
[3:39:55.160 --> 3:39:57.400]  third that's what they call the bottom of the screen
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:40:00.920]  like when they show me again on info wars and they put my name below me if
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:05.720]  you're watching an info wars dot com slash show they'll say it'll say matt dubial
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:09.000]  and then i'll have my twitter handle in there or my name or whatever
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:13.080]  well that is called the lower third in the lower third on all of these news
[3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:16.520]  outlets there it is and uh the lower third of all these news outlets
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:20.040]  what you'll see is pretty much everyone's twitter handle
[3:40:20.040 --> 3:40:24.840]  and i have a feeling if you start looking in the advertising logs of these
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:28.680]  networks uh if they weren't getting money directly they may be some of them
[3:40:28.680 --> 3:40:32.120]  own pieces of twitter but an interesting thing happened
[3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:35.960]  in the uh in the the wake of all the twitter stuff
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:41.320]  uh as i read it um the president's twitter handle was taken down for 11
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:45.000]  minutes and they blamed some low-level employee
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:51.240]  and then a couple days later prinsala weed and a bunch of these other
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:57.880]  highfalutin royals were picked up by uh saudi authorities and arrested and
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:01.560]  detained it just seems coincidental to me that
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:07.400]  that happened following the uh twitter outage for the president
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:11.480]  and then i read somewhere probably at info wars dot com i read
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:15.960]  that somebody and i don't know if it was all the weed or somebody in the in the
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  saudi um hierarchy owns a couple of floors of the
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  mandalay bay in las vegas and there's been a lot of talk
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:32.280]  about the president's twitter and there's been a lot of talk about tweeting
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:35.720]  and there's been a lot of talk about saudi arabia and i also seem to remember
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:37.800]  i'm just trying to connect the dots here because
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:41.800]  i don't keep up on the news as well as everybody else does
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:45.400]  but i also seem to be uh i remember reminded of
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:49.160]  something that happened with the bushes way back when where they were so tight
[3:41:49.160 --> 3:41:53.960]  with the saudi's that they they called like
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:59.240]  george bush or or bandar bush uh bush like the families were so close they
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:03.320]  nicknamed each other because they were so tight and i seem to remember that
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:07.800]  during 9 11 there was a bunch of saudi's put on a plane
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:11.160]  and escorted out of the country in the wake of
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:15.880]  the biggest american tragedy since pro harbour they were put on the plane and
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:20.520]  shipped out of the united states and here we have miraculous developments
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:23.560]  where it seems to me that deals are being struck
[3:42:23.560 --> 3:42:26.520]  whether they're with our president or without whether with intelligence
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:29.880]  agencies or not it's like the tight curling of
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:33.080]  and it seems pretty damn exciting to me i don't know about you
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:35.560]  but we're going to talk more about that and i'm going to share why you should
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:37.800]  watch out for donna brazil i'm a little
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:52.200]  clear of her persuasion as scott adams would say

[3:47:19.720 --> 3:47:25.880]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:47:25.880 --> 3:47:29.320]  it's mad dubio filling in for alex jones they call those liners
[3:47:29.320 --> 3:47:33.480]  in in the business and that liner is really important
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:36.840]  it's uh it's one of those things where i know you hear it over and over again
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:42.680]  but um if you're hearing this you are the resistance keith oberman is not the
[3:47:42.680 --> 3:47:46.440]  resistance have you seen kid i i shouldn't even give his name i
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:49.960]  shouldn't even give him any flow him any power uh but
[3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:53.160]  you are the resistance you are what's important
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:47:56.840]  and what you do in your family and what you do
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:47:59.800]  in the leadership in your community is what's important
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:03.560]  it's very dangerous we get into this partisan stuff and i'm going to talk a
[3:48:03.560 --> 3:48:07.240]  little bit about of an experience i had at facebook today that was
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:10.920]  uh a little illuminating and i want to talk about this donna brazil stuff
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:16.520]  i'm in chicago at the wckg studios and we carry alex's show and we carry real
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:20.680]  news in the morning and we carry the uh war room and we broadcast that on
[3:48:20.680 --> 3:48:24.120]  am 15 30 so we would love to have you listen uh because
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:27.080]  am radio is very important if the internet gets shut down and it looks
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:30.120]  like uh anonymous predicted that there were going to be blackouts and there
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:33.480]  are some today we even had some issues here today earlier
[3:48:33.480 --> 3:48:37.960]  we had issues on saturday during the november fourth pixie
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:42.360]  event where a bunch of you know pixies were like we're gonna do some damage
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:45.720]  and then they really didn't do much but uh one of the things that
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:49.000]  um happened to us was our radio station was knocked
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:52.440]  off the air and it wasn't power and it wasn't internet
[3:48:52.440 --> 3:48:55.880]  it was very unusual i'm still trying to get to the bottom of it it seemed like
[3:48:55.880 --> 3:48:59.800]  a coordinated thing uh maybe had nothing to do with
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:03.560]  the antifa stuff maybe it did maybe it has nothing to do with
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:07.480]  anything that's going on but whether it does or doesn't the important thing to
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:10.520]  note is that liner where they say you are the
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:14.200]  resistance it's important for you to understand and appreciate the power that
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:16.920]  you have and and i'll tell you this quick little story
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.960]  about facebook today there was a facebook event here in
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:22.680]  chicagoland and i went to it it was a business event
[3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:26.680]  and i did one for the media a few months ago to see what they would tell us
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:30.600]  about how facebook works and today i went to this event because it was
[3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:33.720]  supposed to be how facebook works for business
[3:49:33.720 --> 3:49:38.280]  they spent the first 15 minutes at the facebook business event where there was
[3:49:38.280 --> 3:49:43.240]  about 250 people mostly women uh probably about 60 to 70 percent
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:47.800]  female and about 40 male and in this room facebook like the
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:51.240]  people from facebook corporate were there they were set up
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:55.240]  and the first thing they did was they gave the floor
[3:49:55.240 --> 3:50:00.760]  to three local politicians elected officials not just politicians two state
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:05.800]  reps and one state senator from illinois now they gave them all
[3:50:05.800 --> 3:50:14.360]  equal time except one didn't show up and they were all democratic uh
[3:50:14.360 --> 3:50:17.880]  representatives there was not one republican
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:22.440]  there was not one tea party there was not one libertarian they were all
[3:50:22.440 --> 3:50:28.200]  democrats now i'm no um power of influence guy
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:31.560]  i'm no hypnotist like scott adams although i do follow him on twitter he's
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:35.320]  he's um very interesting and i like what he does i like watching his periscopes
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:37.800]  and stuff i loved having him on alice going to
[3:50:37.800 --> 3:50:40.760]  jones it was like one of those world's collide moments where it's like yes i
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:44.360]  want to hear alex talk to scott adams and i want to hear scott talk to alex it
[3:50:44.360 --> 3:50:48.360]  was great uh but the persuasion the embedded persuasion
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:53.320]  even i know this at the facebook meeting is all three representatives were
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:50:57.800]  democrats your representatives are democrats
[3:50:57.800 --> 3:51:02.040]  the embedded persuasion when a gun event happens is
[3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:07.000]  the right argues four guns the left argues against guns
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:12.120]  very few people have the libertarian flag on where they're like hey uh the
[3:51:12.120 --> 3:51:14.920]  government should stay out of it and we should follow the constitution and
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:18.840]  let's just stick with that but that doesn't happen
[3:51:18.840 --> 3:51:22.680]  we we fire up that left right paradigm thing again
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:27.000]  and it's a manipulation of you and when i watch
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:30.680]  and i listen to people uh for instance when i first discovered alex jones
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:34.760]  first thing i did was i flew to austin texas and i wanted to meet the guy
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:37.800]  what is this guy about what where's his heart
[3:51:37.800 --> 3:51:42.120]  where's his head where's his heart what's he like went back out there again
[3:51:42.120 --> 3:51:46.040]  and obviously we still carry the show and and and things have
[3:51:46.040 --> 3:51:49.480]  grown from there i think he's a good man i think he's got a good heart
[3:51:49.480 --> 3:51:53.160]  i think he does this because he actually cares yeah he makes a living
[3:51:53.160 --> 3:51:57.160]  yeah they have to sell supplements that keeps it all going he's a job creator
[3:51:57.160 --> 3:52:02.200]  he's a job provider he's an amazing dude this guy
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:05.960]  he does it because he loves and cares about
[3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:10.120]  you i believe and i asked myself that same question about like the anderson
[3:52:10.120 --> 3:52:13.000]  cooper's of the world and the donna brazil's of the world
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:17.480]  donna brazil is out there saying my book is dedicated to seth rich
[3:52:17.480 --> 3:52:21.240]  hillary bad and before she was like yeah
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:25.640]  hillary's all right well what happened what changed
[3:52:25.640 --> 3:52:28.920]  she was afraid for her life before and now she's come out well
[3:52:28.920 --> 3:52:32.280]  number one the more popular the more famous she gets
[3:52:32.280 --> 3:52:35.640]  the more protected she is she's almost to the point of
[3:52:35.640 --> 3:52:40.040]  almost untouchable she's not going to experience an involuntary suicide
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:43.560]  hopefully right so that's good scott adams has
[3:52:43.560 --> 3:52:46.920]  done that for himself also they're they're almost to the point of
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:49.720]  enough people know so they're kind of untouchable but she dedicates this book
[3:52:49.720 --> 3:52:55.000]  to seth rich why to influence people like us people
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.560]  that may be more libertarian people that may be more
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:53:02.360]  a conservative people that may be more level-headed about certain issues and
[3:53:02.360 --> 3:53:05.320]  may have been in touch with the seth rich issue
[3:53:05.320 --> 3:53:09.800]  to persuade you to go donna brazil is not so bad
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:14.200]  donna brazil wants to sell books that's why she wants to persuade you to like
[3:53:14.200 --> 3:53:20.760]  her number one donna brazil wants to i'm sure be
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:23.560]  elected to something after this because at some point
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:27.800]  donna's going to have to make some money after this book what's she going to do
[3:53:27.800 --> 3:53:33.160]  so thing number one is she's got to sell books it isn't like brain force where
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:37.320]  the team at info wars went wait a minute we're losing advertisers because
[3:53:37.320 --> 3:53:40.840]  they're threatening us and media matters is coming after us well we got to sell
[3:53:40.840 --> 3:53:43.960]  our own stuff so that we can pay for all this
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:50.040]  it's the reverse donna went okay i got to sell books my publisher
[3:53:50.040 --> 3:53:54.760]  hatchet books wants me to sell books they know how to sell books
[3:53:54.760 --> 3:53:57.640]  they probably sat her down with a pr expert and said all right well here's
[3:53:57.640 --> 3:53:59.640]  why you're going to do it here's what you're going to do we're going to get
[3:53:59.640 --> 3:54:03.640]  you in all this media and now both the left and the right are covering it
[3:54:03.640 --> 3:54:06.200]  the left is covering it because they're going to defend
[3:54:06.200 --> 3:54:09.560]  hillary they're going to defend against what donna's saying
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:13.720]  so now she's the bad girl for the democrats
[3:54:13.720 --> 3:54:17.080]  she's on the outs but not really but she's a maverick
[3:54:17.080 --> 3:54:21.960]  in the liberal democratic party she's pacing and leading i think as scott
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:27.480]  adams would say in a way again i'm no persuasion expert
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:32.040]  now the republicans and the libertarians are looking at donna brazil and
[3:54:32.040 --> 3:54:36.200]  they're going and you know kim.com is going yeah donna's
[3:54:36.200 --> 3:54:40.520]  with us on the seth rich thing all right
[3:54:40.520 --> 3:54:45.400]  so now she's building a following that's what everybody's got to do
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:48.520]  in this day and age that's what they're all doing that's what they're using
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:52.120]  the twitter for and the facebook for in the internet ghettos
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:55.240]  they're all trying to build a following and that's why comey changed his uh
[3:54:55.240 --> 3:55:01.240]  his his his name on twitter today he's now at comey
[3:55:01.240 --> 3:55:05.800]  why because man he's going to sell books later he's going to sell uh
[3:55:05.800 --> 3:55:08.920]  he's probably going to be with brian williams talking about how they were in
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:14.360]  uh in vietnam together storing the beaches in normandy before that
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:17.800]  and then and then you know there'll be pictures of them in the old west
[3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:21.800]  like back to the future be like remember when we did that yeah that was good
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:25.800]  that's what comey's got to do now he's got to build a following and sell stuff
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:31.080]  that's his way that's what donna's doing maybe she's not all bad
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:34.600]  but that's what happens that's why there's that thing about
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:37.720]  you know not having false idols because you build people up too much and go
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:41.720]  like oh yeah she's she's uh she's dedicating the book to seth rich well
[3:55:41.720 --> 3:55:45.160]  why is she doing that because she's no she knows there's a bunch of people out
[3:55:45.160 --> 3:55:48.600]  there that have been truth seekers that are going
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:51.560]  why aren't you talking about seth rich news why aren't you talking about seth
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:53.800]  rich why did hanity stop talking about seth rich
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:58.760]  what about seth rich now it's being talked about which is great
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:03.560]  except they're kind of talking about donna brazil more
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:08.440]  just like we're talking about guns more and it isn't isn't it convenient
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:12.200]  how the conversation again today is going to be about
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:15.800]  whether or not we should have guns or not
[3:56:15.800 --> 3:56:18.680]  whether or not that should be legal whether or not there should be background
[3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:22.760]  checks or whether or not there's loopholes like this concept of
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:26.040]  stopping good law abiding citizens from having guns
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:28.760]  so that the bad guys who are always going to break the law are always going
[3:56:28.760 --> 3:56:31.320]  to be armed and then you're going to be helpless
[3:56:31.320 --> 3:56:34.200]  and your your police are going to be paralyzed because they don't want to be
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:37.640]  sued by the family they're they're not going to they're not going to rush to
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:40.760]  protect not because they don't want to not because they're
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:45.160]  not good people but they have families too
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:48.680]  but that's what everyone's going to be talking about now the conversation will
[3:56:48.680 --> 3:56:51.160]  be about guns it won't be about seth rich so much
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:55.640]  donna brazil is going to do the media rounds and guess what since she was
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:57:00.120]  since since she's been coached up by her pr firm since she's been coached up

[3:57:05.080 --> 3:57:08.680]  on fox she'll be all over should be on both sides
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:13.640]  when's the last time you saw like alex jones on both sides of the media
