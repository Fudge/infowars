[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:11.800 --> 00:28.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:28.000 --> 00:39.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 19th day of May 2013.
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.680]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next two hours as we are
[00:43.680 --> 00:48.360]  every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[00:48.360 --> 00:55.400]  Okay, obviously, there's a lot of new developments in the last day and a half since Friday.
[00:55.400 --> 01:00.840]  On the whole IRS scandal, Benghazi gate that IRS is serving as a distraction from.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.000]  More and more, that's clear.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.240]  The White House even basically admits that in their own arrogant way.
[01:06.240 --> 01:11.720]  We've got the spying on the reporters illegally and on the congressional cloakroom.
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.520]  I mean, it's all of this directly out of an authoritarian nightmare.
[01:17.520 --> 01:22.240]  And then I've also got some points I want to make about Angelina Jolie having a double
[01:22.240 --> 01:23.240]  mastectomy.
[01:23.240 --> 01:29.720]  I don't believe her herself is consciously involved in big pharma trying to get $4,000
[01:29.720 --> 01:33.900]  per woman through Obamacare to have this gene typing done.
[01:33.900 --> 01:35.880]  But the big companies are certainly using it now.
[01:35.880 --> 01:43.080]  A bunch of women are lining up sympathetically out of fear or out of rock stardom to mutilate
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.520]  themselves like this.
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.120]  I know it's a tough decision for anybody beyond tough.
[01:47.120 --> 01:58.800]  But this is becoming just a systematic idea that, hey, we're not gonna ask why breast
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.720]  cancer is skyrocketing.
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.480]  We're just gonna say, hey, let's have women, all women, remove their breast.
[02:04.480 --> 02:07.760]  It'd be like saying people are having brain cancer.
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.880]  So let's just remove everybody's brain preemptively or colon cancer skyrocketing.
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.080]  Let's remove colons preemptively.
[02:15.080 --> 02:16.480]  Everyone has genetic markers.
[02:16.480 --> 02:19.840]  Some are more predisposed, that's true.
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.360]  But it's predisposed genetically in certain chemical and biological environments.
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.320]  We all have the same genetic lines have already always been there.
[02:30.320 --> 02:36.440]  They vary person to person, family to family, group to group, sub race, but there's really
[02:36.440 --> 02:42.800]  just one human race, sub derivations, Anglo, Asian, the list goes on and on.
[02:42.800 --> 02:48.640]  Native groups are more predisposed, Native American groups, which are really land bridge
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.380]  crossing Asian groups are more predisposed for pancreas type issues.
[02:53.380 --> 03:05.520]  But the issue here is this is being driven by the environment, not by the nature.
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.680]  It's being done by the nurture or the anti-nurture.
[03:09.680 --> 03:16.320]  Because the same genetic lines were there, the same genetic lines were there, the same
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.440]  pre-markers were there, but why is it now all increasing?
[03:22.440 --> 03:30.160]  Well, we know it's the cocktail of chemicals and biologicals that we are hammered with.
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.760]  And they're gonna have a job on their hands regardless of what happens to me.
[03:36.760 --> 03:40.700]  They're gonna have a job on their hands because of myself and millions of others that understand
[03:40.700 --> 03:45.880]  the eugenics agenda as we go from one in 25,000 with autism to 150 something.
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.960]  As we go from one out of a couple hundred with some type of psychological disorder to
[03:49.960 --> 03:53.840]  now one out of five, have statistics on that today.
[03:53.840 --> 04:02.200]  As we go from diabetes being one in maybe 150 something years ago, to now three out
[04:02.200 --> 04:11.380]  of ten or pre-diabetic being five out of ten in some Hispanic communities.
[04:11.380 --> 04:17.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a holocaust going on and the system knows what's happening,
[04:17.680 --> 04:20.840]  even if they're not behind it, which they're behind a lot of it.
[04:20.840 --> 04:25.600]  They write books about it, bragging about spiking our water with things and sterilizing
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.360]  us and our useless eaters.
[04:28.360 --> 04:29.360]  So that's going on.
[04:29.360 --> 04:36.040]  Regardless, they know, they know and they're taking precautions of purifying water, non-GMO,
[04:36.040 --> 04:38.920]  not taking vaccines and that comes out in the news.
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.240]  The establishment globalists are staying off all this stuff.
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.520]  So that's coming up as well.
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.560]  We've got David Knight in here and we're gonna go over some clips of the Friday hearings
[04:47.560 --> 04:50.760]  with the IRS, it's a bombshell.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.800]  And we're gonna get into Michael Moore and others basically saying it's treason to question
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.800]  government.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.800]  It's all coming up today.
[04:57.800 --> 04:59.680]  Stay with us.
[04:59.680 --> 05:05.280]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[05:05.280 --> 05:09.880]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support
[05:09.880 --> 05:12.280]  your immune system.
[05:12.280 --> 05:16.400]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to
[05:16.400 --> 05:21.880]  be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver and is powerful
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.260]  enough to help protect you and your family.
[05:25.260 --> 05:29.760]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective, and perfect for everyday
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.160]  use inside the body as well as out.
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.240]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[05:36.240 --> 05:42.000]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.040]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.180]  system support.

[06:06.920 --> 06:15.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[06:15.640 --> 06:32.600]  Rallying patriots worldwide, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:32.600 --> 06:39.920]  Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm Central Standard Time.
[06:39.920 --> 06:45.000]  We are here live, ladies and gentlemen, and then of course we come back Sundays and we
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.080]  are live right now, 4 to 6pm Central Standard Time.
[06:49.080 --> 06:55.360]  It is 4.06 and 27 seconds on the 19th day of May, 2013.
[06:55.360 --> 06:58.320]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:58.320 --> 07:02.320]  All right, here's what's coming up today.
[07:02.320 --> 07:07.280]  We've got Info Wars Nightly News and Info Wars Radio reporter David Knight coming in
[07:07.280 --> 07:13.480]  with a bunch of clips, really powerful stuff and heartening information from the IRS hearings
[07:13.480 --> 07:20.520]  on Friday where some Congress people are actually doing their jobs and saying, look, don't tell
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.680]  us these are mistakes.
[07:21.680 --> 07:26.880]  You did this on purpose and you go around without due process taking people's bank accounts
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.160]  in their homes if they, quote, make mistakes.
[07:30.160 --> 07:31.200]  It's not mistakes.
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.520]  The IRS is the private collection agency for the private Federal Reserve with governmental
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.520]  power.
[07:36.520 --> 07:40.320]  It is a manifest fraud and part of the occupation of this country.
[07:40.320 --> 07:41.320]  That's just a fact.
[07:41.320 --> 07:42.880]  So that is coming up.
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.200]  Also, I was traumatized by this on Friday and didn't get to the meat of it, but I will
[07:47.200 --> 07:48.200]  today.
[07:48.200 --> 07:49.920]  I've talked about it for almost an hour.
[07:49.920 --> 07:55.960]  Military says no presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances.
[07:55.960 --> 08:00.960]  Those that don't know about common sense or common history or the Constitution were like,
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.920]  well, what's the big deal?
[08:02.920 --> 08:06.240]  Military doesn't need the president's authorization to operate domestically.
[08:06.240 --> 08:11.240]  I mean, what an incredible statement, but they already say our military is under NATO
[08:11.240 --> 08:14.720]  control, so I guess that's what Congress has been told.
[08:14.720 --> 08:18.160]  They of course control the military and the purse strings.
[08:18.160 --> 08:24.560]  We're in very perilous times where just bombshell things are announced, bombshell things are
[08:24.560 --> 08:30.280]  done and it's put out there like it's no big deal.
[08:30.280 --> 08:34.880]  My father Friday texted me and he said, I'm listening to local radio.
[08:34.880 --> 08:38.960]  That show that attacks you whenever I listen and they're admitting that tyranny's here
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.840]  and they can't believe it and my gosh, they never thought it could be true.
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.440]  And I called my dad back and I said, yeah, but if I called in, they would make fun of
[08:49.440 --> 08:50.520]  me.
[08:50.520 --> 08:57.120]  Because that's a mantle of manliness in America, is to deny things and laugh at people that
[08:57.120 --> 08:58.680]  are right.
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.520]  And then see, folks that are even criticizing tyranny like Piers Morgan nationally is now
[09:03.520 --> 09:06.600]  saying, we are seeing some tyranny out of Obama.
[09:06.600 --> 09:07.600]  I don't like it.
[09:07.600 --> 09:08.920]  We're gonna play a clip of that.
[09:08.920 --> 09:15.200]  They're doing it because the people are waking up.
[09:15.200 --> 09:17.440]  That's why they're doing it.
[09:17.440 --> 09:20.960]  But I have been in public quite a bit.
[09:20.960 --> 09:28.120]  I went to a music recital that my daughters were in that had about looked like a couple
[09:28.120 --> 09:36.360]  thousand people at it today at the School for the Deaf as it's called.
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.820]  Still has the politically incorrect name, horrible.
[09:39.820 --> 09:42.440]  But my daughters are not hearing impaired.
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.280]  That's why they had a big auditorium and they were having it.
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.920]  And all four security guards are, I think they were police that I ran into or were avid
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.280]  listeners and they said, yeah, well, I'm not gonna say what they said.
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.640]  But the point is, is that that's what I encounter everywhere.
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.920]  At the park, at Barton Springs, at the mall, in a grocery store, in a parking lot.
[10:05.920 --> 10:12.720]  And again, I'm just one guy, so that's a radar sonar ping that people are waking up.
[10:12.720 --> 10:15.840]  And there are a lot of talk shows that have talked about tyranny before, but they're really
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.880]  starting to get it.
[10:16.880 --> 10:22.600]  So I've had my ear to the ground and I'm noticing the biggest tipping point right at the edge
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.600]  of it I've ever seen.
[10:26.600 --> 10:31.200]  And I have to make the realization to myself and then say it on air before I get into all
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.400]  this news so that people understand how powerful you are.
[10:35.400 --> 10:38.800]  You are the reason this radio show has been so successful.
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.040]  You resonating with our information, doing your own research, taking action, warning
[10:43.040 --> 10:46.400]  others, spreading the word about liberty and about threats to freedom.
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.200]  You have the power.
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.080]  If I can go anywhere in the world now and walk down the street and run into listeners
[10:53.080 --> 10:55.160]  everywhere.
[10:55.160 --> 10:59.920]  And if I go into a restaurant and there's a group of military and they run over and
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.440]  say, 40% of us are awake or half of us are awake and the others are waking up now, we're
[11:04.440 --> 11:06.360]  ready.
[11:06.360 --> 11:09.120]  And they're sophisticated and they know what's going on.
[11:09.120 --> 11:11.160]  What does that tell you about the new world order?
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.520]  See, you feel like you're alone because you are not Ron Paul.
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.480]  You are not an Alex Jones.
[11:19.480 --> 11:25.200]  You do not get to see what's happening and if you'll start speaking out more and if you'll
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.840]  start wearing the banner of liberty more openly, you will realize the power you've got.
[11:31.840 --> 11:40.360]  And that if we just continue to wake up others, all our job is, I was jogging, if you can
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.400]  call it that, around the hike and bike trail last night at about eight o'clock.
[11:44.400 --> 11:49.200]  And I was, sunglasses on, even though it was getting dark, some of you noticed, ball cap,
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.200]  all of it.
[11:50.200 --> 11:58.360]  And I probably had, let's not exaggerate, it wasn't even very crowded, maybe 15 people
[11:58.360 --> 12:05.080]  stopped me just recognizing, I guess, the line of my face and shoulders.
[12:05.080 --> 12:08.640]  And I would try to stop and say, okay, hey, thank you, but they would say, three or four
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.760]  of them said, you made me wake up, you made me think, you made me get outside the box,
[12:13.760 --> 12:14.760]  stuff like that.
[12:14.760 --> 12:16.960]  And I would say, that's good, cuz I don't have all the answers.
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.000]  Just be more reflective, do more research, look at the world more, study things, and
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.760]  it'll all come clear to you.
[12:26.760 --> 12:32.920]  And that's really the good message that I've got to everybody out there, is that the reason
[12:32.920 --> 12:37.360]  they haven't trumped up charges and put me in prison, the reason they haven't killed
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.480]  me is, number one, God, I know God with providence smiles upon those who stand up against overwhelming
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.240]  odds and evil, that's always happened in history.
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.560]  But also it's because a lot of people in the system are awake and just feel powerless and
[12:49.560 --> 12:53.080]  don't know what to do because it's so big.
[12:53.080 --> 13:00.080]  But also because the more evil people in the system realize, if you go back over my compendium
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.120]  of work, if you cut away the fat and the gristle, and there's plenty of that there, nobody's
[13:06.120 --> 13:07.120]  perfect.
[13:07.120 --> 13:13.240]  We have a great body of work, so there's certainly some tripping and falling and stumbling in
[13:13.240 --> 13:14.280]  that work.
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.440]  But it's been done from a place of love and history and research and trying to do the
[13:18.440 --> 13:19.440]  best job.
[13:19.440 --> 13:21.600]  That's why it's been such a formidable weapon against the globalists.
[13:21.600 --> 13:30.080]  I'm just giving you a status report here, but the establishment, the social engineers
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.000]  know when they hear this show and know when they study it, they know within the compendium,
[13:36.000 --> 13:46.480]  within the body of work, within the volumes, the voluminous volumes of datum is the real
[13:46.480 --> 13:50.800]  essence of what's being constructed and what's being built by them.
[13:50.800 --> 13:54.720]  And the show itself is a think tank because they're constantly in think tank meetings
[13:54.720 --> 13:57.400]  trying to gauge and control and dominate.
[13:57.400 --> 14:02.960]  They're not in full control, so it's hard for even their greater minds to study the
[14:02.960 --> 14:12.720]  larger cut and weave of this garment because it is a patchwork but built from a position
[14:12.720 --> 14:19.960]  of dominance and corruption and selfishness built by many generations of evil.
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.560]  With good over many generations struggling against it, the world is not just full of
[14:25.560 --> 14:26.560]  evil, it's full of good.
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.440]  If there's more good than evil, the frustration is that good, people are like children, not
[14:32.440 --> 14:39.800]  even so much stupid as they are innocent and childlike, laughing and giggling and running
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.880]  through the world.
[14:42.880 --> 14:46.700]  And that's where my real frustration comes because I don't just know the enemy's program
[14:46.700 --> 14:49.880]  from studying them, they brag about what they're doing.
[14:49.880 --> 14:54.480]  Their great downfall is that they operate as if everyone is completely lobotomized when
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.760]  in truth the public is in a near transmedical state.
[14:58.760 --> 15:04.400]  You can look this up, brainwaves have lowered, IQs have lowered in the Western world, sperm
[15:04.400 --> 15:06.760]  counts have lowered, genetics have plunged.
[15:06.760 --> 15:12.080]  I've got a stack of news today about diabetes, cancer, everything else just shooting straight
[15:12.080 --> 15:13.080]  up.
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.480]  But there's no discussion of why is it shooting up, that's the great taboo.
[15:17.480 --> 15:24.360]  The discussion is how to give centralized groups involved in the eugenics depopulation
[15:24.360 --> 15:32.320]  program to give them all of the funding.
[15:32.320 --> 15:38.060]  To never speak why is it increasing, be like if doctors had hundreds of people coming into
[15:38.060 --> 15:41.080]  a city every day with gunshot wounds, never asking who shot them.
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.640]  So I'm gonna try to cover news, we come back into some clips.
[15:45.640 --> 15:52.200]  It's just that that's why we're still here, because there is good and evil in the world.
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.280]  Evil is not all powerful, they're just men and women as well, and there are even more
[15:57.280 --> 16:00.680]  important great truths.
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.560]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.160]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.880]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[16:13.880 --> 16:20.000]  Check out SimpliSafe, it's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.280]  Go to getsimplisafe.com.
[16:23.280 --> 16:25.440]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.860]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[16:29.860 --> 16:34.640]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer,
[16:34.640 --> 16:36.600]  storage unit, or shed.
[16:36.600 --> 16:39.360]  Getsimplisafe.com.
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.800]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's
[16:43.800 --> 16:46.200]  no need to let a stranger into your home.
[16:46.200 --> 16:49.920]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.240]  You aren't always at home, but SimpliSafe will stand guard, protecting your property
[16:54.240 --> 16:57.120]  24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.000]  Again, that's getsimplisafe.com.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.300]  There's been a disaster, and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[17:05.300 --> 17:09.020]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[17:09.020 --> 17:14.100]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[17:14.100 --> 17:19.200]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.200]  afford it.
[17:20.200 --> 17:25.180]  But we have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[17:25.180 --> 17:27.000]  without even a fight.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.200]  Government regulation.
[17:28.200 --> 17:34.440]  After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself uncharitable Mormon food
[17:34.440 --> 17:39.840]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[17:39.840 --> 17:41.160]  regulations.
[17:41.160 --> 17:43.680]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[17:43.680 --> 17:47.320]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[17:47.320 --> 17:53.360]  Call 800-409-5633, or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[17:53.360 --> 17:59.800]  That's 800-409-5633, or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[17:59.800 --> 18:05.000]  Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.120]  real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and

[18:28.160 --> 18:29.760]  all your cleaning needs.
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.300]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.

[18:38.000 --> 18:45.120]  Call 1-800-340-7091, or visit www.5starsoap.com.
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.960]  Alex and his staff have used these earth-friendly pure soaps for years.
[18:49.960 --> 19:00.360]  See them on the web, www.5starsoap.com, or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.960]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[19:05.960 --> 19:10.560]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support
[19:10.560 --> 19:11.960]  your immune system.
[19:11.960 --> 19:17.080]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to
[19:17.080 --> 19:22.560]  be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver and is powerful
[19:22.560 --> 19:25.960]  enough to help protect you and your family.
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.440]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective, and perfect for everyday
[19:30.440 --> 19:32.840]  use inside the body as well as out.
[19:32.840 --> 19:37.280]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[19:37.280 --> 19:42.680]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.200]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune
[19:47.200 --> 19:48.200]  system support.

[20:01.440 --> 20:04.920]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.920 --> 20:15.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:15.880 --> 20:37.360]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'll see you in the next video.
[20:37.360 --> 20:54.600]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
[21:07.360 --> 21:13.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[21:13.960 --> 21:19.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[21:19.360 --> 21:21.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[21:21.640 --> 21:23.520]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[21:23.520 --> 21:24.520]  We are alive.
[21:24.520 --> 21:25.520]  We are conscious.
[21:25.520 --> 21:30.160]  We're not sleeping as the globalists just go about their business taking over the planet
[21:30.160 --> 21:33.860]  and trying to dumb everyone down so it's more easily managed.
[21:33.860 --> 21:37.440]  We believe that is a crime against humanity.
[21:37.440 --> 21:44.240]  Both of us that love freedom and human dignity and who are not so weirdly competitive that
[21:44.240 --> 21:46.980]  we seek to destroy our fellow humans.
[21:46.980 --> 21:55.520]  We wish to see humans empowered to the greatest level possible in our destiny, not destroyed.
[21:55.520 --> 22:00.100]  And just to finish up, the reason I was getting into the awakening that's happening is that
[22:00.100 --> 22:05.960]  there is hope and if you will face the tyranny, then we have a chance to recognize what is
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.160]  bad and we have a chance to reverse it.
[22:10.160 --> 22:12.060]  But here's what blows me away.
[22:12.060 --> 22:21.680]  If you think the IRS harassing and persecuting pro-life groups, Tea Party groups, libertarian
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.420]  groups, Christian groups, we're gonna cover this in detail in the next segment with one
[22:26.420 --> 22:29.280]  of our reporters in studio.
[22:29.280 --> 22:37.560]  If you think that's bad, that's nothing compared to what is really going on and what is in
[22:37.560 --> 22:42.320]  the back of the newspaper because so much of this stuff is actually available and even
[22:42.320 --> 22:51.100]  admitted in mainstream media, but they put it in the paper or online just buried in headlines.
[22:51.100 --> 22:55.980]  Three years ago when the attack on Libya started covertly, it was in foreign press that our
[22:55.980 --> 23:00.780]  government in NATO was funding Al-Qaeda, bringing him into Benghazi and that that's why Hosni
[23:00.780 --> 23:02.780]  Mubarak was taken out of office.
[23:02.780 --> 23:06.860]  Because even though he'd been a Western dictator, he said, I'm not gonna put Al-Qaeda in charge
[23:06.860 --> 23:09.980]  of Libya, my neighbor, I'm not gonna help you.
[23:09.980 --> 23:13.820]  Well bye-bye Hosni Mubarak.
[23:13.820 --> 23:18.160]  Well look at the, again, London Telegraph today, it's also in Reuters.
[23:18.160 --> 23:23.540]  Al-Qaeda's Syrian wing takes over the oil fields once belonging to Assad and the article
[23:23.540 --> 23:32.220]  goes on to say Al-Qaeda is now the main force in Syria run by NATO and that Israel is now
[23:32.220 --> 23:36.900]  saying that if there's any more resistance against them, they'll basically intensify
[23:36.900 --> 23:39.580]  bombing.
[23:39.580 --> 23:43.880]  Syria has done nothing, that is Twilight Zone.
[23:43.880 --> 23:48.260]  But notice it's now mainstream news, they even had one of the deputy Mossad chiefs go
[23:48.260 --> 23:55.720]  public a few days ago and say it's a horrible idea to put Al-Qaeda in charge of Syria.
[23:55.720 --> 23:58.640]  Now remember, when you go to the airport, folks, they're gonna wanna go in your wife's
[23:58.640 --> 24:02.860]  underwear to find bin Laden while they run it.
[24:02.860 --> 24:07.200]  And again, this isn't our whole government, when I say 9-11's an inside job or Benghazi's
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.180]  an inside job, it means criminal elements are working with the most hardcore radical
[24:12.180 --> 24:14.400]  Muslim extremists out there.
[24:14.400 --> 24:17.640]  And that's why they're so scared of this show, they go, you say that George Bush had the
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.520]  plunger like Wile E. Coyote, no, that's not what I'm saying, George Bush couldn't even
[24:22.520 --> 24:24.920]  read off a teleprompter.
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.360]  But criminal globalist multinational elements that have taken over our government, that's
[24:29.360 --> 24:33.100]  what's happened, we're under a globalist soft coup.
[24:33.100 --> 24:39.940]  And now it's gotten to the point where they told Congress three times last year that NATO
[24:39.940 --> 24:43.100]  is what gives them orders and the President orders, not Congress.
[24:43.100 --> 24:47.820]  And if you know the Constitution, Bill of Rights history, folks, that's treason, that's
[24:47.820 --> 24:49.460]  real treason.
[24:49.460 --> 24:54.000]  And so it's so frustrating to hear people going, they were auditing tea parties?
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.440]  That's horrible, impeach them, I guess Alex Jones has been right.
[24:58.440 --> 25:00.920]  Folks, that is nothing, we're gonna cover this.
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.080]  Look, Obama scoffs at Libya outcry, but vows to act on IRS audit, New York Times, yeah.
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.360]  He wants you to go after that, as bad as it is, because folks, Libya, there were hundreds
[25:12.360 --> 25:16.580]  of US military in those NATO situation rooms and on those aircraft carriers that saw the
[25:16.580 --> 25:21.880]  two drones and the other aircraft and saw the whole six to eight hour event go on there
[25:21.880 --> 25:23.640]  and saw the stand down.
[25:23.640 --> 25:26.580]  Now they're saying, what does it matter where Obama was that night?
[25:26.580 --> 25:27.580]  What does it matter?
[25:27.580 --> 25:32.080]  I've got White House spokesman on ABC, we're gonna play the clip coming up going, show
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.880]  one of the law was broken with IRS, that doesn't matter.
[25:35.880 --> 25:39.840]  Hillary Clinton, but why does it matter who killed the ambassador?
[25:39.840 --> 25:41.200]  Why does it matter?
[25:41.200 --> 25:43.120]  What difference does it make?
[25:43.120 --> 25:46.400]  What difference at this point does it make?
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.520]  Absolutely, what difference at this point does it make?
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.300]  I mean, next time a cop pulls me over for going 80 miles an hour, I'll go, what difference
[25:55.300 --> 25:56.680]  does it make that I'm speeding?
[25:56.680 --> 26:02.120]  Get about your business, or let's say you kill your wife, folks.
[26:02.120 --> 26:05.480]  You beat her over the head with a baseball bat, cops show up, there's blood everywhere,
[26:05.480 --> 26:06.480]  and they go, who killed her?
[26:06.480 --> 26:09.320]  What difference does it make?
[26:09.320 --> 26:12.840]  Whoever of a cop shoots some innocent person, how about the cop just says, hey, whatever
[26:12.840 --> 26:13.840]  does it make?
[26:13.840 --> 26:20.400]  I mean, this is ridiculous, and this is their new comeback.
[26:20.400 --> 26:22.460]  What difference does it make if the law was broken?
[26:22.460 --> 26:26.520]  What difference does it make if we got caught shipping guns into Mexico in Fast and Furious?
[26:26.520 --> 26:27.540]  What difference does it make?
[26:27.540 --> 26:30.920]  What difference does it make?
[26:30.920 --> 26:35.000]  And the only thing holding back justice is the Republicans know that if they bring real
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.860]  justice, the Democrats will fire back with all the skeletons they know about.
[26:38.860 --> 26:42.920]  And there'll be a full-on war within the two wings of the corrupt system.
[26:42.920 --> 26:49.840]  So they have a lot of reasons in the Republican leadership to not let this go where it should.
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.560]  But let me tell you something, this could get pushed out all the way, and it won't matter
[26:53.560 --> 26:55.320]  what the Republican leadership tries.
[26:55.320 --> 26:58.560]  Because of the good Tea Party people that are taking over the Republican Party that
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.460]  both the Democratic Party and Republican leadership has been demonizing and attacking, there's
[27:02.460 --> 27:04.200]  some really good people in there, folks.
[27:04.200 --> 27:05.200]  I know a lot of them.
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.920]  In fact, a lot of them behind the scenes, I talk to, who are scared to come on this
[27:09.920 --> 27:10.920]  show.
[27:10.920 --> 27:12.400]  And I don't even really need them on my show, so why do I care?
[27:12.400 --> 27:13.520]  They listen to my show.
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.460]  They get my talking points from research, not made-up garbage.
[27:18.460 --> 27:21.520]  And so I don't even try to get a lot of these congressmen and senators on, but I know they're
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.520]  listening.
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.200]  I know they're listening right now, because I talk to them.
[27:26.200 --> 27:28.580]  And they care about their grandkids and their children.
[27:28.580 --> 27:32.480]  And they know I'm telling the truth, and they're smart enough to know history.
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.880]  This thing will destroy all the prosperity and will destroy this country.
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.240]  It either stops now, folks, or there's no turning the corruption back.
[27:39.240 --> 27:44.080]  You're either an anti-corruption system, which you're always battling it, but you keep it
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.080]  small.
[27:45.080 --> 27:48.800]  Or you give into it, folks, in your North Korea, your Mexico.
[27:48.800 --> 27:51.200]  And I'm not putting down North Korea and Mexico.
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.560]  Most countries in history are run by horrible tyrants, because people give into it, and
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.680]  then the sky's the limit.
[27:59.680 --> 28:06.400]  Now David Knight is gonna be in here in the next two segments getting into the IRS scandal.
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.960]  And then when I start the next hour, I will get to some really amazing clips, some really
[28:11.960 --> 28:14.600]  incredible clips.
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.640]  One of them is, which we've already played, but it dovetails with this Obama saying, you
[28:18.640 --> 28:20.060]  shouldn't worry about tyranny.
[28:20.060 --> 28:23.140]  That's diametrically opposed what the founding fathers said.
[28:23.140 --> 28:26.720]  And then we're gonna dovetail that with Bill Maher Friday night, with Michael Moore saying
[28:26.720 --> 28:30.800]  it's treason to not do what the president wants, to block him.
[28:30.800 --> 28:31.800]  I'm not kidding.
[28:31.800 --> 28:34.240]  Of course, that's the opposite of treason.
[28:34.240 --> 28:37.120]  That separation of powers is what we're supposed to have, checks and balances.
[28:37.120 --> 28:43.260]  And then they go further to say, basically admit they're gonna get all our guns.
[28:43.260 --> 28:47.360]  And that video's up on infoawards.com and prisonplanet.com.
[28:47.360 --> 28:50.180]  But Piers Morgan now says he's worried about tyranny.
[28:50.180 --> 28:52.920]  He's not doing that because he cares.
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.440]  He is a tyrant, I know him.
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.820]  I've looked into his soul.
[28:57.820 --> 29:00.240]  He's doing it because he knows liberty is popular.
[29:00.240 --> 29:05.240]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[29:05.240 --> 29:07.600]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.400]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.580]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[29:16.580 --> 29:22.140]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[29:22.140 --> 29:25.320]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[29:25.320 --> 29:31.640]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.800]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[29:35.800 --> 29:39.600]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[30:59.840 --> 31:02.920]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[31:02.920 --> 31:07.960]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[31:07.960 --> 31:14.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[33:27.480 --> 33:36.680]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.680 --> 33:41.520]  All right for the balance of the hour, Infowars.com reporter David Knight is going to be with
[33:41.520 --> 33:47.400]  us getting deep into the IRS scandal, playing some clips from the latest hearings on Friday
[33:47.400 --> 33:54.240]  dealing with the persecution of Christians and Tea Party people and Libertarians and
[33:54.240 --> 33:56.600]  pro-gun groups by the IRS.
[33:56.600 --> 34:02.880]  Now the essence of tyranny is government doing something or ordering something that violates
[34:02.880 --> 34:05.680]  common law, common sense.
[34:05.680 --> 34:10.720]  And the tell-tale sign of tyranny is when it's an unjust weight and balance, when not
[34:10.720 --> 34:16.040]  only are they oppressing you but then groups affiliated with them are exempt.
[34:16.040 --> 34:18.840]  It's now in the Associated Press, it's now in mainstream news, we're going to be getting
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.240]  to it, where at the orders of Planned Parenthood, which is really Rockefeller Foundation, that's
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.720]  the real government, they said, go shut down these anti-abortion groups.
[34:30.720 --> 34:38.200]  And I've got headlines here, IRS demanded info on pro-life groups' prayers, that's beyond
[34:38.200 --> 34:40.000]  North Korea.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.560]  And I heard talk show hosts on Friday going, well maybe that's reasonable, maybe you shouldn't
[34:43.560 --> 34:47.360]  pray a prayer against corrupt government, a violation of the First Amendment.
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.000]  The First Amendment says the government has no jurisdiction in your religion, it's been
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  turned around backwards but they use your ignorance.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.960]  Here's another one, IRS Commissioner Stonewall's on praying and prying into pro-life groups'
[34:58.960 --> 34:59.960]  prayers.
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.680]  IRS to pro-life groups, you know you're going to have to give up this whole protest thing,
[35:05.680 --> 35:06.680]  right?
[35:06.680 --> 35:12.320]  Telling churches, you can't go out and protest against whatever it is your religion or your
[35:12.320 --> 35:14.640]  belief says is wrong.
[35:14.640 --> 35:18.940]  This is pure authoritarianism, but as long as you put a peace prize on it, bomb and kill
[35:18.940 --> 35:19.960]  whoever you want.
[35:19.960 --> 35:24.160]  As long as you ban free speech, but hey, it's a black guy, he's liberal.
[35:24.160 --> 35:27.280]  That's why the establishment, the globalists, the foreign banks that have taken over this
[35:27.280 --> 35:28.720]  country put Obama in.
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.040]  As a cynical joke, folks, I'm telling you, if Hitler would have worn a pink uniform,
[35:34.040 --> 35:35.640]  he could have killed the entire planet.
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.280]  People would have given their children to him to kill if he wore a pink uniform.
[35:39.280 --> 35:46.060]  I mean, it's all about the surface of things, and this is the insanity of this.
[35:46.060 --> 35:51.200]  And this IRS thing has really finally clicked with people, but here's the issue.
[35:51.200 --> 35:54.500]  What you're even hearing in the news isn't one-tenth of it.
[35:54.500 --> 35:58.220]  Churches all over America are given letters by the IRS that we've shown and covered where
[35:58.220 --> 36:02.720]  they say, if you go on a picnic with the church, tell people don't talk about politics there.
[36:02.720 --> 36:04.820]  I mean, folks, you have a First Amendment.
[36:04.820 --> 36:06.800]  Your preacher can say whatever they want.
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.360]  This country was founded by the black brigades, the preachers.
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.400]  We sell books at infowarsstore.com like Romans 13, the true meaning of submission that breaks
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.400]  down there.
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.200]  It's all a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.440]  It was Christians that led the fight in the 1830s, 40s, 50s, 60s against slavery.
[36:25.440 --> 36:28.580]  And that was the law then, and they were against the law.
[36:28.580 --> 36:30.560]  And they went and were involved in civil disobedience.
[36:30.560 --> 36:33.640]  Some Christians, like John Brown, went around and killed people.
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.860]  Now, the issue here is, do you wanna be an American or not?
[36:37.860 --> 36:41.700]  Do you have an identity, or is it just football and acting tough?
[36:41.700 --> 36:45.900]  Because the identity of America is checks and balances.
[36:45.900 --> 36:51.120]  And the churches have become kept creatures of the government, like in the Soviet Union.
[36:51.120 --> 36:57.600]  With their 501c3, they're no longer churches, they are now tax-exempt charities.
[36:57.600 --> 36:58.920]  And that's how the trick was done.
[36:58.920 --> 37:03.560]  Churches, the government still has no regulatory power over, but they trick you.
[37:03.560 --> 37:06.720]  Oh, here's a paper, sign this, waiving your rights.
[37:06.720 --> 37:07.720]  So this is a big deal.
[37:07.720 --> 37:11.560]  And I wanna play this clip and then go to David Knight, because here's the question
[37:11.560 --> 37:15.640]  for everybody out there.
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.520]  Obama said just a few weeks ago, don't worry about tyranny, don't believe people that talk
[37:19.520 --> 37:20.920]  about that.
[37:20.920 --> 37:24.160]  And then you see the tyranny all around you, and we're at the critical juncture.
[37:24.160 --> 37:29.560]  Because if we don't recognize the tyranny now, when it's gotten so bad, and if we succumb
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.000]  to it, the sky's the limit.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.540]  So this is kinda the point where America's finally gotten so drunk on corruption, we
[37:34.540 --> 37:38.560]  may throw up and begin reversing where we're going.
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.320]  But if America drinks too much more moonshine or Everclear, we may die of tyranny poisoning,
[37:44.320 --> 37:45.440]  alcohol poisoning.
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.160]  We've reached that point, folks, where even the dumbest people, even the people that have
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.180]  sold themselves out to tyranny and made excuses are going, wow, that sounds like oppression.
[37:54.180 --> 38:01.380]  In Nazi Germany, it started in 1933, 34, 35, going after Christian groups that didn't support
[38:01.380 --> 38:03.440]  Hitler and Jewish groups and others.
[38:03.440 --> 38:06.280]  And people said, well, those are just those minorities, it's okay.
[38:06.280 --> 38:10.760]  And it started out with tax audits and shutting down their businesses.
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.880]  Folks, this is incredible political persecution.
[38:14.880 --> 38:19.160]  This is amazing, and of course, it was ordered from the highest levels, that's now coming
[38:19.160 --> 38:20.160]  out.
[38:20.160 --> 38:23.880]  David Knight, I wanna play this clip of Obama, and we're gonna get your report.
[38:23.880 --> 38:26.520]  We're gonna have a little bit in the next hour here.
[38:26.520 --> 38:31.240]  But here is Obama saying, don't worry about tyranny, because he knew the AP was already
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.580]  sitting on this story, and so were the Republican leadership that's now come out.
[38:35.580 --> 38:40.200]  That's now come out, they knew a year ago, because they're scared to go this direction.
[38:40.200 --> 38:43.200]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[38:43.200 --> 38:49.520]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.760]  more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.040]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.340]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[39:05.340 --> 39:06.340]  You should reject these voices.
[39:06.340 --> 39:07.880]  All right, that's enough.
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.980]  Next hour, I'm gonna play him saying gumming up the works, and then I have Bill Maher saying
[39:12.980 --> 39:15.480]  it's treason to not do what Obama wants.
[39:15.480 --> 39:19.280]  I mean, whoa, it is treason to not follow the Fuhrer.
[39:19.280 --> 39:26.400]  The Fuhrer will save Germany, but those opposing him are the reason that the Reich is in trouble.
[39:26.400 --> 39:28.400]  Hail Obama.
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.240]  You do not hail Obama, you will be arrested.
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.680]  David Knight, we're gonna break in about four minutes, but I mean, how much will we take?
[39:35.680 --> 39:36.680]  Well, that's a good question.
[39:36.680 --> 39:40.800]  Because for a long time, since the 1950s, as you mentioned, the IRS has been intimidating
[39:40.800 --> 39:43.960]  these different churches by turning them into tax exempt organizations.
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.560]  And there was a thing called the Johnson Admitment that was put in by Lyndon Johnson.
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.860]  And a few years ago, an organization called Alliance Defending Freedom started organizing
[39:52.860 --> 39:53.860]  some pastors.
[39:53.860 --> 39:55.520]  They only had a couple of dozen the first year.
[39:55.520 --> 40:00.560]  After about four years, just this most recent one, this fall, they had 1,500 pastors who
[40:00.560 --> 40:09.400]  basically recorded their sermon, which was explicitly endorsing a candidate, and taped
[40:09.400 --> 40:11.020]  it and sent it to the IRS.
[40:11.020 --> 40:12.240]  This is a growing rebellion.
[40:12.240 --> 40:16.440]  It was just only 500 the year before, and then within one year, it went from 500 to
[40:16.440 --> 40:17.440]  1,500.
[40:17.440 --> 40:18.520]  They are intimidating people.
[40:18.520 --> 40:21.080]  That's the way they've handled the churches for a long time.
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.960]  But this is reaching an all new level when you look at this intimidation of pro-life
[40:26.960 --> 40:27.960]  organizations.
[40:27.960 --> 40:29.200]  This testimony from Representative-
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.360]  They're now telling them we want to know your prayers, and you can't protest.
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.360]  That's right.
[40:33.360 --> 40:37.000]  This testimony from Representative Aaron Shockey had a document from the Thomas Moore Foundation,
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.680]  150-page report.
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.600]  And it documented the kinds of intimidation that the IRS was using against pro-life organizations.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.800]  And we've got a clip of that.
[40:44.800 --> 40:46.560]  I don't know if we're ready to play that.
[40:46.560 --> 40:49.240]  Sure, let's go ahead and play that clip in a moment.
[40:49.240 --> 40:52.040]  But I just want to go back to something here before we go to that.
[40:52.040 --> 40:58.440]  The First Amendment, the First Amendment that we're talking about here says, Congress shall
[40:58.440 --> 41:03.000]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  thereof.
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.720]  I mean, I don't agree with people chopping the heads off goats, or some groups running
[41:07.720 --> 41:12.080]  around on hallucinogens, but that's their right under their religion.
[41:12.080 --> 41:13.680]  Government has no jurisdiction there.
[41:13.680 --> 41:14.680]  That's right.
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.320]  The wall of separation was something that, a term that came up with Thomas Jefferson.
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.760]  He was reassuring the Danbury Baptist Church that the federal government was not going
[41:22.760 --> 41:24.760]  to be doing anything to their churches.
[41:24.760 --> 41:27.920]  So what he was saying is that there's a wall around the federal government.
[41:27.920 --> 41:30.660]  What they've done is they've put that wall around the churches.
[41:30.660 --> 41:34.360]  So the federal government is free to do anything it wants to, to intimidate anybody in any
[41:34.360 --> 41:35.640]  way they wish.
[41:35.640 --> 41:41.800]  And the churches now are operating inside a wall that gets, Washington said, the British
[41:41.800 --> 41:44.400]  people walk about freely, but it's between high walls.
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.440]  Well, those walls are getting higher and they're getting narrower all the time.
[41:48.440 --> 41:50.880]  And a lot of it is coming from IRS intimidation.
[41:50.880 --> 41:51.880]  Unbelievable.
[41:51.880 --> 41:56.280]  Let's go ahead and go to the representatives point from Friday.
[41:56.280 --> 41:57.280]  Here it is.
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.640]  Their question specifically asked from the IRS to the Coalition for Life of Iowa, quote,
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.400]  please detail the content of the members of your organization's prayers.
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.800]  Would that be an appropriate question to a 501 C3 applicant?
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.140]  The content of one's prayers.
[42:14.140 --> 42:17.320]  It pains me to say I can't speak to that one either, but that's an, you don't know whether
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.320]  or not that would be an appropriate question to speaking, speaking outside of this case,
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.520]  which I don't know anything about.
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.120]  It would surprise me that that question was asked, see, and of course it's come out in,
[42:29.120 --> 42:30.320]  in the Washington post, you name it.
[42:30.320 --> 42:31.320]  They did do that.
[42:31.320 --> 42:32.880]  And the media is like, Hey, that's a good idea.
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.760]  We know what your prayers are and notice they'll always deny it up on the stand.
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.320]  So there can never be a debate about it while they like gangs show up.
[42:41.320 --> 42:48.800]  I mean, I know Christian authors folks 20 years ago that were audited and shut down
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.000]  because of their free speech and criticism pastors that wrote books, you know, saying
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  it's wrong.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  That will happen to text Mars.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.880]  The Jocelyn elders wanted to teach five-year-olds out of masturbate.
[42:57.880 --> 43:00.760]  They came and shut him down.
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.480]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[43:05.480 --> 43:10.400]  system and you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.160]  sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders.

[43:15.680 --> 43:20.120]  It's a new do it yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[43:25.540 --> 43:26.960]  It runs on battery power.
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.960]  So even if the grid goes down, you're protected.

[43:57.320 --> 44:01.160]  Again, that's get simply safe.com.
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.480]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[44:05.480 --> 44:09.200]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[44:09.200 --> 44:14.280]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[44:14.280 --> 44:19.380]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.380]  afford it.
[44:20.380 --> 44:25.360]  But we have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[44:25.360 --> 44:28.360]  without even a fight, government regulation.
[44:28.360 --> 44:34.640]  After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance, the do it yourself and charitable Mormon food
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.040]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[44:40.040 --> 44:41.320]  regulations.
[44:41.320 --> 44:43.860]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[44:43.860 --> 44:47.520]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[44:47.520 --> 44:53.560]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.320]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[45:00.320 --> 45:01.600]  I had tried everything.
[45:01.600 --> 45:03.800]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[45:03.800 --> 45:07.000]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.400]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[45:11.400 --> 45:17.360]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[45:17.360 --> 45:18.360]  be satisfied.
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.720]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[45:22.720 --> 45:30.320]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[45:30.320 --> 45:33.920]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.240]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[45:38.240 --> 45:40.680]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[45:40.680 --> 45:42.100]  Now that's results.

[47:01.640 --> 47:05.120]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:10.640 --> 47:35.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:35.720 --> 47:39.040]  Okay so David Nixon here in studio with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[47:39.040 --> 47:40.040]  Here is the First Amendment.
[47:40.040 --> 47:42.240]  I know they'll call that a conspiracy theory.
[47:42.240 --> 47:43.240]  That's what they do.
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.400]  They hope you don't look into info and they just say, it's a conspiracy theory we bought
[47:46.400 --> 47:47.400]  two billion bullets.
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.160]  It's a conspiracy theory that the army's training to take your guns even though it's on their
[47:51.160 --> 47:54.040]  own website, hoping you're ignorant.
[47:54.040 --> 47:57.320]  It's a conspiracy theory that the IRS is targeting the Tea Party.
[47:57.320 --> 47:59.760]  I told you that four years ago.
[47:59.760 --> 48:02.220]  We broke fast and furious before we even knew the name.
[48:02.220 --> 48:06.380]  They're shipping guns to Mexico to blame it on the Second Amendment, came out.
[48:06.380 --> 48:10.880]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.520]  thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people to
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.240]  peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[48:21.240 --> 48:22.800]  Now that is the First Amendment.
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.120]  And most people think it's about the freedom to dress up like a woman on the street corner.
[48:27.120 --> 48:28.520]  Fine, you got that freedom.
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.120]  But it's really about religious organizations and others having their own right where the
[48:34.120 --> 48:37.740]  government doesn't try to control religion because it did that everywhere else.
[48:37.740 --> 48:42.320]  Now it means the government controls religion and you have no freedom.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.020]  That's what I was taught in high school and college.
[48:44.020 --> 48:49.320]  The government runs religion and religion must worship government or you're arrested.
[48:49.320 --> 48:52.680]  And then everyone goes, yes, I'm in the Soviet Union.
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.340]  And this is where we are where they're now saying, well, what do you pray?
[48:56.340 --> 49:01.200]  What do you and we want the name of the students groups you're praying with.
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.200]  What do you pray?
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.320]  I mean, and now the IRS is getting your medical records.
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.480]  They're being sued for having 6 million medical records they've seized.
[49:09.480 --> 49:11.560]  They are there to intimidate.
[49:11.560 --> 49:12.560]  They are there.
[49:12.560 --> 49:13.560]  I've talked to the authors.
[49:13.560 --> 49:17.680]  I've had them on the show where they came in 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.080]  And they come in and they say, you will not write and talk bad about Hillary Clinton anymore.
[49:22.080 --> 49:23.080]  Is that clear?
[49:23.080 --> 49:24.080]  And they say, I will not.
[49:24.080 --> 49:25.880]  They go, you're under arrest.
[49:25.880 --> 49:28.980]  Okay, this is America and we're supposed to get afraid.
[49:28.980 --> 49:30.640]  By the way, they're bringing all this out now.
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.080]  I said 6 million, excuse me, it's IRS sued for seizing 60 million medical records.
[49:35.080 --> 49:39.760]  Washington Times, it's always my brain tends to downsize things, not exaggerate the people.
[49:39.760 --> 49:40.760]  He's exaggerating.
[49:40.760 --> 49:42.160]  No, I'm not exaggerating.
[49:42.160 --> 49:43.920]  Most of the time it's the opposite.
[49:43.920 --> 49:44.920]  My memory fails.
[49:44.920 --> 49:45.920]  It just downgrades it.
[49:45.920 --> 49:49.400]  It couldn't be 60 million, David, it's 6 million.
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.160]  And there's no death panels, then of course there's death panels.
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.360]  Again, these people are not liberals, they're authoritarians.
[49:55.360 --> 49:56.680]  David Knight, let's continue here.
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.000]  I mean, how big is this?
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.640]  Well, what you keep hearing from them is mistakes have been made.
[50:00.640 --> 50:02.240]  We didn't do anything illegal.
[50:02.240 --> 50:05.480]  Maybe there was a little bit too much zeal for efficiency on the parts of-
[50:05.480 --> 50:07.120]  It was a few people.
[50:07.120 --> 50:10.880]  Hitler didn't do Nazi Germany, it was a low level private in the German army.
[50:10.880 --> 50:13.880]  Well, you know, you always hear patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
[50:13.880 --> 50:18.040]  The first refuge it seems to be is incompetence, to say, well, mistakes were made.
[50:18.040 --> 50:19.040]  We were just incompetent.
[50:19.040 --> 50:20.040]  We were doing our best.
[50:20.040 --> 50:22.080]  So you need to give us more control over your life.
[50:22.080 --> 50:25.560]  You need to give us more employees, more money to do all this sort of thing.
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.360]  By the way, no one will pull it up, cuz I guess everybody's stupid.
[50:28.360 --> 50:32.840]  I remember three years ago, Rachel Maddow saying, we need to take their tax exemption.
[50:32.840 --> 50:34.480]  Go after these groups.
[50:34.480 --> 50:35.480]  They're on record.
[50:35.480 --> 50:36.480]  Absolutely.
[50:36.480 --> 50:37.480]  Who's gonna pull that up?
[50:37.480 --> 50:38.480]  Go ahead.
[50:38.480 --> 50:40.840]  Well, as we mentioned before, they've been doing this to churches for a long time.
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.480]  Now they're branching this out to pro-life organizations, even to Billy Graham's organization,
[50:45.480 --> 50:46.480]  Samaritan's Purse.
[50:46.480 --> 50:48.000]  But there was no order.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.240]  Right, right, right.
[50:49.240 --> 50:53.640]  But now that was done after these groups were politically active on the other side.
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.080]  And as you mentioned before, they're not doing it to the groups on the left.
[50:56.080 --> 50:57.680]  They're not asking them these kinds of questions.
[50:57.680 --> 51:01.000]  And I've gotta say, I've never seen, and I'm not a Republican, it's just the Democrats
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.080]  are kind of the vanguard of the takeover.
[51:03.080 --> 51:06.960]  The Republicans are like the placeholder just to make us think we're doing okay, and that
[51:06.960 --> 51:07.960]  there's an opposition.
[51:07.960 --> 51:10.000]  I've never seen Republicans do stuff like this.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  Yeah.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  I mean, I've gotta say that.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.120]  As much as I said against Bush and them, they never really persecuted me.
[51:16.120 --> 51:17.400]  It's been under Obama.
[51:17.400 --> 51:21.300]  Right, the pervasiveness of it, the extent of it is what's really new.
[51:21.300 --> 51:25.160]  When we look at groups like, again, Samaritan's Purse, the things that they're involved in
[51:25.160 --> 51:27.560]  are disaster relief, domestic and foreign.
[51:27.560 --> 51:32.120]  They have Operation Christmas Child where you take shoeboxes full of toys and give it
[51:32.120 --> 51:34.120]  to them and they distribute it overseas.
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.040]  Even innocuous groups are being targeted.
[51:36.040 --> 51:37.760]  That's the point.
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.040]  Selling out to this and appeasing won't get it off your back.
[51:41.040 --> 51:44.760]  And what I wanna do is I wanna talk to the evangelical Christians out there who, for
[51:44.760 --> 51:49.320]  the most part, they understand what needs to be done, but they're really not paying
[51:49.320 --> 51:50.320]  attention.
[51:50.320 --> 51:52.840]  They may be with their potluck dinners, that sort of thing.
[51:52.840 --> 51:56.440]  If they're going to get involved with supporting things like disaster relief and Operation
[51:56.440 --> 52:00.480]  Christmas Child, the reason those are there, the reason he's got Samaritan's Purse is because
[52:00.480 --> 52:04.040]  it really rings hollow to share God's love with somebody when you're not willing to go
[52:04.040 --> 52:06.760]  out and take care of them physically.
[52:06.760 --> 52:07.760]  That's the whole idea.
[52:07.760 --> 52:10.320]  I give a lot of money to groups that take care of children.
[52:10.320 --> 52:11.320]  Exactly.
[52:11.320 --> 52:16.000]  So why don't Christians get worried about what's going on here in this country?
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.060]  Why don't they get involved politically as their children are being enslaved and poisoned?
[52:20.060 --> 52:21.760]  Why don't they pay attention to this?
[52:21.760 --> 52:23.720]  Why don't they get angry and do something about it?
[52:23.720 --> 52:29.160]  Well, I mean, I take care of kids in Africa and the Philippines through some of the group's
[52:29.160 --> 52:30.160]  monthly payments.
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.040]  But I also have given a lot more money to, I'm not bragging, I never said this on air,
[52:34.040 --> 52:36.720]  to need here in the US.
[52:36.720 --> 52:37.720]  Exactly.
[52:37.720 --> 52:41.160]  But I don't give money to, quote, find mentally ill children so they can grab your kids that
[52:41.160 --> 52:42.480]  are mentally ill to get money.
[52:42.480 --> 52:43.480]  Most of it's fake charities.
[52:43.480 --> 52:46.160]  I give money for hospital beds or food.
[52:46.160 --> 52:50.840]  Well, what I'm saying is with what we're seeing now with these audits, asking people what
[52:50.840 --> 52:52.480]  the content of their prayer is.
[52:52.480 --> 52:54.600]  That's just nothing but deliberate intimidation.
[52:54.600 --> 52:57.760]  You're not gonna ask people for reams and reams of information that is gonna take a
[52:57.760 --> 52:58.760]  you holler.
[52:58.760 --> 53:00.640]  And now it's tell us your thoughts.
[53:00.640 --> 53:01.640]  Exactly.
[53:01.640 --> 53:04.020]  Can they look at this and see where this is headed?
[53:04.020 --> 53:05.020]  See the tyranny?
[53:05.020 --> 53:06.020]  See where it's headed?
[53:06.020 --> 53:07.020]  I think it's already there.
[53:07.020 --> 53:08.020]  Exactly.
[53:08.020 --> 53:11.880]  But I mean, extrapolate this out and see how much worse it's going to get in all aspects
[53:11.880 --> 53:12.880]  of the world.
[53:12.880 --> 53:14.760]  Well, they're having the hearings and changing the law to take your bank account.
[53:14.760 --> 53:15.760]  Europe's already done it.
[53:15.760 --> 53:18.280]  They already admit that's why they're getting ready for civil unrest.
[53:18.280 --> 53:20.600]  Folks, they're gonna take everything you've got, you idiots.
[53:20.600 --> 53:25.520]  I mean, bending over is the way to make them attack harder.
[53:25.520 --> 53:27.480]  Hopefully some of these Christians are gonna wake up.
[53:27.480 --> 53:32.000]  We've already had, like I said, with the Pulpit Freedom Sunday, it's exploded in the last
[53:32.000 --> 53:37.880]  year from 500 to 1500, wrote letters in defiance of the IRS rules, which are not laws, they're
[53:37.880 --> 53:39.760]  just rules that were put in.
[53:39.760 --> 53:42.960]  And they defied that and the IRS is not coming back after them.
[53:42.960 --> 53:47.800]  The IRS basically backed off and is totally silent about this.
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.320]  It's a criminal organization.
[53:49.320 --> 53:54.840]  By intimidation, and Christians have got to see this and even see the broader picture.
[53:54.840 --> 53:55.920]  As you said, it's already here.
[53:55.920 --> 53:58.760]  This kind of intimidation has been here for a long time.
[53:58.760 --> 54:03.680]  And Christian churches have gotten so passive about politics and about current events here
[54:03.680 --> 54:08.440]  in the United States that they're losing their freedoms, they're losing their economy.
[54:08.440 --> 54:11.200]  They're having all kinds of things put upon them.
[54:11.200 --> 54:13.360]  And maybe this will be the wake-up call where they can see-
[54:13.360 --> 54:19.120]  Yeah, because exactly, Christ and all the prophets before him never submitted a tyranny.
[54:19.120 --> 54:21.960]  That's a lying modern doctrine that you submit to it.
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.000]  He submitted at the end of the sacrifice but said, sell your cloak, sell your script, go
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.620]  get a sword.
[54:27.620 --> 54:31.200]  But all of them said no, they said no to the corrupt authority.
[54:31.200 --> 54:32.200]  That's right.
[54:32.200 --> 54:35.680]  I mean, I guess they should have followed orders, not gone in the lion's den, followed
[54:35.680 --> 54:38.240]  orders, not gone in the furnace.
[54:38.240 --> 54:40.880]  All of the Pauls shouldn't have been locked up in jail.
[54:40.880 --> 54:43.840]  People understand when they look at things like this Operation Christmas Child-
[54:43.840 --> 54:46.280]  Why didn't Moses not submit to Pharaoh?
[54:46.280 --> 54:47.280]  He should have.
[54:47.280 --> 54:48.280]  That's right.
[54:48.280 --> 54:49.280]  He was evil.
[54:49.280 --> 54:50.280]  That's right.
[54:50.280 --> 54:52.120]  It ought to instantly grate against them.
[54:52.120 --> 54:54.080]  He should have rendered to Pharaoh.
[54:54.080 --> 54:57.600]  Just as it did William Wilberforce when he fought against slavery for his entire life
[54:57.600 --> 54:59.440]  and- Well, he was evil, he should have supported
[54:59.440 --> 55:00.440]  the law.
[55:00.440 --> 55:01.440]  Right.
[55:01.440 --> 55:07.600]  They ought to have a fundamental anger about this kind of tyranny and they ought to do
[55:07.600 --> 55:08.600]  something about it.
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.640]  But they've been pacified and largely spent by the IRS over several decades.
[55:12.640 --> 55:15.600]  Listen, I've tried to go, I'm going to keep you in the next hour to continue on this,
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.400]  but I've tried to go, let's not exaggerate, I don't know, 20 churches over the last 15
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.400]  years in Austin.
[55:21.400 --> 55:25.660]  And it may even be a good overall, but you can see them get in the mode of every other
[55:25.660 --> 55:30.040]  sermon to deliver a government worship session, knowing they're doing that for the government
[55:30.040 --> 55:33.480]  spies they on record put in all the big churches, even the small ones.
[55:33.480 --> 55:36.320]  And I just go, that's it, I'm out of here.
[55:36.320 --> 55:38.460]  Because that is devilish.
[55:38.460 --> 55:44.400]  And to give your support to a church that's consciously a government agency, I mean, you
[55:44.400 --> 55:46.600]  might as well just go sell out to the New World Order.
[55:46.600 --> 55:50.400]  Well, maybe they can finally wake up when they see the absurd extremes that this has
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.560]  come into, where they ask for the contents of people's prayer, where they go to pro-life
[55:53.560 --> 55:56.080]  organizations and say, tell us what you put on your signs.
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.880]  When they go to a pro-life organization and say, are you presenting both sides of the
[55:59.880 --> 56:00.880]  abortion argument?
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.800]  Well, by definition, of course they're not.
[56:02.800 --> 56:03.920]  That's not what they're about.
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.040]  They're not there to- There's not a fairness doctrine in free speech.
[56:08.040 --> 56:09.040]  Exactly.
[56:09.040 --> 56:12.720]  When they've got a guy from NAMBLA out there saying he should be able to date your five-year-old
[56:12.720 --> 56:17.720]  daughter or son, they don't go to NAMBLA who's tax-free and say, did you hold up signs saying
[56:17.720 --> 56:19.280]  pedophilia is wrong?
[56:19.280 --> 56:22.600]  But if you speak out for traditional marriage, then you're put on the Southern Poverty Law
[56:22.600 --> 56:26.960]  Center's hate group, and they've got the Pentagon- Well, yeah, here's the deal.
[56:26.960 --> 56:31.960]  I don't hate people for what they're doing sexually in their own life, but they're trying,
[56:31.960 --> 56:35.480]  some of those groups, to get into schools to teach five-year-old stuff.
[56:35.480 --> 56:37.200]  It's like, stay away from my kids, man.
[56:37.200 --> 56:38.200]  Right.
[56:38.200 --> 56:39.300]  It's real simple.
[56:39.300 --> 56:43.660]  But they put mainstream Christian organizations like the Family Research Council and Focus
[56:43.660 --> 56:47.200]  on the Family, they put them on hate lists- And then they get shot up, then they get shot
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.200]  up.
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.200]  Yeah, they actually did.
[56:49.200 --> 56:52.320]  They incited that kind of, they actually did incite hate, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[56:52.320 --> 56:55.960]  They put them on these lists to intimidate them, and we've seen that happening.
[56:55.960 --> 56:58.880]  Just a month ago, we saw all these things coming out from the Pentagon, and now we see
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.840]  the IRS doing this with prayers.
[57:00.840 --> 57:05.280]  By the way, I hope only you selling this evil thing is great because when some pervert attacks
[57:05.280 --> 57:07.240]  your daughter or son, you ask for it.
[57:07.240 --> 57:11.240]  I mean, let me tell you, folks, every society when it's about to fall does this.
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.300]  And the people out there claiming they want equality in all this, the truth is they want
[57:15.300 --> 57:19.600]  to pull down marriage, not all of them, but the main groups driving it, because they don't
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.240]  like us.
[57:21.240 --> 57:22.240]  That's the issue.
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.040]  I'm here to tell you right now, I've studied it, I've looked at it, Planned Parenthood
[57:26.040 --> 57:28.160]  is a eugenics death cult.
[57:28.160 --> 57:33.940]  And they're calling the shots, that's mainstream news, at the IRS saying I want you to go out
[57:33.940 --> 57:34.940]  and shut these people down.
[57:34.940 --> 57:38.120]  David Knight, stay with us for another 15, 20 minutes, I'm going to get some more congressional
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.720]  clips where the IRS got grilled last Friday, Benghazi gate and a ton more coming up.
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.200]  And we'll look at billionaires that are tax free, but want to raise your taxes coming
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.040]  up next hour.
[57:51.040 --> 57:56.640]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[57:56.640 --> 58:01.260]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support
[58:01.260 --> 58:02.680]  your immune system.

[58:27.600 --> 58:32.640]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.480]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune

[59:51.680 --> 59:55.160]  Coast to coast direct from Austin.
[59:55.160 --> 01:00:02.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:08.600]  From his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.360]  You know, wild horses could not drag me away.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.800]  I get David Knight, my reporter in here with all these video clips we're going to play
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800]  in the next segment.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.440]  He starts talking about how they're telling pro-life groups you can't protest.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.660]  They're telling people, well, you got to go out and be pro-abortion half the time.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.440]  Your free speech, they can't tell you what to do.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.360]  Anytime I try to demonstrate around the country, the cops come up and go, where's your permit?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.640]  And I go, it's the first amendment.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.880]  You know, this city, this county's lost lawsuits over this.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.440]  The free speech zones have been thrown out.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.160]  Paul Watson has been contacted by the police in Watford.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.120]  He lives like 70 miles away on the other side of London, a suburb Southern.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.080]  This is suburb Northern, Northwestern.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.760]  They want to drop by his house and talk to him.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.760]  And they want to talk to me.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.360]  And so I guess I'll call them up this week about what are you planning in England?
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.480]  They know, but it's like acting like we're doing something wrong.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:05.440]  A bunch of global crooks meeting in secret to decide policy.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440]  It's come out.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.360]  They've been indicted before over Lockheed Martin scams, you name it.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.800]  We want to cover a mafia event and then it's like we're bad.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]  It's intimidation.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.980]  Well, yeah, it doesn't intimidate us.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.440]  So I'm going to call tomorrow for a massive demonstration, folks.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.720]  You've got to go to London, even if they try to block me getting there, I'm going to have
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720]  my people there.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  They're not going to stop.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.600]  I mean, it's like, how do these people sell their families out?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.860]  Well, they're hired guns.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.320]  But let me tell you, hired guns, when everybody sells out the bottom falls and you become
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.040]  North Korea, you're going to wish all of you that serve evil.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.960]  That's one thing I've noticed in history and life, David, people that serve evil always
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960]  have a comeback on them.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.520]  So I start ranting and hyperventilating and I invited you up here.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.240]  You can't even get to your points, but people I think understand it's because I am just
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.400]  so blown away by this.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.960]  And I think the outrage is beginning.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.200]  I want to come back with all the news on the immigration bill, the rest of it, the next
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]  segment.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.080]  But do you think this because I've been feeling the tipping point and seeing it, I think either
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:09.000]  it tips and we reverse or we just accept it like Mexico or Russia, that we're living under
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.600]  corruption and it's a fate worse than death.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600]  Well, that's exactly it.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.600]  I hope we have reached the tipping point and there's hope that it's gotten to such an absurd
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.000]  point when they ask for the contents of your prayers.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.800]  I mean, how much more absurd does it have to get?
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.440]  How much more intimidating and the question is-
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.720]  Where's the Fifth Amendment?
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.720]  Exactly.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.000]  They say, well, we don't have to worry about tyranny.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.400]  Isn't intimidation, prior constraint, denial of due process, isn't all that stuff?
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.380]  That's how it always begins.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:40.280]  That's why demonstrations aren't big anymore because they'll try to put you in jail for
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]  it.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.080]  They'll constrict you to one little free speech corner that's far away from-
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.040]  And by the way, police, when you're part of this, you literally are burning down your
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040]  own future.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]  That's right.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]  That's right.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]  They intimidate people.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.320]  When I hear this, I think about the words from the Simon and Garfunkel song, we'd like
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.800]  to know a little bit about you for our files.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.440]  We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.480]  I mean, it's gotten to the point though that when they ask this kind of stuff and when
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.800]  they single out groups that are opposed to them, people who have been passive, who have
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.920]  been a part of this, who just acquiesced to this just to get along so they could keep
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.620]  their tax deduction for their church or whatever, they've got to understand where this is headed.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:26.160]  They've got to see where we are now, and they've got to do something for their children's future.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.640]  This is the sort of thing that they have to wake up for.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.220]  The Bible says that when there's a period of restoration, God will turn the father's
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.000]  hearts towards their children.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Now's the time.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.680]  Well, it is now the time, and people have gotten into religion of being cowards.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.600]  And well, we just wanna win souls instead of rocking the boat.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.500]  You're not gonna win any souls preaching what you're preaching, and your children aren't
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.920]  gonna be safe, you fools.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920]  That's right.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.520]  You are destroying yourself by your acquiescence.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.500]  You are opening the gate.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:05.040]  When you're totally divorced from the realities of what's going on in society, when you let
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.920]  everybody, when you let them steal your freedoms, when you let them establish this kind of tyranny,
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.960]  that's when you have to wake up at this point.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.620]  Let's take a clip from Representative Mike Kelly, and I hope that he's really serious
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.620]  about that.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.200]  So I hope he's not just grandstanding to get a standing ovation, he got a standing ovation
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200]  from this.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.120]  I hope he really sincerely believes this.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.640]  I hope he's gonna do something about it.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.480]  Well, no, no, he seems- We can't just wait for the congressman to
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480]  do something about it.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480]  We've got to do something about it.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]  Absolutely, we're going to break.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.120]  We're gonna come back and play that in your final segment and get more into the immigration
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120]  bill.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.800]  Let's get into all the other clips where they're now saying on HBO with Bill Maher and the
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.740]  self-propelled stomach that, Michael Moore, that if you do not do everything they say
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]  it's treason.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.760]  I mean, that is the essence of authoritarianism.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.080]  And again, these people are conscious authoritarians.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.080]  They're not liberals.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.880]  There's a lot of well-meaning liberals that are like, let's teach equality to your five-year-old
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.880]  so people don't get bullied, but it's not meant for that.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.640]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.400]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.320]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.840]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.260]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:12.960]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.960]  Infoworth.com.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:24.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:31.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:07:01.940]  By the way, I did a big in-depth video interview with Mike Judge last week, who is no longer
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:02.940]  a longtime listener to the show.
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.160]  We've been a longtime fan of his.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:11.160]  King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead, Extract, Office Space, Idiocracy.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.000]  And he even got Political, which he never does.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.280]  That's gonna be airing Thursday on the weekday show, 11 AM to 2 PM.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.240]  It's about a 50-minute interview, but we'll cut it down to about an hour.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.760]  That will premiere Thursday here on the syndicated radio broadcast.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.560]  Now, if you just joined us, I got a bunch of other Benghazi news, police state news.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.440]  I'm gonna get into this, cancer rates exploding.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:39.560]  So why don't we talk about why it's increasing instead of everybody, we might get brain cancer,
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.800]  let's remove our brains.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.080]  Eye cancer is up, retina cancer, let's remove our eyes.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.280]  Breast cancer is up, let's just remove our breast.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.000]  Colon cancer is up, let's remove our colon.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.400]  I guess for government officials, that might be good.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.520]  What do you call having your brain removed for your health?
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.320]  I guess they're coming out with vaccines.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.080]  Now, we've been bantering back and forth in the last 30 minutes, but the other points
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.660]  before we shift gears out of the IRS situation.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:10.280]  With this clip that you are talking about, Representative Mike Kelly, tell folks about
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.280]  this.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.160]  Yeah, hopefully, I want people to listen to this.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.240]  He got a standing ovation with this, and he's talking to them.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.040]  He basically says, is there anything that you can't ask?
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.900]  In other words, trying to get a sense from the IRS official there.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.440]  Is there anything that you think that the law prohibits you from doing?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.600]  It's pretty amazing to hear what the guy says, so let's take a look at that.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.040]  Yeah, let's see this clip.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.040]  Is there any limit to the scope of where you folks can go?
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.080]  Is there anything at all?
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.440]  Is there any way that we could ask you, is there any question that you shouldn't have
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  asked?
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.320]  My goodness, how much money do you have in your wallet?
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.480]  Who do you get emails from?
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.080]  Who signed you put up in your front yard?
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.520]  This is a tax question.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.960]  I am more concerned today than I was before, and the fact that you all can do just about
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.000]  anything you want to anybody, you know you can put anybody out of business that you want
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  any time you want.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.880]  And I got to tell you, you talked about you're a horribly run organization.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.160]  If you're on the other side of the fence, you're not given that excuse.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.920]  And when the IRS comes in to you, you're not allowed to be shoddy, you're not allowed to
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.600]  be run horribly, you're not allowed to make mistakes, you're not allowed to do one damn
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.520]  thing that doesn't come in compliance.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.360]  If you do, you're held responsible right then.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.560]  I just think the American people have seen what's going on right now in their government.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.240]  This is absolutely an overreach, and this is an outrage for all America.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.240]  I yield back.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.880]  All right.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:38.280]  So Infowars.com reporter David Knight, I mean the IRS takes your house, your bank accounts
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:44.480]  without even the fake IRS court saying so, and it's a kangaroo court, not a real constitutional
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]  court.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.800]  So when it's criminal, and they actually bring a case against you, at least there's a puppet
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.280]  jury they bring in, the IRS takes bank accounts and just laughs at people while the ultra
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.680]  rich, I'm gonna cover this later, are exempt, lobbying for more taxes on us.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.520]  But absolutely, the IRS wants to know your prayers.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.140]  I mean, the reason the IRS is being used to run healthcare and everything now and getting
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.080]  our healthcare records is because they are the lawless criminal group, and they've gotten
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.320]  away with bloody murder.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:14.240]  And so yes, they're the group everyone fears, they will be the Gestapo.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.880]  Well they operate under the presumption that you're guilty and you have to prove your innocence.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.440]  I mean, that's exactly the upside down opposite of what our law says.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.000]  But then you can't even prove it.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.360]  They've done that over and over again.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.560]  And so the IRS has really been at the forefront of destroying our civil liberties and due
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560]  process.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.100]  Then they picked up the ball with the DEA and the drug wars.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100]  And now we see this-
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.140]  Asset forfeiture seizure where they pull an old lady over and she has $1,000 in her wallet
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.960]  and they just take it, no judge, no jury.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960]  That's North Korea, man.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.880]  And everybody's like, well, America isn't a tyranny yet.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.360]  Yes, it is.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.860]  And then we're gonna get in more trouble till you admit it, America.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.600]  Then they step it up even higher with the war on terrorism.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.560]  So each one of these organizations is stepping it up to another level.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.000]  And now they're saying that the terrorists aren't al-Qaeda, it's the Tea Party and conservatives.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.280]  Right, even Piers Morgan and Joe Scarborough realized that this IRS scandal has implications
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.720]  for the Second Amendment and the gun registration.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.160]  And I think it's interesting to see not only the pattern of tyranny, but the idea that
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.880]  all of these major legislative pushes that Obama is pushing through.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.920]  Every single one of them comes with calls for a lot more information to be kept on the
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.920]  American people.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.240]  Well, take the new census, totally unconstitutional.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.320]  Businesses get a yearly one where they ask all these questions that they couldn't make
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.400]  you ask in a criminal investigation.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.680]  It's all fraudulent, just bureaucrats seeing what you'll do and then threatening you.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.600]  And when you do that, if you go in and you start to tell them the contents of your prayers
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.160]  or any of the other ridiculous- It empowers them.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.600]  It empowers them because when they were going in and telling these groups, some of the more
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.000]  prosaic things that they were asking were things like, tell us everything that you plan
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.880]  on passing out at future meetings, all the politicians that you're going to talk to and
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]  so forth and so on.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880]  It's a chilling effect.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.640]  If you give them any kind of answer that they can later claim that you lied to them on,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.440]  okay, you basically committed perjury.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.100]  So it's essentially not only intimidation, but it's also entrapment.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:16.200]  But think about, we talked about how gun control, they're focusing on registration and database
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.200]  collection.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.080]  Look at this immigration law they're coming out with over and over again within that bill
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.160]  and it's a huge bill.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.440]  It's national biometric ID card for us and the illegals are exempt.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440]  Absolutely.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.480]  Well, they're putting it in there as a condition for the illegals, but they're also-
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.480]  But they always waive it.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480]  They always waive it.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.120]  Yeah, they're also gonna have this be a national database where the Social Security Administration
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.640]  is going to collect all this information on you and your biometric information before
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.520]  you're going to be allowed to get a job.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.160]  Because they're gonna have to determine whether or not you're an illegal alien and they're
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.240]  gonna use all that biometric information for passports.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.640]  So they're gonna use it to control whether you can get in and out of-
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.360]  Meanwhile, Obama has already by fiat stopped the deportations and is just legalizing them
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360]  anyways.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  Right.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.080]  So what they're doing is, again, what they're doing is they're using this false facade of
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.480]  the immigration bill to establish a biometric tyranny, a tyranny where they're going to
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.680]  have us have to get permission and the okay of the Department of Social Security and other
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.720]  government organizations in order to have a job.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.080]  Well, they admit that already goes on, but now it's gonna be more.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.320]  It's gonna be formalized.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.520]  They want the biometrics, which they already have through the driver's license, federalized
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.000]  national ID, because you're gonna go thumbprint or face print, digital photo when you buy
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  and sell.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.720]  They say if you're not a good globalist, you're not even going to be able to buy and sell.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.680]  Gee, I heard of that before, but the preachers won't talk about it cuz that's political.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680]  Exactly.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.160]  And they won't talk about how they're gonna try to recruit five year olds into sexual
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.720]  activities in the public schools cuz that's political.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.720]  And they won't talk about anything cuz that's political.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.320]  So maybe this will be a wake up moment for them.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.220]  Maybe when they see the kinds of actions of the IRS, they will believe that this biometric
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.340]  information that the government is now looking for to make everyone have to get permission
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:06.280]  from Washington to get a job, to travel, to do anything.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.480]  Maybe that will be a wake up call now for the churches, hopefully it will.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.080]  Some of the people have to wake up and do something.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.240]  Well the churches just go that means the end of the world's next week, but then it's not
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240]  gonna happen.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.180]  Right, yeah, that's the sad part about it.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:23.160]  So many of them look at it, they have this eschatology that says that they're not gonna
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.320]  go through any trouble.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.220]  And so they look at this as a positive thing that they actually want to see happen.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.880]  And that's one of the things that makes them passive.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.560]  It's not just the IRS, it's also-
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.400]  And of course, the pre-tribulation rapture was not taught until about 150 years ago.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  That's right, yeah.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.560]  I mean, a five year old could read the Bible and it clearly is not there.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.280]  Right, the Darby sisters, yeah.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.280]  It's very sad-
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.980]  I mean, even if you're not a Christian, folks, supposedly 77% of this country calls themselves
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.980]  that.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.160]  The Bible is clear that the Antichrist comes, wages war on the saints, overcomes them, there's
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.960]  the biggest revival ever.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.560]  And then the dead in Christ are raised and the living in Christ are raised.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.080]  I mean, it's after the archangel ties up the devil and all that.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.120]  I mean, it just isn't there.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.840]  But your whore preachers work for the New World Order and are gonna sell you straight
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.840]  to hell.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.960]  Well, you gotta ask whether a very complicated eschatology ought to trump the basic moral
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.480]  principles that are taught in the Bible.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.960]  God's gonna say I don't know you.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.160]  Yeah, let's just say there's a pre-tribulation rapture.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.720]  You're not gonna fight any of this tyranny cuz you all go basically to your social club
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.120]  of the church to all feel good about yourselves?
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.000]  Martin Luther said, if I knew the world was gonna end tomorrow, I would still plant a
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.600]  tree today.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.560]  And that's the kind of mindset that Christians need to have.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.700]  They need to understand the basic moral principles that they need to fight for those as long
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.000]  as they're alive.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.600]  And there's no excuse not to do that.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.280]  Well, we've become a nation of cowards on average who worship tyranny.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.460]  And now people notice their prosperity is going.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.460]  That's why they're mad about the tyranny.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.520]  And let me explain something to you.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.040]  For every inch of tyranny they get, you lose an inch of freedom and now they're gaining
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.480]  light years of tyranny and you're losing light years of liberty.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.500]  Thank you, David Knight.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.800]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.520]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.600]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.720]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.720]  afford it.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.640]  We have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.480]  without even a fight.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.000]  Government regulation.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.920]  After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:40.360]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.640]  regulations.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.160]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.800]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.920]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:01.200]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.560]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.800]  natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.960]  skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.720]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.160]  your immune system.

[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.200]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:19.920]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.320]  the mind of man.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:29.680]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:36.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the exact same handful of globalist mega banks that own the big insurance
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.760]  companies, that own the major infrastructure, that make their money off of government contracts
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.600]  and putting their own politicians in power.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.260]  They were the ones all over Europe taking people's private bank accounts of paid for
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:53.800]  tax money, after tax money.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.360]  They are the ones then that exempt their own operatives in government and corporations
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.840]  from all the taxes.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.500]  And that's why I get so upset.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.080]  This is a lawless criminality.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.720]  I've watched them do it in Latin America, in Asia, in Europe, the very same people.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:18.560]  And I've interviewed professors of economics and the number three in the Japanese government
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:26.160]  and top EU Parliament members, concurring with my analysis, with their analysis.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.000]  This is not my opinion.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:34.240]  I'm a person that literally eat, sleeps, drinks and dreams this stuff.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.320]  All I do is research.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320]  And that's what's frustrating.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.080]  I then talk to the general public.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.760]  You're not stupid on average, new listeners.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:49.480]  You just don't care and aren't informed about geopolitics.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.280]  And you don't know about due process, the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.440]  You probably haven't interviewed over 100 constitutional lawyers like I have on air.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.000]  I live this stuff.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.200]  I live case law.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.280]  I live history.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.520]  I live it.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.600]  I live it.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.240]  To quite frankly an embarrassing level, I was at a two hour music recital with different
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.300]  groups of kids up there in a big facility today.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.360]  And I was sitting there except when my kids came out, listening to law tapes for two hours
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.680]  because I can't help it.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.040]  I cannot sit there and watch people dance for two hours.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.640]  I had to listen to law tapes while I was there.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.960]  And I'm not bragging, it's just that it freaks me out to be absolutely confirmed in all of
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]  this.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.000]  I mean, it is devastating how much danger we're in.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.560]  And then people are like, wow, the IRS is intimidating people, I guess we are in trouble.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:49.480]  Man, if you knew how much trouble we're in, we would fix this very quickly.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.680]  Where is your common sense?
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:23:00.960]  Gazelles run from lions, deer in the forests of northern India run from the Bengal tiger.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.160]  I mean, just at least run from it.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.160]  But running from it doesn't mean crouching.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:15.760]  Does a gazelle to a lion get in front of it and grovel?
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.440]  And then the lion is nice to them?
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440]  That's what you're doing.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.800]  I mean, if you wanna run from this, I would respect that more out of the fire into the
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800]  frying pan.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.840]  Other countries are under the same tyranny as well.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.900]  I would respect it more.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:37.920]  But just the groveling and I'll get ahead toadying, you have empowered this.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.960]  And man, I watch over the last seven years where they've been changing laws and regulations
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.100]  and they've already spent all the federal pension funds.
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:51.320]  They're now paying for it with Treasury notes and totally worthless garbage.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.000]  I mean, folks, there's no way.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:08.120]  I sat there this morning after I had swum some laps in a swimming pool in Austin.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.880]  And I laid there and listened to a group of school teachers talk about how they couldn't
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.120]  pay their bills or what they were paid and how the government owed them more.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:19.520]  There was more money and how these people are out of work in their family who don't
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.120]  work for the government, but it'll be okay.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.880]  And I'm sitting there going, hey, we've been signed on to two quadrillion in fake derivatives
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.880]  debts.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:28.880]  Let's be honest.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  I mean, let's be conservative.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.600]  I don't know what, it's like 30, 40, 50 times all the wealth in all the world.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.400]  Some estimates are over 100 times.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.920]  Let's just say it's a lot more than we can pay back and it isn't our debt.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.680]  We've got a $17 trillion debt ourselves.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:48.800]  The domestic product is at $17 trillion a year where our credit rating is being lowered.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.400]  And this was all done by design.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.640]  I had economists on like George Humphrey, former Austin City Council member, but that's
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.580]  not why I'm impressed by him.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:01.040]  He's a successful businessman who owns stuff all over the world, lives all over the world.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.340]  I'm not gonna even get into how much money he's probably worth.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:08.200]  So busy he can't even come on this show living all over the world.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.040]  And I remember interviewing him in 1998 and he laid out everything was gonna happen, derivatives,
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.640]  the quadrillion, the whole plan, the plan to implode us, and it all happened.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:24.160]  Ron Paul, same thing, all happened.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:30.680]  And I'm sitting here loving this country, and loving freedom, and going into debt bondage,
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:38.600]  and I see the childlike public having no idea how much trouble we're in.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.760]  I wanna go to a bunch of clubs, we only got guests coming up.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.360]  Adam Kokesh has been arrested, another guy that called for an armed peaceful march on
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.080]  Washington to exercise the Second Amendment and civil disobedience.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.280]  But let's go to some of these clips.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.520]  Here's Obama saying don't worry about tyranny, and then I'll get to the new clips.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.000]  Here's Obama saying don't worry about tyranny.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.080]  That's 180 degrees from what the founders said, here it is.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.400]  Unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.640]  more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.920]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.240]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.240]  You should reject these voices.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:26.800]  All right, that's enough.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.760]  Tyranny's always lurking around the corner.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.680]  Hell, it's in our lap right now, and it's crushing us, it weighs like 5,000 pounds.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.640]  I want it off my back.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:41.160]  Now let's go to a clip, the whole clip's up on infowars.com, cuz it's incredible.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:46.840]  And it's Bill Maher and it's Michael Moore, we're gonna analyze it and critique it here.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:53.580]  And they're saying it's treason to try to repeal Obamacare and have 37 different House
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.880]  members introduce bills.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.040]  That's their right as elected representatives of the people that try to repeal that unconstitutional
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:05.200]  monstrosity written by foreign insurance companies that have doubled the rates to rape people.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.600]  And they lie on the show and say it's lowered rates, like their audience is idiots.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.840]  Then Michael Moore goes, it doesn't matter, the conservatives have been defeated, look
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.980]  at the demographics.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:16.560]  The demographics of people from countries that have no freedom, that think the government's
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.800]  their friend, they don't think that, they're thinking short term.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.800]  I mean, demographics, the Republicans aren't gonna save us, their establishment as well
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.400]  at the highest levels, but the Tea Party type people, that's who all of them are after.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.160]  So let's go to this disgusting clip where Michael Moore says America doesn't want guns,
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.160]  here it is.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.720]  I'm trying to repeal it for the 37th time.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.960]  Is that a wise use of our resources and time?
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.880]  I mean, at some point, obstruction becomes, I don't know, treason?
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.100]  You know, I mean, they've also blocked Obama's head of the EPA, there's no way-
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.040]  Shipping guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment is treason.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.840]  At some point, it just becomes more about hating him than loving your country.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.840]  No, we hate America.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.840]  Hit pause.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.080]  That's really what it is.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]  It's hating America.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.400]  We're gonna play the rest when we come back and then go to our guest.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400]  It's hating America.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.200]  Let me tell you something, if we had a black president that was like Ron Paul, I would
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.320]  wash his feet.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.860]  What makes me mad is I really don't care what color you are.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:21.240]  The problem is they now attach in the media what color you are is what you're supposedly
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240]  to stand for.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.680]  Like, owning guns and owning your own property and running your own life, that's an old white
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]  guy thing.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.580]  You know, we're the winning team.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:33.920]  We're the Hispanics and the black people, and we like Che Guevara and communism.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.880]  And I'm like, do you know what communism produces?
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880]  It's not communism.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.440]  It's just a group of thugs running things.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.840]  I want liberty for Mexico.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.480]  I want liberty for Argentina.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.620]  I want liberty for Nigeria.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:50.680]  In my heart, I have goodwill, but I also know if they don't have liberty, I'm not gonna
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  have it intellectually.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:29:01.560]  We're gonna come back to the disgusting demon, uh, I can't even say his name, Michael Moore.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.880]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.580]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:14.680]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:19.760]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.760]  afford it.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.720]  We have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.540]  without even a fight.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.040]  Government regulation.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.980]  After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:40.400]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.680]  regulations.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.200]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.880]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:53.960]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:30:00.840]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:05.560]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.320]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.720]  They used to say, as Texas goes, so goes the nation.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.840]  Well as Texas goes, so goes America, and as America goes, so goes the world, because we're
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:02.400]  not perfect, but compared to other countries, we've had a bigger share of freedom and that's
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.200]  why we've been so successful.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.760]  5% of the world's population had half the wealth, bringing collectivism, we're now about
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.880]  30% of the world's wealth in just 20 years.

[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.560]  Nobody can say I kiss the devil's stinking rump either.

[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.160]  Prisonplanet.tv, all right, that's enough, boom, just midair refueling and the expansion
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.160]  of the operation here.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.840]  I wanna play these clips and go to our guest on this, and then Adam Kokesh locked up, he's
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:52.040]  at a marijuana legalization rally, whether you support that or not, only 6% of Americans
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.080]  say lock up marijuana smokers.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.720]  He was arrested, they singled him out because he's a pro-Second Amendment guy.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.420]  We're gonna break that down with our guest, his producers, here in a moment from their
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.920]  TV studio.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:14.080]  But first off, let's finish this clip of Michael Moore, the host of the show, had just said
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:18.680]  there on Bill Maher's program that it's treason to not do what Obama wants.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.280]  And then Moore says we hate America because we don't wanna just bring in 30 million people
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.400]  and give them free welfare and bankrupt the country and hand in our guns.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.640]  And then he says Americans wanna not have guns, and in fake polls they've got.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.640]  They've sold hundreds of millions of guns the last few years, everybody's getting into
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.640]  guns.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.080]  You're losing the culture war, scum, so they declare they're winning it in a giant hoax,
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080]  here it is.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.080]  No, they hate America.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.160]  You hate America, you piece of crap.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.500]  Yeah, I think these conservatives and right wingers, really, for as much as they say they
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:52.120]  love this country, they hate it, they hate the government.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.120]  Back it up again.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.920]  Man, you read the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights Constitution, it sounds
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.680]  like Alex Jones and Ron Paul, okay?
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.300]  Not you, you read what the Soviets and the Nazis did politically.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.240]  It sounds like you, Pig Moore, Pig Morris, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.920]  I mean, you make me sick what a liar you are.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.760]  Just the outrageousness of an anti-American piece of crap like you, excuse me, I'm trying
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.960]  to control myself.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.720]  Yeah, he has bodyguards, it's on video back in 2004.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.560]  He's out in the street in New York, go up, talk to him.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.560]  I'm like 10 feet away, they elbow me out, elbow the guy right back.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.560]  They're like groaning back top like, yeah, you think I'm one of these people?
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.840]  You're gonna punch me and not get it back, you scum?
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.880]  That guy's got six bodyguards with guns, but he doesn't think you have a right to own them.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.880]  It's a piece of trash.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.480]  Let's go back to the liar, go back to him.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.560]  No, they hate America.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.560]  That's really what it is.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.560]  They hate America.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.560]  Hate you?
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:50.360]  Yeah, I think these conservatives and right wingers, really, for as much as they say they
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.120]  love this country, they hate it, they hate the government, they hate-
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.640]  I hate globalists like you who've taken it over.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.600]  No, well, it shouldn't be, the government's supposed to be of, by, and for the people,
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.600]  right?
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  But it's not.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600]  Why is the government-
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.120]  But it persecutes people with tax records, you piece of trash.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.800]  It does, Mike, it got taken over by a Kenyan socialist, that's why.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.040]  That's why we need our guns.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.040]  From Cincinnati.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.360]  Yeah, we might have to take over the government.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360]  Yeah.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.640]  Listen, here, here's the good news.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.640]  I'm not as depressed about this.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.640]  It's all lies.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.800]  We're going to our guests.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.480]  It's all lies.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.920]  Obama has seven czars that have quoted Mao Tse Tung, that's the biggest mass murder in
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.920]  history.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.020]  I mean, it's these creepy weirdo authoritarians who just said it's tyranny not to do what
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:42.840]  they want, but that they're not tyrannical, that it's treason not to do what they want.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:48.320]  And then he's such a liar, they later say the healthcare law is cutting healthcare costs
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.440]  in half, when it's doubled it, that's even the White House admits it.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.400]  They just think you're stupid.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.400]  They're not liberals.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.800]  I'm a real liberal, folks, who want to use a Thomas Jefferson term.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.580]  Yeah, I'm an extreme right winger nowadays, because all the terms are scrambled.
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:05.080]  Let's go back to this piece of trash.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.200]  Let's go back to the clip here of Michael Moore.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.720]  They hate America.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.720]  That's really what it is.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.720]  They hate America?
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.520]  Yeah, I think these conservatives and right wingers really, for as much as they say they
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.360]  love this country, they hate it.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.560]  They hate the government.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.560]  They hate people.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.960]  But those are two different things, aren't they?
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  No.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.960]  Well, it shouldn't be.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.220]  The government's supposed to be of, by, and for the people, right?
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.220]  That's the line.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.080]  Obama's like, don't worry about the government, it's the people.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.080]  There's no tyranny.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.160]  The government does, Mike, have got taken over by a Kenyan socialist, that's why we
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160]  need our guns.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]  From Cincinnati.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.840]  There's a southern accent, he's a bigot.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.840]  He's a bigot.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.720]  Listen, here, here's the good news.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:46.960]  That piece of trash thinks he's better than everybody.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.600]  As all the polls show, the next generation coming up, they don't agree with any of this
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.600]  nonsense.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  They got five times the cancer rate.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.600]  You've done a good job on them.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  They don't give any guns to young people.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  They're totally brain damaged.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  They're not bigots.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.600]  They're not haters.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.600]  Right.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  81% of young adults support gay marriage.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  They support legalization.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  Less religious?
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600]  Less, yes.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.600]  Oh, it's Obama arresting all the pot smokers.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  I can't hear any more of it.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600]  Shut it down.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.600]  Come on.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.600]  All right, I'm going to our guest.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  I appreciate him holding.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.480]  We're going to break here in a minute or two.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:22.240]  Joining us are Lucas Jewell and one of the other hosts there of the show, pardon me?
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  Darryl Young.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.600]  We're just going to go to you after the break.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.080]  We'll go to you after the break that way because I didn't know we were going to have two guests
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.960]  on and that's great, but I'm going to get these names straight on a piece of paper when
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.160]  I come back after this break.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:42.320]  We're going to find out exactly what has gone on with Adam Kokesh, again, who is a talk
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.480]  show host and a frequent guest of the show.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.320]  I don't cheerlead him having an armed march on Washington because I know they're going
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.040]  to try to set something up and I know how the media will spin it, but I also understand
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.780]  their right to have an armed march on Washington when the Supreme Court has ruled their anti-gun
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:04.420]  laws are unconstitutional there inside of DC.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.420]  So it's civil disobedience.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:09.840]  Now, the police chief said famously a week ago, I'll arrest Kokesh and these people.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:15.120]  We will allow protesting, which is civil disobedience, but we won't allow people with guns.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.760]  Only the government can have guns.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:20.020]  Civil disobedience is violating a law that's unconstitutional.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:24.960]  You're violating the law arresting peaceful protesters in DC all the time and not allowing
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.960]  it.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.820]  So she's like, I'll allow unarmed protesters, which you don't normally do because you're
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:35.060]  a color of law thug, but you won't allow other people to do that.
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.420]  So again, they just think everybody's stupid.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:44.560]  Civil disobedience was black people saying I'm not going to sit at the lunch counter.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:50.940]  You know, at the black restaurant only or the black bathroom when it doesn't exist.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:51.940]  That's the parking lot.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:55.460]  I'm going to come into the so-called white restaurants and I'm going to order food at
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:43:00.600]  lunch, which was against the law, or I'm going to sit at the front of the bus.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.640]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.940]  good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:12.760]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.920]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:22.480]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.660]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:31.980]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:36.120]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.

[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.020]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.560]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states

[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:16.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.700]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:21.620]  But it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:26.820]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820]  All right, final segment.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.620]  I appreciate our guests joining us.
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.180]  The Adam versus the man radio TV show.
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.300]  Only 6% of Americans think marijuana possession should be punished with jail time.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:45.780]  A new Reason Roop poll put out by Reason magazine found and look, I'm not a big marijuana guy.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:48.900]  George Soros promotes it cuz he wants to dumb the public down.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:53.820]  It's kind of one of the few liberal things actual establishment people can push.
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:56.180]  It's like yeah, gay marriage, have your marijuana.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.420]  But libertarians have been saying decriminalize it forever cuz it's just used to put peaceful
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.900]  people in prison.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.500]  Now you know who Adam Kokesh is, a lot of you.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.740]  He's a talk show host who says he's gonna have an armed march peacefully on DC as, like
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:11.860]  I just said, like black people sitting at the front of the bus saying I'm not gonna
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:12.860]  sit at the back of the bus.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:17.540]  If the Supreme Court said you can have loaded arrivals in DC, why can't we march five years
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:20.260]  later after that with the rivals?
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:23.940]  Others have said this will be used as a provocateur and start some type of big event.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:26.420]  I don't think the establishment wants that to happen.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.620]  But I did warn Kokesh on and off air, I said they're gonna come after you.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:37.020]  Now he was in another city doing a marijuana demonstration and they singled him out and
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.600]  tackled him and arrested him.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.020]  And now to tell us what they're charging him with, what's happening, here it is.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:45.940]  Philadelphia police arrest marijuana activist at peaceful demonstration.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:51.340]  And joining us are Lucas Jewell, his producer, and his podcast producer, Darrell Young.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.900]  Gentlemen, you've got the floor for the balance of this segment, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:59.300]  Looks to me, I like on the video, that they singled him out.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.300]  What happened there?
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.900]  Thank you for having us, brother.
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:06.180]  Now for starters, this is our fifth rally that we had for Smoke Down.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:10.220]  So for them to come and attack us now, there had to have been a reason.
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:14.900]  But we originally arrived in Philadelphia for our end of federal rally, which started
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.340]  about 12 o'clock.
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:21.200]  So as us arriving in Philadelphia early, we noticed by the Liberty Bell where we normally
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.820]  host the Smoke Down rallies that they had a fence gate around the area where we normally
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:31.660]  stand and promote our peaceful Smoke Down rally.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.380]  And earlier in the day, there was massive police there.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.700]  And I guess there was a officer that had, how should I phrase it, like a stack of paperwork.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:44.540]  So my assumption is, hey, are those paperwork of people that they're gonna be looking for
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:45.540]  in advance?
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:50.220]  Because we had never seen this area gated off as it was that day.
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:55.180]  So we walked around, asked all of the hosts of the event, did they request this gate to
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.980]  be surrounded the area?
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:57.980]  Nobody had any information.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:01.060]  No, they put it up as a non-escape thing for their prey.
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.420]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:07.380]  And on the gate, it did state, this area is for a rally for people that's gonna be smoking
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:08.700]  a controlled substance.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:14.700]  And nobody that hosted the event knew any information about this gate.
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:17.040]  So from the beginning, this seemed real fishy.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.500]  So we had a meeting about one or two o'clock just discussing if we was to get arrested,
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:27.180]  what would be our game plan and how do we go about, I guess, regrouping and making sure
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:28.940]  that everybody's okay.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:34.980]  So as the event started, as we normally do, we light up about 420.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:37.780]  Adam did not smoke anything.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:43.340]  All of a sudden, they came and grabbed Adam and our brother, NAPO, from the panic hour
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.420]  for no reason.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:48.860]  They arrested other people for smoking, but Adam did not smoke anything.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:53.100]  For anybody that's been following or watching Adam, they know the reason why they picked
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.100]  him up.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.620]  They have not provided any information on why they detained him.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.580]  He was picked up by park rangers, brought to a police station.
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.500]  When we went to a police station, they say they have no information to provide to us.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:05.660]  That's just a holding cell.
[01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:08.020]  We went to the Fed building.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:10.820]  Our assumption is that the federal agents have him.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.100]  We have no information on his whereabouts.
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.540]  He has not contacted us.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:19.820]  My God, I would have gone to you earlier in the first of the show if I'd have known this.
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:21.580]  My goodness, he's disappeared.
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:23.820]  This is breaking news.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:29.600]  Alex, we have not made contact with Adam, but we do know where he's at.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:30.600]  It's public information.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.940]  It's on the Internet.
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:39.420]  But we have not been able to make contact, supposedly in a PO, who was also arrested,
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:41.540]  has been able to make contact through a lawyer.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:45.940]  Sure, well, they weren't using the opium the government ships in on C-130s publicly or
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:50.900]  the cocaine they ship in on the major bank aircraft Bloomberg reports on.
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:55.580]  So that's your reason they hate pot is it doesn't kill you like the other drugs and
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:56.900]  they don't control it.
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:52:01.180]  But tell us where he is for people that may want to get in contact.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:06.780]  I don't have the exact address, but there is a federal jail located about a block or
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:10.060]  two away from the Liberty Bell Independence Hall.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.900]  700 and Arch Street will be the address to the jail that he's referring to.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.180]  Yeah, but see, I saw that in your Facebook yesterday.
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.500]  We had an article on Infowars.com.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:22.980]  This is a big deal that it's a local state marijuana law and he's in a federal jail.
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.340]  This is huge, man.
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:27.100]  And that's why we I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.400]  Just the fact that the feds come in and grab him.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:32.780]  So it was the Rangers that singled him out.
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:33.780]  And now what is this?
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:38.060]  I hear they're claiming he resisted because the video he didn't resist our government
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:45.180]  gods from the video shows that he peacefully raised his arms very civilly.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:48.460]  Well, that's going to show that he doesn't have a weapon, so they can't pop him.
[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:49.460]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:52.100]  Well, and also to show that he's nonviolent, you know, he's compliant.
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:54.500]  Our whole our whole movement is about nonviolence.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:55.500]  That's what the Liberty movement.
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:56.500]  That's why you're so evil.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.500]  Yeah.
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.500]  Right.
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:52:59.500]  That's why it's about nonviolence.
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:02.980]  And when the government tries to regulate what you can and cannot put into your own
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.640]  body, it's inherently violent.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.640]  So law.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:07.980]  Yeah, but I've seen the video.
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:12.580]  He puts his hands up, then they tackle him acting like he's done something.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:16.860]  I mean, I've seen him with people on the ground doing nothing, stomp their brain in and then
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:17.860]  charge him with assault.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:20.620]  I mean, it's such a screwed up government, man.
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.060]  It's like North Korea.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:25.580]  And now he's disappeared into a federal labyrinth in Philadelphia.
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.680]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:31.700]  We also something I just want to clarify, a lot of people on the Internet are talking
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:36.780]  about the libertarian state Senate candidate, Don Desarne.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:40.660]  People are claiming that he planted something on Adam or anything like that.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.860]  I just want to clear his name.
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.140]  I spoke to him earlier.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:51.520]  I've watched the tape and I can confirm that he didn't plan anything on Adam.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.820]  And Adam actually doesn't have any drug charges.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:59.620]  And when I spoke to the people I spoke to, I was told it was just resisting arrest and
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:00.620]  failure to process.
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:01.620]  Yeah, sure.
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:07.180]  The video you're talking about is it looks like one of the federal police is trying to
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:09.860]  put something in his pants or grab his belt, either or.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.140]  So you're saying that guy's a libertarian candidate?
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:16.680]  No, you can see on, I don't know if we're watching the same angle, but you can see in
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:23.060]  one of the angles that it was Don Desarne, who was actually speaker at the event.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.060]  And he was being tackled.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:27.940]  It looked like he was maybe going to grab Adam to keep his balance or something like
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:28.940]  that.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:29.940]  Oh, I get it.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:31.580]  And then people thought it was a cop's hand.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.580]  Okay.
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.580]  All right.
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:34.580]  Yeah.
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.580]  Yeah.
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:38.260]  I didn't think it looked like something was being planted by the cop either when we debated
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.700]  it because it just looked like he's trying to grab his belt.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.700]  Go ahead.
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:43.100]  I just wanted to clear his name.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.100]  We've cleared it now.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:45.100]  That's fine.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.100]  I didn't know the guy's name.
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:48.940]  So he's in this federal jail.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.020]  Correct.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:54.900]  And me and Daryl and members of the Adam versus the Man team will be going to Philadelphia
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:55.900]  tomorrow.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.100]  We just got back today.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:04.660]  We're here in Virginia and we will be organizing individuals who wish to demand Adam's release.
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:10.500]  We will be there for when they set the bail and we will get Adam out of custody as soon
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.780]  as possible.
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:19.840]  And when we do, be sure to give Alex Jones and info Wars first dibs and show you support
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.620]  because whether or not you support Adam Kocas, this could be a friend of yours.
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:26.940]  This could be you that they illegally detained.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.620]  We need to stand up now before it's too late.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:29.620]  People.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:30.620]  We need to stand up.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:32.580]  He's saying he's going to March on DC.
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:35.820]  He's had a quote federal park in Philadelphia.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.580]  And then now normally the feds would hand him over to local police if they claim something,
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:42.580]  they disappear him into a federal building when he's done nothing.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.620]  This is a federal kidnapping.
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.620]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:45.620]  It is indeed.
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:46.620]  It is.
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:47.620]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.900]  I just want to thank you for shedding light on this important.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:50.900]  No, no, no, no.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:51.900]  Please don't thank me.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.900]  Listen, we're all hanging together.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:53.900]  Hang separate.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:54.900]  Let's get back to this.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.900]  You were there.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:56.900]  We've seen the video.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:57.900]  He's standing there in a suit.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.900]  They come over and grab him.
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900]  He puts his hands up.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.180]  They throw him on the ground and then he goes to jail.
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.860]  I mean, that's, that's like Russia or something.
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:05.860]  Yeah.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.100]  Also, it's, it's kind of funny.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:11.180]  I saw people who got arrested and then were released with citations.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:15.860]  I saw people who were detained and then released without a citation.
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:24.260]  But I guess if you're a man demanding or calling for an armed revolt on DC, you get a little
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.340]  bit of a special treatment.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.340]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:28.340]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:34.780]  I mean, I got to say that this is really creepy because how did it start?
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:36.180]  He's just standing there.
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.180]  That's what we see.
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.180]  And they grab him.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:42.460]  I mean, Adam, Adam was the keynote speaker and he was delivering the final address and
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:45.580]  we were, we gave the call for everyone to light up.
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:47.900]  One person had already been arrested.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:54.060]  And all of a sudden these goons in funny costumes with shiny badges came in, kidnapped our boss
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:55.060]  and friend.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:56.500]  Well, they take people's kids with badges.
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:57.500]  Maybe it's okay.
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:59.940]  Maybe, maybe anything government does is okay.
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.580]  That's actually what the officer at the police station told us.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.580]  He's an adult.
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:07.580]  Don't worry about where he's at is what she told us, angrily yelling at us.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:10.820]  And we're just politely trying to get information on our close friend.
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:12.220]  She said, he's an adult.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:13.220]  Are you a lawyer?
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.220]  Don't worry about it.
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.220]  Don't worry.
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:18.380]  We need to have you on for a full hour tomorrow and take calls here.
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:22.460]  Cause I put you at the end of the show and I didn't even realize that it was even worse
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:23.460]  than I thought.
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.060]  And see, this is kind of normal in America.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.060]  Yeah.
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:28.060]  You go to a rally to speak and you're not even smoking pot.
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:31.220]  You just disappear and you disappear into a federal building.
[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:32.220]  That's just how it is.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.540]  You know, Hey, where'd Bob go?
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.620]  Oh, he disappeared one time.
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.620]  Don't worry about it.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.620]  NDAA.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:41.100]  I want to get you guys shut up to take phone calls tomorrow and hopefully Adam will be
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.100]  back.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.100]  But maybe he's at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:45.100]  I mean, you know, unbelievable.
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:46.660]  In full wars.com folks.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.820]  The resistance starts there.
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:58:18.100]  Never give up.
