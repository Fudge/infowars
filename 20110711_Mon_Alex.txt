[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:32.240]  Texas Alex Jones well we've got Jennifer Jones popping back in with us
[00:32.240 --> 00:40.160]  from court side Arizona the Arizona Republic has the headline here in my
[00:40.160 --> 00:48.000]  stack court side officials reject mayor's martial law claim now the mayor
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.800]  is saying that they reportedly are saying that they want martial law there
[00:54.800 --> 00:59.160]  but they're now denying that I remember in Milwaukee five years ago or four
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.400]  years ago the city council in closed session discussed martial law you want
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.600]  to have them raise taxes you want to do recalls of them well they'll just declare
[01:08.600 --> 01:13.680]  martial law never have elections again I guess she's popping in Jennifer Jones
[01:13.680 --> 01:20.280]  one of the activists who's been arrested even when she's has time on the roster
[01:20.280 --> 01:25.560]  to speak at citizens communication this is a microcosm what's happening in
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.520]  court side of what's happening across other towns and cities in the United
[01:29.520 --> 01:32.760]  States and of course with the federal government it's called out of control
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.440]  bureaucrats and people in government who think they're God so she's gonna be
[01:38.440 --> 01:41.520]  popping in briefly with an update on that maybe we should get the mayor on
[01:41.520 --> 01:46.280]  that's probably also would be a good idea to try for that also dr. Jerome
[01:46.280 --> 01:49.720]  court seat will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the second hour
[01:49.720 --> 01:57.400]  to give us an update on birth certificate gate birth or gate and some big new
[01:57.400 --> 02:02.280]  developments there and then Stefan Malinu researcher political activist
[02:02.280 --> 02:07.400]  libertarian slash anarchist he'll be joining us to talk about the state of
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.440]  the world economy and where he sees civilization in society going via video
[02:12.440 --> 02:20.300]  connection coming up in the third hour today now interspersed with all these
[02:20.300 --> 02:26.960]  guests today we're gonna be talking about a huge issue well we've got actually a
[02:26.960 --> 02:34.520]  huge plate of issues here France tells Libya rebels to seek peace with
[02:34.520 --> 02:38.600]  Gaddafi so it looks like they're beginning to bulk at a ground war or
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.120]  this just may be on the surface but Italy a month ago called for a ceasefire so
[02:44.120 --> 02:48.360]  this is a big deal we're gonna be breaking that down obviously Syrian
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.640]  protesters attack US French embassies after ambassadors visited opposition
[02:53.640 --> 03:02.200]  stronghold so things are heating up on that front I have reserved comment on
[03:02.200 --> 03:09.800]  the whole Rupert Murdoch hacking scandal and the shutdown of a very old
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.280]  newspaper the news of the world a very old tabloid but I'm because I wanted to
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.480]  gauge things and do some more research but I do have my breakdown and take on
[03:19.480 --> 03:27.360]  that today we've got Bachman really taking the lead in key battleground
[03:27.360 --> 03:33.480]  states like Iowa for El Presidente with Mitt Romney and Ron Paul right behind
[03:33.480 --> 03:43.080]  and Bachman is better than Pailin but at the end of the day it doesn't matter
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.360]  because it at a certain point of bureaucracy could care less what a
[03:46.360 --> 03:50.120]  president does or doesn't do and if a president doesn't directly confront
[03:50.120 --> 03:56.240]  government drug dealing government weapons shipments like Ron Paul has done
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.360]  and doesn't address the private Federal Reserve and called for its
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.040]  abolishment then it doesn't matter everything else is window dressing
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.600]  that's why it's Ron Paul or nobody in a way it'd be better to have Obama for
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.200]  four more years than a Michelle Bachman because she would mean well that they
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.360]  manipulated then they would blame libertarian or freedom style folks for
[04:18.360 --> 04:24.200]  her failures and her neoconism which is not freedom based imagine what four
[04:24.200 --> 04:28.520]  more years of Obama will do government will be universally hated and
[04:28.520 --> 04:32.000]  distrusted as it should be and we'll get back to some common sense founding
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.600]  father principles I don't want Obama to be back in I want Ron Paul but at a
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.720]  certain point we don't need to compromise with Michelle Bachman or
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.680]  anybody else for that matter and Mitt Romney there's no compromise he's a
[04:43.680 --> 04:51.920]  gun grabbing open border lovin Obama health care takeover writing globalist
[04:51.920 --> 04:57.360]  and Al Gore praises him of course for loving carbon taxes oh yeah he's for
[04:57.360 --> 05:00.080]  that as well stay with us
[05:04.080 --> 05:10.040]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[05:10.040 --> 05:14.920]  says that the state is God the United States is now recognized globally as one
[05:14.920 --> 05:19.560]  of the most oppressive police states on earth this film conclusively proves the

[07:19.640 --> 07:24.080]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.760]  May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in

[08:15.920 --> 08:22.080]  we've got a big report with our top story today coming out in t-minus one
[08:22.080 --> 08:28.880]  hour at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com I stayed up late last
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.960]  night doing more research to confirm the pattern and we've got two special video
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.120]  reports so that'll also be in the article going up at info wars dot com
[08:39.120 --> 08:45.960]  Obama establishing dictatorship now I want to be clear here the executive
[08:45.960 --> 08:52.760]  branch has been eroding the power of not just the states but of the legislative
[08:52.760 --> 08:58.320]  that's the Congress as well as the courts but to a certain extent the
[08:58.320 --> 09:01.960]  executive is teamed up with the courts in their war against the Bill of Rights
[09:01.960 --> 09:06.000]  Constitution and Declaration of Independence and so this is a
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.360]  dictatorship of the bureaucracy and special interests that finance and
[09:13.360 --> 09:17.640]  control elected representatives and they have been enshrining in the
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.760]  presidency what other oligarchies have done throughout history in every
[09:22.760 --> 09:30.080]  culture Mesoamerican Chinese Japanese African Middle Eastern Roman Byzantine
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.960]  before that Greek Persian it goes on and on and on that's why oligarchies like
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.760]  kings or dictators or strong men Carol Quigley Bill Clinton's mentor at
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.720]  Georgetown head of political science who wrote the thousand page book tragedy
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.240]  and hope only a thousand copies printed for the State Department CIA so that
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.120]  they could understand that the left-right paradigm was fraudulent in fact I meant
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.440]  to pull up this morning we pull up Carol Quigley quote on how both parties are
[10:03.440 --> 10:09.400]  controlled and to get into the specifics of the quote you know he and the
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.480]  whole books about this that that that both parties should not oppose each other
[10:13.480 --> 10:18.120]  in reality only on the surface and so there would only be degrees of
[10:18.120 --> 10:25.200]  differences within a very narrowly defined spectrum and that over time they
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.640]  would be able to transfer power completely into the executive and that
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.760]  that was the plan of Wall Street controlling Big Pharma Big Agra the
[10:35.760 --> 10:41.120]  Pentagon through global deals and globalism worldwide standardization of
[10:41.120 --> 10:47.560]  policies to shut down all competition that is not part of the inside coterie of
[10:47.560 --> 10:52.640]  globalist and you can see that happening today of course because the book
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.160]  was government funded the plates got out well first one of the books was
[10:58.160 --> 11:01.920]  obtained quickly later wrote books about it and admitted yes I wrote that for the
[11:01.920 --> 11:05.680]  government yes I was allowed into the private corporate annals that run the
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.800]  government I believe world government is good the public is too dumb to be free
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.320]  we're doing a good thing for you and he wrote public books like the Anglo-American
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.760]  establishment and others but but this is a fact that this is how the world works
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.800]  you can read the books written by Gary Goldwater where he publicly exposed this
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.760]  corporate fascist corporate is system that's the opposite of free market and
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.080]  what he called crony capitalism which listeners have pointed out and I agree
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.880]  with him should be called crony collectivism or elite sponsored crony
[11:39.880 --> 11:50.360]  collectivism okay now the big news today is that Obama is accelerating the
[11:50.360 --> 11:58.920]  process and it's hidden in plain view of the executive completely disregarding
[11:58.920 --> 12:04.920]  Congress Ron Paul a month ago gave a speech titled the last nail in the
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.960]  Republic's coffin and he said if they're able to continue this war in Libya then
[12:09.960 --> 12:13.160]  we were two plus months and now we're three and a half months in if they're
[12:13.160 --> 12:19.760]  able to continue this war in Libya and Congress has as has filed lawsuits on
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.200]  Obama they have said you've got to come to us for authorization we'll even give
[12:24.200 --> 12:28.120]  you authorization we love war we're totally corrupt remember we launched all
[12:28.120 --> 12:32.200]  these other wars before you were bought and paid for by the same people just we
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.680]  want to maintain and be relevant or why will big defense contractors even
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.040]  finance our campaigns to be their slaves if you run everything you know we want
[12:43.040 --> 12:49.800]  some of the power here at the mafia table and Obama said listen I don't need
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.000]  you let me reissue a letter I'm doing this for the credibility of the UN
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.400]  that's a quote I don't need to talk to you I'll do whatever I want that is what
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.120]  Caesar did when he began to take control the Roman legions without
[13:06.120 --> 13:14.760]  senatorial authorization in the Roman Empire 2000 plus years ago that is what
[13:14.760 --> 13:23.600]  they did what 2030 you know 2040 years ago so that's what he did that's taught
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.920]  in any mainline history that's tyranny that's tyrannous you read about third
[13:28.920 --> 13:33.960]  world dictators in Latin America Africa Eastern Europe Asia who will get
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.800]  elected and then start dissolving the power of the parliament they keep the
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.720]  parliament or the Congress there but but but but basically anybody that doesn't
[13:43.720 --> 13:47.840]  go along with it ends up having dying in plane crashes or being arrested for
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.680]  corruption Saddam Hussein did the same thing when the US put him in as the head
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.560]  of the Baptist Party in 1979 this is how it's all done we've been through this
[13:57.560 --> 14:01.760]  thousands of thousands of times throughout history they found the
[14:01.760 --> 14:06.200]  quickly quote please put it on screen the argument that the two parties should
[14:06.200 --> 14:11.600]  represent opposed ideas and policies one perhaps of the right and the other of
[14:11.600 --> 14:19.040]  the left is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrina in or doctrinaire
[14:19.040 --> 14:25.640]  and academic thinkers instead the two parties should be almost identical so
[14:25.640 --> 14:29.720]  the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without
[14:29.720 --> 14:39.080]  leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy source tragedy and hope
[14:39.080 --> 14:46.440]  1968 written for the Department of State to be delivered to high level CIA
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.880]  section chiefs so they could understand what they were doing over a thousand
[14:51.880 --> 14:58.360]  pages I suggest you read it and what first in the early 70s one leaked
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.280]  patriotic grips got it made a few thousand copies then later plates were
[15:03.280 --> 15:06.840]  stolen this is good patriots on the inside you don't want to be total
[15:06.840 --> 15:09.720]  slaves you look at your children you know that'll wake you up to join the
[15:09.720 --> 15:13.560]  side of light and and gets away from darkness and now there's a whole bunch
[15:13.560 --> 15:17.640]  of publicers that put them out because it again was government funded so there's
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.960]  no real copyright plus quickly didn't want to make a stink out of it because
[15:22.960 --> 15:27.080]  that would then bring attention to it this is a manual on how to enslave
[15:27.080 --> 15:33.480]  people and make them think they're free now it's been bad since the killing of
[15:33.480 --> 15:38.040]  Kennedy with the executive grabbing power and again it's the bureaucracy and
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.280]  if you look at all the major agencies there a revolving door of the former
[15:42.280 --> 15:50.200]  CEO's presidents top vice presidents people the top ten layers or more in
[15:50.200 --> 15:56.200]  every major fortune 100 company they rotate in and out of every federal
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.400]  agency every federal bureaucracy that's why the health care laws written by the
[16:01.400 --> 16:06.040]  insurance companies on record to rip everybody off the carbon tax laws written
[16:06.040 --> 16:12.760]  by big oil to then shut down their competition that's why a big agra openly
[16:12.760 --> 16:16.600]  writes the food safety acts to where they're exempt from everything but small
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.680]  farms are literally swat team for no reason and you can't bake your neighbor
[16:20.680 --> 16:27.560]  a strawberry pie literally this is total bondage to shut you down what do you
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.640]  expect these mega corporations to do they're ruthless they're hyper competitive
[16:31.640 --> 16:36.440]  they're non-free market they want what is the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty
[16:36.440 --> 16:43.560]  stay competition is a sin he wrote that in his own autobiography competition is
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.840]  a sin of the monopolist we're fighting monopolist monopolist we're not
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.000]  fighting communist we're not fighting socialist we're fighting monopolist who
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.720]  you we've been falsely taught in school that fascism is the opposite of
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.640]  communism no it is true communism and that's why what ten years ago the
[17:03.640 --> 17:08.880]  Chinese president BBC headline Chinese communism is the greatest expression of
[17:08.880 --> 17:14.840]  capitalism and the article made fun of him no no that was Veritas that was the
[17:14.840 --> 17:21.040]  essence of truth Chinese communism according to the model of capitalism
[17:21.040 --> 17:24.800]  that isn't free market that we have because they interchange labels this
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.320]  crony capitalism this crony collectivism Chinese communism is the greatest
[17:30.320 --> 17:34.440]  expression the top generals the top families the million or so party
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.120]  officials of the billion and a half people in China they own and run
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.120]  everything and they are just billionaires wallowing in palaces while the
[17:43.120 --> 17:49.440]  people starve to death that is communism under the Russians communism giant
[17:49.440 --> 17:55.160]  villas race horses hundreds of mistresses total gods in the inner party in the
[17:55.160 --> 18:00.920]  Duma absolute rulers total control working with Armand Hammer the Rothschilds
[18:00.920 --> 18:05.280]  the Rockefellers building all the big plants that is see they tell you
[18:05.280 --> 18:09.480]  communism exists they tell you the answer to the bankers the answer to the
[18:09.480 --> 18:13.360]  robber barons the answer to the corruption it's everything you've been

[24:23.200 --> 24:27.120]  prison planet calm the big report that Paul Watson and I've been working on
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.280]  since last night is going up with the videos that I've already shot that are
[24:31.280 --> 24:37.400]  on the Alex Jones YouTube channel Obama establishing dictatorship is one of
[24:37.400 --> 24:42.200]  them and then if you expand there's another Obama attempting to set up
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.320]  dictatorship I shot two different videos now understand people are going to say
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.360]  oh you said that was happening under Bush you said it was happening under
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.360]  Obama now I've always been clear they are transferring power to the federal
[24:55.360 --> 24:59.800]  government they are destroying the Republic they're destroying checks and
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.400]  balances with Homeland Security TSA destroying 10th Amendment rights from
[25:04.400 --> 25:07.920]  reptiles you eight years ago TSA would start being on the streets because I
[25:07.920 --> 25:12.320]  watched them on c-span say that was their plan and to buy or sell or have a
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.480]  job you'll have TSA authorization on your ID card to buy a gun you'll have
[25:17.480 --> 25:22.760]  authorization what did Obama announce on Friday we now have the details from
[25:22.760 --> 25:27.720]  even the NRA's on website and the Huffington Post praises it Obama to
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.360]  sign an executive order and to do it Rahm Emanuel we have that in our video
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.320]  reports called for when he was a congressman and as a chief of staff a
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.160]  no fly no buy they that was always the plan I saw under Ridge this isn't just
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.840]  Obama folks they were talking about this eight years ago on c-span with the TSA
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.480]  and Governor Rich and I've since pulled up the original transcripts and articles
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.240]  and proven all that so they're telling us what they're going to do the
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.800]  Huffington Post and an article Obama to unveil gun control reforms in their
[25:59.800 --> 26:06.320]  future they the White House spokesman says that don't worry this is stuff we
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.040]  can all agree on that's mind-controlled we can all agree I'm gonna come to your
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.360]  house and you're gonna sign the deed over for nothing to me we all agree I'm
[26:14.360 --> 26:18.960]  gonna come over to your house and you're gonna give your model wife to me Bob we
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.680]  all agree that you're going to give me all your jewelry we all agree on that
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.960]  you're like oh we all agree see it's all a spin golly mind control move and
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.520]  that's the way they're spinning and oh it's just some reasonable executive
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.400]  order to add some things into the instant check and not that you're a
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.880]  felon or even a misdemeanor but that we think you might have mental problems
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.480]  after Jared Lee Loftner because there's crazies like him now you've all got to
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.400]  give up your rights and we're gonna put you on magic list like no-fly list and
[26:50.400 --> 26:55.320]  they go on to say still executive actions offer something that legislation
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.360]  doesn't guaranteed results man getting tough and as one gun control advocate
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.520]  told the Huffington Post there are ways to quote use these administrative
[27:04.520 --> 27:09.480]  changes to obtain similar results and he's gonna order the Attorney General to
[27:09.480 --> 27:15.040]  just restrict more international guns legally being shipped in also they
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.400]  tried last year in Texas right through to California, Nevada, Arizona, New
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.600]  Mexico remember telling gun shops you can only sell one gun now and they said
[27:24.600 --> 27:29.000]  but that's not the law and they said well we're telling you because of US guns
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.640]  going into Mexico causing violence turns out they were the one shipping a man 30,000
[27:33.640 --> 27:38.840]  guns most the media keep keep saying 1800 but if you go to Reuters and the
[27:38.840 --> 27:43.720]  court filings now this is Reuters US agents slam guns sting effort on Mexico
[27:43.720 --> 27:50.080]  border of the nearly 30,000 firearms recovered in 2010 where gun is
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.880]  possessed some 70% were determined to have come from the United States and it
[27:54.880 --> 27:59.960]  turns out most of those from the ATF shipment so there you go and and the
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.360]  truth is most the guns you do find in Mexico that are from the US the normal
[28:03.360 --> 28:06.920]  semi-auto and stuff that's things that Mexicans get illegally to protect
[28:06.920 --> 28:10.920]  themselves the cartels are using fully auto grenade launchers armored vehicles
[28:10.920 --> 28:15.760]  okay and the people are trying to defend themselves and oh you can't do that so
[28:15.760 --> 28:21.240]  continuing here Obama to unveil gun control reforms in the near future and
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.600]  guess what he's going the executive route Obama can't get his internet
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.240]  kill switch passed in cybersecurity so what have they announced earlier this
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.040]  year they're going ahead with it and the four branches of the military to go
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.080]  ahead and just take over the web and do whatever they want and quote set up a
[28:39.080 --> 28:44.440]  new separate internet as the former head of the CIA Hayden set up the weekend
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.960]  to quote another second internet for government and trusted users to stop
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.480]  hackers and the Stuxnet worm which they admit the US and Israel launched they
[28:53.480 --> 28:57.640]  publicly launch it admit they launch it tacitly and then you've got to lose your
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.000]  internet freedom and you've got to be taxed of internet ID and go into this
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.240]  new controlled internet as they shut the old one down because they launched the
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.400]  Stuxnet they actually say we've got to do this because the Stuxnet by the way we
[29:07.400 --> 29:13.480]  launched it we ship the guns in Mexico we launched the Stuxnet we stage the
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.840]  Gulf of Tonkin ha ha ha we'll do whatever we want they just caught a CIA got
[29:17.840 --> 29:22.000]  two months ago that's even in Associated Press now giving radioactive material to
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.400]  the Taliban in Pakistan trying to get them to blow stuff up so they could
[29:25.400 --> 29:29.360]  then blame the Pakistani military for it as a pretext to invade those guys but
[29:29.360 --> 29:33.160]  when we come back I want to get into all the other ways the executives power
[29:33.160 --> 29:38.680]  grabbing guns carbon taxes healthcare waivers the companies that are
[29:38.680 --> 29:45.400]  insiders the war not consulting Congress I mean are you getting it I mean and
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.040]  mean the Congress people are calling this a dictatorship that's what it is
[29:49.040 --> 29:55.240]  let's call it what it is we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.240 --> 30:02.640]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.640 --> 30:07.080]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:07.080 --> 30:11.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.080 --> 30:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:15.040 --> 30:19.040]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.600 --> 30:27.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.640 --> 30:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:35.040 --> 30:39.400]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:39.400 --> 30:42.560]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[30:42.560 --> 30:46.200]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[31:12.560 --> 31:16.840]  the Americans at home I've turned in members influence on our president in
[31:16.840 --> 31:21.960]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[31:21.960 --> 31:27.000]  us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.800]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[31:31.800 --> 31:35.800]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[31:35.800 --> 31:39.960]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying

[33:21.080 --> 33:30.080]  Ron Paul Congressman Nadler even Senator Franken Congressman Kissenich they've
[33:30.080 --> 33:35.560]  all come out and said that a dictatorship of the executive is being set up
[33:35.560 --> 33:41.080]  Ron Paul called it the last nail in the Republic's coffin Congressman Nadler
[33:41.080 --> 33:48.320]  senior Democrats said that Obama is becoming a king or emperor but again we
[33:48.320 --> 33:53.160]  been wrong all these years about dictatorship and martial law being set
[33:53.160 --> 34:02.880]  up there they're never going to call it dictatorship they're never going to
[34:02.880 --> 34:09.080]  call it martial law but when the states and even the Congress tell the
[34:09.080 --> 34:13.120]  president not to do something and he goes ahead and does it and says I don't
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.440]  need to to talk to you when in the Constitution the Congress is the boss
[34:18.440 --> 34:23.120]  they're not co-equal that's a more modern propaganda and then they've moved to
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.560]  telling you the president's the boss if you read the Federalist Papers and and
[34:27.560 --> 34:33.240]  other founding debates it's a hundred percent clear Congress is numero uno
[34:33.240 --> 34:39.960]  legislatures are numero uno they are the law givers next is the court that that
[34:39.960 --> 34:46.760]  that checks the law to see that it's constitutional and next is the minion and
[34:46.760 --> 34:52.560]  that's the executive that's the executive that executes whether it's the
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.000]  governor or whether it's the president whether it's the mayor it's the same
[34:57.000 --> 35:05.120]  thing now if you look at what's going on with Obama and the executive it's
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.800]  crystal clear Congress controls the purse springs the power of the purse and
[35:11.800 --> 35:18.560]  the purse strings the Congress levies war declares war launches military
[35:18.560 --> 35:25.760]  actions or defense of the border and what has Obama been saying in the last
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.080]  year he says I'll launch any war I want and I don't even need to talk to
[35:30.080 --> 35:35.960]  Congress he says I'll set up carbon taxes to the bureaucracy and I don't
[35:35.960 --> 35:41.320]  care if Congress voted down our carbon taxes two years ago and again a year
[35:41.320 --> 35:48.200]  ago I don't care I'm going to order the EPA to do it I don't care if Congress and
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.520]  that's actually in these articles the White House frustrated that Congress
[35:52.520 --> 35:57.840]  won't pass more quote gun control that is victim disarmament oh Hitler took the
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.360]  guns Stalin took the guns the first gun control laws in this country were
[36:02.360 --> 36:06.240]  enacted after blacks attained their freedom on paper at the end of the
[36:06.240 --> 36:10.520]  Civil War with the Emancipation Proclamation and the first gun laws
[36:10.520 --> 36:17.000]  were passed from New York State to Kansas to Florida you name it that blacks
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.320]  could known guns or they had to pay a fee to get a minute it varied state to
[36:22.320 --> 36:29.120]  state but the point is the first the ATF who had been whiskey regulators that's
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.240]  why they were so famously corrupt because they would come shake down your
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.120]  still if you weren't paying taxes on the local whiskey were making a moonshine
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.520]  and they became notoriously corrupt because you could pay them off they
[36:40.520 --> 36:48.120]  suddenly started enforcing gun laws oh yes they weren't even called ATF then
[36:48.120 --> 36:54.240]  they were called federal whiskey tax assessors and enforcers the first federal
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.760]  armed agents outside of the US Cavalry and here they come and boy they'd kick
[37:00.760 --> 37:04.200]  down those black people's doors and they'd come in there and they'd find that
[37:04.200 --> 37:09.200]  shotgun and they'd say boy you think you're allowed to own a gun and that was
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.880]  that gun but we go right in those teeth you don't have a shotgun to protect
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.000]  yourself from the Ku Klux Klan when they come a riding to shoot up your
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.080]  house and burn it down because there were cases the black folks getting guns
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.680]  getting together and defending themselves you don't do that we're gonna
[37:25.680 --> 37:31.600]  take your guns didn't you read the fine print of the law we passed
[37:38.200 --> 37:44.280]  this is the type of garbage that we're dealing with and facing and so he says
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.000]  he's coming out with executive orders and and and other bureaucratic moves
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.720]  including putting you on a no-gun buy list when you have no criminal record
[37:51.720 --> 37:54.880]  and that's when they're playing for three years even before they got in
[37:54.880 --> 37:58.000]  office you know manual set it as a congressman and then as the chief of
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.680]  staff and now that's what they're saying they're gonna do and the oven can
[38:00.680 --> 38:06.840]  post praises they say wow we like this executive power we really really really
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.560]  like it and you notice there's time magazine newsweek CNN all these
[38:10.560 --> 38:17.560]  publications I covered it a few weeks ago on the 4th of July demonizing the
[38:17.560 --> 38:25.960]  entire Constitution and saying it's trash get rid of it and they've got the
[38:25.960 --> 38:30.800]  CNN host the rest of them all the council on foreign relations coming out
[38:30.800 --> 38:35.440]  against that evil Constitution with the right to defend yourself the right to
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.440]  have private property that your home is your castle that no one is above the law
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.360]  fair weights and measures no indentured servitude all these horrible things that
[38:45.360 --> 38:51.160]  they demonize 24 7 say what you want about the founding fathers this was
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.240]  their ideas didn't even mean they implemented it all when they got into
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.840]  power the point is it's the idea that has flowered and that others looked at
[38:59.840 --> 39:07.600]  and picked up so continuing here Obama says he doesn't need Congress to pass
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.120]  cybersecurity he's just implementing the internet kill switch and takeover system
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.800]  on his own the Pentagon now is admitted they've built their own private
[39:15.800 --> 39:19.080]  internet they're gonna force you on to where you have no rights associated
[39:19.080 --> 39:22.760]  press this weekend as we told you a decade ago from the internet to documents
[39:22.760 --> 39:25.000]  that are public they tell you what they're gonna do that's what's so
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.920]  frustrating now continuing what it what did Obama say over the weekend but it
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.040]  didn't go over too well we covered this yesterday he came out and he said if the
[39:34.040 --> 39:41.000]  states well that goes back to the Civil War he said we will use a clause in the
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.720]  14th Amendment used against the states and and and members of the Congress the
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.040]  federal Congress from the states if the federal Congress does not raise the debt
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.720]  ceiling to the foreign bankers this was in AFP you name it yesterday I shot
[39:54.720 --> 39:59.080]  videos on it last night and covered it on the radio show that if you don't raise
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.440]  the debt ceiling give more to the bankers that that have hijacked the
[40:02.440 --> 40:06.040]  government and have set up this dictatorship of the bureaucracy with the
[40:06.040 --> 40:12.160]  president now the head criminal publicly the figurehead if you don't do that we
[40:12.160 --> 40:19.760]  will simply in use the powers that the president used during reconstruction I
[40:19.760 --> 40:26.480]  guess that'd be Ulysses S. Grant we will use those powers and we don't need the
[40:26.480 --> 40:29.920]  Congress so he doesn't need the Congress to launch new wars in Libya even when
[40:29.920 --> 40:36.640]  the Pentagon's own lawyers tell him he does never before done he doesn't need the
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.240]  Congress now to raise taxes and to get us deeper into debt according to them
[40:41.240 --> 40:44.720]  of course the Congress controls the purse strings they don't care he doesn't
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.400]  need the Congress to pass a law for carbon taxes he doesn't need the Congress
[40:48.400 --> 40:57.440]  to pass a law on any of these things they're just going to do it and he
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.680]  doesn't need the states anymore why even have states because he set up the
[41:01.680 --> 41:06.640]  10 governors in the governor's council Bush started this Cheney was the main
[41:06.640 --> 41:09.840]  guy who said he was above the law on a separate branch of government or remember
[41:09.840 --> 41:14.880]  that a fourth branch of government he claimed as an executive which of course
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.000]  the constitutional law scholars everybody laughed at but he still operated
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.040]  that way this started under Bush and then Obama signed the order and got into
[41:22.040 --> 41:25.560]  place where we don't talk to the 50 governors and the elected legislators
[41:25.560 --> 41:30.480]  know we now have a 10 governor council that the president picks that are his
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.920]  little lap dogs that sit over each of the 10 FEMA regions set up in 1979 that
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.240]  we told you that's what FEMA was for because it came out in 86 and Rex 84
[41:40.240 --> 41:45.560]  hearings in Congress we played the clips that FEMA was set up to be a martial
[41:45.560 --> 41:49.760]  law takeover system over the states and then in 2007 the John Warner Defense
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.560]  Authorization Act openly said we're setting this up to use the US military
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.680]  against states if governors or legislatures don't follow orders it
[41:58.680 --> 42:04.200]  actually says it and funded the entire defense department set up and North
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.760]  com which was already set up but empowered in 2007 to actually be the
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.840]  receivership arm over the states and now they have the 10 FEMA regions with the
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.800]  10 governors over it but wait there's more now the feds writing laws to shut
[42:19.800 --> 42:23.680]  down small farms and ranches are going to come in with money to buy off the
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.840]  locals and set up the quote aid agencies as their policies bankrupt you to
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.000]  pose as the good guys and then spy on rural communities get this you don't
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.960]  believe me I've played Fox News even reporting it CNN reported it and said
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.520]  how good it was CIA FBI Defense Intelligence Regular Army Homeland
[42:42.520 --> 42:49.840]  Security and Viper TSA teams in your cornfields rural councils I don't need a
[42:49.840 --> 42:57.920]  Congress I don't need states launching wars I don't need Congress carbon
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.520]  taxes I don't need Congress gun control I don't need Congress I don't need
[43:02.520 --> 43:06.920]  Congress I don't need Congress I don't need Congress I don't need Congress why
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.160]  have a stake in Congress and if we let this continue pretty soon it'll be
[43:11.160 --> 43:17.320]  Alex Jones claims that we used to have a Congress Alex Jones claims cows were
[43:17.320 --> 43:21.200]  once fed grass that Alex Jones claims that women once breastfed their
[43:21.200 --> 43:27.200]  children Alex Jones claims that birds once flew Alex Jones claims that once
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.960]  we could own guns how ridiculous Alex Jones claims we once could drive our
[43:31.960 --> 43:34.960]  own cars and they weren't remote controlled and controlled by the NSA
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.920]  and Google oh yeah Arizona just passed a law to start having the Google cars
[43:38.920 --> 43:43.200]  drive themselves in the road there goes your job that gives the globalist total
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.080]  control Alex Jones claims once the military actually fought wars instead
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.640]  of robots and drones see this is their their world where everything is taken
[43:51.640 --> 43:56.920]  over Alex Jones claims once women had children vaginally everybody knows
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.000]  that a stork came and cut women open that they were always born by cesarean
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.040]  section now more than half the children in this country are born by cesarean
[44:04.040 --> 44:07.200]  section and they're now threatening women if they won't have it they're
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.920]  taking control of the entire human biological operation all right we're
[44:10.920 --> 44:13.600]  going to a guest here a moment with some big breaking news but I'm gonna be
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.200]  covering this more next hour we got Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up with the latest
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.280]  on the birth certificate for about 20 30 minutes then I'm getting into this big
[44:21.280 --> 44:27.240]  issue and all the other news but it's here and they call tyranny liberty they're
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.280]  not gonna call it martial law or dictatorship of the puppet president
[44:31.280 --> 44:37.200]  under the bankers banker occupation bankster occupation they're not going to
[44:37.200 --> 44:44.600]  call it that they're gonna call new wars peace actions you see everything's
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.480]  upside down up is down down is up black is white white is black two plus two
[44:48.480 --> 44:51.760]  equals whatever they say it equals and if you say two plus two equals four
[44:51.760 --> 44:55.600]  you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't like being groped they now call you a
[44:55.600 --> 45:01.560]  conspiracy theorist by the TSA on record you read George Arwell where he's
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.000]  torturing Winston O'Brien is the inner party member and he's torturing him
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.360]  for months and he finally says now what is two plus two equal and he sees five
[45:11.360 --> 45:16.240]  ten twenty he goes I don't know whatever you say it's all blurred and he can't
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.960]  think anymore and he goes now you're cured I'm releasing you and Winston's
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.240]  waiting for execution but he's been released to the chestnut cafe to drink
[45:25.240 --> 45:30.600]  synthetic gin and he hears propaganda on the news that big brothers just want a
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.480]  big victory he even guesses what the lies are going to be knows it's a lie but
[45:34.480 --> 45:39.120]  still loves it and accepts it and can't wait to be killed that's how the book
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.720]  ends and that's the general public they love it they love it they love it they
[45:44.720 --> 45:48.800]  love it and they're gonna get it don't worry you want to get hurt real bad
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.720]  tyranny is here and it's growing so that's all coming up now I remember this
[45:53.720 --> 45:56.880]  a few years ago in fact we'll try to search it four or five years ago
[45:56.880 --> 46:03.960]  Milwaukee Council proposed martial law or members of Milwaukee City Council wanted
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.560]  martial law and there was all this corruption coming out and so one of them
[46:08.560 --> 46:11.680]  opened their fat mouth about putting the city under martial law in open
[46:11.680 --> 46:16.760]  session that had been discussed behind the scenes and they're not supposed to
[46:16.760 --> 46:19.600]  call it that but they've introduced this I did all the cities getting them
[46:19.600 --> 46:23.640]  primed for it and how cute and fun it is globalist sympathizers have been
[46:23.640 --> 46:26.880]  trained the threat fusion centers everywhere for the full takedown of
[46:26.880 --> 46:31.560]  America by the criminals that have hijacked DC now we covered last week
[46:31.560 --> 46:36.440]  Jennifer Jones who runs a local newspaper in court site where she got
[46:36.440 --> 46:40.360]  up in her three-minute communication communication they didn't want her
[46:40.360 --> 46:46.280]  discussing the fact that they just passed an illegal tax and so they ordered
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.560]  the police to arrest her and the mayor said she's allowed to speak it's her
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.400]  communications is being very polite and they said no and arrested her now it's
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.640]  confirmed that a SWAT team was sent to the mayor's house to take him to a
[47:00.640 --> 47:05.040]  secret meeting Jennifer Jones was there and able to eavesdrop through the door
[47:05.040 --> 47:09.440]  on part of it the Arizona Central as the Arizona Republic the big paper in
[47:09.440 --> 47:14.880]  Arizona is reporting court site official rejects mayor's martial law claim the
[47:14.880 --> 47:20.440]  mayor says it's martial law and the media is like the SWAT team only came and
[47:20.440 --> 47:30.040]  took him and so it continues in it here and we're gonna go over this they had
[47:30.040 --> 47:34.480]  an emergency Sunday session to beef up security now the police chief said
[47:34.480 --> 47:37.720]  months ago that we can't have citizens criticizing us this will cause it
[47:37.720 --> 47:41.680]  Jared Lee Loeffner so they're gonna use that to fully lock the city down there's
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.360]  areas of Arkansas under martial law the cops even call it that and you found the
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.160]  Milwaukee put that up as we go to Jennifer Jones and there it is unraveling
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.360]  the martial law rumor press buzz I remember was in the Milwaukee news it
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.080]  goes to the city council member that talked about it okay let's go ahead now
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.320]  and go to Jennifer Jones Jennifer we don't have a lot of time we appreciate
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.200]  you joining us we're trying to get the mayor on soon tell us exactly in a
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.320]  nutshell what happened okay well here here is that as quickly as I can do it
[48:10.320 --> 48:15.440]  because ironically I'm in my car on my way to jury duty of all things here's
[48:15.440 --> 48:19.760]  what happened Sunday about 11 30 in the morning the police chief and the
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.200]  sergeant and the sergeant was in his tactical gear showed up at the mayor's
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.000]  house and ordered the mayor to get into the police car and go with them to
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.920]  town hall the mayor apparently said down all that open on Sunday I'm not going
[48:31.920 --> 48:37.200]  with you anywhere and if I go to town hall I'll take my own car so he started
[48:37.200 --> 48:40.360]  calling several of us and said grab your cameras and meet me at town hall there's
[48:40.360 --> 48:45.280]  something terribly wrong so we did that and a handful of us went to town hall
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.200]  and when we got there I asked the mayor what did you call that dispatch to see if
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.720]  the police chief radioed in this called dispatch and what this is about so he
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.440]  called dispatch he asked for the county sheriff it said the nearest sheriff is in
[48:58.440 --> 49:04.600]  erinberg about you know that's about 17 19 miles away so it'll be a moment in
[49:04.600 --> 49:08.160]  the meantime we'll call to court like police officers who are on duty and
[49:08.160 --> 49:14.320]  that was officer Rodriguez and officer norris officer norris her sister is the
[49:14.320 --> 49:18.600]  town close okay so what happened we did we walked up the steps while we're
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.000]  waiting for the police and they opened the door and off as Sergeant Browstow in
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.640]  a tactical gear opens the door you can see this on the video right that's on
[49:27.640 --> 49:32.040]  on YouTube he opens the door the mayor says he has the mayor be coming in he
[49:32.040 --> 49:36.440]  looks we see all the council town manager town attorney town assistant
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.680]  attorney every wet town clerk in there looking very nervous and he says I'm not
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.680]  going in there this is an illegal meeting so they locked the door and they
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.800]  held the meeting the mayor got on the phone started making phone calls local
[49:48.800 --> 49:52.600]  realtor and I took our cameras to the glass and photographed this meeting I
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.400]  stuck my ears to the glass wherein I heard the police chief make about a 20
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.200]  minute speech about how the town had been flooded with email since your show
[50:00.200 --> 50:05.000]  he blamed it on I think the Tea Party is coming to our next council meeting and
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.200]  it's been on this website the Daily Paul and the mayor and Jennifer Jones and
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.880]  Michael Ross are trying to apparently the alleged we're trying to incite some
[50:15.880 --> 50:19.880]  kind of a riot public safety was in danger I heard the vice mayor say I got
[50:19.880 --> 50:24.960]  500 emails just yesterday I can't work like this I'm in fear we must do
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.120]  something and then to my horror I heard them call for the vote I heard them

[54:27.400 --> 54:32.280]  full thing is going up very very soon the mayor just got it the transcript where
[54:32.280 --> 54:37.680]  the martial law civil emergency was discussed they talked about comments on
[54:37.680 --> 54:43.320]  the YouTube video of Jennifer Jones on this show last Friday they had this
[54:43.320 --> 54:49.160]  emergency meeting Sunday this is now one of the major reports in the Arizona
[54:49.160 --> 54:54.120]  Republic court site official rejects mayor's martial law claim now now I
[54:54.120 --> 54:57.120]  want to get back to what you heard with your ear up against the window you guys
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.560]  were able to get some audio you're trying to boost that audio with the
[55:00.560 --> 55:04.080]  camera mic up to the crack in the door it's very hard to hear but if you just
[55:04.080 --> 55:07.400]  put it wrong the web folks can grab it and that there's audio experts that know
[55:07.400 --> 55:11.680]  how to separate it out but but regardless we now have the agenda and we're
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.800]  about to get the actual minutes of it now now specifically here you were
[55:15.800 --> 55:20.200]  telling Rob do this morning and clarify this that they went to the mayor's house
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.840]  with the SWAT team or the people in their tactical gear describe what happened
[55:24.840 --> 55:29.240]  there and what else was said because I'm talking about Obama saying Congress
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.760]  isn't needed for war gun control carbon taxes internet kill switches that's the
[55:34.760 --> 55:38.600]  big theme today because it's all coming down right now and here's this same
[55:38.600 --> 55:44.680]  attitude in court site Arizona so tell us what happened with the mayor well I've
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.400]  been here about over a decade and I've never seen any police officers wearing
[55:49.400 --> 55:53.320]  that sort of tactical gear with the big white police letters on the bulletproof
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.000]  vest and things you can see that in the video of the illegal meeting when he
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.040]  opens the door for the mayor but apparently they came to the mayor's
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.360]  house and the police chief and the duty sergeant and the duty sergeant was
[56:05.360 --> 56:09.000]  wearing the tactical gear they ordered the mayor to get into their police
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.760]  vehicle and go with them to town hall and he refused he said I know town hall
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.040]  isn't open on a Sunday and I'm not going anywhere with you if I go to town hall
[56:18.040 --> 56:22.360]  I'll take my own vehicle so he immediately started calling a group of us that he
[56:22.360 --> 56:25.920]  could reach in only a few minutes time and to bring your cameras to town hall
[56:25.920 --> 56:30.400]  and meet me there the police just came to my door and ordered me to town hall I
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.160]  don't know what's going on I have no idea what's happening now again ordered the
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.760]  mayor their their supposed boss and a lot of the cops are good folks and have
[56:38.760 --> 56:41.840]  gone public some of them are getting in trouble people at town hall that don't
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.280]  agree with this are being fired this is lawsuit city here for the type of
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.360]  political discrimination that's going on the city needs to apologize and back
[56:50.360 --> 56:54.160]  off now and oh they're watching they need to realize this is not a fight
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.040]  politically they're gonna win by screaming that you know that the daily
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.120]  poll and people are terrorist or that we're terrorist you know as the police
[57:02.120 --> 57:06.280]  chief months ago said that you guys you know we're basically Jared Lee Loeffner
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.160]  for protesting their tax rate hikes I mean they need to learn this is what a
[57:11.160 --> 57:16.760]  free republic is all about but I'll go back to what mayor Nagan just came out
[57:16.760 --> 57:21.000]  in his new book and admits now that reportedly blackwater came day one with
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.280]  guns and said we're taking over the mayor's office and he had to kick him
[57:25.280 --> 57:29.600]  out but the point is they try this power grab this is what happens in third
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.680]  world countries where the police and military just take over this is what
[57:33.680 --> 57:38.400]  Caesar did 2,000 years ago so the mayor said I'm not coming with you what
[57:38.400 --> 57:42.680]  happened next well he drove in his own vehicle to town hall while he frantically
[57:42.680 --> 57:46.880]  made phone calls and we made phone calls and rounded up half a dozen people when
[57:46.880 --> 57:51.400]  we got to town hall we saw that the police were parked behind town hall and
[57:51.400 --> 57:57.440]  we parked in the front parking lot and I asked the mayor I said what did you check
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.480]  with dispatch because dispatch for us runs through the county even town calls
[58:01.480 --> 58:07.080]  run is okay so what happened well they they told him he asked for a sheriff he
[58:07.080 --> 58:10.800]  was told the sheriff was about 20 minutes out he sent two of our court
[58:10.800 --> 58:14.160]  site police officers who were fortunately to the officers who had
[58:14.160 --> 58:18.200]  criminal complaints against the chief so we they we were happy to see them on
[58:18.200 --> 58:23.640]  duty they showed up first officer Norris was very concerned that her sister was
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.640]  inside the building her sister's the town clerk because her sister was
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.920]  supposed to be out of town and I still don't know yet if her sister was called
[58:30.920 --> 58:34.840]  and ordered back to it to take the minutes for this meeting or I'd still
[58:34.840 --> 58:38.040]  there were doing five more minutes the doctor course he's coming up but there
[58:38.040 --> 58:42.040]  you go martial law in Arizona
[58:43.360 --> 58:52.240]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network a very wealthy US citizen

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:27.520]  alex jones okay we're gonna play this clip live on air and we now have the
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:33.280]  video shot by one of the compadres of Jennifer Jones and you can watch it
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280]  again on the website that's on the video where the mayor who the police have
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:43.240]  ordered the armed police to go to this emergency meeting on Sunday the mayor of
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.320]  court site he gets there he walks up and says this is an illegal meeting and the
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.920]  cop in tactical gear slams the door why not just put gold crowns on the police
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:58.080]  chief and these other cops why not why not just literally bow down like make
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.840]  them like North Korea and then the great grandson you know decades from now a
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.320]  hundred years from now of this police chief can be you know the third or
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:09.000]  fourth king of court site and that's how North Korea works that's what the
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.600]  Queen of England is pretty soon they'll be like tabloids worshiping the police
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.720]  chief and you know his wife's gowns or something I mean that's what royalty is
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.880]  it's just people that take over and put a crown on he worship him so here's the
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.200]  mayor first ordered there he gets there and doesn't like what's going on so
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.760]  they slam the door in his face this is martial law going on that they've
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.560]  declared in court site Arizona here it is
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.320]  are you coming in or no I'm not coming in this is an illegal meeting it was never
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.400]  announced
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]  be posted
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.400]  there you go
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.240]  and there's Jennifer Jones she was later able to you can see the meeting
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.280]  halls right in there she was able to put her ear up there and hear them read the
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.480]  proclamation so even the martial law emergency proclamation is secret
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:08.240]  boy there and now they've told the the Arizona Republic this isn't going on
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.440]  what's gonna now happen that they've gotten the copy of the proclamation
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.200]  Jennifer well you know that's that's what we're trying to find out we the
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.600]  proclamation itself we don't believe is legal but when you're two hours from the
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.840]  Capitol and nobody wants to rush out here in any big hurry we you know the
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.440]  question that has been a concern for us is what is the police chief going to
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.320]  think he has the power to do until the real world punch the time clock this
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.680]  morning and you know we can start making what's wrong what's wrong with with
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.960]  making these council members and the police chief king I mean I mean that's
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.040]  a good system I mean they're talking about getting rid of the Constitution our
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.080]  media I think you're an extremist I okay so I mean please now I think it's good
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.800]  they sent police to the mayor's house and ordering there I mean this is freedom
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.240]  and I think you're an extremist Jennifer Jones now expanding listening to the
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.680]  door what else did you hear them say about the civil emergency aka martial
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.480]  law well you know they might say extremist I say Patriot but what I heard
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.760]  them say was the police chief was the only one who addressed the council he's
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.040]  our lord he gave about a 20-minute dissertation referring to the video
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.320]  going viral that that we saw my arrest referring to statements the mayor made
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.160]  about how the next council meeting was going to be just as exciting referring
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.680]  to myself by name but to the Republican briefing committee man Michael Ross by
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:38.360]  name saying that we have created a situation where danger is imminent and
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:44.040]  and it's a an emergency situation we must do this we must do this and he said
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.360]  that because of the threats via email in reaction to the video thousands of
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  emails pouring in from your listeners and and some of the other stations and
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.000]  some of the blog sites and such that the tone of the emails was threatening and
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.440]  they had to do this to protect public safety well I agree with that I mean I
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.920]  mean I'm glad I mean look when they arrest a woman for speaking in three
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.080]  minutes citizen communication with the mayor saying let her speak that's
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.560]  freedom and and and and again Jennifer all you people that are upset about this
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.400]  ought to be ashamed of yourselves well you know here's the thing Alex if they
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.320]  really want to protect public safety they need to step down and resign
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.760]  immediately because we never had these sorts of public meeting we never even
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.560]  had a need for police at the meeting until they started acting beyond the
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.560]  scope of what the country clear they don't want you up there talking about
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.720]  taxes they've passed that according to you and others aren't properly passed or
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.240]  legal and they're there telling you to shut up I mean this is pure tyranny it
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.480]  thank you so much we'll check in with you in the mayor tomorrow as this as this
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.160]  develops Jennifer let me say bye to you during the break we're gonna get that

[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.520]  news no sooner have they gotten the second banker robbery known as a bailout in
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.480]  Greece hundreds of billions of the bankers again on derivatives they
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.600]  created we get we bail them out then pay interest to them on the money we give
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.560]  them can't make that up good business if you can get it if America and the rest
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.800]  the world's busy watching Dancing with the Stars and the World Cup that's all
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:55.400]  coming up gold silver exploding in prices also there is now no doubt the
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.560]  governor's councils the rural councils Obama launching the Libyan war and
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.920]  saying I don't need congressional approval carbon taxes without congressional
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:09.480]  rules against our industries now they're announcing is gonna have executive
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.640]  orders for a no-gun buy list just like no-fly list what his former chief of
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.200]  staff called four years ago we've played that video here we have special
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.560]  reports up that have just gone live at info wars.com and prison planet.com on
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.720]  this subject Obama establishing a dictatorship now he may leave the point
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.640]  is Ron Paul congressman Nadler a big Democrat they've all called this
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.120]  tyranny the last nail in the coffin Obama's becoming an emperor that's what
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  it is now he may leave office but the precedent is set for this power grab so
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.280]  it's here it's happening and it's incredible so we're gonna be discussing
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.480]  that coming up at the bottom of the hour as well somebody who's written about
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.240]  this for the last six years he saw it happening under Bush people said oh Dr.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.400]  Coisey the martial law didn't come the point is it's that slow creep just like
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.200]  the Roman Republic towards absolute tyranny but now it's not a creep it's a
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.680]  gallop and in even the Pentagon told Obama you've got to go to Congress for a
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.000]  new war even the Pentagon that presidents never ignored those lawyers and
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.080]  there's the headline Emperor Obama to use war powers against the Congress now
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.760]  he even threatened over the weekend 14th amendment and said what we used
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.480]  against the South in Reconstruction when when when members of the South in
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.760]  Congress wouldn't go for the incredible war reparations on the South
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:39.820]  President Ulysses Grant just ignored it so now the president controls the
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.720]  purse strings the president controls the wars the kill switch the governor's
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.680]  councils all of it in fact I want to get Dr. Coisey to talk about that first
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.560]  because I know he's a political scientist worked in banking and he's been
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.360]  worried about this for a many years wrote the late great US Sam the subject
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.840]  will get into the big new Obama developments with Dr. Jerome Coisey
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.600]  but do you concur with my analysis Ron Paul's even the portly Nadler big
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.240]  Democrat that this is really dangerous what's happening I think it couldn't be
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.920]  more dangerous this is the this is a power grab at the dictatorship but the
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.960]  presidency I'm like anything that's ever happened in our history and I'm sure
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.720]  you go back to parallels then you know the Civil War with Abraham Lincoln
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.840]  spending you know various rights Dr. speak up for me start over Dr. Coisey
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.000]  and then start over I think there's a tremendous power grab Alex I think it's
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.160]  one that's unprecedented in American history and what you've got what we
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.840]  should all fear is like you say once the power is in the presidency it's never
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:50.680]  going to be reversed it'll be now you know George W. Bush had executive orders
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.760]  that extended emergency powers now Barack Obama's extending presidential powers
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:02.400]  that would normally be emergency powers in situations that are not emergency but
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.760]  the crisis is going to continue to develop I mean we're now on the edge of
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:13.200]  Europe saying the Greece can actually default on some of its debt and if
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.400]  Greece starts to default on its debt the next strategy that's going to be put
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.200]  into place in the United States default and that's some of our debt and we're
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.120]  entering into a great depression that I think will make the previous great
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.360]  depression of the 30s look mild and by the way you predicted this a decade ago
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.200]  in one of your best-selling books you've written so many on the subject
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.120]  America for sale was really about this whole situation developing and in fact
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.080]  I was saying it was inevitable that we were at the globalist were creating the
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.160]  situation on purpose in order to push us into a one-world government the solution
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.600]  of all this is going to be to destroy the dollar like George Soros has wanted
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.560]  to do for decades it's going to be put the International Monetary Fund at the
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:05.640]  World Bank control the world economic situation and I continue to say you
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.880]  people got to read America for sale because my point there is that this is
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:15.560]  not a recession or a depression this is what globalism looks like the jobs are
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.160]  gone structural unemployment in the United States where cheap labor is
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.840]  exploited if not in China that an Indonesia or whatever part of the
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.920]  world it can be found in that's going to be the future for the foreseeable
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.560]  future of the world economy and the American middle class in the process is
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.520]  going to die out was intended to die out absolutely the middle class the
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.480]  historic enemy of oligarchs and crony capitalist I want to get back into that
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.160]  if we have time but you join us today because there's been a lot of big
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.280]  developments on the whole hunt for the real birth certificate right they
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.520]  originally of course said that as receipt was the original that no bank vault
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.160]  copy existed then magically the new one came out that looked like it had been
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.400]  done by a three-year-old where do we stand now well with the evidence is
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.240]  increasing in fact I'm writing a series of stories this week and next week to
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.800]  show that the Obama birth certificate was forged using the Nordite birth
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.440]  certificate and a couple of others that we now have as template I'm going to be
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.760]  able to show the cut and paste job of the transformation of the information
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.480]  occurred lifting the information off existing birth certificates modifying
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:39.720]  it cutting and pasting it to put into the Obama birth certificate and the
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:48.120]  forgery is now obvious we've had experts and the adobe software are they best as
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.800]  weighed in she supported Doug Boyce analysis he is a typesetter was owned
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.680]  a scanning company since the 1990s the document the White House presented was
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.680]  not a scan of an original document and I still doubt that there is any original
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:10.160]  birth certificate of this nature in the Hawaii vault I don't think it exists I
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:16.760]  think of the PDF electronic file the White House released was the birth
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:22.480]  certificate that's the file it was used to create the forgery and from that file
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.520]  the copies the Xerox copies that were handed out of the White House including
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.400]  the one that supposedly had the seal on it were printed from that PDF file they
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.680]  were not Xerox or copied or scanned out of an original in the Hawaii vault I
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.280]  don't think it exists and if it does I challenge the Hawaii Department of Health
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.560]  to release the best evidence of document the document itself and submit it to
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.440]  independent forensic examination that's never going to happen because the
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:59.840]  document itself does exist dr. Corsi we haven't talked in about a month where is
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.040]  the lawsuit for $285 million against Esquire going and for those that don't
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.440]  know recap what Esquire did well Esquire once my book was published where is the
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.280]  birth certificate Esquire within the first hours came on out they said in an
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:23.760]  article did not identify itself as a any kind of a spoof or satire that Joseph
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.960]  Farah the publisher of WorldNet Daily had decided to pull the book because now
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.920]  that the birth certificate had been released there was no need for the
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.080]  book and that we was being reduced to pulp taken off the shelves and it just
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:43.160]  wasn't true the book was not pulled back became a New York Times best dollar it
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.240]  looks like we'll sell that we're headed towards 100,000 copies being sold the
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.480]  book is sold very strongly since it was in print but undoubtedly when they did
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:01.120]  that and and and they offered for you to refund the money at retail that would
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.720]  bankrupt you guys because you know you sell the book for like eight bucks to a
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:11.440]  publisher or or to Amazon or to Barnes & Noble they sell it for $24.95 so they
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.640]  were also putting out a business announcement to basically create the
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.320]  perception that there was a a run on the book a reverse run to dump the book
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.520]  and undoubtedly this had to have hurt sales what did hurt sales and in fact I
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.520]  was on many radio interviews where the radio announcers believed that the Esquire
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:37.560]  was true how the interview started out by saying you know what happened that
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.400]  Joseph Farah pulled your book I said no it didn't happen at all that way that
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.600]  was completely an Esquire lie and I think it was what the White House had
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.240]  wanted to happen this was their their plan I think quite frankly Alex is that
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.080]  they thought that if in fact the White House did this stunt of releasing a
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.360]  birth certificate I'm quite sure my book forced the White House to hand and
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.880]  caused them to release this forgery on the the book would be pulled I think
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.280]  that and if the book had been published perhaps by a major New York house
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.320]  maybe the New York house would have pulled the book they might have been
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.000]  right they might have there's not might have worked at the White House but
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.160]  we're not daily we've held that we continue to report this story the birth
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.280]  certificate is an obvious forgery 100% I'm not 100% certain that the forgery and
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:32.280]  now I'm naming the documents that it was forged from and we will be now naming
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:37.520]  the various people involved in the forgery about to expose the entire
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.800]  network of what's called the OBOT the Obama radical supporters who have been
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.120]  plaguing the website their own websites and all others trying to cause
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:53.040]  disruption harassed anybody as a birther who dares to question this wasn't true
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.280]  they wouldn't have been acting so suspicious for three years and Obama
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.400]  spending 2.2 million to block the release of the long form they said
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.600]  didn't exist precisely on this document existed why wasn't it released three
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.800]  years ago why didn't the American people see this right away and the evidence
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.400]  is increasing that Obama was not born in Kenya I've published the Kenyan
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.960]  documents of the Kenyan government where the Kenyan government told the Bush
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.200]  administration that the they believe in Canada the Obama birth certificate was
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.880]  criminally removed from the records criminally and by the way it shows the
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.320]  Bush administration was so into this that they were quietly looking into it
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.960]  correct and you would think that that would now be big news but they use the
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.720]  hoax of announcing that your book had been pulled to just try to close the

[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.560]  next segment we'll be gone at 40 after then I'm getting into all the economic
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:16.800]  news that is off the charts important I do want to show prison planet TV viewers
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.080]  and invite radio listeners to go to info wars.com it is a detailed report that I
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.800]  worked on last night and this morning right through into the show with Paul
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.120]  Joseph Watson titled Obama is establishing an executive dictatorship
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:38.560]  with the total proof war on Libya gun control debt ceiling carbon taxes Obama
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.200]  care Obama's rural council Obama's council of state governors internet
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:50.200]  kill switch and more this is a super red alert we're gonna do a Google bomb
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.520]  right now I haven't done this in over a month they set up algorithms where a
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.200]  lot of key terms are hard to search now if we do something archaic it'll go to
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.240]  number one every time if we use something big you know that's common sense
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.840]  for them to put and they admit they've done this into their system they'll try
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:13.480]  to block us let's search the term Obama dictatorship two words into Google search
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.240]  engine let's hammer them Obama dictatorship over and over and over again
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:26.880]  Obama dictatorship Obama dictatorship also search as a secondary search term
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:32.200]  Obama establishing so two search terms Obama dictatorships one put that in by
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.720]  itself and then Obama establishing and we'll see if they're blocking his name
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.680]  as well because anything we do goes number one but now if not with an archaic
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.200]  term tomorrow something that isn't in their lexicon because we've been
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.880]  testing this now we were always a hundred percent successful now if it's a
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.400]  common term they're blocking it this is a short segment a little bit more time
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.680]  coming with dr. Corsi dr. Corsi you dropped bombshells on meter and the
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.080]  break I said man they were really scared of this that you know he pulled that
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.640]  stump right as your book came out and I said do you see the whole bin Laden
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.440]  thing as an opportune way to smoke screen as well and you concurred that
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.000]  these were October surprises that they were saving for the election but had to
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.440]  pull now break it down dr. Corsi well I think the Obama administration had
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:19.200]  planned that the birth certificate issue would surface just before the election
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.800]  in November 2012 and they'd spring on a public with no time to analyze that the
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.200]  forgery that had already been done it was being held for the right time and
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.720]  also the second October surprise I think we forced the Obama administration to
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:39.800]  use was to kill Osama bin Laden I think they have had trapped him in a hundred
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  of Osama bin Laden down they could have killed him any day they wanted but
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.080]  instead of having these two big news stories at just before the November 2012
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:56.160]  election as October surprises to propel Obama into office my book where's the
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.440]  birth certificate being published was so threatening to the White House that they
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:06.160]  had to use early these two prepared October surprises we forced their hand
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  and I've been told that directly by inside information that leads directly
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  back into the White House dr. Corsi I know you have a lot of sources inside
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.440]  government the military I know you've worked for the federal government
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.000]  encounter terrorism let's just say you've got an intelligence type background
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.320]  what is the word because obviously you know they lied about bin Laden fighting
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.640]  back they supposedly threw him in the ocean they had DNA released before
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.520]  anybody could release it they admit they faked the White House situation room
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.960]  photo that was admitted three days later that was totally fake the whole thing
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.880]  was a lie what is the information you have the information I have is that
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.840]  bin Laden died of kidney failure a long long time ago well you know again it's
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.360]  gonna be very hard to prove any of these things if I've been focusing 100% of
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.000]  the birth certificate I can tell you the birth certificate the forgery it's a
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.200]  thought that was made up and I can tell you exactly when it was done it was done
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.520]  right after Governor Abba Comby could find nothing and they was in the
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.080]  newspaper saying I couldn't find anything right and when that word came out
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:19.880]  and then just before February 24th I got called by my sources in Hawaii one of
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.800]  the the malls that we've had within the Hawaii Department of Health went in and
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  looked at the logbook and suddenly the Obama fake birth certificate had been
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.680]  inserted into the logbook so it's a fake document it was created as a fake
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.440]  document the whole thing is a manipulation it's a big big lie the
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.480]  Hawaii Department of Health is still issuing long-form birth certificates to
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.440]  people who want to pay for them this whole idea that was a special permission
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.040]  and the Obama lawyers had to go out to Hawaii and get special dispensation to
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:58.040]  pick up the birth that's all nonsense within three weeks before the Obama
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.400]  birth certificate was released I've got copies in my files of long-form birth
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.880]  certificates that were sent by the Hawaii Department of Health to people who
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:11.600]  paid $10 fees to get them the whole thing is a lie and I'm confident now
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.160]  that my book that where's the birth certificate is so threatening to the
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.520]  Obama administration information in it about the Obama lies about his past and
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:26.320]  who he is is an undocumented president we get in but the lies continue you know
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.640]  I've proven that the Obama mother and father did not live together as a man
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.880]  and wife now we got this immigration file coming out and it's clear that the
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.880]  you know the immigration department in where Obama was born doubted the mother
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.520]  and father were married or absolutely and the Kenyan government's on record
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.440]  saying somebody stole the records of Obama and Kenya stay there a few more

[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.760]  it tomorrow with our kick term because I'm almost sure that's what's happening
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.560]  now and if it's our kick it'll go to number one we've done it like 50 60 times
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:23.040]  in a row number one they announced they changed their algorithm I've been
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.200]  sitting here entering it in before and you had it flash up and say please enter
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.880]  the code below to make sure you're not a spam bot which is what the government
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.960]  admits they do to our sites with their disinfo and so we're just hitting them
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.880]  and in driving this to number one Obama dictatorship hit them and hit them hard
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.920]  now going back to dr. Corsi where is this going with Donald Trump because he
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.840]  helped bring it all to a head got an early copy of your book you talk to him
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.040]  some national media made fun of you and said dr. Corsi claims Donald Trump's
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:58.280]  talk to him I mean like oh you could never talk to the great God himself
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:04.080]  trying to again impune just totally ridiculous well Donald Trump called me
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.640]  number a number times and he was always pumping for information I'm convinced
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.840]  Donald Trump was working with Barack Obama it's all about money Alex by the
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.560]  way you predicted he would magically get the authorization from their man in
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.960]  Chicago in Chicago land Rahm Emanuel and magically he's getting the casino
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.160]  now that's what it was all about it was about that also getting a big payday
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:35.520]  from GE remember GE films about 48% of of NBC along with Comcast and GE of
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.840]  course sits about that Obama's right-hand side WNBC and NBC extended
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.680]  Trump's contract for two years with the apprentice I think that was worth a
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.480]  hundred million dollars to Trump and now he's getting the casinos so Trump came
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.360]  out and said I want to see the birth certificate then of course when Obama
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.320]  released this fraudulent Ford's birth certificate on April 27th Donald Trump
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.000]  said well that's good enough for me and I told Donald Trump he told me after that
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.880]  and he said again Trump repeated that he thought that the birth certificate was
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.040]  a Ford's document told me that twice it called calls after April 27th that his
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.360]  golf course designer a computer expert had called Trump and said the
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.280]  documents that I'll be a forgery and I said to Trump if you believe that then
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:27.320]  get out there and demand a forensic examination of the original document in
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:33.360]  the Hawaii vault Trump would not do that well again for their scripting they
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.000]  had to build a chair crescendo then have him act like he was discredited he
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.680]  creeps off right as your book comes out and then as folks start looking at that
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.600]  boom out pops the bin Laden all scripted admittedly all lies we just don't
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:50.760]  know what the truth is I mean this is so incredibly obvious that they are
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.080]  scared to death of what's in your book by the way we have it a discounted
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.040]  excellent book you'll learn so much more in the book and and they want to defeat
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.200]  it of course he said other books that sell half million copies this one only
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.000]  a hundred thousand that makes it a New York Times bestseller obviously we need
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.880]  to get this book out to everybody and attack their dirty ops their their dirty
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.240]  tricks the things they try to do to kill this get this book get it out to
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.320]  everybody you know it's available at info wars dot com and bookstores
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.600]  everywhere as well but again Dr. Jerome our course in PhD where's the birth
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:26.560]  certificate the case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president all of
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.680]  this scripted for right when the book came out on record showing they're
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.480]  scared of it absolutely incredible we've only got a few minutes left with the
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.920]  doctor we appreciate your time any other little little giblets or tidbits when
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.360]  are you going to name the names well I'm starting to now I'm going to say I was
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.760]  probably tomorrow world that daily that the Nordike twins document with the
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:55.400]  major template used to to create the forgery I'm not going to stop on this
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:01.280]  at all until we expose the truth that's the greatest cover-up in American
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.080]  history now got a felony committed in the White House forged document that
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.800]  Obama is to the self-responsible for part of the chain of evidence in order to
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.440]  stay in power all stage manipulation of the news to try to defeat my book where
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.000]  is the birth certificate prevented from being read prevent Americans from
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.240]  knowing the truth which is an Obama is not eligible to be president well in
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:30.280]  closing we wish you Godspeed and obviously as this begins to develop in
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.000]  the next week or so we want to have you back up just in the next few days just
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.520]  as soon as you're ready please have your assistant email us and we'll schedule
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.440]  in just a 15 minute pop in because I know you're busy the final question is on
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.640]  another subject but it goes to credibility if I'm a prosecutor and I've
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.280]  got a convicted liar up on the stand who I believe committed the new crime I'm
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.080]  going to bring up the fact that they've been caught lying over and over again
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.280]  and Obama has made Richard Nixon look truthful Bill Clinton look like a choir
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.760]  boy I mean there's no doubt this is a new level of deception and lies where it's
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.440]  just an ocean of lies where the truth is not there so it's it's it's hard to
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.080]  even get a frame of reference but Attorney General Eric Holder has now
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.480]  it's come out and even the Associated Press of all places but isn't getting
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:20.640]  the attention it needs I wanted you to briefly speak to this that the FBI the
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.720]  DEA not just the ATF were involved in Fast and Furious that it was tens of
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.440]  thousands of firearms not 1800 that it has been used to kill cops and other
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.680]  people and then it was going to be used as they were already doing a year ago
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:36.320]  before this was known to demonize the Second Amendment right as he now
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.800]  announces his new no fly no buy type deal to restrict firearm ownership of
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.800]  America and so you have an administration constantly engaged in
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:53.200]  perjury what's your take on how big this is to have this going all the way to
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.160]  the Attorney General and his own rats now because they've been caught lying in
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:00.360]  their own documents that Congressman Issa and others have gotten that they're
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.240]  now turning on the Attorney General I mean this is this is huge it's huge and
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:09.560]  it goes right to the Oval Office the this whole Fast and Furious as well as
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:15.600]  the forging of the birth certificate is Obama's doing and I'm now convinced it
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.960]  will be able to disclose that probably next week that a White House unit has
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.840]  been responsible for the old boss the White House has coordinated this attack
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.800]  against the birthers the entire thing is misinformation it will be classically
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:36.160]  KGB almost as if Obama's entire life and careers in intelligence operation as
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.280]  the misinformation and peruse for my father's work begins it's filled with
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:43.640]  lies I expose that and where's the birth certificate well that's what all the CIA
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.720]  people and NSA folks I've had on they say when you look at Obama it's all a
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.400]  fake history going back decades clearly and then the whole family's in
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.400]  different intelligence agencies that this guy is a purely manufactured
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.200]  creature the question is who does he work for well and why can't we get the
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:04.120]  documents why can't we get the travel record the passport record the school
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.840]  record Obama is an undocumented worker in the White House and that's a classic
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.280]  intelligence cover-up what I pointed out is now the cover-up is continuing
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.960]  they're forging birth certificate documents they're lying about their role
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.680]  the fast and furious the entire Obama administration is the line I don't tend
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.120]  to stop Alex until we exposed fully who's responsible for creating this
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.760]  forward birth certificate and the responsibility lies in the Oval Office
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:44.440]  well dr. Corsi in conclusion here do you agree historically and and looking at
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.400]  this that this makes the administration even more dangerous that they're being
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.120]  opposed on their Libya war for constitutional reasons yes and Alex
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.800]  there's we'll be able to announce the working with the group of a military
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.240]  they're about to call for a congressional investigation the Obama
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.600]  White House should be very concerned about how far they're pushing our US
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:10.240]  military and should be understanding that people whose careers have been built
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.560]  here on service in the United States they're not going to see budget constant
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.360]  disrespect to the military and simply stand by there's going to be military
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.240]  calls for an investigation of this administration and they're coming very
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.280]  quickly it's organizing but more than that his his his frontal assault on the
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.200]  Constitution so he doesn't need Congress for taxes he doesn't undead ceiling he
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.680]  doesn't need them for gun control he doesn't need Congress for new wars I
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.520]  mean if this is off the charts I've never seen anything move this fast and I
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.480]  see that as a sign of desperation it is and the mainstream media won't report
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:48.760]  it the American people I think are set up with the mainstream media it shows
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.640]  like yours Alex at the work we're doing a world net daily this is where the real
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:57.480]  reporting is going on and where the real truth is being told our Constitution
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.520]  has never been in more danger than it is today all right dr. Corsi where's the
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.640]  birth certificate available at info wars calm thank you for joining us great
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.480]  pleasure always Alex thank you all right thank you folks I'm telling you we're
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:13.760]  in grave danger I told you three and a half months ago when they had Al Qaeda
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:19.120]  start attacking Gaddafi that's on record now that that they either force
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:23.280]  them to strike Europe back and they would call that terrorism and then use
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.760]  that to take our liberties or they would stage something and now Gaddafi is
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.680]  saying I'm gonna attack Europe if you don't stop attacking me he's played
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:35.600]  right into their hands and they meant he'll do something they'll stage
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.280]  something got all these White House advisors saying a terror attack would
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.680]  sure help us on record and we want a domestic attack to blame it on Glenn
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.880]  Beck and Alex Jones I mean even Glenn Beck covered that he said he's gonna be
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:54.040]  blamed for the new Oklahoma City no if you read all those thinly veiled threats
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:58.120]  and media matters and it's it's Glenn Beck and Alex Jones are gonna cause the
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.040]  next attack and then the very advisors are saying gee a new attack would sure
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:07.320]  help us you got those two things I mean they think we're so stupid you think
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:13.040]  it's fun to be on the White House enemies list you think it's fun to have
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.000]  them trying to set us up for a new OKC but but it's it's because we're what
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.280]  we're doing is defending the Republic if you let criminals run things folks the
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:28.280]  sky's the limit they're not gonna stop okay okay I want to get into the
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.280]  economic news then I'm gonna get into the whole martial law situation and
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:37.400]  that's what we're creeping into now actually jogging into and the good news
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.400]  is but again they play possum a lot it's a psychological warfare tactic the
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.240]  White House announced today okay they won't try the civil war powers of
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.320]  reconstruction against the federal Congress because so many scholars laughed
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.080]  it out with the you know didn't pass the laugh test that it was just so brazen
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.200]  oh I don't need Congress for spending now I'm the president
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:03.600]  Ulysses S. Grant did it by the way Lincoln wouldn't do that so he did he
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.520]  wanted to be friends with the South he wanted to not have a brutal reconstruction
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:11.560]  in a Versailles treaty you know style raping and to have Obama say I'll just
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.840]  use civil war powers on the federal Congress what he's like I don't need you
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.760]  for war I don't need you for taxes I don't need you for kill switches I don't
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:24.920]  need you for gun control I don't need you for carbon taxes I don't need you for
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.240]  governor's councils I don't need you for rural councils I'll do whatever I want I
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:35.520]  mean it's so naked as Ron Paul said a month ago this is the last nail in the
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.360]  Republic this war stuff going to war without telling Congress I don't even
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:44.280]  want your support Congress like here we'll give it to you no I want to set
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.800]  the president it's like when he sat violating article one section nine when
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:57.240]  he sat sat on the rotating council as the head of the UN Security Council
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:00.360]  that's why they had all the UN officials there Henry Kissinger was almost
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.840]  crying this was such high treason the president serving as the head of the UN
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:11.040]  at the same time that's in my film fall the Republic all right I'm gonna get
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.280]  into all of it getting into economic news here again it's off the charts
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.760]  Obama's saying they're gonna go ahead with the debt increase regardless of
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.200]  world stocks down a renewed EU debt concerns of course as soon as they
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.480]  further bankrupt agrees now they're moving on to Italy and Portugal it was
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.000]  always designed that way and then you'll get more trillions of our money and
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.640]  then it'll just keep dominoing right towards the rest of Europe England the
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:42.400]  United States Geithner says hard times to continue for many and he says some of
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:50.240]  the hardest times I'll meet the press yesterday in WNBC Geithner tells NBC's
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:55.640]  meet the press that it's very tough economy he says that for a lot of people
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:59.240]  it's going to quote feel very bad harder than anything they've experienced in
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:02.880]  their lifetime now for a long time to come there goes your hope and James this

[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:25.040]  raise the debt limit so we can shore up our economy how do you shore up your
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.840]  economy by going further into debt it absolutely makes no sense everything's
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.400]  twisted backwards upside down and moving in reverse it just doesn't make
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.840]  sense Alex the only thing that makes sense is to pick up that video series

[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.200]  the phones at the last 30 minutes with him Obama is establishing an executive
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.240]  dictatorship I'm coming to that in just a moment and those aren't just words
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.280]  this is really happening by not even stealth anymore they're just doing it
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.040]  out of the open and it's extremely extremely dangerous but going back to
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:16.040]  Ted Anderson Ted and we've got links to it up on info wars calm Geithner quote
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.400]  for a lot of people it's going to feel very hard harder than anything you've
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.240]  experienced in their lifetime now for a long time now so the banksters have
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.680]  gotten their tens of trillions they've now bankrupted Greece Ireland they're
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.000]  now moving into the continent they'll hold the next group of nations hostage
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.320]  saying give us trillions more or the whole thing will implode they give them
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.000]  trillions more the next group is imploded it's in the IMF World Bank
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.680]  documents it's always been the plan I've been covering this specifically what
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:46.840]  they would do for 12 years I mean it's all a program it's all a blueprint it's
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:53.160]  globalism as Dr. Corsi said earlier in the hour and he's an economist Ted yeah
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.680]  it sure is globalism I mean we're putting this country into debt perpetual
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.280]  debt like like like the forefathers of this nation had talked and described as
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.040]  they were setting up the Constitution of the United States of America why do you
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.600]  think they called for silver and gold to be money and why do you think they
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:13.040]  wanted to stay away from a central bank well now the central bank is becoming a
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.800]  world bank and they want us to pay world taxes and you know it it is it's
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:22.080]  become a globalist system they want to control everything and the people are
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:27.520]  going to be ending up being serfs we'll be you know we are gonna we're just you
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:30.440]  know that we're gonna be working for taxes and that's it there's just gonna
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.200]  be nothing left we're all gonna be standing in soup lines if we keep going
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.040]  this direction and it doesn't have to go this direction it's all about this
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:42.440]  printing press that's going on in Washington DC and a whole bunch of our
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:46.160]  elected officials becoming dependent upon it and every time they implode
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.360]  another country gold and silver goes up even in a dead time for golden silver
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:52.800]  like the middle of the summer this is happening when folks call for the
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:56.600]  specials tell them it's a radio special they got a whole list of things that are
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.800]  super discounted because Ted already has very competitive prices on his regular
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.360]  deals but with the radio specials he buys it when it's low sells it when it's
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:08.440]  high at the old price they got a whole list of silver dollars half dollars
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:15.880]  gold coins European US they got it all 800 686 2237 tell them it's the Alex
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:20.880]  Jones radio special but Ted I wanted to at the end of this hour show viewers and
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.440]  for radio listeners go to the mail online the Daily Mail Peter Mandelson
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:29.080]  parties with his super rich chums again he's the Bilderberg minion that
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.280]  actually runs England the prime minister's his his his his creature and the
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:38.360]  security guards definitely don't want you to see him it was for Nathan Rothschild's
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.000]  birthday party they had multi hundred million dollar yachts their own private
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.080]  island super models out there with them and meanwhile Nathan Rothschild runs the
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:54.520]  big carbon exchange with Al Gore openly saying with his cousin David Rothschild
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:59.040]  and Prince Philip and Prince Charles on record you you shouldn't be able to take
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:03.560]  a hot bath and shouldn't be able to have a car for the earth and you should pay
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:09.200]  them carbon credits so they can do this I mean this is a sick joke it is it's
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:12.880]  bringing back serfdom is what it is I mean the regular people the common
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.720]  people are gonna end up with nothing we're gonna end up paying taxes through
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.520]  this carbon thing and it's just way out of hand Alex I mean people need to wake
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.880]  up they wrote in the 60s with the Club of Rome that it was a joke and they had
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:28.480]  to cook up something to tax a basic part of the life cycle and then meanwhile
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.760]  they're just laughing at us and have all these idiot Hollywood people running
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.200]  around promoting it that Anderson thank you so much for joining us we'll be

[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.920]  little kid stuff all right what we do here and NBC this is real radio in
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.800]  New York City so let me let me see you try to say it and you say it like I say
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:38.840]  it w w w NBC I'm sorry so ridiculous it reminded me I I got hired in talk radio
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:49.240]  without even trying I was doing access TV and they just were going to talk at a
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:52.760]  station and call got me on they were real radio guys who'd been on the radio
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.040]  nationally and they and they gave me the job and then about a year and a half
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.120]  into that they took better jobs and let me tell you the company hired people the
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:06.200]  program directors last job had been in a B suit as the promotions person at
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.240]  Little Mitty station knew nothing about it and he would call me in and tell me
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.480]  how to say the call letters it was the same thing and I'd sit there and I'd
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.280]  listen to this not that I knew anything about radio I just knew about
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:22.920]  information I'm a real guy and it was not fun oh boy you know over the years you
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.040]  begin to sound more like a radio broadcaster just because you talk so
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:29.800]  much you get a cadence people think radio is this certain sound really the
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.160]  radio sound was 70 year old guys that have been smoking two packs of cigarettes
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.360]  and drinking Jack Daniels their whole life and I didn't get it from really
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.000]  cigarettes and Jack Daniels well maybe a little bit years ago I mainly got this
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.080]  deep voice always had a little bit of one but a twang on top of it from screaming
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.640]  at political events and never taking voice lessons and actually coughing blood
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.320]  up a few times I was screaming so loud tearing my larynx so that's how I got
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.680]  the 75 year old whiskey drinker cigarette smoker voice by the time I was
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:03.240]  about 30 okay now I'm digressing into things that don't even matter every one
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:10.360]  of these stacks of news is off the chart insane I caught a number what does that
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:17.200]  mean you just popped in my ear and you said I caramba oh I caramba is the
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.800]  B-suit guy in the Simpsons I don't know about the Simpsons I've probably seen

[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:31.120]  long since it's been on one of the longest running TV shows so that will
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:34.640]  have since middle school it's 20 something years yeah I don't know all
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.880]  these things I just know there's that one kid in there that goes his breath
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:47.200]  smells like dog food okay now I start thinking about morning zoo programs and

[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.680]  be happy laugh a lot but I can't because there's a bunch of crooks trying to rob
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:21.160]  me so instead I researched their crimes constantly and get angry here's an
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.800]  example they knew 20 plus years ago when they were approving the latest types of
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.600]  cell phones that they caused massive brain tumors and here's two news
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:35.560]  articles on it today here's one from Fox News cell phones cancer and infertility
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:40.040]  and they go through the studies of how it destroys your fertility and gives you
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:45.840]  brain cancer and how they knew all along so it breaks it all down but again I'm
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.560]  just a conspiracy theorist pretty soon conspiracy theory will just be able to

[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:52.520]  Google search term today Obama dictatorship Obama has announced he's
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:56.280]  doing carbon taxes without Congress passing it he's doing internet kill
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:59.600]  switch that letting the Pentagon take over the internet without Congress
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:04.240]  passing cybersecurity he is launching a Libya war and expanding it getting
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:08.360]  ground forces ready even France said in the war in the US is in the news saying
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:12.840]  no will continue without Congress's approval just all completely
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.600]  unconstitutional totally illegal the Pentagon even told Obama he set up the
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:20.680]  governor councils the rural councils under FEMA with the Department of
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:26.240]  Defense and CIA and Homeland Security and TSA to operate in rural areas spying
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.440]  on citizens all announced I mean they're actually saying this no who even needs a
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:37.280]  Congress who even I mean Obama is who even needs to go to church you can just
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:42.000]  worship Obama like the dear leader Kim Jong-il and now his son that'll be three
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.120]  generations why not Obama's daughters can you put crowns on them but don't
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.960]  worry this isn't a dictator of the personalities a dictator of the
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:55.880]  corporate communitarian collectivist who collectivize our wealth through
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.840]  government control who farm us as Stefan Malinu talks about really that goes
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.280]  back to Animal Farm Eric Blair aka George Arwell and that's what it is
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:07.600]  that's what the most ancient societies were about who was the smartest the best
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:12.680]  hunter that's who the small tribes would follow then the priest class was
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:19.240]  developed and they learned not how to hunt good or build but how to manipulate
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:24.520]  the humans so it's a subgroup of humans operating in a predator class way
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.760]  against the rest of us and building a false environment for us from cradle
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:33.800]  to grave so that we will go along and perpetuate the parasitic oligarchy now
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:40.600]  our article Obama's establishing a executive dictatorship is one of the
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.280]  most important in a long time you notice more and more I used to say very
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.400]  important once a year now I said every day because stuff gets crazier and crazier
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:49.720]  but you read this article I put together with Paul Joseph Watson with the two
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.240]  videos I shot last night up here on the subject and it goes over the whole thing
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:58.520]  gun control by executive order he's now announcing oh yes victim disarmament
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.440]  war in Libya without congressional approval debt ceiling he says he'll use
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:07.480]  civil war powers on the Congress like their southern states that's AP you
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:11.720]  can't make this up I was pinching myself last night when I saw this carbon taxes
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.560]  Obamacare Obama's rule councils Obama Council of State Governors internet
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.000]  kills which that's just some of the examples we're doing the search term
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.640]  Obama dictatorship put it in those two words over and over again in the
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:28.040]  secondary search Obama establishing to lead them back to this article we always
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:31.280]  succeeded in the past now it looks like they've got a big list of popular terms
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.160]  that are blocked so we'll see if this works if not I'll do an archaic term
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.800]  tomorrow that's very rare and it'll be number one and but we're almost this is
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:42.240]  one of our last tests here to see since they changed the algorithm so help us
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:45.320]  out with that now going for the rest of the hour and we'll take some of your
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:52.240]  calls the last 20 minutes at 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:12:00.800]  Stefan Molyneux is a blogger essayist author and host of free domain radio series
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.040]  of podcasts he's written numerous articles and essays which have been
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:07.920]  published libertarian lew Rockwell dot-com any war dot-com and he's done
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:13.440]  over 1800 podcasts self-published and he's coming out with a bunch of books as
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:19.240]  well so he joins us today as promised I wanted to get him back time flies be a
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:23.680]  video Skype and there's so much to discuss but I'm in a few minutes I want
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:33.840]  to play the WNBC know the NBC piece with Geithner over the weekend where he
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:39.640]  came out in fact I'm looking for the exact quote here Geithner on meet the
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.640]  press and said for a lot of people it's going to feel very hard harder than
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:47.000]  anything they've experienced in their lifetime now for a long time to come so
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.080]  he says this is the worst thing in our lifetime this recovery is so good Stefan
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:56.680]  and if you say this engineer global depression is not a wonderful recovery
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:02.200]  you are a conspiracy theorist Stefan that's a very sad but true Alex it's
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:07.320]  good to have an extremist on with us what do you make of the fireworks going
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:12.320]  on in the economy the police state all the bizarre behavior I mean the ruling
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:16.600]  class is going insane well you know what it is Alex I mean my training is in
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.520]  history and it's like a grim rewind to the last days of the Roman Empire you
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:24.680]  could slap Togus on these guys and it would be pretty much a frame-to-frame
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.200]  repeat where you get the imperial presidency you get the continual
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:34.680]  withering of Congress into a sclerotic kind of money-grubbing taxpayer
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:39.720]  raping kind of institution so this growth of charisma this growth of
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:44.360]  dictatorial powers this stepping over any last remnants and shreds of
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:49.320]  constitutional a legality is all been played out before and I hope I hope I
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:52.400]  hope we learn enough from this phase in history that it's just not going to
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.720]  happen again we can hope hope hope for the best that way well that's what's
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.480]  horrifying anybody that's ever cracked a history book knows that excesses by
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.480]  corrupt elites using government power are legion and that liberty is the rare
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.240]  jewel that must be defended as Thomas Jefferson said I don't think the general
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:15.360]  public realizes that governments always go to complete excess and turn our
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.680]  wonderful lives into living nightmares well and another thing that's
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:23.320]  interesting as what you can see going on in Europe is a very fascinating thing
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:27.280]  which we talked about the last time I was on that when government is at some
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.480]  point restrained or controlled or minimized all it does is it opens up
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:34.320]  the free market the free market generates wealth the government then uses
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.800]  that excess wealth as collateral to borrow more and so you can see the Irish
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:42.320]  tiger of the 90s has now become one of the biggest debt-ridden countries in the
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.680]  EU Portugal has had a 10-year very successful end of the war on drugs you
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:49.960]  think that would give them lots of extra money no they're also going down
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:53.880]  mootie has just downgraded Portugal's banks to junk status because we have a
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.240]  war going on between the US dollar and the euro about which one is going as
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:01.960]  late watching King Kong and Tyrannosaurus Rex go at each other with
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.560]  chainsaws it's which one is going to fall first so there's a few extra dollars
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:10.760]  like Mothra and Godzilla that's right except the special effects are even
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:14.240]  cheesier and the subtitles are even worse but yeah oh wait a minute wait a
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:21.040]  minute you know that bin Laden thing was real there's no lies here and you can
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:24.640]  see of course what happened when they're shipping drugs to sorry they're
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:30.080]  shipping weapons to Mexican drug lords yet again we have another example of the
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.760]  people who are supposed to protect us arming our enemies just as they did
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.720]  with the majority in the 80s and just as they did by giving lots of money and
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:43.240]  and aid to the Soviets during the communist look at their using al-Qaeda
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:47.280]  against Gaddafi right now right Gaddafi and one of the reasons Gaddafi was
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:50.840]  invaded was he sitting on one of the largest gold stores in the United in
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:54.120]  the world unlike the rest of the countries which seem to be conveniently
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:58.520]  ignored if you look at the economic drivers of this current economic
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:01.800]  collapse one of the reasons of course is that the baby boomers are about to
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.480]  retire so they have to kill the system because there's simply no money there
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:08.760]  so they have to create this emergency in order to get people to accept reduced
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.080]  circumstances they have to create these wars to create these artificial
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:16.640]  emergencies and unity they have to fight against other currencies that are
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.320]  gaining ascendancy in the general fear that the euro or some other currency is
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.880]  going to become the de facto trading currency for oil if you just peel away
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.760]  the surface layers it's all about control of fiat currency control of the
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.760]  population and of course it's our hope as as thinkers and communicators that
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:35.440]  we can give people this red pill and have them wake up no matter how startling
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:40.680]  it might be let me ask your opinion or your educated view on this I didn't
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:44.920]  know this but it's been linked on drudge all day a drudge report calm down the
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.920]  middle of the article they had the latest video of the six-year-old boy being
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:55.320]  groped once and crying so they double groping to you know really teaching as
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:58.960]  he's crying I think my children would cry this was happening I mean they don't
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:03.560]  like strangers I mean I mean that's a normal instinct but TSA lied to law
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.440]  makers still conducting pat downs why do they say in November and again in
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:10.920]  April that they're not doing pat downs and they said they'd stop doing them
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:15.080]  and they told Congress a month ago that it had stopped and it's intensifying I've
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:19.520]  witnessed it flying recently what is this tactic of lying is it just to set
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.000]  the precedent that they're gonna lie in plain view and they don't care yeah I
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.960]  mean that's that old joke how do you know a politician is lying there's a
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:32.000]  microphone around and that is the way it goes that these people are sociopaths
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  they're pathological there was a study that was done recently and it's sort of
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:40.200]  not funny though it is funny in a way which said that serial killers have
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:44.000]  similar characteristics psychologically to politicians with the exception that
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.920]  we don't give serial killers aircraft carriers nuclear weapons and endless
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.480]  prison systems to incarcerate their victims well that's actually what you
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:57.640]  know in high-level criminology that actually they call them what high
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.280]  functioning psychopaths tend to actually get into government there they
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.640]  don't start killing and stuff until they get that immunity and that power and
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:11.360]  that's why the Stalin's the Hitler's the Mao's are the Norman history and a
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:15.720]  Thomas Jefferson is the exception right and so one of the characteristics
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:18.840]  sociopaths is that they're consistently lying the second is that they look for
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:22.320]  whatever weak spot you have and will exploit it for their own gain and one
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.320]  of the things that's very true of the West and I think this is very true of
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.440]  Americans Americans are very very generous people they they give a lot to
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:31.920]  charity they really want to help the poor and so the sociopaths in power say
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:36.240]  ah you care about the poor do you well we'll take care of the poor and then
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:43.680]  they just raise the taxes oh you want the poor children to be educated
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:47.520]  let's raise the taxes so we can educate the poor and people fall for this
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:51.000]  without realizing that these things are just a pre-tax for increased after
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.760]  giving them shots so they don't get sick filled with cancer viruses yeah they
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.240]  all that I missed the politicians that had those little pencil-thin mustaches
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:06.320]  that they could roll you know that blah that's an evil laugh they would say a
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:10.080]  sort of funny joke here in in America so in England recently the one of the
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.840]  dictators from the Middle East came to visit England and they wanted to
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:17.760]  protest the marching band wanted to protest so they paid they played the
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  emperor's theme from Star Wars you know bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.040]  I really feel that that should be played every time a politician walks into the
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:29.400]  room they don't have to wear the black helmet and sound like they've got asthma
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.640]  but I think that would really help clarify the position of power they have
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:35.800]  over us and they should have stormtroopers on either side just so the
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:40.560]  kids understand what what sort of society they live in
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:45.320]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen don't act so surprised your

[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.640]  back to Stefan Malinu that's enough from Sith Lord Darth Vader Mr. Malinu this
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:55.240]  is a short segment there's so much going on in the world what is front and
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:25:00.760]  center on your radar screen well I'm really really quite interested in the
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.040]  way that the American credit rating agencies have downgraded Portugal's
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:08.320]  debt and seem to be on the verge of downgrading Italy's debt Greece was
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:13.040]  fairly small it's a very small part of the EU about how you measure Italy is
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:18.320]  between three and the third and fourth biggest one on the size economy in the
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:22.440]  EU so I think that they're really doing an attack on the euro at the moment to
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.640]  cover up the fact that the dollar is taking such a big dive relative to the
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:31.280]  euro so for instance the rating agencies in America have said that they're
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:34.440]  going to look at any voluntary rollovers of the Greek debt you know just sort of
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:39.200]  keep buying more and more as a kind of default yet the fact that the Fed has
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:43.800]  bought a staggering amount of American debt is not considered a default America
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:47.560]  has already defaulted on its debt because it's buying its own treasuries and so I
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:53.280]  think that's going to be I think he's playing a video game while I'm talking
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.560]  but that's okay I can talk to the listeners but no I think that's really
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:00.720]  really quite fascinating to see these two giant beast dying currencies hacking
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:03.320]  away at each other rather than trying to deal with their own problems
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.240]  mathematically the euro can't survive mathematically the dollar can't survive I
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:10.600]  don't know that there's much will to try and centralize these things into a
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.280]  larger central bank I think that that's all kind of exhausted so it is going to
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.160]  be quite fascinating I think if we see a collapse of the euro we might see a
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.360]  breakup of Europe into its more individual currencies which might save
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:24.640]  things off for a little longer but you know I think people just really
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.040]  recognize deep down that the system as a whole I mean I think it's already dead I
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:33.120]  think it's just doing that after death body I agree and they sell us a self
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:36.520]  fulfilling prophecy if you look at the Rockefeller Foundation over a hundred
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:40.240]  years ago now a hundred and eleven years ago they would fund the National
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:45.000]  Council of Churches to actually teach the end of the world's coming don't get
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.920]  involved you know do whatever you're told and now they have 2012 for the
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.280]  non-christians to think the world's ending so that people just have a
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:56.680]  foregone conclusion no it's the opposite these elites are pathetic they can be
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:01.480]  defeated they can be defeated and to me the fundamental argument is just
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.640]  waking people up to the violence in the system to the fact that fiat currency is
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:10.840]  based on violence it is based upon an illegal and moral attack upon any
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:15.840]  competing currencies gold-based currencies are robbed and threatened
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:20.760]  throughout the world taxes is based on threats and violence the war on drugs is
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.320]  based on threats and violence the education of miseducation indoctrination of
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:30.880]  the young will keep the local systems in line fear of this aircraft carrier but
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:35.760]  that's impossible who will maintain control without the bureaucracy yeah this
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.280]  is weird thing that because the government has a monopoly on something
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.080]  like educating the young if you take the government out of the equation somehow
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:46.800]  the young won't be educated it's like saying if you take a huge rock out of
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:49.840]  the middle of a river that the river is still gonna go around the hole rather
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:52.800]  than fill it in and that's this weird thing because the government does it if
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:56.160]  the government doesn't do it it won't be done like there's no history where it
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:59.120]  was ever done before without the government roads were built without the
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.880]  government the literacy rate prior to government education was far higher than
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:08.600]  it is now now we have this ridiculous spectacle of teachers cheating on tests
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.840]  in order to get bonuses I mean it's just sad and pitiful the same thing with
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:16.720]  children get thrown out of school for parents as sorry teachers are getting
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.120]  rewarded for and this is happening so far throughout the system there's nothing
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:25.040]  in the system that is working anymore except propaganda which is always needed
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:29.040]  when a system doesn't work and I just hope that the evidence is accumulating to
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:33.480]  the point where even the worst addict to state violence is waking up and saying
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:37.360]  maybe this stuff doesn't work anymore that's my particular hope but of course
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:41.120]  addicts are the last one sometimes to see the basic truth well that's the other
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:45.280]  big issue is they keep drugs illegal so the big mega banks can make bigger
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.680]  profits when something's a black market it's more expensive and and I've even
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:53.280]  heard talk show hosts that are pro drug war now coming out and admitting the
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:57.280]  government deals the drugs and the drug war is a fraud and so this what do you
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:02.320]  think the system's gonna do to try to stop this revolution of awakening well
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:05.520]  what they're going to do is they're going to as they're already doing they're
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.440]  going to arm more of the drug lords right so they lots of government weapons
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:12.480]  are gonna find their way into the drug lords hands basically they're gonna
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:16.280]  fund the crackdowns in Mexico and other places and so this is to fight the
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.360]  example in Portugal where 10 years of legalized drug use or at least
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:23.640]  decriminalized drug use has resulted in far lower drug addictions far better
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:27.720]  treatment for the sick people who are addicted to do yeah they're gonna lower
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.600]  crime they're gonna arm the enemies and so the enemies then create all of this
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.120]  violence and then they say aha you see you need us
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:40.400]  with a poison and then says I'm the only one with a cure and that's all that they
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:44.640]  do over and over again well Stevan Malinu is our guest he's an extremist he

[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:25.240]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:08.080]  Malinou Stefan told us about your website and how people can visit that
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:13.880]  sure it's at free domain radio.com it is the biggest philosophy conversation in
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.600]  history but of course that's mostly just because of the new technology and yeah
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:21.720]  we've had like almost 35 million downloads and video views and 10,000
[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:24.840]  board members and so it's a really thriving community of people very
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:27.840]  interested in philosophy so I hope to check it out I got tons of free books
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:33.400]  up there I just released one called the Handbook of Human Ownership a manual for
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:37.880]  new tax farmers which is a tongue-in-cheek humorous instruction manual for new
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:44.440]  politicians on how to rule the herd. Briefly write down the tax farmer system
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.840]  for folks that aren't familiar with that. Sure well you know you look at a map of
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.280]  the world and you see these geographical regions in different colors with labels
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:55.680]  and a lot of people think that it's about culture and a lot of people think
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:59.920]  it's about nationalism but the reality is that all of the countries that you
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:05.440]  see on a map are actually just tax farms and they are very modern tax farms
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.200]  where we are no longer assigned to our occupations like surfs we're no longer
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:13.760]  owned directly like slaves we're no longer eaten directly like the old-style
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:17.640]  cannibalism of the Stone Age now we're allowed to choose our own occupations
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.520]  which makes us more productive which means that we can generate more money
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:26.200]  and wealth for our owners. The problem is of course that democracy can't work
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:29.960]  without massive bribery at the population it's as true now as it was in
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:33.280]  ancient Greece as it was in ancient Rome. That creates the collectivism and then
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:39.080]  destroys the human species turning us into lazy servile blobs. Well I hope that
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:41.520]  we're not going to get to a destruction of the human species it certainly does
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:46.200]  destroy the economy in the long run. You can't have a democracy without debt
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:49.760]  because you have to bribe people right so the baby boomers who got three to four
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.240]  dollars in services for every dollar they paid in taxes thought it was the best
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.720]  system ever look at this we've got all this free health care we've got all this
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.400]  free staff it's wonderful and it's great the problem is of course as Margaret
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:03.800]  Thatcher famously said the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.280]  other people's money to burn. Well it's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:10.720]  for dinner what happens after the wolves have eaten all the sheep and eaten the
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.440]  sheep are herder you know that's my issue for you. I see at the Bilderberg
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:19.160]  group and things a lot of big libertarians like the head of the PayPal
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.560]  mafia and others you know these multi-billionaires they're pushing
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:29.120]  libertarian from philosophy but in the end game now that through crony non-free
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.160]  market systems they've consolidated control now they're pushing austerity
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.440]  and cutting off resources now the people are dependent as libertarian or you know
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:45.600]  anarchic capitalism but then they're always scapegoating the the the
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:50.080]  unfeasibility of the ongoing welfare state ignoring the banker bailouts
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:55.440]  ignoring the fiat money system that was designed to be impossible to pay back and
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:58.960]  convert us from the greatest creditor nation to the greatest debtor nation the
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.200]  same for them you know every other nation so so so I mean certainly you've seen in
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:08.000]  the whole globalist hive board they're now putting some libertarian camouflage
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:13.800]  on top their backs a bit. Well I'll tell you Alex you know the system is about
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.400]  to crash when libertarians are invited to run the show because that way when the
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.480]  whole thing goes up in flames everybody will remember hey who was in charge but
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.200]  it all crashed those crazy libertarians and they'll just discredit freedom for
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:29.760]  another thousand years so my strong strong advice is hey you know support
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:33.040]  Ron Paul if you think he's a good educator and I think he is but for heaven's
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:37.040]  sakes libertarians and anarchists do not go near anywhere this titanic because
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:40.720]  it already hit the iceberg and you do not want to be anywhere near political
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:44.800]  power when the giant sucking sound of imploding fiat currencies and collapsing
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:48.400]  economies is heard around the world you want to make sure that all of the
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.760]  idiots who made this mess are in charge when it goes down so I know there's a
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.840]  great temptation to get in there and try and fix it it's way too late it was too
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:00.200]  late with the great society that that's sealed the doom of Western democracies
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:04.800]  so stay away from political power because don't be anywhere near the helm of
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:07.880]  this ship when it goes down. Sure I mean I mean even if you would be against
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.640]  tariffs it's not you know when another country has high tariffs on you you
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.380]  raise yours that actually creates you know a level playing field so tariffs
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:19.080]  when the other S tariffs is actually free market at a limited level you have
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:21.640]  things are sophisticated they're not just you know black and white there's a
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.760]  lot of gray there but I am for no tariffs if the other people were actually
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:30.080]  you know doing the problem is they are tax farms basically trying to cheat the
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:34.280]  other tax farms but Ron Paul has said now is the time for him to try to get in
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.680]  because it is imploding he can go in and point out what they did if not they
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.800]  may use the implosion to sell more collectivism but I do see your point
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.400]  about they could then scapegoat us like they did smooth haulings the economy
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:51.480]  was already in a depression they got in put tariffs in they then blamed the
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:55.040]  depression on that when it had been the collectivist engineering the whole
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:00.920]  situation from the beginning let's play a clip from NBC's Meet the Press with
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:05.720]  tiny Tim Geithner the guy who told the Chinese they're not evaluating the
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:09.320]  dollar and they laughed at him a few years ago because they were informed
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:14.320]  unlike certain people here in the United States and let's play this clip where he
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:18.120]  says the worst stuff of our lifetimes coming it's gonna be painful and it's
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.040]  gonna last for a long time here it is treasury Tim Geithner Mr. Secretary
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:26.360]  welcome back nice to see you David what happened well this is hard you know it's
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:30.200]  politically very hard but this is a grave moment for the country we need to
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.960]  something very big very substantial to bring our long-term deficits down over
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.520]  time we have to do that in a way that's good for the economy so we give more
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:41.000]  support to this economy still healing from the great recession oh it's gonna
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  require both sides to compromise presidents bring the leaders together
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.320]  again at the White House this evening to try to figure out how to move forward
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:51.600]  what does he actually say though because it you're hearing two different things you
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.040]  hear Bainter saying look they're demanding tax increases we're not gonna
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:59.080]  do that they've also said that you were back titling a bit on whether you'd cut
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:03.040]  entitlement programs like Medicare or Social Security what's the fact that
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:05.800]  latter thing is not true the president is standing tough he is willing to do
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:10.880]  very very difficult political things like what I'm getting very substantial
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.440]  savings from the budget across the budget defense the rest of government
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:19.360]  even Medicare make a long-term there are things we can do responsibly to save
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:22.200]  money in those programs and we have to do that if we're gonna bring these
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:27.080]  episodes under control but to do that we have to have some shared sacrifice we
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.000]  have to find a way to avoid shifting more the burden of tax system to the
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.480]  middle class it's gonna take a balanced approach both sides are gonna have to
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.320]  make some compromises and you know just one thing to Republicans we know this
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.160]  is very hard to do but they should not walk away now from trying to do something
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.080]  good for the country this is very important for the country now for the
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:48.720]  economy to be growing long-term restore confidence that Washington can actually
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.800]  do things that solve some problems need both sides to come together what was the
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:56.560]  president's reaction to Bainter's move well you know the president wants to do
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:59.600]  the right thing for the country and he recognizes to do the right thing you
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.720]  have to try and do the biggest most substantial deal possible the deal is
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.720]  going to be best for the economy and you know his view is he's gonna bring
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:11.040]  people together and we had a miscommunication I thought it was cute
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:13.920]  up to this quote I know that's a long interview just see if you can by the end
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:19.520]  of the show find the place where he says quote meet the press that is a very
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:24.480]  tough economy he says that a lot of people it's going to feel very very hard
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:28.880]  harder than anything they've experienced in their lifetime now for a long time to
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.100]  come but but I mean just that first part I'm glad that we didn't have it queued
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:35.560]  up to where I wanted because that was even worse we they're now calling it
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:39.200]  the Great Recession they're admitting it never ended so now it's not great
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.120]  depression it's great recession we're three years in to having three quarters
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:48.600]  in a row of non-growth even with cook numbers I mean and here they are
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:52.800]  telling us massive taxes on poor and middle-class to pay the bankers who've
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:56.600]  written the tax laws where they're almost completely exempt that that's
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:00.560]  gonna fix things I mean these guys are something else Stefan and who who is
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:05.560]  taking a shred of responsibility for the complete failure of tarp and the
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:10.720]  stimulus package and all of the money that was blown and burnt and sent into
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:14.600]  the stratosphere to supposedly deal with this crisis now it's like nothing
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:18.600]  ever happened that they had this huge plan that was supposed to rescue us from
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:21.320]  the recession now they're admitting there was a recession anyway but we're
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:25.360]  much more in debt and now they want to rape us again and rape us again it's
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:28.560]  the same thing in Greece over and over again and it's just never gonna end and
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:32.120]  think that you know what the dangerous thing is and don't you just hate being
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:35.360]  right all the time I wish I would be wrong you make these terrible
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:38.680]  predictions and you just want to be wrong because they're starting to use the
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:41.960]  word sacrifice I predicted this about a year ago that there was going to be no
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.520]  recovery and when there was no recovery and things began to get worse and worse
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.400]  and the debt ceiling was going to be bumped up against and the entitlement
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:51.520]  programs were under threat what they were going to start talking about Alex
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.880]  was the need for shared sacrifice and now they've introduced a bill where we
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:45:00.640]  voluntarily have money taken out of our check and the inside baseball is once
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.960]  they totally default they're just going to use that here's an example my dad was
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:08.960]  going to sign up to pay online taxes to the private fellow reserve to the IRS
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:12.960]  with Wells Fargo and it turned out it was a Goldman Sachs waiver in fact it's
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.360]  not my car and the whole thing you waive your rights they're now a tax
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:20.320]  reporter you allow them to take all the money out of your account and give it to
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:23.960]  the government it's a contract where you waive all your rights in the future and
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:27.760]  allow them to share all your data when you get a cloud computing thing with
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.800]  Amazon they waive your rights and say they now own your data I mean these
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:35.320]  people are out of control I'm sorry go ahead no they they're completely out of
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.520]  control and now they're going to start talking about sacrifice and sacrifice is
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:43.240]  political ease for bend over grab your shoelaces this ain't going to be pretty
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:47.960]  because take Lord Rothschild he's got giant 300 million dollar yachts jet
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:53.000]  airplanes he rented a whole giant island for his party for 300 people world
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.960]  leaders went there taxpayer paid for security they would come across the
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:01.760]  water grab cameras for mainstream media erase them and he literally is then
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:07.960]  giving speeches about not being able to take a hot bath or have a heating in the
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:11.800]  winter because it's hurting the earth with carbon while the I mean is such a
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:16.520]  sick joke yeah I really I have a tough time understanding how people take this
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:21.440]  at all as seriously but now this this talk of sacrifice when the ruling classes
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.680]  are backed into a corner and all of their disastrous users of violence and
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:27.800]  deception have caught up with them then they start talking about shared
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.680]  sacrifice and shared sacrifice means you all better get used to a pretty damn
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.040]  low standard of living because the whole system is coming down and we're going to
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:38.880]  grab as much gold and treasure as we can and you're going to be left with you
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.400]  know tang as your meals and that is what is going to happen oh hey when I go to
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.560]  Whole Foods now for three years it's all how sexy austerity is and how it's good
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.360]  to be in a depression and and and all the trendings are like oh yeah we're
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:59.320]  imploding it's so fun so they're now making it fun to be a poor slave yeah
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:02.360]  they're absolutely doing that kind of stuff and it's it's completely wretched
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:07.000]  and we need to push back on the idea of sacrifice this is not how the West was
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.960]  built the West was not built on let's accept lower and less and and more
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:15.400]  poverty and and less access to information and less of a high standard of
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:18.240]  living that had nothing to do with how the West was built the West was built on
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:22.000]  life liberty the pursuit of happiness property rights and freedom and a growth
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.400]  in the economy that was continual so that we could deal with things like
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.800]  environmental problems by by wealth not through poverty you know to solve
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:33.160]  no our mental problems you need an excessive wealth so that you can install
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:36.640]  install scrubbers so that you can have more localized production of energy you
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:40.840]  don't want a poverty-based reduction in your right well that makes things
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.640]  cleaner wealth on record makes you have less children and instead they block
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:50.480]  development making it filthy squalor yes and they're gonna call this sacrifice
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:54.000]  and what they're going to do is they're gonna try and make a virtue out of
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:58.440]  surrendering the last vestiges of your middle-class lifestyle and say it's for
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:01.200]  the planet it's for the children it's for the future it's for the spotted owl
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:04.480]  it's for the fish in the sea it's forever this is nothing to do with it
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:07.960]  the only way to solve environmental depredation is through the privatization
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:11.480]  oh and here's another thing while I'm on that topic of privatization you're
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:14.320]  also going to see a massive privatization of government which is
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:18.600]  another form of tax increase because what happens is they privatize let's say
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:22.000]  they privatize the parks well before you didn't have to pay much to get into the
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.440]  parks because it was absorbed in your taxes now when they privatize the parks
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:29.160]  you're gonna have to pay a lot more to to go into the park it's just another
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:32.800]  form of raising your taxes so they're gonna sell stuff off and they're gonna
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.200]  take the profits for themselves and then you're gonna have to pay the private
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:39.940]  company that's not real privatization either because it's all done inside
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:44.560]  deals that's right there just as it was in Russia and oh okay last thing so I'm
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:49.640]  a good Randfest here the banks have now recently been threatened with you have
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.320]  to pay $30 billion and we're gonna wipe out any problems you had with your
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:56.880]  fraudulent mortgages and they have almost no proof they don't know how far
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:00.800]  this mortgage fraud goes and I I imagine it goes enormously far and I bet you
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.560]  that the wisdom of Solomon could not figure out who actually owns a house
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:08.000]  in America anymore because it's been so split up and diversified and sold all
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.880]  over the planet but now what they're saying is they're gonna shake these
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:14.840]  banks down the five or six major banks who defrauded the US government defrauded
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:19.160]  the customers and lied about the at least according to the allegations lied
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.560]  about the quality of these investments to investors all around the world that
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:25.440]  they're gonna let get let off with 30 billion dollars people say well that's a
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:28.640]  lot of money but it doesn't come out of the pockets of the people there's one
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:33.640]  point five quadrillion in derivatives Bank of America is taking houses they
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:37.520]  never even had a deed to that are paid for with people that have pure title
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:42.480]  going back decades it is it is in the thousands of trillions and yeah they're
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:45.720]  telling the big banks government's gonna guarantee all this if you put 30
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:51.200]  billion in with the big six banks that doesn't even come to 200 300 billion it
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:55.440]  is even near one trillion and but the public here's 30 billion that sounds
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:59.600]  big you're absolutely right Stefan Malinu let's go to some calls I'm skipping
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:02.680]  this network break and I want to go five minutes into overdrive to get to Beth
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.640]  Michael Brian Sean George and others you're on the air Beth from Texas with
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:14.000]  Alex Jones and Stefan Malinu welcome what my question is is I'm wondering with
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:20.120]  I've bought some gold and silver and what I'm wondering is is that are we
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  right for confiscation or will they do it in another way basically through tax
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:30.920] ation right now if I sell some of the gold and silver I have there's a 28
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:34.240]  percent capital gain people do that under the yeah I'm not telling you what to do
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.680]  but folks that's why gold is really good because it's hard to track look here's
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.160]  the deal people say why should I own gold they could take it well why should I
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:45.760]  have children they could die in a car wreck or you know die of cancer God
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:49.520]  forbid they don't but I'm not out of fear not gonna live gold and silver aren't
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:53.320]  perfect and yes I believe down the road they're gonna try to slap taxes on
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:56.920]  they're gonna try to take it but it's better than them just taking it through
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:51:01.120]  inflation or taking it right out of your bank account it's harder for them to
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:06.920]  get do like my my grandmother's father and my grandfather's father both of
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:10.960]  them different parts of Texas didn't turn their gold in when the feds said do
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.040]  it in 33 and so it comes down to end of the day saying I'm not doing what you
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:18.960]  tell me crooks and if enough of us do it they can't enforce on us what do you
[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:22.680]  say to that Stefan Malinu well I think that's right and I also think that it's
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:26.320]  well worth while buying stuff at the moment with your fiat currency that
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:30.360]  that can't be taken right so buy a bunch of food buy some water you know stock up
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:33.000]  a little bit even if you don't think there's gonna be a huge collapse there's
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.280]  sure as heck gonna be massive inflation in food prices over the next year so
[02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:39.160]  that's a great way I mean they're not gonna come and take cans from your
[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:42.120]  basement so you can convert your fiat currency into something you can eat
[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:45.400]  something you can use grow a vegetable garden do all of that kind of good
[02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:48.560]  stuff unless you want to be arrested like some people are for growing vegetable
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:53.920]  gardens but yeah Al-Qaeda gardens Al-Qaeda gardens the terrorist tomato is loose in
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:52:02.040]  the neighborhood the vegetables are coming flea she's facing 90 days in
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:08.080]  jail for a tomato plant in her yard yeah yeah very sad yeah so that would be my
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:11.960]  suggestion does that answer yeah I mean I mean Beth does that answer Beth you can
[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:15.520]  go in little coin shops in places swap meets you can buy gold and silver here
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.200]  and there you can buy it from companies like Midas I mean I mean so what I mean
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:23.800]  the crooks may announce tomorrow we've all got to be drafted to fight for Emperor
[02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:27.960]  bumblebee or whoever's in power then I mean at the end of it that they may nuke
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:32.040]  Chicago and say the Easter Bunny did it and I mean there's no telling what
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:36.120]  they'll do to try to make you love them through fear and you just got to get the
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:39.280]  word out that they're the terrorists they stage 9-11 and if you don't do that
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:42.200]  they're gonna keep staging terror attacks that's their how do you deal with
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:46.400]  government staging crises or wars as a pretext to make people primitively
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:52.080]  rally around the king new order person step on well I think all you have to do
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:54.720]  is point out the number of times that these things have occurred before I
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:58.200]  mean it's well established now that the the Gulf of Tomkin incident was staged
[02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:01.480]  and fabricated and that started a war that killed millions of people
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:05.800]  everybody's completely aware about the lies about the WMD's in both the
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:09.400]  British and American press and isn't it shocking that the news of the world is
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:12.640]  shut down because they hacked a few cell phones the fact that they supported a
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:16.120]  war that's killed over a million people and driven million millions more into
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:20.120]  exile that didn't get them shut down well this is political fighting this is
[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:24.640]  sorrows striking at Murdoch you know these globalists even get in little
[02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.240]  fights with each other yeah that's true that the turf wars like the five
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:31.080]  families in in New York they're just turf wars and we think that it's got
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:34.040]  something to do with our freedom but it's just them battling over our tax
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:38.920]  revenue which is really quite sad absolutely I mean this well said I'm
[02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:42.280]  glad you brought that up thank you Beth does that answer your question yes it
[02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:45.840]  does thank you thank you and and I want to just say I'm not with Stefan
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:49.920]  Malinu I agree that up in Michigan and in other areas where there are resting
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:55.600]  people for for growing tomatoes in their yard I think that's reasonable and
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:54:00.240]  that's what George Washington fought for I'm not with the extremist okay right
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:03.360]  well you know he obviously cut down the cherry tree because you don't want to
[02:54:03.360 --> 02:54:07.720]  eat cherries he you know he understood that the war yes against fruits and
[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:10.560]  vegetables so I think that's why he chopped down that tree and I think we're
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:16.840]  all with him on that Stefan you are really starting to get it you're not an
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.960]  extremist now good I feel like I'm not being dragged behind the train of Alex
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:24.240]  Jones I'm actually clambering on the caboose and and starting to walk up and
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:28.360]  I don't feels good I think you're on your own train way up ahead of me there my
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:32.040]  friend you can't do Darth Vader yet but we'll get you there Michael in Florida
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:36.400]  you're on the air with an evil person go ahead oh Michelle Michelle I gotta read
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:41.320]  that better Michelle welcome hi Alex hi Stefan mine isn't so much as a question
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:45.040]  as if I wanted both your thoughts on this you've been talking about for the
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:50.600]  past few weeks a possible fall flag maybe in America and Europe with Gaddafi but
[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:53.840]  well they would never do that I mean they shipped 30,000 guns to blame it on
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:57.240]  the second amendment to Mexico and they wouldn't then perjured themselves they
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:00.640]  would never stage a terror attack I'm sorry ma'am go ahead that's okay but my
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:04.680]  thought was I know that we're the resistance and a lot of the Christians
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:08.760]  people but they're have supposed to be having this big summit and Washington
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:14.040]  the CUFI in July 18 through 20th I thought but anyway is it too far out
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.600]  there to think because Glenn Beck supposed to be there and you just said
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:19.640]  they're gonna blame it on Glenn Beck do you think it's possible that they they
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:23.520]  would try a false flag I mean with thousands of well let's not give them
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:26.800]  any let's not give them any idea but yeah they're all scaring us about the
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:30.680]  caliphate and Muslim extremists and then publicly funding all the groups in
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:35.360]  every case and funding Al Qaeda right now against against Gaddafi I mean I'm
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:38.680]  not saying some of these groups are not a control and dangerous the point is who
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:43.720]  fed that dog who trained that dog and absolutely false flag is the next card
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:47.040]  they're gonna pull you better believe it you can see all the prepping and
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:51.160]  priming and Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills where they're telling us when the
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.280]  terrorist attack what do you do give I writes up to you what do you do when the
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:59.080]  terrorist attack bend over and give you my bank account what do you do when the
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:03.040]  terrorist attack let you grow bar five-year-olds what do you do when we
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:07.680]  stage the terror attack worship you you're our daddy thank you for the call
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:11.560]  Michelle I'm gonna go to Brian Sean George Lee the show's about to amble
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:13.920]  have internet only for five minutes of Stefan can do it to finish those calls
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:18.040]  your comments on what I just said Stefan Molyneux well you can see this
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:21.000]  happening already Alex I mean they've cut hundreds of millions of dollars in
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.880]  military funding to Pakistan which is going to destabilize the ruling
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:26.800]  governments people don't understand that many people don't understand the degree
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:29.960]  to which tyranny's around the world are supported by Western money for a
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:34.000]  variety of nasty and evil reasons so there's going to be destabilization in
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:38.160]  Pakistan and that of course is going to be pretext for another intervention and
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:41.560]  more control and more growth so you just keep me to exploding this stuff ahead
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:44.920]  of time put the predictions out there and try and be as right as possible and
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:47.320]  that's going to gain you credit credibility with anybody who's got a
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:50.680]  few brain cells left rolling around well they caught the CIA guy trying to give
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:54.800]  new material to Al Qaeda to them blame on the Pakistan government publicly two
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:58.160]  months ago they're not playing games they're getting that little ledger that
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:01.720]  history ready when they blow up Chicago they've already bought the properties they
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.920]  want to blow up let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Wisconsin you're on the

[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:23.320]  passed on the favor to a number of my friends and they're getting the idea but
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:29.280]  I had an idea you're talking about Ron Paul and I had a couple campaign
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:34.660]  slogans for dr. Paul you want to hear him yes yes tell us the extremists go
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:42.480]  ahead their adaptation the first one is Paul and no fed okay the second one is
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:47.120]  it's the Federal Reserve stupid I agree who I'm gonna do a t-shirt of that I'm
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:51.880]  stealing that it's the Federal Reserve stupid beautiful all right glad to like
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:55.520]  it and you know if you would just get up there while he's got a platform on the
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.120]  debate you just started saying to the American people did you know that the
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:03.600]  Federal Reserve is owned by a Rockefeller Rothschild Warburg no I agree
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:08.560]  Ron Paul is great but if he got a lot more hardcore then that would have a
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:12.640]  bigger effect and maybe we can give Ron Paul some red bull before he gets up
[02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:21.640]  there maybe we can waterboard Ron Paul with coffee Starbucks coffee for no the

[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:31.240]  getting angry because that's the first step in getting woken up absolutely you
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:34.400]  know the fight-or-flight mechanism if we can tamp down the flight and focus on
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:38.080]  the fight I think that's that's a good use of adrenaline these days well done
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:44.360]  Lord Malinou let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut you're on the air
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:50.000]  my friend good to speak to you again I heard some people talking over on a
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.280]  Sunday show on WADC in New York area coming into my state Connecticut and I
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:02:00.400]  couldn't believe it almost sounded like your car show I mean you're bleeding
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:04.000]  over to a lot of different networks you're beating their tail off now they
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:07.760]  can no longer keep it quiet it you know I think it's more than that people have
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:13.960]  been managed in the narrative of a little tight left-right box and that the
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.640]  social engineers like curl quickly wrote about once I don't show people the
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:21.680]  truth I show folks there's a bigger world and get them to take their own
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:26.520]  blinders off and then and then they see it Stefan comments well if you put
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:30.480]  something in someone's food that continually makes them fat you know
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:34.120]  like corn syrup or whatever this sort of stuff then you they may not believe
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:37.720]  you for a while because it's like oh this tastes good I like it but
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:41.760]  eventually when they look down and they can't see let's say their toes for one
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:44.280]  to the better word if they look down and they can't see their toes because their
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.080]  gut is so big at that point they may believe you because if you don't
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:51.880]  believe the reason and the arguments and the evidence ahead of time you then
[03:02:51.880 --> 03:02:54.840]  have to accept the evidence after the fact and the fact that the system is
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:58.600]  breaking down so badly is proof that it's immoral at its core and so people
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:02.520]  who didn't accept the moral arguments now are seeing the terrible of violence
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:05.920]  and that's I think enough to to shore up our moral arguments I want to get one
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:09.560]  last caller in but George what were they talking about on WABC
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:14.400]  Oh they were talking everything from the Federal Reserve to the way of being raped
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:17.600]  and how out they're going to be raping Social Security and I heard on several
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:20.200]  different shows that ABC was the biggest because they're one of the biggest
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:25.880]  networks that I know WABC appreciate the call let's talk to Lee in Minnesota
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:29.160]  you'll be our tail gunner with Stefan Malin today go ahead hit us and hit us
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:36.000]  hard Alex Stephen I would like to ask both of you quickly today and maybe you
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:40.640]  could get into this more Alex tomorrow or the next day about particularly what
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:44.720]  they're talking about with the 14th Amendment because I believe I believe
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:50.960]  Stephen that Stefan but things are already dead and that they will invoke
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:57.600]  this this clause what from 1868 yeah I saw this weird creepy he's gonna be like
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:02.480]  Abraham Lincoln you watch stuff even in the campaign and they're now trying to
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:08.360]  invoke it I appreciate your call Stefan Malin what do you think of that okay
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:11.320]  remind me about the 14th Amendment well they're now announcing the president
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:15.440]  can basically be a dictator oh yeah but that's I mean what do you mean can be a
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:18.860]  dictator he's already been a dictator for quite some time I mean there was
[03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:22.360]  somebody who asked Nancy Pelosi some reporter asked Nancy Pelosi prior to
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:27.000]  Obamacare he said what aspect of the Constitution allows the federal
