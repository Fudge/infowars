[00:00.000 --> 00:08.200]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.200 --> 00:11.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.760 --> 00:15.400]  We're live the 30th day of May 2010.
[00:15.400 --> 00:19.280]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.800]  For just one segment, Wayne Madsen of the Wayne Madsen Report will be joining us coming
[00:23.800 --> 00:28.440]  up in about an hour and a half, the middle of the second hour to give us his breakdown.
[00:28.440 --> 00:32.480]  Back on South Korean ship looks like a false flag operation.
[00:32.480 --> 00:36.760]  That's his words and I always really respect his analysis in hindsight.
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.440]  He's somebody who I've really never seen be wrong.
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.360]  A lot of great sources also worked, of course, with multiple U.S. intelligence agencies and
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.720]  they are confirming now the torpedo is a German torpedo.
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.560]  There's no history of the Germans selling their high-tech torpedoes that are launched
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.800]  out of their dolphin submarines that they've sold to Israel and others being used.
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.040]  And so we'll talk to him briefly coming up later in the second hour.
[01:04.040 --> 01:07.400]  I want to talk some about Memorial Day just briefly when we come back.
[01:07.400 --> 01:14.080]  My view on it and the great veterans of this nation.
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.960]  So I'll speak to that also.
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.360]  They're now saying it's not not one oil leak, not two.
[01:20.360 --> 01:23.880]  The AP is now reporting three miles away.
[01:23.880 --> 01:27.600]  It's like they found a fissure in the earth and oil is just coming out.
[01:27.600 --> 01:32.200]  Well the truth is they found all sorts of naturally occurring oil seepage.
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.680]  You have oil seepage on the ground and you have oil seepage in the sea.
[01:37.680 --> 01:39.560]  What do you think tar pits are?
[01:39.560 --> 01:46.440]  The La Brea tar pits in downtown Los Angeles full of saber-toothed tigers and mastodons
[01:46.440 --> 01:53.040]  and woolly mammoths and a boreal North American giant ground sloths.
[01:53.040 --> 01:55.240]  It's an oxymoron.
[01:55.240 --> 01:59.840]  They're a boreal and they're ground sloths, both a boreal and ground sloths.
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.080]  But we'll be discussing that and it's just devastating the Louisiana missile because
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.920]  lines that video of a congressman breaking down and crying watching that wonderful community
[02:08.920 --> 02:09.920]  down there.
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.720]  So beautiful being decimated, but it will come back oil is toxic, but not that toxic.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.880]  The chemicals they're using to disperse it though.
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.880]  That's another story.
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.720]  Very, I mean, this is one of the classic examples of the cure being worse than the disease.
[02:24.720 --> 02:27.160]  So that is coming up as well.
[02:27.160 --> 02:32.840]  We have some big developments going on with Mexico, huge economic developments.
[02:32.840 --> 02:39.360]  In fact, guys, I was digging through my IMs I sent you and I'll come out there during
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.760]  the one minute break, but I didn't see it in my stacks.
[02:42.760 --> 02:51.200]  I just now realized that incredible announcement by Geithner, uh, where he says to China when
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.760]  he was there last week, he said, if this is going to be my top story, and then I just
[02:55.760 --> 03:03.520]  realized that I'm at home and I, I am my articles here to have them printed here.
[03:03.520 --> 03:10.000]  And uh, sometimes they don't make it through, but we have a video of Geithner saying the
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.840]  US is done, we're never going to basically come back financially.
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.040]  We can't be your market anymore, China.
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.960]  You better become sustainable and sell to yourself.
[03:19.960 --> 03:23.880]  And the other bizarre statement of Europe's going to have to be China's new trading partner
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.840]  because the US has just done, they've sucked us dry.
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.320]  When Europe and the United States are pretty much in the same financial situation run by
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.560]  the very same private banking cartel.
[03:37.560 --> 03:43.400]  And so we'll be, uh, discussing that, uh, to say that the news is off the chart.
[03:43.400 --> 03:46.880]  I mean, I say this at the start of almost every radio show now to say that the news
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.000]  and information is off the chart is because it is off the chart and it's getting more
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.720]  off the chart.
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.720]  It's like a car that can go to a thousand RPMs will suddenly go to 2000 and 3000 and
[03:58.720 --> 03:59.720]  4000.
[03:59.720 --> 04:02.280]  I mean, it broke the gauge a long time ago of craziness.
[04:02.280 --> 04:08.800]  Uh, here's one Israel stations, nuclear missile subs off Iran, times of London, very prestigious
[04:08.800 --> 04:09.800]  publication.
[04:09.800 --> 04:17.240]  Uh, you've got Israel preparing to bust a blockade or enforce a blockade of, uh, peaceful
[04:17.240 --> 04:24.000]  people trying to bring medicine into Gaza, flotilla set for final leg of Gaza blockade,
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.240]  busting bid Israeli gunships had to see to block flotilla.
[04:29.240 --> 04:35.160]  This, uh, AP, so, uh, I'm going to come back and rattle through a whole bunch of this important
[04:35.160 --> 04:38.880]  news and there is a lot of it.
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.520]  And, uh, then I'm going to get into the big news, the financial situation when, when the
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.400]  bankers are announcing Dean, oh, what's that sound, honey?
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.880]  Oh, the turkeys cooked.
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.200]  Oh, the turkeys cut for 12 hours.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.200]  Go get it out.
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.200]  Let's eat it.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.760]  You know, Geithner, uh, America's done.
[04:54.760 --> 04:57.040]  He tells the China Chinese.
[04:57.040 --> 05:03.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap,
[05:03.080 --> 05:07.400]  not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[05:07.400 --> 05:09.400]  owned and operated American company.
[05:09.400 --> 05:14.200]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.840]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[05:16.840 --> 05:20.840]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated subs
[05:20.840 --> 05:27.880]  anywhere, get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at five-star
[05:27.880 --> 05:30.400]  soap.com or info wars.com.
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.520]  Let's talk to the owner of five-star soap Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[05:34.520 --> 05:41.160]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.280]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[05:45.280 --> 05:55.680]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website, five-star soap.com, for buying a one to two
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.680]  month soap sampler.
[05:57.680 --> 06:04.680]  Thank you.
[06:04.680 --> 06:09.480]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:09.480 --> 06:10.480]  You want answers?
[06:10.480 --> 06:12.480]  Well, so does he.
[06:12.480 --> 06:25.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:25.680 --> 06:37.000]  It is Sunday, my friends, the 30th day of May, 2010.
[06:37.000 --> 06:44.800]  I want to talk about Memorial Day first and then I'm going to run through all of the amazing
[06:44.800 --> 06:48.400]  news here and amazing is the word.
[06:48.400 --> 06:52.040]  Israel stations nuclear missile subs off Iran.
[06:52.040 --> 06:57.000]  Times of London, Israel rejects call to join anti-nuclear treaty, at least there's a real
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.280]  discussion about the fact that Israel has 400 nukes but says no one else in the region
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.440]  is allowed to have them.
[07:03.440 --> 07:09.840]  So starving and deluded, yet North Korea is ready for war.
[07:09.840 --> 07:17.360]  Going back to Israel, Israel War Game rehearses Iran attack.
[07:17.360 --> 07:23.040]  Flotella set for final leg of Gaza blockade, busting bid, French news agency, hundreds
[07:23.040 --> 07:30.160]  of activists braced for the final leg of their attempt to go through a Gaza strip in Bargo,
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.480]  a bid Israel vowed to defeat, and that was yesterday.
[07:34.480 --> 07:42.160]  Now here is another headline, Israel gunships head to sea to block Flotella.
[07:42.160 --> 07:46.520]  And it says their ships headed out to see Friday to stop a flotella, a pro-Palestinian
[07:46.520 --> 07:50.440]  activist from reaching the Gaza strip that military said setting the stage for what could
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.400]  become a dramatic showdown on the high seas.
[07:53.400 --> 07:59.920]  You know, Gaza's been under siege for several years, oldest form of total war.
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.520]  Israel continued to follow that as it unfolds.
[08:03.520 --> 08:07.640]  Also second Iceland volcano issues ominous warning.
[08:07.640 --> 08:12.600]  The volcano is Katla and is many times bigger than the one that's already screwed up air
[08:12.600 --> 08:16.400]  travel the last few months, and they're saying it's set to blow.
[08:16.400 --> 08:21.200]  So we'll be talking more about that coming up in the broadcast.
[08:21.200 --> 08:29.160]  Also a pirate's threatened boats on U.S.-Mexico border, AP, California College offers scholarship
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.880]  to illegal aliens.
[08:30.880 --> 08:31.880]  That's Fox News.
[08:31.880 --> 08:32.880]  Well, what's the big deal?
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.760]  I mean, illegal aliens have always the last 30 years gotten in state tuition, when other
[08:37.760 --> 08:44.200]  U.S. citizens don't get it and they get first dibs on all the welfare and all the free scholarships.
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.720]  I mean, that's on record because the globalists want to break down the borders and have a group
[08:50.720 --> 08:55.720]  here that'll vote for gun control and big government and 90 plus percent of the illegals
[08:55.720 --> 08:59.080]  when they get to vote finally, vote to take our guns and take our property.
[08:59.080 --> 09:04.560]  So of course the banks are bringing them in, bring down the U.S.
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.240]  Administration opposes Arizona law that penalizes the hiring of illegal immigrants.
[09:10.240 --> 09:19.840]  The feds have lied and Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security of insecurity, she's
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.240]  got plenty of money for the feds to be spying on returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians,
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.560]  conservatives, people like that and to harass gun shops and gun shows.
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.760]  But last week in Congress, if she admitted she hasn't read the Arizona bill, well, I've
[09:35.760 --> 09:42.800]  read it, we've read it on air, it is identical, identical except that it says Arizona and
[09:42.800 --> 09:46.520]  the state instead of federal, to federal law.
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.960]  And that's if the feds, because the federal law is very weak, happened to already arrest
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.720]  somebody in the commission of a crime or suspicion, drunk driving, speeding, whatever.
[09:56.720 --> 10:07.080]  And if they don't have identification, they're to be brought to ICE or what's the lemigra?
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.080]  Feds don't do that.
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.680]  You've seen it in the news where they'll do a stage meat packing plant arrest of 500
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.400]  people and give every one of them a green card on the spot.
[10:16.400 --> 10:19.640]  They'll arrest them in front of TV cameras and take them down the street or they'll take
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.400]  them and give them green cards and have them build the fake border fence that you could
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.280]  drive a, you know, the Empire State's building through and then they only built a 50-something
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.280]  miles of the 2000s.
[10:29.280 --> 10:36.120]  It's just completely, oh, Obama announced this week, the 1200 troops are just to fight
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.760]  drugs coming across the border.
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.320]  Yeah, and of course, I guess they're well-trained.
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.080]  If these troops come from Afghanistan, they could plant poppies in South Texas.
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.240]  Of course, they don't grow well here, they only grow well in a few geographic areas of
[10:49.240 --> 10:52.080]  the globe, 90-plus percent in Afghanistan.
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.920]  And our own troops are on the news admitting, I guess on Memorial Day, one of the symbols
[10:57.920 --> 11:00.160]  of supporting vets has always been a poppy.
[11:00.160 --> 11:01.160]  You know why?
[11:01.160 --> 11:03.160]  Because it's a painkiller.
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.840]  The poppy's associated with troops having their arms and legs blown off and so the poppy
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.880]  brings them heroin.
[11:09.880 --> 11:10.960]  It brings them relief.
[11:10.960 --> 11:16.080]  So I guess the entire symbol of America and the entire symbol of our troops should just
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.520]  be a big, giant poppy.
[11:20.520 --> 11:25.160]  And we can have the troops down on the border who are there for show in the Associated Press,
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.760]  they admit, not allowed to interdict illegals, not allowed to even call the Border Patrol
[11:28.760 --> 11:29.760]  if they see them.
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.920]  Bush put them down there five years ago, they get shot at by Mexican troops, they were
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.480]  told to run.
[11:34.480 --> 11:37.120]  Our troops are told to run.
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.200]  How about on Memorial Day, we memorialize that our republic has died.
[11:42.200 --> 11:47.640]  How about we have a memorial like you go to Grandma's grave once a year and put a wreath
[11:47.640 --> 11:50.680]  around it saying, we love you, Grandma.
[11:50.680 --> 11:57.640]  How about we place wreaths at all of the veteran cemeteries for apologizing to them that we
[11:57.640 --> 12:00.880]  let America be taken over by foreign corporate interest.
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.640]  No, who's here in America fighting against the New World Order, the open announcement
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.000]  of global government run by a bunch of Ponzi scheme running offshore banks.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.840]  It's on record, they engineered the crisis, it's on record, they plunge the housing market,
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.520]  it's on, I've got stacks of mainstream news with even the German government saying Goldman
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.280]  Sachs, JP Morgan and others engineered the European collapse with the head of the European
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.320]  Central Bank, Trichette for France.
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.920]  That's in the mainstream news today.
[12:32.920 --> 12:39.320]  Our entire country, our entire world is being taken over by covert corporate interest, a
[12:39.320 --> 12:42.200]  corporate takeover.
[12:42.200 --> 12:44.680]  I'm sorry, people with turbines are not our enemy.
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.240]  We're only over there because there's opium, 500 billion a year.
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.880]  I'm sorry, the million plus dead Iraqis and our thousands of dead U.S. troops, a thousand
[12:52.880 --> 13:04.000]  in Afghanistan dead, 5,000 in Iraq, their sacrifice and their courage has to be admired.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.560]  But I'll tell you, no preemptive war in history has been a just war.
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.120]  When the British attacked the colonies, it was unjust, okay?
[13:14.120 --> 13:18.640]  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they were the insurgents.
[13:18.640 --> 13:20.440]  That's why we have Fourth of July.
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.440]  That's what the Star Strip Spangled Banner is about.
[13:25.440 --> 13:33.400]  That's what our troops fought for in World War II.
[13:33.400 --> 13:39.000]  That's what they fought for in the other wars this country's had.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.480]  But there's no doubt this country's been taken over by foreign corporate interest.
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.600]  And some troops are now serving their seventh tour in Iraq or Afghanistan, respectively,
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.960]  most of them a mix.
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.400]  We've never made trips serve more than one tour, one year.
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.920]  Not in World War II, not in Vietnam, not anywhere because it screws them up with one
[13:59.920 --> 14:05.040]  tour, around 30%, 35% statistically end up having real mental problems.
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.360]  You make them serve two, three, four, five tours, you're talking more than half the
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.400]  troops are just complete basket cases, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:11.400 --> 14:13.200]  Oh, but that's how we support them.
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.120]  We put a little American flag made by Chinese slaves that's deindustrializing our country
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.120]  out on our front lawn and we walk up to the troops and say, oh, thank you.
[14:23.120 --> 14:24.120]  Thank you.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.280]  You've served four or five tours over there.
[14:26.280 --> 14:27.520]  Thank you.
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.840]  And then you give them horrible government run healthcare, which we're now all going
[14:30.840 --> 14:32.800]  to be getting.
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.200]  And so, again, it's just hype.
[14:36.200 --> 14:42.200]  You know, we need patriots here in the Republic to save the United States from massive taxes
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.240]  and regulations and surveillance and the Patriot Act now being used against U.S. citizens.
[14:47.240 --> 14:52.560]  We need to realize what Memorial Day is all about, what the flag is all about.
[14:52.560 --> 14:54.280]  It's about the Declaration of Independence.
[14:54.280 --> 14:55.600]  It's about the Bill of Rights.
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.560]  It's about the Constitution.
[15:01.560 --> 15:03.600]  It's very simple.
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.640]  We all are warlike because we instinctively, our ancestors wouldn't have survived if they
[15:08.640 --> 15:17.240]  wouldn't have protected the village, the hut, the region when invaders would come and take
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.240]  over areas.
[15:18.240 --> 15:21.600]  No matter where you live, you've dealt with the same situation.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.800]  So that's why we're warlike, we're aggressive.
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.360]  We instinctively honor people that put on uniforms and march off to fight.
[15:28.360 --> 15:34.880]  But in any war, there's the invader and there's those that are fighting for their lives.
[15:34.880 --> 15:38.400]  Now why does the United States invade country after country?
[15:38.400 --> 15:40.880]  Because we're not the United States anymore, folks.
[15:40.880 --> 15:44.600]  We're a province of offshore banks where they're muscled.
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.240]  And now Geithner has announced, in China, I have the Reuters article that America is
[15:49.240 --> 15:50.240]  done.
[15:50.240 --> 15:55.280]  I told them, hey, you can't count on the U.S., U.S. taxpayers are tapped out and they don't
[15:55.280 --> 16:01.440]  have money anymore.
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.000]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.880]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[16:09.880 --> 16:15.840]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.740]  investing in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[16:20.740 --> 16:25.440]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.840]  our families.
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.280]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[16:30.280 --> 16:31.920]  of your own home.
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.520]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.680]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[16:40.680 --> 16:47.680]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.840]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[16:50.840 --> 16:56.560]  That's www.silverlungs.com, silverlungs.com.
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.440]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[17:05.440 --> 17:07.040]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.640]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable?
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.440]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[17:15.440 --> 17:17.720]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[17:17.720 --> 17:22.200]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[17:22.200 --> 17:23.200]  seeds.
[17:23.200 --> 17:28.200]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[17:28.200 --> 17:30.040]  food for you and your family.
[17:30.040 --> 17:33.880]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[17:33.880 --> 17:37.840]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[17:37.840 --> 17:41.080]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[17:41.080 --> 17:47.920]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[17:47.920 --> 17:52.400]  That's 877-327-0365.
[17:52.400 --> 17:56.920]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[17:56.920 --> 18:00.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[18:00.400 --> 18:07.080]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[18:07.080 --> 18:11.840]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[18:38.080 --> 18:45.800]  We turned genes inside out, diamond gusset genes, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[18:45.800 --> 18:50.360]  Our Defender motorcycle genes combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could
[18:50.360 --> 18:52.520]  ride all day with confidence.
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.440]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[18:55.440 --> 18:57.640]  Diamond gusset genes got it.
[18:57.640 --> 18:58.640]  Others don't.
[18:58.640 --> 19:03.960]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[19:03.960 --> 19:08.960]  The irony is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[19:08.960 --> 19:11.560]  It really says that the state is God.
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.080]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[19:16.080 --> 19:17.320]  on earth.
[19:17.320 --> 19:22.120]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[19:22.120 --> 19:23.960]  expanded nationwide.
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.040]  old powerful shadow state.
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.160]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[19:34.160 --> 19:38.560]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.360]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.880]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.920]  The police state isn't coming.
[19:49.920 --> 19:50.920]  It's here.

[20:08.480 --> 20:29.600]  the end of the video.
[20:29.600 --> 20:35.240]  But please have a good phone if you call in, again, can't take calls that are Skype or
[20:35.240 --> 20:36.240]  that you can't understand.
[20:36.240 --> 20:42.160]  You've got to have a good phone line to call in, 888-201-2244.
[20:42.160 --> 20:47.320]  Geithner tells Europe to emulate China on growth, and in here he says US consumers are
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.680]  going to be less a source of demand for the world in the future.
[20:51.680 --> 20:56.680]  And then if you read the full quotes, he says that we're tapped out, that we are too deep
[20:56.680 --> 21:02.920]  in debt, and that our economy is not going to be growing for a long time, just like Japan.
[21:02.920 --> 21:08.680]  Now, meanwhile, they're on our news telling us that our economy is doing great, that if
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.800]  you think the economy is doing bad, you're a conspiracy theorist, that why unemployment
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.240]  is at 9.8%, all the private economists say over 22%, and they're just telling us that
[21:18.240 --> 21:23.360]  good times are here, they're not around the corner, no, they're here.
[21:23.360 --> 21:28.480]  And they've got a whole bunch of new income taxes, and sales taxes, and carbon taxes,
[21:28.480 --> 21:32.240]  and all these states are going bankrupt, but don't worry, the private central banks have
[21:32.240 --> 21:35.960]  got more fiat made up money to loan them.
[21:35.960 --> 21:41.160]  And Spain just lost his triple A credit rating, Moody's is saying the US is about to lose
[21:41.160 --> 21:47.400]  its triple A credit rating, and so the US won't just pay 5% to 10% to borrow money from
[21:47.400 --> 21:51.320]  the private Federal Reserve out of nowhere, the private bankers that owe the whole world
[21:51.320 --> 21:57.480]  because of this fraud, no, no, now we're going to get a worse rating, we might pay 20% why
[21:57.480 --> 22:02.400]  someday we'll be like Nigeria, where everything goes to interest to the bankers, they just
[22:02.400 --> 22:04.240]  own everything.
[22:04.240 --> 22:10.320]  This is Bernie Madoff taking over the planet, that's all this is, and I want you to know
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.960]  why things are going to get worse and worse and worse and worse for you, is they're going
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.560]  to turn on the mainstream television, and they're going to tell you, oh my gosh, three
[22:19.560 --> 22:25.440]  Hollywood stars, you know, link letter died and art link letter, and you know, all these
[22:25.440 --> 22:30.280]  other people died, and what are we going to do, and oh, Lindsay Lohan's in trouble with
[22:30.280 --> 22:33.140]  the judge, my goodness.
[22:33.140 --> 22:36.600]  I'm sorry, you will not hear about Dennis Hopper here on the show, even though I did
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.760]  interview Dennis Hopper once, you know, I've never aired the interview, people in the office
[22:41.760 --> 22:44.760]  have seen it a couple of years ago, we were digging around and they're like, why don't
[22:44.760 --> 22:50.480]  you air this, and I had my reasons, I'll just leave it at that, there now I've done it,
[22:50.480 --> 22:53.280]  I've got to probably tell the Dennis Hopper story, but see, you're more interested in
[22:53.280 --> 22:57.720]  that, humans are designed to be tribal and only care about local stuff, and ooh, what
[22:57.720 --> 23:04.720]  the celebrity's doing, you know, what chief big feathers up to, you know, and chief big
[23:04.720 --> 23:13.280]  feather is the Hollywood peacocks up there, but we've got to dig the interview out now,
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.760]  people won't believe it, I guess they will, I mean, I've never read quite a few people,
[23:18.760 --> 23:25.360]  but yeah, I saw this on British TV, I saw it on Russian, Japanese, this is big news
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.440]  all over the world, but here in the US it's just buried in there, that Geithner was in
[23:30.440 --> 23:36.520]  China for three days, he's now left reportedly, and he's, this is the former Goldman Sachs
[23:36.520 --> 23:41.000]  exec who was running the New York Fed and swindled everybody with Paulson now running
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.840]  things for Obama, but let's go and just play a clip of what foreigners are saying, interviewing
[23:45.840 --> 23:47.160]  Americans, here it is.
[23:47.160 --> 23:51.680]  US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has advised Europe to look to China as the world's
[23:51.680 --> 23:56.920]  economic powerhouse, saying America has lost its lead, while investigative journalist Webster
[23:56.920 --> 24:02.320]  Tarplay says the country's flawed financial system is to blame.
[24:02.320 --> 24:07.680]  The US economy, to the extent that we still have one, is based on the New Deal model,
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.240]  which is a highly regulated kind of industrial capitalism, and this is what we had starting
[24:13.240 --> 24:14.740]  in 1933.
[24:14.740 --> 24:20.520]  Now for the past 40 years, since the coming of Nixon more or less, reactionary Republican
[24:20.520 --> 24:26.440]  administrations have been steadily dismantling that entire edifice, so now we've got no more
[24:26.440 --> 24:32.120]  regulation and we've got no more industry, so what we've got left is this casino gambling
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.960]  speculative derivatives paradise that Geithner thinks is so great, and of course that's not
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.960]  right.
[24:37.960 --> 24:38.960]  Okay, so I wouldn't call it that.
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.120]  The rest of the interview is up on infowars.com and prisonblinded.com if you want to go watch
[24:43.120 --> 24:44.120]  it.
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.640]  You know, I respectfully disagree with Tarplay on a few points, because I want this to be
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.720]  truthful, and I'm not saying he was being untruthful, it's just that let's flesh this
[24:52.720 --> 24:53.720]  out.
[24:53.720 --> 24:58.720]  Both political parties got involved to get rid of Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, and it
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.860]  was Bill Clinton who officially went along with it, and you've had perfect integration
[25:03.860 --> 25:13.400]  between Bush's people, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, and now Obama, president number 44, you've
[25:13.400 --> 25:15.860]  had perfect integration, it's a revolving door.
[25:15.860 --> 25:28.540]  The Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citibank, Cabal, in the Republican arm of power, when the Democrats
[25:28.540 --> 25:33.080]  get back in, they leave government and go back into banking.
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.640]  And then the Democrats that were in banking, when the Democrats get in, they go into government.
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.320]  I mean, literally, it's a revolving door.
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.520]  It'd be like if the same sports team, if the same sports team owner owned both teams and
[25:47.520 --> 25:50.200]  even had them in the same uniforms.
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.720]  And instead of fielding 11 players, they fielded 22, and then you went and watched a football
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.680]  game where the team played itself, and it was all completely contrived, kind of like
[25:58.680 --> 26:00.720]  a Don King boxing match.
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.360]  But worse, I mean, literally, ladies and gentlemen, this is like having wind up horses in a horse
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.360]  race, and you know, well, this horse can wind up longer and faster, so we know this little
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.880]  gray pony with the white spot on its forehead named, you know, Ginger Schnapps is going
[26:16.880 --> 26:17.880]  to win today.
[26:17.880 --> 26:20.520]  I mean, this is a rigged system.
[26:20.520 --> 26:22.080]  This isn't capitalism.
[26:22.080 --> 26:23.440]  This isn't free market.
[26:23.440 --> 26:28.520]  You've got the upper echelons of the banking cartel, by the way, I had the former head
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.160]  of the Treasury on this last week, former head of policy, Dr. Paul Craig Robertson.
[26:33.160 --> 26:34.160]  He totally agreed.
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.160]  He's read the banking re-regulation bill that passed, and it allows the big megabanks to
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.120]  shut down and take over state banks, local banks, healthy banks that aren't in derivatives.
[26:44.120 --> 26:46.480]  And it surveils everything that U.S. citizens do.
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.320]  It controls our entire lives.
[26:51.320 --> 26:56.400]  Every bank account, every transfer, everything you purchase on a credit card, in live time
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.920]  being watched by the regulators who were all a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay types.
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.880]  I mean, and they didn't get rid of the removal of Glass-Steagall.
[27:06.880 --> 27:07.880]  It's still gone.
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.760]  They can do whatever they want.
[27:11.760 --> 27:19.080]  Investment banks, private banks, commercial banks, it doesn't matter, GMAC, anybody who
[27:19.080 --> 27:25.680]  wants to can basically set up a company and sell a bunch of derivatives.
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.760]  They could go out to the park and get dog droppings and put it in a box and have AIG
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.880]  AAA certified as solid gold investment, and they'll sell it to the yuppies, and so they'll
[27:37.880 --> 27:42.040]  make money when the yuppies buy it and when the local governments buy it.
[27:42.040 --> 27:50.040]  And then when it goes under, why the banks will then loan the fiat money back to the
[27:50.040 --> 27:57.600]  municipality to get out of debt because they're in financial trouble because they don't have
[27:57.600 --> 27:59.560]  any real assets they've invested in.
[27:59.560 --> 28:02.440]  And that's basically how this works, and it's not going to get any better.
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.760]  It's not meant to get better.
[28:03.760 --> 28:09.080]  You have the Club of Rome, the UN, all these globalists, Henry Paulson saying they want
[28:09.080 --> 28:13.560]  to post-industrial the United States, they want to deindustrialize the country.
[28:13.560 --> 28:14.560]  Yeah.
[28:14.560 --> 28:19.600]  I mean, why for 25 years have they had huge tax incentives to move to Mexico or India
[28:19.600 --> 28:26.560]  or China, and they told you NAFTA and GATT were going to be great for the economy.
[28:26.560 --> 28:30.880]  They told you the world government was going to be wonderful and that globalization was
[28:30.880 --> 28:32.600]  the best thing since sliced bread.
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.280]  Well, you found out it's not good, and now they're saying, oh, we've got more global
[28:36.280 --> 28:37.280]  government.
[28:37.280 --> 28:38.280]  We've got carbon taxes.
[28:38.280 --> 28:41.480]  We've got global value-added taxes.
[28:41.480 --> 28:46.200]  And they've now announced the official power structure of the new world government.
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.960]  Goldman Sachs has put out a report on it, global reserve currencies and SDRs in global
[28:50.960 --> 28:51.960]  governance.
[28:51.960 --> 29:00.840]  We'll be right back.
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[29:08.160 --> 29:09.160]  do you want?
[29:09.160 --> 29:14.720]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[29:14.720 --> 29:16.200]  Food is your only ammunition.
[29:16.200 --> 29:17.440]  How much do you want?
[29:17.440 --> 29:18.440]  When do you want it?
[29:18.440 --> 29:20.440]  Now or after the battle starts?
[29:20.440 --> 29:21.580]  When will you need it?
[29:21.580 --> 29:23.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[29:23.680 --> 29:25.040]  Will there be any food?
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.520]  Will it make your children sick?
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.640]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[29:30.640 --> 29:31.800]  and be immunized?

[31:07.480 --> 31:11.560]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.560]  and documents.
[31:12.560 --> 31:17.160]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[31:17.160 --> 31:19.640]  It means all the world under their control.
[31:19.640 --> 31:24.480]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[31:24.480 --> 31:25.480]  world.
[31:25.480 --> 31:30.680]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[31:30.680 --> 31:33.160]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[31:33.160 --> 31:37.640]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[31:37.640 --> 31:38.640]  financial system.
[31:38.640 --> 31:41.520]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[31:41.520 --> 31:45.200]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[31:45.200 --> 31:48.040]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[32:57.840 --> 33:00.920]  Thank you.
[33:00.920 --> 33:04.760]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.760 --> 33:22.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:22.800 --> 33:35.240]  Full free number to join us on this Sunday edition is 888-201-2244-888-2012244.
[33:35.240 --> 33:40.080]  You know I'm very threatened by the new world order.
[33:40.080 --> 33:44.400]  I understand this global corporate government is sworn to enslave me and my family to set
[33:44.400 --> 33:51.520]  up a high tech police state grid that they also own so they profit from it.
[33:51.520 --> 33:58.520]  And we have this memorial day which is supposedly about our troops and about America when we
[33:58.520 --> 34:04.560]  have a government, no matter who's in office, that is run and designed to destroy and overturn
[34:04.560 --> 34:08.520]  everything that made this country great, everything that's good.
[34:08.520 --> 34:14.400]  And I'm so sick of the criminal offshore interests that wrap themselves in the American flag
[34:14.400 --> 34:16.960]  and then tell me what's patriotic.
[34:16.960 --> 34:23.080]  And CNN and MSNBC with all these television shows demonizing conservatives and libertarians
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.160]  and gun owners, they've got a big special with Chris Matthews coming out, the rise of
[34:28.160 --> 34:36.320]  the right wing featuring myself and Rand Paul and demonizing us and twisting and deceiving
[34:36.320 --> 34:40.200]  about what we really say and what we stand for.
[34:40.200 --> 34:49.640]  It's very frustrating to have hundreds of UN documents, hundreds of statements every
[34:49.640 --> 34:56.880]  year now by world leaders about world government, how it's going to run, how it's designed
[34:56.880 --> 35:02.800]  to take over your life, how it's designed to set up a global one-child policy and take
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.040]  private property from the commoner.
[35:05.040 --> 35:10.640]  It's basically slavery, high-tech slavery and then to know that for all these years
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.480]  there's been political distractions, political diversions, mainline conservative talk show
[35:15.480 --> 35:20.680]  host making jokes about world government and jokes about new world order and they still
[35:20.680 --> 35:21.680]  do it.
[35:21.680 --> 35:22.680]  They still do it.
[35:22.680 --> 35:28.080]  It's globalization and NAFTA and GATT and all of this has destroyed our country, it's
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.080]  industrial base, it's societal base, all that protects us as our bill of rights and constitution,
[35:34.080 --> 35:43.040]  it's now being openly destroyed and it just gets worse and worse and worse and then I
[35:43.040 --> 35:52.280]  see the treason, I see Geithner in China saying America is done, our private and public debts
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.040]  are too high, we're not going to be able to be a trading partner for you soon or a place
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.520]  for you to basically even buy your bonds from and you're going to have to start trading
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.280]  with Europe and yourself.
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.240]  I mean, mission accomplished by the globalist, to wreck this country, remember they told
[36:10.240 --> 36:16.720]  you you wouldn't have factory jobs anymore, you'd have service jobs but then you can't
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.360]  get those because the illegal aliens will live 10 to a house and are supplemented by
[36:20.360 --> 36:26.240]  welfare and don't pay taxes and they've done the breakdown of that, how the illegal aliens
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.920]  are doing better than most Americans and do you blame them, globalization, NAFTA and GATT
[36:30.920 --> 36:32.800]  destroyed Mexico, what are they supposed to do?
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.960]  I don't even dislike them individually, it's that it's part of the globalist operation,
[36:37.960 --> 36:45.680]  part of collapsing this country, this is without even looking today for outrageous treason.
[36:45.680 --> 36:51.960]  In the Gulf of Mexico and on lakes bordering Texas and Mexico, Mexican troops are robbing
[36:51.960 --> 36:57.440]  people, I have the sheriffs on the show, this is old news for our audience, Mexican troops
[36:57.440 --> 37:04.080]  will come 3, 4, 5, 6 miles in, they will rob cars, they will rob police, Mexican troops,
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.760]  I've had the sheriffs on, they will kill people and what does our government do, sticks its
[37:08.760 --> 37:13.600]  tail between its legs, Obama puts 1200 troops down there to quote, involve in drug introduction,
[37:13.600 --> 37:19.560]  they can't have loaded weapons and they're not allowed to stop illegals, look at this,
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.320]  pirates threaten boats off US Mexico border lake, the waters off Falcon Lake normally
[37:24.320 --> 37:29.760]  beckon boaters with water skiing and world class bass fishing, but this holiday weekend
[37:29.760 --> 37:34.240]  fishermen on the waters that straddle the US Mexico border are on the lookout for something
[37:34.240 --> 37:38.240]  more sinister pirates, well why don't people start carrying guns in their boats, oh because
[37:38.240 --> 37:42.040]  the cops will come after you even though it's not the law for them to take your guns, it's
[37:42.040 --> 37:46.480]  time for America to have red blood again, I got a gun right here in the studio folks,
[37:46.480 --> 37:53.040]  you know I own my own studio, my home situation, I got a gun right here, I got a gun in my
[37:53.040 --> 37:57.600]  car folks, you come over and pull a gun on me, you're dead, you better be ready to use
[37:57.600 --> 38:03.040]  it, I'm red blooded, I haven't been castrated, you come around with a gun, I'm gonna kill
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.160]  you, it's real simple, you know we got a lady coming on the show, I've seen countless
[38:09.160 --> 38:13.160]  news reports where they don't tell the elementary students it's a drill and they turn the lights
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.760]  off and they come in and put guns in their heads and then they tell them we're the pro-second
[38:16.760 --> 38:21.200]  amendment group or we're the homeschooling group, the cops tell them this to demonize
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.640]  the second amendment, that's in the federal grants, that's in the Associated Press, I've
[38:24.640 --> 38:31.360]  got a mother coming in here Wednesday, no it's Tuesday, from Lakeway and same thing
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.240]  she has the documents, they told her under an emergency, under a red level, we're gonna
[38:35.240 --> 38:42.160]  take your kids to a FEMA center, this is in Austin and I went and pulled it up, remember
[38:42.160 --> 38:45.960]  five years ago they announced during a red alert in the Washington Post the government
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.720]  will take your kids and she noticed her daughter was coming home and wouldn't talk to her and
[38:50.720 --> 38:55.600]  said she had to have permission and that she wasn't, basically she couldn't trust her
[38:55.600 --> 39:00.400]  mom anymore and then I mentioned to the lady because it was at a birthday party for my
[39:00.400 --> 39:03.960]  daughter, she's friends with my wife, didn't even really know who I was or listened to
[39:03.960 --> 39:10.160]  the show, that's what's scary, knows my wife separately, doesn't know who I am and she
[39:10.160 --> 39:15.000]  goes oh yeah, what were they telling you not to take a hot bath or a shower or to run the
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.560]  sink when you're brushing your teeth and I said yeah that's the New York Times but they
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.360]  reported like it was good, she said no that's what the kids do now and the mother next to
[39:23.360 --> 39:27.280]  her goes oh yeah, I had to take my daughter out of public school because every time she
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.200]  saw a bulldozer development she'd start crying because they show them videos of basically
[39:32.200 --> 39:36.560]  dying rabbits and animals saying they're murdering animals when they build something and they
[39:36.560 --> 39:45.680]  do that to traumatize your kids in mind control, folks they have you, they have the country,
[39:45.680 --> 39:50.760]  they're brainwashing your children right now everywhere, they're, it's in the New York
[39:50.760 --> 39:54.200]  Times they have the kids write tickets to their parents, they come home and write dossiers
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.880]  up on their parents, false tickets, England's now got the kids writing real tickets, they're
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.440]  called climate cops, nothing to do with the environment, this is just their excuse to
[40:03.440 --> 40:09.400]  get control, listen to this, pirates threaten boats off US Mexico border lake, the waters
[40:09.400 --> 40:14.880]  of Falcon Lake normally beckon boaters with water skiing and bass tournament but he goes
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.600]  on but the holiday weekend fishermen on the waters that straddle the US Mexico border
[40:18.600 --> 40:22.800]  on the lookout for someone more sinister pirates twice in recent weeks fishermen have been
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.560]  robbed at gunpoint by marauders at the local sheriff's say or spillover from fighting between
[40:27.560 --> 40:36.360]  rival Mexican drug gangs, I mean it's not that I have courage folks, it's that if somebody
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.440]  pulled a gun on me I wouldn't even care if it got me killed, I'm going to open fire
[40:39.440 --> 40:45.480]  on them, I mean I just can't, I'm just red blooded, I mean what happened to this country?
[40:45.480 --> 40:53.160]  And it continues, look at this, California college offers scholarship to illegal immigrants,
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.360]  now they're making a big deal out of this, I mean in Texas the illegal aliens get more
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.120]  tuition than Texans, they get more tuition than people from outside Texas who are US
[41:03.120 --> 41:06.800]  citizens, they get better than in state tuition, that was like that AP article a few years
[41:06.800 --> 41:13.920]  ago where the big banks said they give illegals housing loans with no credit and citizens don't
[41:13.920 --> 41:17.360]  because quote we know it's tough for them in the country, now the globalists want to
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.760]  bring in foreigners, they want the incentives to use them as a political force, it's very
[41:22.760 --> 41:28.760]  elementary, a public community college in California has been set up a scholarship fund
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.920]  for immigrant students including illegal immigrants, the 2500 scholarship is sparked anger by some
[41:34.920 --> 41:39.600]  including at least one lawmaker who is threatening to cut off federal funding to the school,
[41:39.600 --> 41:43.680]  a public community college in California has set up a scholarship fund for immigrant students
[41:43.680 --> 41:50.560]  including illegal immigrants, $2500 a piece and it goes on to say that in state kids don't
[41:50.560 --> 41:55.400]  even get this, if you're an illegal alien, $2500 because you are going to help bring
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.160]  down America, you're going to vote to take the guns out of these people's hands, you're
[41:59.160 --> 42:03.040]  going to vote to take the property, you're going to vote to set up an L Heffy system
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.800]  like Mexico or 99% are slaves, come on in, we want to make everybody poor, we want you
[42:08.800 --> 42:14.320]  to drive down the wages, we don't want Mexico to be free, we want US to be a steam valve
[42:14.320 --> 42:21.040]  for Mexican tyranny and crime, here's another one, administration opposes Arizona law that
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.160]  penalizes hiring of illegal immigrants, now there's federal laws on hiring illegals but
[42:26.160 --> 42:33.400]  the feds won't enforce them, and so Arizona last year passed a separate law saying we
[42:33.400 --> 42:36.440]  will prosecute people that hire illegals and the feds are in the Supreme Court trying to
[42:36.440 --> 42:44.000]  block it because the feds are a criminal outside group of offshore corporations, our government
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.880]  has been seized, you understand that on Memorial Day folks, on the Memorial weekend, you understand
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.040]  America's already gone, it's already in the world government, just like they've got a
[42:54.040 --> 43:00.280]  euro, we're in the SPP, wake up, okay?
[43:00.280 --> 43:05.120]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[43:05.120 --> 43:08.600]  What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.400]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights, not democracy, not
[43:13.400 --> 43:17.320]  mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner, so they think they own
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.200]  our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.400]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[43:26.400 --> 43:32.200]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising, you have the facts,
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.120]  we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law, knowledge is
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.720]  power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you, don't tread on me,
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.760]  rise the republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the
[43:44.760 --> 43:51.600]  American people is rising, a new tool in the info war, don't tread on me, order it at infowars.com
[43:51.600 --> 43:59.120]  or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty
[43:59.120 --> 44:00.120]  films.
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[44:04.240 --> 44:07.160]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[44:07.160 --> 44:11.200]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[44:11.200 --> 44:12.200]  or gold?
[44:12.200 --> 44:15.600]  It's true, seeds cannot perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[44:15.600 --> 44:17.760]  possible that could even happen again.
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.920]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[44:21.920 --> 44:28.000]  seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.520]  dense food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.900]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden,

[44:56.960 --> 45:00.600]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[45:00.600 --> 45:05.080]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions, if you're going into a battle
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.920]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.520]  My answer would be all I can get, in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[45:14.520 --> 45:19.040]  Food is your only ammunition, how much do you want, when do you want it, now or after
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.480]  the battle starts, when will you need it, can you buy it without proper identification,
[45:23.480 --> 45:27.560]  will there be any food, will it make your children sick, if there's a quarantine and
[45:27.560 --> 45:31.920]  you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized, you wipe
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.400]  out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life, how much will you need, we
[45:40.240 --> 45:43.000]  don't know, how much do you want, all you can get.
[45:43.000 --> 45:51.560]  I'm Alex Jones, I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633

[45:59.600 --> 46:04.120]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.800]  in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle, did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[46:08.800 --> 46:12.800]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold, it's true seeds have all performed
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.120]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.280]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[46:21.280 --> 46:27.360]  seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.880]  dense food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[46:31.880 --> 46:37.280]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden,
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.960]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[46:42.960 --> 46:54.640]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[46:54.640 --> 47:01.600]  are the ultimate barter item, this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[47:01.600 --> 47:08.600]  Big Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:08.600 --> 47:11.600]  Hit it!
[47:11.600 --> 47:29.960]  Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna cut right to the chase here, the bill of rights and constitution
[47:29.960 --> 47:36.440]  and private property, and the fact that we jealously defend it and are aware of our liberties
[47:36.440 --> 47:39.160]  is what has allowed us to have all this wealth.
[47:39.160 --> 47:45.000]  You wonder why North Korea or Mexico or China or, you know, most other nations are horrible
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.240]  cesspits of corruption and thuggery with cops strutting around on power trips and the people
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.760]  incredibly poor?
[47:52.760 --> 47:57.000]  That's because the systems there have made a decision to make people poor, they've made
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.840]  a decision to use it as a weapon.
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.960]  Mexico has at least tripled the resources of the United States, and it has fully collapsed.
[48:06.960 --> 48:13.560]  It is a failed state now, the State Department admits it's a failed country.
[48:13.560 --> 48:20.280]  There is mass death, tens of thousands killed per year on our border, the crime is pouring
[48:20.280 --> 48:26.200]  across and the government just loves it, it's just legalizing it, bringing it in, loving
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.480]  it, and you've got this cowardly, politically correct, decadent, bloated population who
[48:31.480 --> 48:39.680]  are forefathers would be disgusted by like a bunch of decadent Romans in 410, right before
[48:39.680 --> 48:46.440]  Rome fell, having no idea that the currency's been sucked dry, the factories are rusting,
[48:46.440 --> 48:53.000]  Detroit and many other cities are collapsing, more than 15 states are already totally bankrupt,
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.280]  thousands of counties, there's over 20,000 counties, thousands of counties totally collapsed,
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.760]  a debt black hole designed so you can't pay it back.
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.480]  And I have all the Goldman Sachs documents, all the Timberwolf documents, I've been telling
[49:06.480 --> 49:17.440]  you this for 10 years about the derivatives, and still the American people are so cowardly
[49:17.440 --> 49:18.440]  on average.
[49:18.440 --> 49:25.400]  So, and by cowardly, oh they act tough, men strut around and bug their eyes out and they're
[49:25.400 --> 49:29.960]  big and bad, unless somebody in a cop in a black ski mask comes by, they start urinating
[49:29.960 --> 49:36.120]  on their leg, and they bow down to the American flag but hate everything it stands for.
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.520]  Look, you're going to have nothing if you don't have enough respect for yourself to
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.200]  get up and get angry and speak out, I don't care what religion, what color you are, if
[49:46.200 --> 49:51.880]  you support the Bill of Rights and Constitution and that shield, that hedge of protection,
[49:51.880 --> 49:52.880]  it's gone.
[49:52.880 --> 49:56.880]  The shields are down now folks, they've gotten rid of everything, I've got the Economist
[49:56.880 --> 50:03.920]  magazine in front of me, we're in Seattle, they make you pay giant fees and fines to
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.160]  even have free speech in the city, not to rally, not to march, the government is completely
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.680]  criminal ladies and gentlemen, they're violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution from one
[50:15.680 --> 50:19.560]  end to the other, we're going to start the next hour and go to all your calls.
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.400]  It's just, I read stories here, where the feds are challenging in a previous Arizona
[50:24.400 --> 50:30.240]  law, which they're not even enforcing, where people that are highly illegals get in trouble.
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.520]  Meanwhile, the feds are throwing the book at the American people, the American people
[50:35.520 --> 50:44.640]  are seen as total trash, as total scum, as total garbage, I mean, they're passing laws
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.000]  where just everything that was normal and wasn't illegal is illegal.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.800]  That's what tyranny is, a tyranny makes everything illegal, so we can then selectively enforce
[50:53.800 --> 50:55.040]  on who it wants.
[50:55.040 --> 50:58.760]  And I see articles like this, stacks of them every day, children for to be fingerprinted
[50:58.760 --> 51:04.360]  to borrow school books from library, children to be thumbprinted to get school lunches,
[51:04.360 --> 51:10.080]  school drills where they come in and terrorize the kids and train them to be taken to FEMA
[51:10.080 --> 51:11.080]  camps.
[51:11.080 --> 51:16.920]  FEMA wants traffic lights to stop your car, law enforcement organizations are lobbying
[51:16.920 --> 51:25.240]  for kill switches, where everyone's cars are just remote controlled killed.
[51:25.240 --> 51:31.160]  Meanwhile, Gulf oil spills, scientists find second oil plume.
[51:31.160 --> 51:34.280]  That was the Wall Street Journal in LA Times yesterday.
[51:34.280 --> 51:38.920]  Here's another one, this time from AP, the giant underwater oil plume discovered.
[51:38.920 --> 51:47.160]  A third one, there's the AP section right there in the article, it's up on infowars.com.
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.840]  So now they found a third plume and government can't help you in Katrina, all it can come
[51:51.840 --> 51:54.120]  and do is take your guns.
[51:54.120 --> 51:58.240]  Government can't help you in a hurricane or in an earthquake or in any, all they can
[51:58.240 --> 52:01.200]  do is take your money, all they can do is rob you.
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.920]  And they can't fix an oil leak, they can't fix anything, you understand that?
[52:05.920 --> 52:11.360]  All they can do, because it's designed to rob you, it's designed to steal from you.
[52:11.360 --> 52:16.400]  Public education is designed to make you a conformist idiot and to dumb you down.
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.240]  It's designed to break up your family and turn your children against you and you pay
[52:20.240 --> 52:21.240]  for it.
[52:21.240 --> 52:22.680]  That's what America is.
[52:22.680 --> 52:27.600]  Oh, you don't know they're having drills in every county in every city where they come
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.680]  in and announce we're homeschoolers for the Second Amendment, we're going to kill you.
[52:31.680 --> 52:36.400]  And literally, that's the Associated Press and put it to the kids' heads in trauma-based
[52:36.400 --> 52:37.800]  mind control.
[52:37.800 --> 52:41.280]  So they've been their whole life, hate guns, and are scared to death of them.
[52:41.280 --> 52:45.880]  That's why the Violence Policy Center a few years ago was in the Austin, America statesman
[52:45.880 --> 52:46.880]  debating me.
[52:46.880 --> 52:51.280]  They interviewed them, they interviewed me, and they said, don't worry, we're going to
[52:51.280 --> 52:54.360]  get your guns, we've got your kids in the schools.
[52:54.360 --> 52:59.440]  That was a quote, we've got your kids, because you don't care about your kids, America.
[52:59.440 --> 53:03.000]  You don't care about your tax money, you don't care about offshore banks, because you know
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.840]  why the big conservative talk show host for the last 20 years told you there's no CFR,
[53:08.840 --> 53:13.720]  there's no global governance, there's no world government, there's no new world order, there's
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.720]  no private corporate takeover, none of that exists.
[53:16.720 --> 53:19.240]  And so you just believe none of that exists.
[53:19.240 --> 53:21.480]  And so that's great.
[53:21.480 --> 53:25.640]  You know, I've talked about Israel's nuclear arsenal and how they're kinesit four years
[53:25.640 --> 53:28.520]  ago threatened to nuke Europe if they didn't give them money.
[53:28.520 --> 53:32.560]  Now I'm not even against Israel, but I am against a member of their kinesit saying that.
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.040]  That's their government.
[53:34.040 --> 53:37.520]  And then I had callers calling and say, how dare you even say Israel has nukes?
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.320]  Yes, they have them, but you're not allowed to say they have them.
[53:41.320 --> 53:42.320]  What?
[53:42.320 --> 53:46.360]  You know, that's the mind control in our culture.
[53:46.360 --> 53:49.960]  By the way, there are more newscasts now this week.
[53:49.960 --> 53:55.280]  I've seen CNN and others saying yes, the troops grow the opium and ship it out, because if
[53:55.280 --> 54:00.520]  they don't, the Taliban will get the money and then we'll fund the terrorist.
[54:00.520 --> 54:01.640]  That's what they said in Vietnam.
[54:01.640 --> 54:06.280]  Oh, we better ship the heroin out or the commies will get it.
[54:06.280 --> 54:12.040]  We went there because the French lost control of the opium in Indochina in 58.
[54:12.040 --> 54:17.320]  Our troops were there for seven years before you were told about it in Vietnam.
[54:17.320 --> 54:20.480]  We went to Afghanistan to get the schmack.
[54:20.480 --> 54:25.240]  Say you could, so idiots in Russia and the U.S. and other places could run a dirty needle
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.280]  up their vein and pump some poison in.
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.720]  I could play her all over there right now on the TV, telling you that growing schmack
[54:32.720 --> 54:33.720]  is good.
[54:33.720 --> 54:37.520]  And if you aren't for heroin cultivation, you don't love the troops.
[54:37.520 --> 54:39.440]  In fact, let's just play it right now.
[54:39.440 --> 54:40.920]  Here it is in your face.
[54:40.920 --> 54:43.160]  Get the opium in many, many ways.
[54:43.160 --> 54:46.440]  That is the principal crop that is being grown here.
[54:46.440 --> 54:51.680]  The Taliban lend the farmers the money, they are indebted to the Taliban, they have to
[54:51.680 --> 54:52.880]  grow the opium.
[54:52.880 --> 54:56.920]  Now the Marines in their success are in a sense a victim of their success.
[54:56.920 --> 54:57.920]  Oh, yeah.
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.000]  Because now the population is, you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.000]  it.
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.920]  We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy
[55:07.920 --> 55:12.320]  it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security
[55:12.320 --> 55:13.320]  risk.
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.960]  Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas, he is the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion
[55:16.960 --> 55:17.960]  6th Marines.
[55:17.960 --> 55:20.840]  Really, a wonderful group of Marines here.
[55:20.840 --> 55:27.040]  I know that you care deeply about this contradiction, the fact that here you have one of the best
[55:27.040 --> 55:28.040]  forces in the world.
[55:28.040 --> 55:29.040]  See, I'm not the patriot.
[55:29.040 --> 55:30.040]  I'm not for running heroin up your vein.
[55:30.040 --> 55:33.440]  And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[55:33.440 --> 55:36.040]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[55:36.040 --> 55:37.040]  How do you deal with it?
[55:37.040 --> 55:38.440]  What are you doing about it?
[55:38.440 --> 55:40.520]  Well, frankly, this is part of the culture.
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.680]  That's enough, you can go watch the whole clip on Info Wars and Prison Planet and he
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.040]  goes on to say they help him grow it up.
[55:47.040 --> 55:49.880]  You can go pull these numbers up.
[55:49.880 --> 55:55.240]  There is over a 12-fold increase to all-time records of opium.
[55:55.240 --> 55:59.840]  Just eight years ago, less than 20% of world opium was coming out of Afghanistan.
[55:59.840 --> 56:00.840]  They turned into heroin.
[56:00.840 --> 56:02.040]  Guess what's coming out?
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.120]  91% last time I saw a month ago.
[56:06.120 --> 56:07.560]  The troops aren't tolerating it.
[56:07.560 --> 56:09.240]  I've talked to the troops for years.
[56:09.240 --> 56:15.480]  They are there guarding the Schmack and it's loaded on C-130s and it's flowing in to Chicago,
[56:15.480 --> 56:16.680]  baby.
[56:16.680 --> 56:17.680]  And they love it.
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.160]  They ship it off and when your kids are dumb enough to use it, they slam them in a prison
[56:21.160 --> 56:24.400]  owned by the military industrial complex.
[56:24.400 --> 56:25.400]  It's coming out.
[56:25.400 --> 56:31.120]  The private prisons, most of them, are paid for with laundered cocaine and heroin money.
[56:31.120 --> 56:33.600]  You idiot drug users out there.
[56:33.600 --> 56:36.480]  All you're doing is letting them legalize slavery.
[56:36.480 --> 56:40.800]  They didn't hear of slavery in the 1860s.
[56:40.800 --> 56:44.920]  They just made drugs illegal and if you're dumb enough to use them, that's their excuse
[56:44.920 --> 56:49.120]  to throw you in a slave prison making widgets.
[56:49.120 --> 56:50.120]  You know why I'm mad?
[56:50.120 --> 56:52.920]  I've been talking about this all last week and I just can't shut up.
[56:52.920 --> 56:55.400]  On Monday, the Washington Post came out.
[56:55.400 --> 56:57.560]  We read the article on air.
[56:57.560 --> 57:01.520]  The headline was CIA made film that Saddam was gay.
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.640]  But buried in the article, the CIA says, oh, by the way, we made fake bin Laden videos.
[57:06.640 --> 57:08.720]  Well, I already knew that.
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.440]  But the fact is, they think you're so dumb, yeah, we grow the smack.
[57:12.440 --> 57:15.000]  You better salute the smack or you're not a patriot.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.120]  Yeah, we make fake Al-Qaeda videos.
[57:17.120 --> 57:20.160]  You better salute the fake videos or you don't like the troops.
[57:20.160 --> 57:23.740]  Yeah, you better be for nuke in countries or you're not a patriot.
[57:23.740 --> 57:27.120]  You better give all your money to Goldman Sachs or you're not a patriot.
[57:27.120 --> 57:29.200]  You better let us brainwash your kids.
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.640]  You better turn your guns in or you're not American on this memorial day.
[57:33.640 --> 57:38.240]  Remember, hating George Washington, hating the Second Amendment, hating our borders
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.240]  is patriotism.
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.560]  Well, if that's patriotism, I'm not a patriot.
[57:42.560 --> 57:43.560]  You hear me?
[57:43.560 --> 57:44.560]  Hi, folks.
[57:44.560 --> 57:56.040]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[58:00.880 --> 58:04.880]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[58:04.880 --> 58:09.200]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.760]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver

[58:46.240 --> 58:50.600]  Hi, folks.
[58:50.600 --> 58:54.960]  This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap, not detergents
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.400]  but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated
[58:59.400 --> 59:00.640]  American company.
[59:00.640 --> 59:05.440]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[59:05.440 --> 59:08.080]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[59:08.080 --> 59:12.040]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps

[59:25.680 --> 59:31.680]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[59:31.680 --> 59:36.680]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[59:54.960 --> 01:00:05.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.080]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.960]  All right, we've got Wayne Madsen coming up about the false flag situation with the South
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.520]  Korean ship.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.720]  Key information on that, I'm going to interspersed news throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:43.200]  Jonathan, Kathy, Ann, Mark, Ronaldo, Jonathan, Jake, Jose, Kevin, I'm going to all of you.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.200]  Adam is up first.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.680]  Adam, where are you calling from?
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.880]  I'm from Vancouver, Canada.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  I just...
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.880]  Mm-hmm.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:57.200]  I just want to know what you think about connecting the dots between the state bank movement,
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.960]  which has proposed a financial model for government that eliminates taxation and what Walter Burian
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.480]  is saying, which seems to me that the infrastructure and even the assets are already in place to
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.480]  make this possible.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.880]  Well, the globalists have always known this, that when Kennedy cut taxes by 50%, tax receipts
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.760]  within 12 months doubled.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.320]  They knew when they raised taxes in California, it made go belly up.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.600]  They're like, gee, this screwed things up worse.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.840]  Now they go bankrupt into the banker's hands even more.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.320]  But absolutely, we've got such a technological system.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.560]  We're so productive.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.640]  We could all be living like kings if we didn't have these oligopolies and these megacorporations
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.680]  through government consolidating power.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.720]  And absolutely, we need a state bank model.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.440]  Kennedy and Integrate send to Walter Burian in the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:52.240]  They've taken our wealth through taxes, invested it in their companies to conquer us financially.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:59.200]  Well, I was going to plug in then for Dr. Farid Kavari, who's running for governor in
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]  Florida.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.320]  His site is www.zerocosteconomy.com where he lines out his plan.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.440]  And I just think that what he's proposing it is possible, but I don't think he fully
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.200]  realizes that the assets are in place to just do it tomorrow.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.080]  I know that's what's so sickening about this.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.920]  We could do anything, but we have a bunch of Madoff.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.120]  I mean, literally, Bernie Madoff founded the NASDAQ.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120]  He's one of the...
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.800]  I mean, they're all a bunch of Madoff crooks, but we can't arrest them.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.920]  No, we got to let them set up FEMA camps.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.800]  We got to let them brainwash the cops.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.960]  We got to let them ship OPM in.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.400]  We've just got to worship government, do whatever government says, and just lick their boots
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  up and down.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.160]  I'm sick of it, Jonathan.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.160]  That was Adam.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160]  Excuse me.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.160]  Jonathan's next.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160]  You're on the air.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160]  Yes, Alex.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:51.800]  I was the one who brought you to your attention that the OPM video that you was playing earlier,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.680]  well, I have a new video for you, but several key articles that will be featured in it.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.080]  Well, all I can say is, well done, Lord Vader.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]  Please give me the information.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080]  Okay.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080]  It's called...
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.960]  The video is called What Causes Cancer?
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.960]  The Question Mark.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.960]  It's by moxnews.com.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.680]  I mean, it's the channel moxnews.com on YouTube.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680]  Yeah.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680]  You know that?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:22.920]  Well, look under their channel and you'll find what causes cancer, and CBS News admits
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.080]  that what causes cancer is from the plastics and from your water.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.280]  They tell you, you have to filter water if you don't want to get cancer.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.280]  That's what's incredible.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.840]  One CBS says Mercury's good for your brain and the other.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]  Wow.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.760]  So, it's called What Causes Cancer?
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.560]  And it's the moxnews on YouTube.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.760]  Just go to YouTube, type in moxnews, and then What Causes Cancer?
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.120]  Well, that's incredible news.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.760]  We'll get that up on infowords.com and prisonplotter.com.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.200]  But they know that the fluoride causes cancer.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200]  They know.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.840]  And I don't mean causes cancer like smoke and marble or reds.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.440]  Yeah, you do that 30 years, you're going to probably get lung cancer.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:06.080]  I mean, this is like guaranteed devastating to screw you up fast and to make you dumber
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.320]  in a box of rocks.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:13.040]  And that's why most people, mainline people, you know, see, I've been noticing a lot of
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.000]  rural people wake up faster than city folks, and it's because I'll check.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.440]  And I've even tried to scan through it and look at the addresses and kind of create little
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]  maps.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.120]  A lot of rural people haven't been on fluoride their whole lives.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.000]  And so they're able to even understand.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.160]  But people inside cities, you know, grew up on paint chips and fluoride, you know, on
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]  pesticides.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.080]  Hell, I mean, they don't even count to five.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.640]  They can't tie their shoelaces.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.320]  All they can do is worship government and bow down to black scheme ask and, you know,
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.280]  What were the other points, Jonathan?
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.480]  Well, I won't come back.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.240]  Well, I got to get to the other callers.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.440]  Just, you know, we ought to give you, send it to show tips because you've always got
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]  great tips.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440]  Send it right now.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]  You're the best.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  We'll be back.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:05.480]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action, tyranny is here, the grim future
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.600]  foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.520]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.760]  on earth.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.600]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.440]  expanded nationwide.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.520]  old powerful shadow state.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.560]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:38.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.080]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.080]  corner.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.320]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.360]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360]  It's here.

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show, because there's
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.120]  a war on for your mind.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:16.480]  Okay, I'm going to continue with your calls, Kathy, Annie, Mark, Rolando, Jonathan, Jake,
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.840]  Kevin, Joe, many others that are holding.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.200]  Also on this Memorial Day coming up tomorrow, former New York Times editor and Pulitzer
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:33.720]  Prize winner has gone public in the American conservative newspaper magazine that for two
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.400]  years they were not allowed to basically publish the conclusive government findings of a cover-up
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.240]  from Nixon on of at least thousands of US POWs.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:49.120]  And this is all confirmed that they knew they were in Vietnam and left them, because
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.000]  they didn't want to have to pay for them from the North Vietnamese.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.400]  And of course, it goes back further than that.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:02.760]  It's been a US policy since World War II, 21,000 plus US troops were in Nazi camps
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.520]  who've been captured by the Germans.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.800]  And when Stalin took over those areas, the US just said, keep them.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.680]  It's a gift from us, slave labor.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.960]  We'll just wave an American flag in front of the American people if they ask where their
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.960]  daddy is, and they'll say, I don't care about daddy, I worship government.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.440]  That's what supporting the troops is, is being a mindless idiot.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.160]  I support the world government.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.000]  I support the banker bailouts.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.640]  I support being a schmuck.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.960]  I'm sorry, I'm just really getting angry here today.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.760]  See, I'm not patriotic because I don't want to leave our troops in foreign countries.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.600]  I'm not patriotic because I don't want them growing heroin in Afghanistan.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.120]  All right, I'm going to settle down.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.320]  It's just when the Washington Post came out and admitted, they quoted the CIA, yeah,
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.000]  we make fake Vinod and videos to scare you.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.720]  I mean, you know, it's just a new level.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.960]  They're making me passe.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.160]  You don't even need Alex Jones to tell you this stuff anymore.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.160]  They're just in your face.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:10.960]  Yeah, we're setting up a world government, but kooks think it's real.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:20.700]  And then now there's a third blown oil leak where this stuff is like gotten into the honey
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:26.880]  comb of the undersea strata of the crust and is just coming up out of the seafloor everywhere.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.160]  Again, government, government can't fix it, though, but I bet government can come take
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  your guns.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.320]  I bet government can teach your kids not to trust you.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.680]  I bet government can mandate a Gardasil shot that'll brain damage your daughter or maybe
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.880]  kill her like the press has reported it's done.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.400]  And I bet the government can just kind of have it in the back of the news.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.120]  Oh, well, people are dying from this, but, you know, don't get upset.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.320]  Only kooks get upset.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.840]  Look at this article.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:59.740]  Israel stations nuclear missile subs off Iran, times of London, three German built Israeli
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.880]  submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles are to be deployed in the Gulf near the Iranian
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]  coastline.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.560]  Oh, that's that's really nice.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:12.040]  Oh, see, that's a man like, unless you parking lot, I want to breathe that stuff when it
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.640]  blows around in the jet stream.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.680]  Yeah, we're the good guys.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.920]  Nuke the Iraners, nuke the Arabs, of course, they're not even Arab, they're Persian.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:26.680]  Yeah, we've only overthrown them three times for no reason and a pro US guy over there,
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.280]  but the British wanted all the oil.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.560]  So we, we stage terror attacks, but you don't know about my mosa deck.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.880]  You don't know about 53.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.520]  You don't know anything.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.680]  You think the globalist want to nuke Iran, but, but that, but they're going to let you
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.520]  keep your pension funds, right?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.840]  The government likes you.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.920]  They'll kill a million Iraqis for some oil and weapons sales, but, but, but they're not
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.120]  going to take your pension.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.240]  Oh, oh, the government's not going to take your rights.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.400]  It's run by nice people.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  Uh-huh.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.360]  Well, just get, oh, now they're suddenly, I've got all these stacks of news here where
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.160]  suddenly it's all over the news that, okay, there are death panels.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.720]  Okay, there is rationing.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.840]  I'm suddenly the Democrats, uh, Kathleen Sebelius, I've got the press conference.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.440]  They say, is this rationing, you know, the quoting the head of your group saying that
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.280]  we will ration with our eyes open instead of our eyes closed.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.800]  She goes, yes, that is what it means.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.640]  We are going to ration, the government is your God.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.320]  They're not going to stop there folks.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.520]  You're going to live like they do in North Korea and Mexico because just as Thomas Jefferson
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.040]  said, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you put up with and you
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040]  better get angry.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  People like this guy gets angry.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040]  Yeah.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040]  Yeah.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.720]  I get angry about things that matter folks because I'm red-blooded.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.280]  Israel stations, nuclear missiles off Iran, threatening to use them and they're threatening
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:57.320]  to attack not just Iran, but Syria and Lebanon.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:03.160]  If anyone attacks them in any way, yeah, somebody shoots a fake missile over.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.640]  And again, I as an American, I'm not allowed because I better not criticize nuclear war.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.840]  I better say, well, that's patriotic.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.840]  Start the nuclear war immediately.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840]  Yes.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]  Netanyahu.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.720]  To White House, even staffer, on manual, yes, we have nuclear war immediately.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.280]  Israel rejects call to join anti-nuclear treaty.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.240]  Oh, no, they're the only one above the world government rules.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.120]  They don't have to follow any of those.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.160]  And they could arrest illegal aliens all day there, but oh, then the Israel lobby is always
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.360]  lobbying for open borders here.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.920]  I don't like that, but I'm supposed to shut up, though.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.640]  Oh, look, Israel rejects new drive to ban nukes from mid-east.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.800]  Oh, starving and diluted, yet North Korea is ready for war.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.480]  I better go to your calls.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.560]  It's just the whole world is hurtling down a rat hole.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.840]  And then I've got all this financial news, as Europe is imploding, U.S. stocks, oil,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  euro, tumble.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.400]  Dow ends worst since 1940, and if you count inflation, it's even worse than that.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.400]  That's Bloomberg.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.600]  Just, just, you like globalism?
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.680]  You like the New World Order?
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.560]  New home sales set to plunge in former bubble markets.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]  Bloomberg.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]  Oh, it's only going to get worse.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.800]  But every day they tell you, it's getting better.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]  It's getting better.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.040]  Lying until you're like you're an idiot.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.320]  Kathy in New Orleans, you're on the air.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.960]  Hey, Kathy was my girlfriend kind enough to do the phone work for me while I was maneuvering
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.800]  out of the French Quarter.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.120]  We just came from a protest there about the BP rally, and you just thought you were at
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.960]  a Copenhagen summit.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.920]  They're all screaming that it's climate change, and we all need to go green, and Stodger only
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.080]  was the most pathetic thing I think I've ever seen.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.080]  Yeah, more and more.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.880]  I think they staged it, and a lot of people are saying that.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.400]  I think they blew it as a pretext to get their carbon taxes, which are tens of trillions,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.040]  and to re-kick their entire program.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.400]  I'm not, I can't prove that, but I've had big Republican strategists on and others who've
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.800]  studied these people, and we know that they had a slow response on purpose because the
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.120]  more oil is in the gulf, the more power and control they get.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.560]  Absolutely, and to make it worse, yesterday when Obama was in Grand Isle, they buzzed
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:32.000]  down four school buses full of hired people, and they had these white painting, painter's
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.960]  outfits on, and what you saw on the Katy Kirk CBS News, it seemed like the BP was going
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.400]  strong on the cleanup when it was just a staged dog and pony show.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  Well, that's why, it's all over the news that anybody tries to show the coastline, they're
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  arrested, and because BP is now our Lord, and there's no First Amendment down there,
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.520]  what do you think you are, an American?
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:01.080]  This is Soviet Russia, 1950, you're not allowed to have cameras scum, you're allowed to work
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.320]  and pay the government, because the government gave birth to you.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.480]  So are people upset in Louisiana?
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:15.240]  They're grown Cajun men who are the hardest workers, are literally crying.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.280]  I think mission is just about accomplished as far as wiping out all the fishermen and
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.120]  all the people, Grand Isle, this is Memorial Day weekend, it's usually just hopping, people
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.000]  with boats, everything, it's the only thing you see now, it's military vehicles, and they're
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.120]  the only people eating, and it's pathetic when you look at the camps, and the only people
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:43.160]  that are renting the camps are Homeland Security National Guard.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.080]  How bad is the oil?
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:51.960]  The oil is getting into many places, I've had a friend of mine tell me that she's beginning
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:58.120]  to get sick, I'm convinced of this genocide going on down there, the people that are cleaning
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:05.120]  it out, literally by hand with mops and sponges, never mind any big barges or ocean-going barges
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:09.680]  or anything like that, there's just people by hand in little boats and they're getting
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.920]  sick, and they have these mobile medical stations, they go on, they give them a little something,
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.160]  they stick them right back in, and they're just spraying core exit everywhere, and it
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:27.520]  will not heat, the fact that core exit is the same toxicity as from now to high.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.400]  For those that don't know, they're using a bunch of deadly chemicals, crude oil won't
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.480]  make you sick unless you drink it, you can smear it all over you, and it's biodegradable,
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.560]  but then so they're bringing in thousands of tons of deadly chemical, mixing it in,
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.280]  but again that way a big globalist company gets a bunch of tax money, see because you
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.720]  never let a good crisis go to waste like Rom Emanuel told us, okay thank you, I appreciate
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.360]  the call, I'm going to try to hurry through your call straight ahead, Wayne Madsen on
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:07.640]  the North Korea situation coming up.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:37.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.160]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]  do you want?
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.520]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.760]  How much do you want?
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760]  When do you want it?
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.920]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.400]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.120]  and be immunized?
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.920]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.760]  How much will you need?
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]  We don't know.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]  How much do you want?
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  All you can get.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:55.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.280]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.640]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.600]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.240]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.280]  or gold?
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.640]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.840]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.320]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.320]  seeds.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.560]  food for you and your family, and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.960]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.200]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:48.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.080]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.200]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:15.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.920]  I want my children, I want my children to grow up free.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:26.360]  I am angry about somebody raising my taxes, taking my liberties, destroying my freedoms.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.600]  How do you think America had so much wealth and power?
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.520]  Because we had the most freedom.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.480]  Freedom produces wealth.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.760]  Now you notice, as we lose freedom, we lose wealth.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.240]  You put two and two together yet, folks.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.360]  And I've got all these bizarre stories, here's one out of AP, it's also in Raw Story.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.160]  Energy expert, nuking, oil leak, only thing we can do.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.200]  That's a lot worse than crude oil.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.240]  The chemicals they're using to disperse it is much worse.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.800]  C crude oil is not that big a deal, folks, when you're dealing with hundreds of trillions
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.120]  of gallons of saltwater versus millions of gallons of oil.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.360]  Oh, man.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.640]  And by the way, for those that don't know, oil naturally comes up from the sea floor
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.800]  and from regular land all the time.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.720]  I'm not saying this isn't a big deal.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.880]  I'm just pointing out the government response will make it worse, as it always does.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.560]  Katrina wouldn't bring food and water, wouldn't let people leave out over the bridge, came
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.120]  and took guns.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.960]  That's what the government wants.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.840]  That's the precedence it once said.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.840]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.400]  I mean, here's the times of London.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.640]  Greece urged to give up Euro by England.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:36.440]  I mean, the whole world system is collapsing and I turn on the news and I'm hearing about
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.440]  Lindsay Lohan.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440]  Folks, Lindsay Lohan doesn't matter, okay?
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.440]  You've been taught to only care about idiocy.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.680]  All right, I'm going to go to calls.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680]  I'm going to go to calls.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.880]  Annie in New York, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:55.160]  A couple of things with Lieberman's Charism, Ex-Creatoriation Act.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:01.680]  I mean, anyone suspected of being a terrorist, well, how about we turn this on them?
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.560]  I mean, I suspect the Clintons big time.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:10.200]  I suspect Lieberman and Kerry and Jamie and the Bushes and Emmanuel and Obama.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.240]  Why can't we use this on them?
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.520]  Well, I know this.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:20.240]  It is treason to have the federal government releasing illegal aliens when they catch him,
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.720]  not picking them up when sheriffs, I mean, it was in the Houston Chronicle a few years
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.720]  ago that over 200,000 illegals had been released from South Texas jails, including Houston,
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.800]  in the year before because the feds wouldn't come pick them up.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.000]  And the article said arson, armed robbery, rape.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.880]  If you're an illegal alien in America, folks, you are a god because the government is criminal.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:49.080]  It wants the maximum number of foreigners here to bankrupt the cities, bankrupt the
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.760]  counties and the states so the feds can come flapping into the rescue to take control.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.000]  This is an economic weapon.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.480]  And so it's treason.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.680]  And the North American Union is treason.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.480]  And all of this is treason.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.000]  And our government giving trillions to these banks, and the banks won't tell Congress
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.240]  where it went arrogantly.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.120]  I mean, in this film, Fall the Republic, in Obama deception, both my films I made last
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.960]  year, I have the congressional hearings where they say, where did this trillion go?
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.080]  Where did that trillion go?
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.760]  And Bernanke and Geithner and Paulson say, I'm not telling you.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.280]  I appreciate your call, Annie.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.920]  And then I've got to have the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL and Chris Matthews and
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:34.600]  CNN saying I'm a delusional extremist because I believe there's a world government.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.040]  Go Google world government in Google News.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.600]  There's hundreds of articles a day announcing world government.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.640]  That's saying it's good.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.240]  They're stalling you folks.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.080]  They sit there and talk to you like you're morons.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.080]  Mark in Texas.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.080]  You're on the air.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.080]  Go ahead.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.880]  Hey, I'm getting fired up just like you and trying to do things.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:01.880]  And I think that I've got, I think that the people down there in Mexico, I think that
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.520]  they want to know the same way to destroy these banker people and these people that
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.880]  have, I mean, I live here in San Antonio, Texas, and I want to say some good things
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.880]  about people.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.280]  I had a fellow the other day and I was getting things done.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.640]  I worked long weeks and on certain days I have time to go and do all my errands and
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.880]  I ran out of left my car at the gym and I didn't have money to get some things to pick
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.880]  up some good waters.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.280]  I didn't have to drink this floodwater and this guy did not speak unless he gave me the
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.280]  money for me watching me talk to the person at the counter.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.120]  So the people want to do what's right, but we're not, let me, let me say this, I always
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.560]  talk about Latin America because that's the majority, okay?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.160]  They're the salt of the earth, just like humans are all good people on average, okay?
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.360]  The issue here is they had a rotten foundation.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.040]  They had the Aztecs and then they were colonial.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.280]  They never had freedom.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.200]  They've never had real independence, okay?
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.920]  America's never been perfect, but compared to Mexico, we had a strong foundation.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.080]  And so that's why it's so torn up, Mark, but go ahead.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.640]  Well, I have a friend of mine, uh, I've spoken with several times and he's now in Canada.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.600]  He's a border patrol fellow and all the corruption that goes on in that it's, it's amazing how
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.640]  much that goes on.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.200]  How much money and drugs they take.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200]  Absolutely.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:21.760]  Look, you see these customs officers living in $500,000 million houses.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.680]  There's no way they can pay for it.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:30.480]  I'd have to say half the cops in senior positions are on the take more like 10%.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.160]  If you look at the studies, well, I mean, here's an example in the seventies, they had
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:42.720]  to fire 76% of the NYPD detectives because they were on the take.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.080]  They were, you know, with the whores, the drugs, the money, and it's a culture of corruption.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.080]  But go ahead.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.240]  Well, you know, I'm just one, I'm not going to be afraid anymore because I'm trying to
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.920]  just lean on, instead of doing my thing, I'm trying to lean on the perfect things of God.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:03.360]  I'm trying to learn and read what he says and, and just do that and realize that there's
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.800]  more than I can imagine that will happen good because he's in control of it all.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.480]  You said that and well, I respect the people that have stuck with just praying and doing
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.600]  things each day that we can do.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.320]  And I don't know, I don't have any answers.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:21.440]  I just wish that we could put these banker folks, it just somehow there's the, the God's
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.440]  words somewhere in there.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.440]  I'm not quoting things.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.360]  I don't like to be preachers because I don't believe in all that stuff.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.800]  But if we will seek God's face and repent, he'll heal our land.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.280]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:35.240]  But if you repent, then you'll won't be able to control yourself to stand up against evil
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.280]  and then that will heal your land.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.400]  Um, look, I, I promise to myself every day lately, I'm going to come in and do a calm
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.840]  radio show because the last few months I'd been doing pretty calm radio.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.400]  People were marveling at it and you know what, it's, it's entertaining.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.680]  It's interesting to have me yelling scream, but I, it's better when I actually go over
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.440]  all the news and the subtle nuances and really educate people.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.000]  But I physically, I'll be honest with you, I threw a microphone, a $2,000 microphone
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.920]  up against the wall, you know, in my own studio last week, because I'm just mad.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.400]  Folks, I mean, but you're supposed to be mad.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.360]  It is mentally ill that people are not folks.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:22.240]  The Associated Press reported on Thursday, $118,000 is owned by every man, woman and
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.040]  child in America, just on the national debt.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.280]  And that's what's currently owed.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:32.160]  If you look at expenditures and commitments, it's more like 300,000 that that was in the
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160]  news.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:37.280]  I already knew it, but to have them admitting it, no one's ever paying this off.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.720]  They're going to debase the currency.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.160]  There's no way out of that.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.120]  They're going to devalue global currencies.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:49.440]  I've got Goldman Sachs, print off PDF, Goldman economics paper number 196.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.320]  This just came out yesterday where they talk about global government, everything.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:59.040]  And they say the new world currency will be an SDR, just a made up digital money by the
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.360]  private banks that they will then loan to us.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.720]  See, they get us in debt.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.400]  They bankrupt us with fiat derivatives they sell us, then they come in, destroy our currencies
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.760]  and say, we've got a new one that they just make up.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:18.920]  And then we lose our credit rating and we've got to pay them instead of 5%, 20% for nothing.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.120]  Maybe like if I went out in the parking lot and got some dirt out of the ground and came
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.960]  in and said, give me your whole country because the currency is this dirt and you bowed down
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.400]  and gave me your liberty, your freedom, your families, your sovereignty, everything for
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:40.480]  a pile of made up SDRs that's backed up with our sweat, our blood, our tears, folks.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.480]  They raised taxes so bad this year, the CPA says they've gotten rid of all my tax exemptions,
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  everything.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.200]  They've got to pay people off because I pay it because they'll come arrest me if I don't
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.520]  when it all goes to private offshore banks.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:29:00.600]  I pay my taxes to the Federal Reserve made off prime syndicate.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.200]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.560]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.320]  Thank you.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.720]  They help to create a new world order.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.920]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.160]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.240]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240]  and documents.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.840]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.320]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.080]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.920]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:31.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.840]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.320]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320]  financial system.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.200]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.880]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.040]  And I got news for you.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.720]  You're everyone else.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.720]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.240]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.240]  do you want?
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.800]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.280]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.520]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.560]  Now or after the battle starts.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.680]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.120]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.600]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.720]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the Gathering Center
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.880]  and be immunized?
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.680]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.520]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.520]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.520]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.840]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.840]  What have we got?
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.320]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.200]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.400]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.080]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.080]  our money.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.160]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.880]  He's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.880]  We have the facts.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.880]  We have the constitution.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.880]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:34.880]  We have common law.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.440]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.440]  Don't tread on me.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.440]  Rise the republic.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.080]  Terror is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.880]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.880]  Don't tread on me.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:55.880]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:01.320]  And support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.040]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:08.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:19.960]  Here's a Reuters headline, White House flow rate of BP spill could increase by 20% during
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.240]  new operation oil coming up until August.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:31.160]  So 46 days isn't enough for them, you know, we're at day 41 right now.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.520]  They say it'll be another five days until they try this new thing.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.480]  People thought that might be 46 days.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.520]  Now, now they're saying until August, you know, 80 days, I mean, May is about to end
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.560]  June, so it just goes on and on and on.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.400]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.640]  When governments fear the people, there is liberty.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.120]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.120]  But I got FEMA on video teaching that he was a terrorist and bad because they're terrorists.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.360]  Mark Twain, I guess they call him a terrorist today as well.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.080]  I am more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.440]  I'm talking about the government.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:15.000]  Look, North Korea is run by a lunatic, Kim Jong-il, and they are involved in provocations.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.200]  But you notice Japan wants U.S. bases out.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:25.120]  You notice that China is being pressured right now to raise the value of their currency because
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.200]  it's completely destroying what's left of our industrial base.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:36.000]  And the U.S. troops have been there for 50-plus years.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:42.440]  The North Korean regime is on the verge of collapsing.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.680]  And I've looked at it.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.480]  The torpedo guts that are left of the supposed torpedo, it's been confirmed now, is a German
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.080]  torpedo, not a North Korean or Chinese torpedo.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.400]  And it's a perfect way to keep our troops there, a perfect way to manage Japan.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.120]  And we've got Wayne Madsen joining us for just this segment, next segment I'll finish
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.040]  up with those callers that are holding and hit some other news.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:12.240]  But he worked for RCA as a government consultant on contracts for the National Security Agency.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.920]  He later worked for the Naval Data Automation Command.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.360]  He's reported for the Washington Post, the list goes on and on, CNN, I mean, you name
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:27.000]  it, just hundreds and hundreds of reports on national security issues, and he's really
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  over the years turned out to be one of the best sources we've got in hindsight.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.840]  And so here's one of the headlines, attack against South Korean ship, looks like a false
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:36.560]  flag operation.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.360]  Here's another one from the Wayne Madsen Report.com, Beijing suspects false flag attack on South
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.400]  Korean Corvette.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.280]  And so now we go directly to the man, Wayne Madsen joining us from Washington, D.C.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.000]  Wayne, break down what you believe has happened and what Beijing thinks.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.720]  Well, yes, Alex, what I'm hearing from Beijing is that when the incident first took place,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.720]  Kim Jong-il, who of course is a Stalinist, just like his father was, but he's not a
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:08.880]  suicide Stalinist, he was called to Beijing, he never flies because he's afraid somebody
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:14.400]  will take down his airplane, so he took the train from Pyongyang to Beijing.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.560]  The Chinese asked him, point blank, did you have anything to do with this?
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.200]  He said no, and they were reasonably assured that what he was telling was the truth.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.800]  Now we know that this incident took place near this Pyongyang Island, which is a South
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.480]  Korean island, the westernmost part of South Korea, but it sits directly across from North
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.280]  Korean territory, heavily fortified North Korean territory.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:45.760]  But on the South Korean Pyongyang Island, it's a U.S.-South Korean military intelligence
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.760]  base.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:52.880]  There are U.S. Navy SEALs present, present as there was this equal fair exercise going
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.960]  on between the U.S. and South Korea, a civilian U.S. Navy ship, the U.S. and a salvo was present.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.560]  It would just happen to have 16 D.C. divers on board when this incident takes place.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:13.480]  And of course, and now I'm hearing from Beijing that, of course, that when the incident first
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:18.520]  took place, of course, South Korea thought, well, maybe it was rough seas that caused
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.520]  the whole attraction.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.280]  But their story has changed so many times from South Korea.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.280]  Two things.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.000]  The real target for this incident was Japan, because the Japanese, the new Japanese government
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.480]  of Prime Minister Hatuyama wanted the U.S. out of this marine base in Okinawa.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.600]  They're only going to switch it now from 10 months to Camp Schwab, but they've had enough
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.680]  of these Marines raping little Japanese girls, 12-year-old girls on their way home from school.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.320]  This is going on time and time again, and I know it's Memorial Day, but we, although
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.760]  we honor our servicemen and those who gave their lives, we also have to remember not
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  every serviceman we send abroad is a shining example.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.840]  Well, if we defend this type of raping children, which is which they've been convicted of over
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.440]  and over again, we then discredit them all.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:13.520]  So Japan, the people of Okinawa, they had enough of it, but what happened after this
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.800]  incident, the rise in tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Prime Minister Hatuyama, who represents
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.080]  the federal government, was flipped.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.440]  He was opposed to the base being moved to another part of Okinawa, and now he agrees
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.840]  with it, and it's caused a split in his own government.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:38.440]  The old Democratic partner resigned from the cabinet, and then we had this strange spectacle,
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.360]  and I got this from sources in Beijing that Hillary Clinton and Timothy Geithner, the Treasury
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:49.080]  Secretary, were both in Beijing together, and they were acting like school kids at these
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.320]  bilateral meetings with the Chinese.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.680]  No, I saw the video.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.400]  They were laughing and giggling and acting weird, and I have the Reuters quotes where
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.600]  Geithner told the Chinese, and I read the quotes in the last hour, so I won't do it
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  again here, but the headline is, Geithner tells Europe to emulate China on growth, and
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.480]  in the fourth and fifth paragraph, he says, look, the U.S. is out of money, the American
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:15.800]  people aren't going to be able to buy your goods anymore, we've maxed them out debt-wise,
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.160]  and so you better become sustainable and only trade with Europe.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:24.400]  I mean, even if that was true, to have the Treasury Secretary running around saying America
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.520]  is a dead duck, I mean, are they trying to create a dump of the dollar?
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.400]  I mean, this evil elf is just a treasonous little moron.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.440]  Yeah, well, he looks like he just graduated from high school, and I would note that he's
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  also heavily involved in these pick-up basketball games, and after my week in Chicago, I'm beginning
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:50.640]  to think that may be a code word for something entirely different, but on South Korea, we
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.640]  now know that a large percentage of the South Korean population suspects their own government.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.520]  President Lee Young-bok, this was a false flag, he's a right-winger, and he came into
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.640]  office with the sole intention of rationing things up with North Korea, and what does
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.920]  North Korea have to gain from this?
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  Nothing.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:16.320]  The special economic zone that they were using to earn hard Western currency, all trade has
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320]  stopped now.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.600]  They're talking about sanctions, they had nothing to gain from this, absolutely nothing,
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:27.720]  and of course the South Korean right-wing regime has everything to gain, as did the
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.200]  US with the Okinawa base in Japan.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.980]  What about this headline here out of the times of London where Israel has dolphin submarines
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:42.600]  with nukes off the coast of Iran?
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:49.400]  They've had two at any given time in the past, each of the courts allows them to transit
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:41:00.600]  the Suez Canal from their port in Haifa, and they've always had at least one, now three
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:07.880]  obviously, this Israeli government is held bent on starting a war with the Iranians.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.600]  Well, I guess my question is this one in a limited time.
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.320]  Why is it on the cover of the times of London Israel deploys nukes off the coast of Iran,
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.880]  where as just a year ago it was taboo to admit that Israel had 400 high-tech weapons?
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.360]  Well, we just had this interesting thing where the US suggested that Israel join the
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.480]  Non-Proliferation Treaty, they rejected it, now I think we're going to, basically I think
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:38.640]  very soon we're going to see maybe a little shift in the US policy of stating the flat
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.040]  out that Israel has nuclear weapons.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.720]  We know that the deal was done with South Africa, we have Shimon Peres' signature on
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.800]  the deal made with the apartheid regime in 75 where they agreed to share nuclear technology.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:59.360]  So, I think more and more, and they put more to Kaivan Nunu back at prison apparently.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.560]  So every time the Israeli nukes who comes up, they put their nuclear scientist who's
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:08.760]  basically blown a whistle on it, they put him back in jail or under house arrest.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:15.200]  Well, it does look hypocritical saying Iran can't have nukes, peaceful reactors, but Israel
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.320]  can have high-tech weapons systems and the missiles to deliver it.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:27.320]  But again, looking at this larger situation, what last week, it came out that Obama at
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:34.120]  one level had said please send your uranium for enrichment to Brazil, to France and Turkey,
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.680]  and we will basically not attack you.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.840]  And then when Iran said, okay, we'll ship our uranium out to make sure it's not weapons
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.960]  grade, then suddenly, oh no, we can't do that anymore, showing there's a fight going on
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  in the administration.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.120]  Wayne Madsen, report.com is the website.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  Our site's infowars.com.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.600]  Wayne, thanks for coming on about the potential false flag on the Korean Peninsula.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  You bet.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.160]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.640]  Stay with us and a lot more.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.640]  Hi, folks.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.440]  This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about SOAP, not detergents
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.920]  but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.160]  American company.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.960]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.600]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.600]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  anywhere.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.560]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at five-star-soap.com
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.160]  or infowars.com.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.160]  Let's talk to the owner of Five-Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:42.920]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:46.840]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:52.400]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:44:06.200]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.080]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:16.000]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.960]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.680]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:26.680]  our families.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:30.480]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.160]  of your own home.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.760]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.920]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.920]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:54.920]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:18.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:25.320]  seeds?
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.160]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:34.320]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.960]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:48.040]  So visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:57.040]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.600]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:07.200]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:14.600]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing black and gusset seeds.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.120]  They make blue diamond, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:27.680]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.000]  They sew a diamond gusset and put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.120]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.640]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.640]  You don't understand, folks, we do our share of this commercial.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.480]  We use combined gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could ride all day with
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.480]  confidence.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.480]  Yes, I know we're live listeners.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480]  Where are yours at www.gusset.com?
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480]  www.gusset.com?
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.480]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.960]  You know, I guess my problem is I've studied history, I know how hardcore vicious it is.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:29.560]  I know how my ancestors braved hell on earth to build this country.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:36.640]  On my dad's side, my mom's side, Mayflower, battles in Texas, everything, and I know everybody
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.840]  around the world's fought for the little bit of freedom we've got.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.440]  When we come a bunch of TV watching jellyfish that don't know anything about how the world
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.640]  works, we're going to be robbed.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.120]  Powerful interests are going to take what we've got.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  It's real simple.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.440]  So, on Memorial Day, I want to say this, I love our veterans, I love this country.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.080]  I love the red, white, and blue, but for those of you out there that claim you love it,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.960]  you better go research what it really means and decide which side of history you're on.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:07.040]  Because what this country's turned into, and what our government does, desecrates the red,
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.120]  white, and blue.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.080]  It's the antithesis, it's the opposite of it.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.360]  I'm angry, and I'm sick of traders parading around with American flags wrapped around
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:17.360]  them.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.200]  While they're doing everything they can to kill what that flag stands for, Rinaldo in
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.200]  New York City.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.080]  Thanks for holding Rinaldo.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.080]  Welcome.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.280]  Hello, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.000]  One thing about illegal immigration, like I live in New York City per se, after I got
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:39.280]  out to military back in 2003, I noticed a large influx of Mexicans around New York City
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.000]  before previously when I joined the military, I really didn't notice them.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.680]  The majority of Hispanic population in New York City is Dominican and Puerto Rican, just
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.800]  out of nowhere overnight, they're just everywhere, and I'm of Hispanic descent.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.320]  My family came from Panama, my mother learned how to speak the language, she learned English
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:05.280]  with the school, she became a nurse and she had still education in us, and I'm successful
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280]  now.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:13.320]  But one thing about welfare, do you see them shutting down that welfare system soon, so
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.320]  then people that are warned of government slay plantation will reverse you right after
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.800]  they cut off everybody's welfare?
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.920]  Yes, that's part of the plan, but first they want to totally break the borders down, that's
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.920]  why they're rushing to do it.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.640]  They want to get as many people in here as they can, and again, if we didn't have welfare,
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.680]  it wouldn't matter if we had 30 to 40 million illegals because they're hardworking folks.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:40.160]  In fact, they take these hardworking people, intelligent people, and they literally shove
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.840]  government on them and turn them into little globoids, and that's why we've got to oppose
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  it.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.800]  Can you imagine what 35, 40 million illegals, over 90% of them, voting to take our guns and
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.440]  bring in the world government?
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.880]  That's, look, it's simple.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.360]  If the globalists are for something, we've got to be against it, and yes, they're going
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.840]  to cut the welfare down to almost nothing once they fully implode the economy.
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.240]  That's the austerity we're hearing about.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.040]  But first, they're going to get the unwashed masses, no matter what color they are, but
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:16.520]  poor, that's how the elitists call us, the unwashed masses, all of us.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.480]  You have a million bucks you're unwashed to them.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.960]  If you're not part of their club, part of their family, they want to sick the really
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:30.120]  poor welfare crowd on the middle class to totally socialize everything nationally.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.720]  That's what globalism is.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.480]  Then the internationalists sit offshore and have the money conduited to them.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.560]  Okay, so, I mean, that's what the new order is.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:43.840]  Where they set up a global government that selectively robs the middle class and then
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:47.240]  transfers the money to themselves, Ronaldo, I appreciate your call.
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.440]  And look, I mean, NAFTA, GATT, globalism, it hurts Mexico, it hurts the US, but it
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.880]  helps consolidate power.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.960]  NAFTA and GATT destroyed Mexico.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.280]  That's why they're all pouring up here.
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.680]  I don't blame them.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.480]  The point is, I don't have the communication system to sit there and somehow deprogram
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.480]  these people.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.680]  Just like I can't deprogram the average American.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:14.160]  I mean, look, open borders is the key to bringing down the US, okay?
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.280]  It's a chopped-off leg.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.280]  We're bleeding to death.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.280]  We got to put a tourniquet on it.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.120]  We've got to fix it now, folks.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.280]  Plus, look at American citizens.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.400]  We're treated like trash.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.600]  We have the book thrown at us.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:33.320]  And then we don't get any respect because we're already here.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.000]  We're already slaves.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.680]  They want to lure people here to be slaves.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.160]  It's not just that the illegals of the new slave class, they are, but they're being
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:45.480]  brought in to join the slaves.
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.320]  One of the slaves, home of the cowards.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320]  That's what the globalists think.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.920]  I believe we're the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.520]  But look, Memorial Day isn't about John Wayne movies, folks.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.720]  It's about learning what it is to be an American.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.240]  Jonathan and Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:00.240]  Go ahead.
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.240]  Yes, Alex.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:09.000]  Just wanted to make a quick statement, only fitting for Memorial Day, fighting the good
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.760]  fight alongside many others, not licking any boots.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:19.880]  I'm on Ed Fox 777 YouTube with, that's with two X's, a good movie to watch today.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:20.880]  It's only fitting.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:21.880]  Don't tread on me.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:28.120]  That's for the screaming, drooling, madman, Chris Matthews for his 1984 propaganda style
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.120]  film.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.120]  He's coming in June.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:36.560]  I just wanted to say that the elites, SMBC and Chris Matthews is 100% underestimating
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.280]  all of us true patriots.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:39.760]  God bless you, Jonathan.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.760]  You're awesome.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.760]  Absolutely.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:48.520]  Don't tread on me on DVD, available at info wars.com, states, rights, constitution, democracy
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:54.000]  versus Republican, democracy versus a Republican form of government.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  Republican form of government.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.160]  That doesn't mean Republican party folks, relearn or learn for the first time what it is to
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:00.240]  be an American.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.120]  It's an idea, not a race, not a color.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:03.280]  It's an idea.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:08.600]  Don't tread on me available at info wars.com and at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.280]  Jake in New York, you're on the air, sir.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.280]  God bless you.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:13.280]  Wow.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.280]  This is pretty crazy.
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:20.280]  I've been looking into you for a long time and it's pretty cool to be on air now.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:21.280]  I've waited a while.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.280]  Well, here you are.
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:26.560]  You're talking to the, to the, to the, the Patriot baboon, Alex Jones.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.560]  Go ahead.
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.560]  Yeah.
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.760]  My dude, my girlfriend thinks you're really hot too, by the way.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760]  Okay.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760]  Well, all right.
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:39.080]  I do not avoid women, man, Drake, but I do deny them my essences.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:43.280]  Old Jack T. Ripper said, I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:53.360]  I just wrote an article on the Times online UK saying that the consulting firm in London
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:59.480]  is, I guess, advising the Greeks to leave the eurozone at default on its debt.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.480]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.480]  Go ahead.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:07.600]  And it, yeah, I mean, you got it right in front of you, but it's saying, I don't know,
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:13.440]  like Spain would follow suit, possibly Italy, or it would pretty much take the euro down
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:15.840]  and put everything like the doll.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.440]  I mean, how much would that drive?
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.240]  That's what the trilateral commission said in the mid-70s is that they would create the,
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.040]  the Asian Union, the European Union, the American Union.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.520]  Those have all been in operation for at least five years, the euro longer.
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.360]  Again, the public doesn't even know that, but they have the Asian Union, American Union,
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:40.880]  the European Union, then they, so we had Greg Palace, top BBC reporter on, also ABC Nightly
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.160]  News reporter, and he said, you know, he met with some of the, you know, he listed the
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.500]  names, some of the founders of the euro, and they said, no, it's designed to take control
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.160]  of nations and rob them and implode them.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:57.120]  So see the North American Union is about looting, the European Union is about looting, Asian
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.600]  Union is about looting.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.040]  And then when they're done with those, they dissolve them.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.760]  And the SDR has created a global cashless system where you'll still have regional currencies,
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:09.680]  but they'll be denominated in the SDR.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:15.160]  And I was just showing folks earlier, watching on PrismPlanet.TV, the Goldman Sachs announcement
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.840]  that globally they're all going to SDRs.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.440]  So they're going to kill currencies one after the other, and it'll probably take two, three
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.520]  years to kill them all.
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.960]  But once they've done that, the bankers won't have to go in and have Federal reserves anymore
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:33.400]  and have some connection to taxpayers and some connection to sovereignty.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.800]  It'll just be the global government, as Gordon Brown said, and as Herman von Rumpi, head
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:43.760]  of the EU said, global convention, a constitution of the top bankers, and then you won't be
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:47.480]  able to buy, sell, or trade without their digital approval.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.800]  So this is literally anti-Christ level control.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:53.200]  Can I get your opinion on something?
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.200]  Sure, fast.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:55.200]  We're almost out of time.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.360]  Okay, can you give me your prediction on when pretty much everything's going to go to absolute
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:01.360]  hell?
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.400]  Well, sir, we've already got 20-plus percent real unemployment.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:06.840]  Things are going to hell.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.840]  Half the restaurants I try to go to are shut down now.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.160]  I've doubled my audience every year, and in the past when we doubled the audience, more
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:15.160]  revenue would come in.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:16.160]  No, that doesn't happen.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.160]  It's less revenue.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:23.480]  It's just the real economy is just this slow implosion.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.560]  Well, if we don't reverse this, arrest the bankers, the default on the debts, the right
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.840]  way to go, they don't owe this debt.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:35.640]  The bankers created thousands of times more assets than there is real things, and then
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.400]  they sucker you in a debt black hole that's impossible to pay back to always give them
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.280]  more or they threaten to create a depression when you're already in a depression.
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.760]  It's like a boa constrictor that's killing you saying, don't struggle or I'll suffocate
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:50.760]  you.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:53.800]  If you don't struggle and get out, you're going to be suffocated.
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:01.280]  So it's squeezing you going, it's okay, I'm your friend, although I'm squeezing you, but
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.840]  if you don't resist, I promise I'll be nice.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.840]  So you relax and go, okay, bank or bail out, and squeeze, it's even better, it's like there,
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:16.040]  see, I told you, I'm your friend.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.760]  These people aren't going to stop.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.240]  You understand, we have to stop them, and do that, we have to stop being liberals, stop
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:29.040]  being conservatives, and become patriots who understand the true geopolitical system.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:33.080]  And after we beat the New World Order, we can decide what type of system we want.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:38.000]  I'm sorry to Joshua, Joe and Kevin, I'll be back live tomorrow on Tuesday, if you want
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.640]  to call me on the weekday show 11 to 3 central, get angry about freedom.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.680]  This is the number one issue.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.680]  Nothing else matters.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:48.760]  If you don't have freedom, you have nothing, the engine of wealth is liberty.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:58:17.280]  Great job, crew.
