[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:59.000]  25 years and my life is still trying to get up there, great big healer of hope.
[00:59.000 --> 01:19.000]  For a destination, I realized quickly when I knew I should that the world was made up of the struggle of man, for whatever that means.
[01:19.000 --> 01:47.000]  What you see on the screen in front of you is a video compilation of professional athletes who have passed out, had heart attacks, cardiac problems on professional fields,
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  whether it's soccer, basketball, football, hockey.
[01:55.000 --> 02:09.000]  And this video on the screen from a YouTube channel, Jay Wilderness, has actually put together three of these compilations, totals about 20 minutes.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  With the 90s song What's Going On, isn't that the question? What's going on?
[02:17.000 --> 02:28.000]  Why are all of these professional athletes and young athletes, who are in the best physical condition of all humans most of the time, are all of a sudden having all of these heart problems?
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Some of them dying.
[02:32.000 --> 02:58.000]  And then there was last night, where a young football player who perhaps was doing his best work off the field as a good Samaritan takes what is referred to as a routine hit in an NFL football game
[02:58.000 --> 03:11.000]  and then loses his heartbeat, loses his breath, has to be resuscitated on the field, heart stopped, breath stopped, they were able to get his heart going again.
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  Such a shocking thing for the players. There were tears on the field.
[03:18.000 --> 03:29.000]  And the reporter that the NFL told them, take five minutes and get back on the field to play, but the players and the coaches decided otherwise.
[03:29.000 --> 03:47.000]  But how could you go on? How could you play after seeing your friend, your colleague, your brother out on the field for almost 10 minutes needing emergency medical treatment?
[03:47.000 --> 03:57.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, you're tuned in to Info Wars today because you know you're going to get the unvarnished truth.
[03:57.000 --> 04:09.000]  And you know that nobody's going to tell it like it is with the background and the context and the understanding like we are right here.
[04:09.000 --> 04:24.000]  But just to understand, the reason why this has become such a national story is because the questions of what's going on when it comes to vaccinated athletes,
[04:24.000 --> 04:40.000]  dropping dead, having heart attacks at rates we've never seen before until after this mRNA experimental COVID vaccine injection.
[04:40.000 --> 04:50.000]  We're going to lay it all out for you here on the other side of this Tuesday, January 3rd edition of the Alex Jones show.
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be hearing from lawyers, doctors and covering all the angles from this massive story.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  But I thank you all for your support, please commit now to go to InfoWarsStore.com to get great products and make donations.
[05:52.000 --> 06:20.000]  I thank you for your support, now take action. The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  We're working overtime with extra focus today because even though the big story that a lot of people are concerned about, and we all know why,
[06:31.000 --> 06:45.000]  is last night during a Monday night football game, Buffalo Bill's safety 24 year old DeMar Hamlin collapses on the field due to cardiac arrest,
[06:45.000 --> 06:56.000]  and had to be taken to the hospital in Ambulance. The game was postponed, I think maybe the first time in NFL history,
[06:56.000 --> 07:04.000]  certainly the first time I can ever remember an NFL game being postponed, that almost never happens, not for whether injury, anything.
[07:04.000 --> 07:17.000]  But it was such a gut wrenching, it was such a gut blow for the athletes and the coaching staff to watch their friend,
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  their colleague, their brother on the field collapsed, needing emergency medical attention for 10 minutes.
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  It was such a shaking and jarring experience, they decided they would not take the field, even after it was reported the NFL said take five then finish the game,
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  they decided to do otherwise, and you know the NFL is probably lucky that the players made that decision because they didn't need that bad press,
[07:44.000 --> 07:53.000]  they didn't need to look so bad today, when even Skip Bayless who said that the game seems irrelevant after this,
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  that was considered so controversial, he might not even have a job tomorrow.
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  Amazing stuff, so a lot of bouncing balls here, we're going to cover all the angles.
[08:05.000 --> 08:13.000]  Now, I also need to mention because this is going on, there is a vote for the speaker of the house coming up today,
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  and from my last measurements looking at this, I don't know if Kevin McCarthy is going to have the votes folks,
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  and I think a certain number of Republican holdouts have decided, we have no problem sabotaging these two years,
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.000]  we have no problem in sabotaging Kevin McCarthy's speakership, we have no problem in sacrificing these next two years,
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  because they mean nothing if nothing in the Republican party is going to change.
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  And so I salute Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert and Bob Good and others who have said, you know what, we're not going to get behind McCarthy,
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  I think it's political brilliance that Matt Gaetz is currently exhibiting.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  And I have no problem with the Republican holdout sabotaging Kevin McCarthy's speakership,
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  or even the next two years in Congress, because it's not going to make a difference if we don't get new leadership,
[09:06.000 --> 09:16.000]  it's not going to make a difference if the Republican party doesn't start to have voter policy from the ground up,
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  not from the donors down.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  So we will be covering that.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  I also want to mention, again, we're hoping to get a doctor or two on today, we've got a couple we're reaching out to,
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  maybe we'll open up the phone lines and hear from some doctors to comment on what we saw last night.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  Attorney Thomas Renz is going to be joining us.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  And then other big news, Leo Zagami joining us already scheduled on the death of the former Pope Benedict.
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  And so a lot of bouncing balls today, we're going to be covering all of them, and Alex Jones is coming up,
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  because here's the thing, we're about to get the new Fauci files from Twitter.
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.000]  And so for this tragedy to happen on that football field last night, and we don't know the whole story yet,
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  let's be clear, we don't know the whole story yet.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  But whatever the story ends up being, it is beyond a doubt,
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  it has put the vaccine issue and put the vaccine injuries at the front of the line for discussion.
[10:16.000 --> 10:26.000]  And for that now to be at the top of mind, when we're about to be getting the Fauci files is a very important development.
[10:26.000 --> 10:37.000]  And so it really just adds more weight, it adds more focus, it adds more importance to the Fauci files,
[10:37.000 --> 10:50.000]  and to what we've seen in the other Twitter files, how the U.S. government, the healthcare portion of the U.S. government,
[10:50.000 --> 10:58.000]  with Anthony Fauci was actively censoring any negative information about the vaccines,
[10:58.000 --> 11:11.000]  which we know that they know had a severe risk of heart complication side effects.
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  We have the slides from October 2019, we have their meetings, we have their emails,
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  they all knew the side effects of this vaccine, they still went on TV and told you safe and effective.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  Now, what's the story as far as last night with the NFL players cardiac arrest?
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  Well, do you know he was vaccinated?
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  We don't know that.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  And I will tell you that the event that he took that hit with,
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  you can call it a routine NFL hit, that's fine. Folks, no NFL hit is routine.
[11:53.000 --> 12:04.000]  I have been on NFL sidelines, I've watched NFL games from the sidelines, there is no such thing as a routine hit.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  It might be routine for the NFL, but let me tell you, you go stand in the middle of a football field,
[12:10.000 --> 12:21.000]  and an NFL player runs at you 20 miles per hour, you think that's going to be considered routine, you think that's going to feel routine.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  Every hit in the NFL is violent, even the routine ones.
[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000]  And I'm willing to stay, and I don't think this is a reach, and a lot of people won't like this, but I'm sorry, it's the truth.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  Folks, the gentleman collapsed and had a cardiac event because of the hit.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  The vaccine did not cause him to collapse on the field.
[12:45.000 --> 12:55.000]  Now, again, if we find out he is vaccinated or double vaccinated, now you have the issue of did the vaccine make the situation worse?
[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  Because he was vaccinated and had a fiber clot, was it harder to get his heart going again?
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  Did it make it a situation that was already bad much worse?
[13:06.000 --> 13:21.000]  That's a fair question to ask, but anybody saying that his cardiac event was not caused by the hit, I'm sorry, but you're making a fool of yourself.
[13:21.000 --> 13:32.000]  This is about a 30 mile per hour collision, and Hamlin takes direct blunt force trauma to the chest, to the heart.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  This has happened in sports before any vaccines.
[13:35.000 --> 13:45.000]  I personally remember somebody I know, Chris Pronger, an NFL hockey player got hit with a slap shot, excuse me, NHL hockey player, got hit with a slap shot right in the chest.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  Exact same thing happened.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  Now, Pronger got up, collapsed, they were able to resuscitate him and get his heart going, and we knew everything about that situation in about a half an hour.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  And he was back up and responsive within an hour.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  That is not the same situation for Hamlin.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  So maybe that's a vaccine caused issue.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  Maybe that's a vaccine making a bad issue worse.
[14:10.000 --> 14:21.000]  But whatever you think, whatever the truth may be, there is no doubt this is now at the top of people's minds and there is no doubt this is at the head of the conversation.
[14:21.000 --> 14:29.000]  Now, when we come back, folks, I've got a stack of news forgetting about last night's tragedy for a second.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  I've got a stack of news here.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  There is no doubt of athletes being injured by the vaccine.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  I've got stacks of news over here, young children that we know died from the vaccine.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  So if you're looking at this event seeking vindication in your vaccine stance, you don't need vindication.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  You're already vindicated, folks.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  So let's not give the people that want to make us look bad any more ammo to do so.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  The hit caused the cardiac event, potentially a vaccine in his body, made it that much worse.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  So we're going to follow all these bouncing balls when we come back.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  And I'm going to give you all the information and all the resources you need to fully understand this situation throughout the broadcast today.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, we wouldn't even be on air if it wasn't for your support at infowarstore.com.
[15:25.000 --> 15:37.000]  Who knows if the vaccine is even being discussed today, if it wasn't for info wars being on air, and our great guests like Dr. Francis Boyle and Dr. Peter McCullough and Thomas Renz and so much more
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  to make the issue here about the vaccines that are killing people.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  It might not even be within the realm of discussion today.
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.000]  But because we did, and because you shopped at infowarstore.com, it is now the number one discussed topic is vaccine injuries.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  And if that's what we witnessed last night on a football field, so keep us on the air and shopping infowarstore.com.

[19:13.560 --> 19:17.240]  to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and and the
[19:17.240 --> 19:22.240]  forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible made any resistance to it
[19:22.240 --> 19:27.120]  possible was people continuing to support info wars. Despite the massive
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.680]  lawfare being waged against info wars, despite the media defamatory libelous

[19:55.520 --> 19:59.160]  keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American

[20:06.800 --> 20:29.840]  Alex Jones 2023 is here last year was a groundbreaking time for him out we went
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.920]  through two and a half years of globalist brainwashing and them throwing
[20:33.920 --> 20:37.720]  every dirty trick in the book of psychological warfare is the people and
[20:37.720 --> 20:41.720]  they put all their citizenship and all their control systems in play but
[20:41.720 --> 20:47.720]  despite that their attempt to continue lockdowns have forced injections as 98
[20:47.720 --> 20:51.920]  percent now failed and there are criminal investigations being opened up all over
[20:51.920 --> 20:56.600]  the world including in the United States against criminals that carried this out
[20:56.600 --> 21:02.480]  they are eugenicists they are a death cult and they won't stop to let total
[21:02.480 --> 21:07.760]  planetary rule to carry out for the population that's why these Twitter files
[21:07.760 --> 21:11.600]  that are about to be released on Thursday by Elon Musk are so incredibly
[21:11.600 --> 21:16.880]  important on Dr. Fauci we already know that Fauci worked through the government
[21:16.880 --> 21:21.080]  big tech to censor alternative treatments at their opponents and the lie
[21:21.080 --> 21:24.440]  about the poison shots when they knew they didn't work and they hurt people
[21:24.440 --> 21:30.520]  but now we're gonna have even more of the actual documents of Fauci directing
[21:30.520 --> 21:36.080]  through big tech using governmental power to keep all the thousands of
[21:36.080 --> 21:40.440]  prominent scientists and doctors and medical workers from telling the truth
[21:40.440 --> 21:44.520]  about the experiences they had and what they witnessed this is pure evidence of
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.760]  premeditated mass murder so throughout the week we're gonna be chronic like the
[21:49.760 --> 21:53.360]  past crimes of these monsters because we don't bring them to justice they're
[21:53.360 --> 22:01.040]  going to do it again yes they're beginning to win major battles but we

[22:56.240 --> 23:00.640]  30 minutes as we're getting ready for the show and doing the show prep and
[23:00.640 --> 23:05.240]  getting all the news articles and all the videos and the studio set up I gave
[23:05.240 --> 23:09.480]  the crew a special assignment and I engaged in it a little bit myself about
[23:09.480 --> 23:14.040]  30 minutes I said guys just just go online and just find as many stories as
[23:14.040 --> 23:18.120]  you can about young athletes professional athletes dying from heart
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.480]  complications or having to retire or collapsing on the field from heart
[23:21.480 --> 23:26.200]  complications the number one side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and and most of
[23:26.200 --> 23:33.240]  these cases have been affirmed that the individual that suffered the cardiac
[23:33.240 --> 23:40.480]  event was vaccinated now that is not the case for Chris Pronger who you see on
[23:40.480 --> 23:43.800]  the screen here in front of me now why am I playing a hockey video of a guy
[23:43.800 --> 23:53.720]  collapsing because I understand why the individuals who have already been proven
[23:53.720 --> 23:59.480]  right about the COVID-19 vaccine are feeling so desperate to be vindicated
[23:59.480 --> 24:05.520]  and and using the focus on last night's NFL game and the Buffalo Bill safety
[24:05.520 --> 24:12.240]  collapsing on the field as a moment of vindication or a moment of this is a
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.840]  red pill for people to know how bad the vaccines are you just we can't be sure
[24:17.840 --> 24:23.000]  of that I still to this moment do not know what Hamlin's vaccine status was I
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.200]  don't know it do you you might say it's safe to assume but there were other
[24:28.200 --> 24:31.800]  players on the Buffalo Bills that refused to get a vaccine it was a major
[24:31.800 --> 24:41.720]  news story some of them became openly actively voices against the vaccines one
[24:41.720 --> 24:49.440]  of them was on the field last night Cole Beasley so I can't rush to a
[24:49.440 --> 24:55.080]  conclusion there is it a serious situation that the vaccine may have made a
[24:55.080 --> 25:01.080]  bad situation worse last night absolutely of course that could be the case but why
[25:01.080 --> 25:08.040]  do I show you that video of Chris Pronger in an NHL playoff game from 1998
[25:08.040 --> 25:13.400]  when there was no COVID-19 vaccine he collapsed during a hockey game why
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.120]  because he took a slap shot to the chest and as you see in this video just
[25:19.120 --> 25:26.360]  like last night he gets up thinking he's okay and then collapses on the ice now
[25:26.360 --> 25:33.000]  what happened to Chris Pronger is an event that happens every once in a while
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.160]  sometimes fatally even in sporting events it's happened to young athletes
[25:38.160 --> 25:42.760]  before and it's actually worse for young athletes because they don't have the
[25:42.760 --> 25:50.480]  body mass or the bone mass as these professional athletes do so when they
[25:50.480 --> 25:55.600]  get direct blunt force trauma to the heart area it can be worse for young
[25:55.600 --> 26:02.520]  kids and so it can be called cardiac arrhythmia it can be called comatio
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.840]  cortis I've seen a couple other things but the phenomenon is when you have
[26:07.840 --> 26:14.320]  direct blunt force trauma directly to the heart area and if it can apply enough
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.320]  pressure through the sternum or through the ribs or the chest wall and if it
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.360]  hits at a perfect the perfectly timed to hit in between heartbeats it can throw
[26:26.360 --> 26:32.920]  off your heartbeat and it can empty the blood from your heart and so what
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.280]  happens is you think you're okay and you stand up and then you go for that first
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.720]  step and you don't have a heart rate you don't have blood pressure because you
[26:41.720 --> 26:44.680]  just had it knocked out of your heart it's kind of like having the wind knocked
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.600]  out of your lungs except for your heart and if your heart stops beating it's a
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.680]  lot harder to move than if you can't breathe for a couple seconds once you've
[26:54.680 --> 26:57.280]  had the wind knocked out of your lungs so it's a similar thing of having the
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.000]  wind knocked out of your lungs except for your heart it happens it's happened
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.560]  before COVID-19 vaccines it'll happen after the COVID-19 vaccines and that's
[27:05.560 --> 27:11.720]  100% what happened to the safety last night and you can say it's a routine hit
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.760]  as much as you want it might be for an NFL player NFL football is violent
[27:16.760 --> 27:22.240]  folks again I've watched these games from the sidelines I'm telling you a common
[27:22.240 --> 27:28.480]  hit in the NFL is violent and when and that's probably about a 35 maybe 30
[27:28.480 --> 27:33.920]  mile-power collision last night and the guy's helmet T Higgins the offensive
[27:33.920 --> 27:40.720]  player from the Bengals helmet rams right in to DeMar Hamlin's chest area
[27:40.720 --> 27:48.960]  clearly causing some form of a comatose cordous issue now could the vaccine have
[27:48.960 --> 27:55.280]  made it worse that's the big question could a fiber clock from the vaccine be
[27:55.280 --> 28:00.280]  in his body that made it a lot harder to get his heartbeat going again could be
[28:00.280 --> 28:08.200]  the case could be the story we know they did CPR on him for about nine minutes
[28:08.200 --> 28:14.320]  that's not normally how bad it is but it has resulted in fatalities before as
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.320]  well in young athletes but so that's that it's an NPC meme and I had people
[28:20.320 --> 28:24.000]  giving me a hard time last night saying oh you're trying to discount the vaccine
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.760]  injuries are you kidding me oh and Troyer of Info Wars doesn't want to talk
[28:27.760 --> 28:33.280]  about vaccine injuries that's a joke I'm one of the biggest vaccine skeptics
[28:33.280 --> 28:41.080]  ever but I'm a realist folks obviously the hit is what caused the cardio
[28:41.080 --> 28:46.040]  vascular event last night was it made worse by the vaccine that's the
[28:46.040 --> 28:50.840]  question we don't know the answer to it yet but here's what I do know I've got a
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.700]  stack of stories I'm gonna cover in the next side where we do know vaccinated
[28:54.700 --> 29:01.360]  athletes had heart problems and we'll cover that there is a war on for your

[33:26.880 --> 33:31.680]  your host Owen Troyer
[33:38.600 --> 33:45.440]  all right ladies and gentlemen I understand why
[33:46.560 --> 33:55.840]  freedom fighters truth tellers vaccine skeptics purebloods are all in a tizzy
[33:55.840 --> 34:03.320]  today to feel vindicated and to dole out a bunch of red pills after an NFL
[34:03.320 --> 34:08.000]  football player collapses on the field last night due to a cardiac emergency
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.720]  I understand that here's the problem folks you do not know as of right now I
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.200]  don't know you don't know I've not seen in any information and I doubt it would
[34:21.200 --> 34:27.240]  be made public if Damar Hamlin took a COVID-19 vaccine or two or three or any
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.080]  at all you just do not know that and I of course would not expect there to be
[34:32.080 --> 34:36.120]  any public statement about that because overall the issue is still not
[34:36.120 --> 34:42.480]  appreciated as it should be plus it's personal medical information so unless
[34:42.480 --> 34:46.480]  his family or his mother who just so happened to be in the stadium last night
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.680]  bless her heart went to the hospital with him you imagine that ambulance ride
[34:51.680 --> 34:58.480]  my goodness unless they decide to release any information I don't expect
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.720]  there to be the case but you'd hate to have this situation with all the
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.440]  huffing and puffing and then a public statement is released that says he never
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.040]  got the vaccine so stop talking about it the hit caused the cardiac arrest could
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.560]  his vaccinated status could having a fiberclot in him have made a bad
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.240]  situation worse that's the question but if you're looking at this desperate for
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.720]  vindication desperate to say this is a major awakening red pill moment for
[35:22.720 --> 35:27.600]  Americans to see the vaccine side effects folks we don't need this you
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.720]  don't need this to be vindicated you don't need this for your red pill moment
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.160]  what am I talking about let me go through this stack again we took maybe
[35:38.160 --> 35:41.240]  about a half an hour with all the other prep work that we were doing today
[35:41.240 --> 35:45.560]  pulling videos in getting news articles getting the studio set up everything
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.440]  else and I just said hey guys let's take about 30 minutes and let's find a bunch
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.000]  of stories about vaccinated athletes and professional athletes and young
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.600]  athletes either dying suddenly or having heart problems on the field and so I
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.480]  got a stack of probably about 30 40 articles so you don't need the
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.600]  vindication you've already been vindicated and I'm just I'm just let's
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.800]  not put ourselves in a situation to look bad here anybody insinuating that the
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.640]  hit is not what caused the cardiac event you're making yourself look bad and if
[36:17.640 --> 36:20.360]  they come out and they make a statement he was never vaccinated please stop
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.280]  talking about it you're not gonna feel too good then either so let's just check
[36:25.280 --> 36:28.680]  ourselves and measure ourselves here it's like the kind of thing if somebody
[36:28.680 --> 36:31.840]  would have shared the chris pronger video last night and said look chris
[36:31.840 --> 36:35.320]  pronger passed out during a hockey game people would have bought in and said oh
[36:35.320 --> 36:41.160]  my gosh it's from the vaccine that happened in 1998 but you don't need the
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.280]  vindication you don't need this for a red pill moment you've already been
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.160]  vindicated I've got a stack of red pills right here so without further ado a
[36:51.160 --> 36:56.120]  story from goodsciencing.com which I'm just gonna circle back on is this is
[36:56.120 --> 37:03.040]  gonna be the book ends to this 1616 athlete cardiac arrests serious

[37:17.640 --> 37:21.640]  vaccination the collapses post vaccination all the data points all the
[37:21.640 --> 37:29.960]  footnotes in this story right here okay now that's over a year old so it's
[37:29.960 --> 37:37.320]  probably safe to say that you've had double that since this story but here's
[37:37.320 --> 37:44.000]  the headlines. Japan launches official investigation into millions of COVID

[46:57.520 --> 47:13.360]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[47:27.520 --> 47:44.320]  now ladies and gentlemen I fear the worst for this young NFL player DeMar Hamlin
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.520]  the situation is obviously not good he's basically on life support they were
[47:50.520 --> 47:56.200]  never able to return him to breathing on his own so after about nine minutes of
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.200]  CPR they got a heartbeat returned but he was not breathing on his own and he
[48:01.200 --> 48:09.440]  still as far as we know is on a breathing machine now one thing that you're
[48:09.440 --> 48:12.480]  hearing and this is from the NFL athletes this is from the actual sports
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.920]  media who don't talk about vaccines is the quote is I've never seen anything
[48:17.920 --> 48:26.120]  like this I've never seen anything like this so let's try to understand that
[48:26.120 --> 48:30.800]  statement because obviously oh you've never seen anything like this well
[48:30.800 --> 48:35.560]  what's the variable well again we all know the variable that people want to
[48:35.560 --> 48:40.000]  talk about but as far as I've concerned here's what they've never seen anything
[48:40.000 --> 48:47.920]  like this before means a player essentially unconscious on the field
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.000]  receiving emergency medical treatment for almost 10 minutes even when you have
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.360]  the worst spinal cord injuries like what we saw a couple years ago with Ryan
[48:56.360 --> 49:04.600]  Shazier they can usually have enough signs of life to declare him alive before
[49:04.600 --> 49:12.400]  he's taken off the field by an ambulance so that the players can at least get back
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.920]  to knowing okay he had a serious injury it's football but he's alive he's
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.040]  getting treatment we can now play the game again but for them to watch an
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.840]  unresponsive athlete on the field for almost 10 minutes is a bit of a
[49:25.840 --> 49:33.800]  different thing when they can't even confirm life and I've never seen them
[49:33.800 --> 49:42.200]  cancel or postpone a game ever I've never seen that the I mean I've seen them
[49:42.200 --> 49:47.040]  move a game because of a weather like a hurricane they've moved games before but
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.440]  I've never heard of them postponing a game I've not for whether not in the
[49:51.440 --> 49:55.080]  middle of the game not for an injury I've never heard of that and apparently
[49:55.080 --> 49:59.800]  the NFL said take five minutes and get back on the field so the NFL's got its
[49:59.800 --> 50:05.640]  own problems to deal with and that's obviously the minor issue at this point
[50:05.640 --> 50:12.520]  is what they're gonna do about that but again you see the athletes you see the
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.160]  former players you see the media I've never seen anything like this so there's
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.480]  a serious reckoning happening here whether it comes down to the vaccine or
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.440]  just football in general there's a serious reckoning that's gonna come from
[50:26.440 --> 50:33.080]  this folks you've already got high schools canceling football programs you've
[50:33.080 --> 50:36.040]  already got rules in the NFL you can't hit the quarterback you can't hit the
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.360]  kicker they've already rewritten a lot of the rules to try to get rid of some of
[50:40.360 --> 50:43.400]  the big hits they try to get rid of some of the kickoffs which is where that
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.480]  injury occurred last night again not the most violent hit you've seen but all
[50:46.480 --> 50:53.560]  NFL hits are violent so there's going to be a major reckoning here and the next
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.680]  snap that is taken in an NFL football game is gonna be maybe the most watched
[50:58.680 --> 51:08.480]  scrutinized snap that we've seen in recent history but the two debates that
[51:08.480 --> 51:16.520]  are gonna follow here are was this cardiac arrest made worse was this hit
[51:16.520 --> 51:20.520]  that caused the cardiac arrest was this event made worse because of a vaccine
[51:20.520 --> 51:26.760]  because of a clot in his body from the vaccine and what is the future of
[51:26.760 --> 51:35.120]  football and and and really you have to ask those two questions because either
[51:35.120 --> 51:39.880]  you're looking at a situation where yep this is a bad situation made worse
[51:39.880 --> 51:44.480]  because of the vaccine and you need to address that or you're dealing with a
[51:44.480 --> 51:50.320]  new situation where an NFL athlete isn't just hoping he walks off the field
[51:50.320 --> 51:57.960]  after the game hoping he is alive at the end of the game that is an entirely new
[51:57.960 --> 52:04.720]  dynamic when you're seeing grown men crying on the field balling their eyes
[52:04.720 --> 52:14.160]  out folks you don't see that normally you know where you see that hospitals and
[52:14.160 --> 52:20.520]  you know when you're saying bye to people
[52:22.920 --> 52:30.920]  and already of course NFL fans are already mad because they're hearing
[52:30.920 --> 52:36.560]  about the vaccines all day because former Jacksonville Jaguars player Uche
[52:36.560 --> 52:45.120]  in Wannery was found dead last night autopsy results from the tip of Canoe
[52:45.120 --> 52:49.760]  County Corner show that in Wannery may have died from a heart attack and
[52:49.760 --> 52:55.440]  there's this supposed tweet going around it's it's hard to even believe that this
[52:55.440 --> 53:00.920]  tweet is real it's so bad I can't even believe in this tweet is real it's so
[53:00.920 --> 53:06.240]  bad but this image is going around that supposedly a tweet from this former
[53:06.240 --> 53:12.840]  football player in September 21 that says okay so let's get these vaccine
[53:12.840 --> 53:17.520]  mandates and vaccine passports up and running ASAP we've seen children die
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.280]  daily from unvaccinated selfishness pregnant women at risk to protect life
[53:22.280 --> 53:27.720]  mandate the vaccine jail anyone who refuses to protect life I that is so
[53:27.720 --> 53:33.320]  bad I almost can't even believe it so I'm just gonna say allegedly that's a
[53:33.320 --> 53:38.360]  text put out from this former player it's just and even if it's real I don't
[53:38.360 --> 53:41.520]  I'm not gonna sit here and celebrate if you had a vaccine injury that's just
[53:41.520 --> 53:48.400]  awful but at the time this was a big debate in the NFL and you remember you
[53:48.400 --> 53:51.600]  may remember when they came after Aaron Rodgers because he didn't want to take
[53:51.600 --> 53:55.320]  the vaccine you may even recall that there's a Buffalo Bills player Cole
[53:55.320 --> 53:59.720]  Beasley who refused to take the vaccine and there's a big uproar about that
[53:59.720 --> 54:04.160]  maybe there was some discontent amongst other NFL players or locker rooms
[54:04.160 --> 54:09.480]  saying hey we were forced to take the vaccine why didn't they have to take it
[54:09.480 --> 54:15.720]  so you know there was a little bit of that going on behind the scenes but you
[54:15.720 --> 54:20.760]  already had football fans who don't hear about the vaccine who don't hear about
[54:20.760 --> 54:25.040]  the vaccine side effects hearing about it for the first time because of this
[54:25.040 --> 54:31.560]  former player who was supposedly a major vaccine promoter dying of the number
[54:31.560 --> 54:36.000]  one side effect from the COVID vaccines and so just like any other time you had
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.520]  to die suddenly the vaccine skeptics and the COVID vaccine truth tellers jumped
[54:42.520 --> 54:46.720]  to the scene to say hey you need to investigate these COVID-19 vaccines
[54:46.720 --> 54:54.160]  they're killing people so they were already sick and tired of hearing about
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.520]  the COVID-19 vaccine causing heart attacks then you had the event in the
[54:59.520 --> 55:05.560]  game last night and it just went overboard but you better understand this
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.920]  debate goes one of two ways the questions here go down one or two paths
[55:11.920 --> 55:19.120]  either you had a serious cardiac event on a football field last night which was
[55:19.120 --> 55:26.200]  bad but made worse because of a vaccine or you're now having to face the
[55:26.200 --> 55:34.000]  reality that your game NFL football what is considered a routine hit can be
[55:34.000 --> 55:42.400]  potentially fatal which direction would you rather that conversation go if
[55:42.400 --> 55:49.240]  you're an NFL fan but that's just the topic that I'm sure is ultimately going
[55:49.240 --> 55:55.680]  to be discussed in football hallways and locker room cooler talk and all that
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.600]  other stuff but for the players to not want to go on last night when the league
[56:00.600 --> 56:05.440]  said take five and play that that tells you like what you're seeing they've
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.080]  never seen anything like this before something is off about this so is is
[56:10.080 --> 56:16.000]  football now considered a potentially fatal sport in a routine hit or can a
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.200]  routine hit that caused a cardiac arrest event a bad thing made worse by a
[56:22.200 --> 56:32.560]  COVID-19 fiberclot in the athlete's body so look I've got more on this and I've
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.760]  got more names of individuals who we know died from the COVID vaccine including
[56:36.760 --> 56:43.200]  young children now look obviously Hamlin as an NFL athlete is going to get more
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.160]  notoriety than some of these young children that died from the vaccines but
[56:47.160 --> 56:55.440]  those kids are out there too and so maybe we should say their name maybe we
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.720]  should say their name today and so we will and these aren't just young
[57:00.720 --> 57:04.560]  athletes that took the vaccine and died we're talking about the original
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.560]  applicants to be to volunteer themselves to be tested with the vaccine that died
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.840]  and they still rolled it out up for you so we're gonna say their names when we
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.080]  come back but ladies and gentlemen again I barely plug this hour I should be
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.840]  plugging every segment to keep us on the air especially when Alex is out I
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.800]  barely plugged so please make up for that go to infowarstore.com folks I

[59:50.120 --> 01:00:09.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.560]  all right ladies and gentlemen the house vote for speaker of the house is now
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:26.520]  live and McCarthy needs 218 to get the speakership role I don't know if he's
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:33.440]  got it I got to be honest I I don't know if he's got it and I think that what
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.480]  Matt Gates has done is actually brilliant I salute Matt Gates I don't mind
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.400]  sabotaging the next two years with your tiny majority control of the house I
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:50.000]  don't mind sabotaging Kevin McCarthy's speakership because as Matt Gates
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.360]  actually said earlier today we can maybe find the clip we've obviously been
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.480]  focusing on the issue of the NFL player having the cardiac arrest and the
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.160]  questions of was it caused by the COVID vaccine but Matt Gates basically said
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.600]  earlier today that what's the point of having a McCarthy speakership it does
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.880]  nothing for us it does nothing for the Republican Party it does nothing to drain
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.600]  the swamp it's completely pointless I completely agree with him I think I think
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.800]  it's political genius for Matt Gates to sabotage the Kevin McCarthy
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.120]  speakership and and even if that means sabotaging the next two years with your
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.200]  tiny majority control of the house I still think it's brilliant because it
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.200]  makes no difference whether it's McCarthy or Pelosi to me it's the unit
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.840]  party it's the establishment it's the swamp as Matt Gates put it he said why
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.600]  would you put the biggest alligator in charge of draining the swamp referring
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:57.800]  to McCarthy so if Gates and Bobert and Donaldson and Gossar or just like three
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.200]  or four others don't vote McCarthy then he's not going to get the votes and I
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.040]  think they've already decided they don't care we'll sabotage it come after us
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.200]  attack us we don't care it doesn't make a damn bit of difference nothing good
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.440]  happens if Kevin McCarthy is the speaker I mean tell me can you even answer
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.560]  any of these questions about McCarthy what is Kevin McCarthy strong on what
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.240]  are Kevin McCarthy's strong stances what are Kevin McCarthy's conservative values
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.480]  what does Kevin McCarthy ever said or done that is pro America what makes you
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.120]  feel confident that Kevin McCarthy would be a good speaker of the house
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.320]  anything can you make any answer any of those questions I can't I don't know what
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.400]  it makes him a strong conservative I don't know what his values are I don't
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.360]  know what he leads on I don't know his big issues he's an empty suit so I don't
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:54.560]  mind it at all now what'll be interesting is just how committed they are to put
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.760]  the potential sabotage would somebody switch and vote for the Democrat maybe
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.360]  the Democrat is like maybe some of the Democrats I think it would actually be
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.640]  genius for the Democrats to actually have some of them flip and vote for McCarthy
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:15.760]  to try to put him over the top I don't know if any of the Democrats have that
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.720]  sort of fortitude there might be one though there might be one that has that
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.800]  fortitude but no I don't mind what Gates and Boebert are doing to sabotage
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.880]  McCarthy I don't I don't care if they sabotage these next two years of a
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.200]  tiny majority control because I have no faith in Kevin McCarthy that he's gonna
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.320]  do anything and why would I what what has he shown me to this point to make me
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.720]  believe he's gonna do anything so we're gonna be monitoring this this vote is
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:55.740]  ongoing right now and I didn't mean to distract from the names of the children
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.960]  that have died these are confirmed deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine children
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.440]  I didn't mean to distract from that I will still come back and read this list
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.520]  of names but since they launched the House vote I felt it would at least be
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.680]  appropriate to come on here and let you know what's going on so we'll be
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.200]  monitoring that I think it's gonna come right down to the wire and we may have an
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.000]  idea of what we're looking at here before the end of the hour so we'll
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:34.660]  continue to monitor that but when I come back these are the names of the
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:46.240]  children that are confirmed dead from a COVID-19 vaccine like Ernesto Ramirez
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:52.640]  Jr. and so many others and so they may not get the attention of an NFL athlete
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.520]  but we'll give them the time of day right here
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.160]  there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield this is an
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.960]  information war info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:15.240]  and today whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:20.240]  they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.120]  understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.080]  it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and power you

[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.880]  you are literally non-violently politically punching the new world order
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.520]  in the nose punching their lies in the nose we are going to defeat the new
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.960]  world order we're going over the top right now is the critical juncture so
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:08.120]  please go to infowarstore.com and donate and now the tip of the spear leading
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:14.760]  the fight to take back the nation it's Owen Schreuer you're listening to the
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.920]  Alex Jones show
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.280]  all right we're monitoring the vote for speaker of the house right now I think
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.960]  this one could get interesting I think it's gonna come right down to the wire
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:44.360]  here so we'll be monitoring that but I understand especially for people who are
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:51.880]  new to the awakening or have just taken the red pill or are new to the battle
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.400]  against tyranny I mean I can I can slice it dice it and present it in a
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:00.640]  thousand different ways you know what I mean I understand the desperation to
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.920]  wake people up I understand the desperation for vindication I get it
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:10.720]  I've been there but you still have to be smart you still have to be measured and
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.200]  you still have to try to bat 1000 and you don't want to swing at balls in the
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.880]  dirt and you don't want to swing at balls that are a foot over your head
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.280]  because it just makes the whole thing look bad and we don't have to do that we
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.600]  can select what pitches we want to hit when it's the pitch we want so I don't
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:38.000]  need vindication from the hit last night that caused the cardiac arrest I
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.520]  don't need vindication whether or not Hamlin had a COVID-19 vaccine I may not
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.480]  ever know I may not never ever know the truth about that could his cardiac
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:57.440]  event been made worse from a COVID-19 vaccine absolutely but I don't know what
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:02.800]  I do know is that there are confirmed deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine I
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.720]  don't need the football game for vindication or for a red pill moment I
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.120]  read through an entire stack of news in the last hour of all the athletes young
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.680]  and professional that had heart problems post COVID-19 vaccine I mean
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.640]  there's there's thousands of these cases confirmed here's some of the children
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.960]  this is from freedom for Maryland here's some of the children that have died
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.000]  post vaccine some of them it's 100% confirmed they died from the vaccine
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.800]  some of them were the test subjects for children with the COVID-19 vaccine that
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:50.360]  died to here's their list Ernesto Ramirez Jr. Sean Hartman Maddie DeGerry she
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:58.080]  was one of the test subjects Louie Troub Lindsey Nicole House Jam Padilla
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:08.640]  Cat Parker Christine Asher Andrew Bridgen Anna Koenig Jeff Jackson
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:20.680]  Shelley Shan Safford Kira Tihi Brooke Jackson Christopher J. Williams so we
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:28.160]  know about Ernesto Ramirez Jr. I've met Ernesto himself what a kind-hearted man
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:35.240]  who's had to suffer so much confirmed COVID-19 vaccine death Sean Hartman
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.200]  young hockey player in Canada father still fighting for justice Maddie De
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:50.360]  Gary volunteered as a test subject for the COVID-19 vaccine so you see these
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.880]  young people might not have been NFL football players and so you never heard
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.000]  of them but to their friends and to their families they were heroes to their
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.360]  friends and to their families their lives meant everything and so I don't
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:15.240]  have to ask about the football player because I already know that these
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:22.520]  innocent people died from the COVID-19 vaccine and again look I didn't even
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.680]  want to believe it okay with these tweets from the formal foot former
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:35.760]  football player Uche in Wannery because it doesn't make me feel good here here
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.080]  this guy is on Twitter apparently celebrating the vaccines say how great
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.960]  they are say how bad you are if you won't take them cursing people out all
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.960]  kinds of insults doesn't make me feel good that this guy has a heart attack at
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.600]  38 might have been caused by that vaccine he loved so much might have been
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.960]  directly caused his death by the vaccine he promotes so much and wanted to
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.960]  mandate to me doesn't make me feel good it makes me feel sick I don't even want
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.040]  to believe it and then the crews like you know that the whole account is up and
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.640]  there's like dozens of these things and I'm just sitting here like I just I
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.320]  don't want to believe it I don't even want to care because it's not about that
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:26.040]  I don't feel bad because this guy wanted to hurt me with a vaccine I feel bad
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.520]  because he got hurt with the vaccine he got tricked yeah and then there's that
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.120]  from Rasmussen Rasmussen poll shows that one in four Americans believe they
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:45.680]  know someone who died from the COVID vaccine this story is not going to go
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.120]  away though I will tell you that the NFL has a big problem on its hands today
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.200]  and the NFL is gonna have a reckoning moment whether that's reevaluating the
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:03.360]  violence of the sport for what it is or reevaluating their vaccine stance from
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.920]  the past and potential mandates that may still exist but do you really think
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.960]  they want to go down that path I don't think they want to go down either one of
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:18.680]  those paths they'll try to find a way to thread like a Tom Brady pass but I don't
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:27.840]  see how they avoid this and the poor young man is still on life support and it
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.800]  just at this point feels like it's a matter of time folks you know if there's
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.080]  anything that you see positive out of this you've never seen the sports media
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.520]  promoting prayer and God before recently you see all the players on the field
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:53.040]  getting down on their knees praying to God it's what we all need but there you
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:59.240]  go oh I didn't even cover this one this one just broke last week 17 year old
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.600]  Gillette basketball player dies unexpectedly on Monday 17 year old
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:12.040]  basketball player dies unexpectedly and then they and then they publish this in
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:19.680]  the Wall Street Journal today like oh who knew our vaccines fueling new COVID
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.560]  variants the virus appears to be evolving in ways that evade immunity
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:32.560]  duh talk about old news talk about old science everybody saw that coming but I
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.280]  guess not unless they were tuned in right here huh
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:43.280]  but see here's here's the here's the dam breaking folks the dam is breaking on
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:50.120]  the vaccine injuries and whether or not that ends up being the case with the
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:56.000]  Mark Hamlin really it is irrelevant because the dam's already broken it's
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.240]  already out there as a narrative people are already questioning it whether that's
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.520]  the case or not is not gonna matter and you have people regretting taking their
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:12.440]  vaccines like this tweet from a doctor Natalia who's now private made her
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.280]  Twitter account private and deleted this tweet I guess out of embarrassment I
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.360]  will never regret the vaccine even if it turns out I injected actual poison and
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:30.280]  have only days to live mm-hmm why would you say that my heart and my heart and is
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:37.640]  was in the right place I got vaccinated out of love while anti-vaxxers did
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.160]  everything out of hate so that's a reverse reality if I have to die because
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.120]  of my love for the world then so be it oh yeah they love the world so much that's
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.400]  why they wanted to vaccinate everybody and everything and every animal but I
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.280]  will never regret or apologize for it she's deleted the tweet she's made her
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.480]  Twitter account private because folks this is the reckoning even the people
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.760]  that promoted the vaccine and told you how great it was they know the gig is up
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.920]  the gig is up and you've got tens of thousands of doctors maybe even hundreds
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:21.880]  of thousands of doctors at this point who are calling for the vaccines to be
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.000]  taken off the shelves and stop being injected into people's bodies and this
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.320]  situation is not going away they thought they could intimidate us they thought
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.160]  they could threaten us they thought they could intimidate and threaten doctors
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:40.600]  and physicians and scientists and data analytics and they're not giving up and

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.400]  incredible I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and

[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:16.720]  wars store.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:56.000]  you know we've been saying we haven't seen
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.560]  anything like this for almost two years now because we've been watching
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.680]  professional athletes college athletes soccer players collapse on the field
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:13.560]  have cardiac arrest on the field sometimes die from the cardiac events
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:23.720]  and that has never been seen before in sports I worked in sports media before
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.280]  I came down here to do politics and I'm telling you it never happened before I
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.840]  mean you'd have a couple stories of course with thousands of professional
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.160]  athletes of maybe one or two a year having a cardiac event now you're
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:45.360]  talking about hundreds every year and so this video here is video number two in
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:52.320]  a last I saw a three-part series I don't know if it's been updated we took the
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.440]  three videos will maybe air some of the third one later coming up but if you
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:03.160]  want these videos if you want to share these videos because obviously what
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.520]  happened with the NFL player last night has spurred the conversation so if you
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:12.480]  want them to see other videos of this going on post COVID vaccine we have the
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:18.040]  full compilation that we actually uploaded it was about a year ago to
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:25.280]  band video and it's on the war room page we uploaded it about a year ago and I
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.760]  think that we're gonna have the crew actually put together a new story and
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.200]  have it headlined at info wars com for today so that you can have this video to
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:42.880]  share as this debate is now getting into the focus because of the NFL player
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:52.600]  collapsing last night so we will work on that and getting that available for you
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.320]  but we're gonna have the link again we're gonna have the link to the video
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:02.240]  compilation at band.video and I think we'll have another story probably at
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.120]  info wars.com as well do we have the title of that on the channel guys do we
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.920]  know did we ever find that on the channel yet so we're gonna we're gonna
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.360]  we're gonna have that for you hopefully by the end of the show if not
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.600]  definitely on the war room we'll figure it out but again it's about 15 20 minutes
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:25.720]  of video of all the different athletes professionals young old college having
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:33.800]  the cardiac events post COVID-19 vaccine at such a rate we have never seen
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:43.520]  before so I don't know the story from DeMar Hamlin last night but I do know
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.400]  he's not the only one and I do know that we have events where there was no
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:55.120]  football hit there was no major blunt force trauma to the chest area causing
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:03.600]  a cardiac event where guys just collapse out of nowhere so we'll we'll get
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.040]  that resource fully for you by the end of the day so that you can share it it's
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:18.560]  already been announced it that Kevin McCarthy is not going to win this first
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:26.280]  round of votes so that means there's probably going to be a standoff going
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:33.360]  on and we'll see how long that goes on for but of course you've got Rana
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.840]  McDaniel on Fox News right now probably on there just campaigning for McCarthy
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.040]  and saying how bad anybody is that doesn't vote for McCarthy you know I'm
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.280]  not hearing her so I have to be honest I'm making that assumption I just see
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.760]  her there on the screen but we know about the we know about the Mick
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.560]  squishies that have led the Republican Party to nothing we know about the Mick
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.400]  squishies of McConnell McCarthy and McDaniel who have delivered us Mick
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:12.240]  nothing and will never will always deliver us Mick nothing so this is
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.920]  going to be an interesting standoff and and I the only person to me exhibiting
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.120]  any political brilliance so far has been Matt Gates and I think Matt Gates
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:30.200]  political brilliance is is on display here and I understand his logic of I
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.440]  don't care if I sabotage Kevin McCarthy's speakership I don't care if I
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.280]  sabotage these next two years with a small majority in the house because it
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.240]  means nothing if we don't drain the swamp it means nothing if we don't get
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.520]  justice for all the crimes that have been committed against Donald Trump in
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.400]  January 6th defendants it means nothing if we can't investigate the Biden crime
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.200]  family and if it's Kevin McCarthy as a speaker none of that's gonna happen so
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.680]  what's the point I think I think it's a move of political brilliance from Matt
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.360]  Gates quite frankly and let's see if anybody has the political wit or the
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.560]  political brilliance or the political blunt force to overcome what Matt Gates
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.480]  has done here today because Gates isn't gonna flip I don't think Boba it's gonna
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.200]  flip and I'm guessing there's five or ten others that aren't gonna flip no
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:25.480]  matter what so what's gonna happen now so our is is Kevin McCarthy Mitch McConnell
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.920]  Ron McDaniel are they gonna start making calls to Democrats asking for their votes
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.480]  are Democrats gonna throw their votes to McCarthy just to just to scuttle the
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.320]  Republicans in a weird way knowing that McCarthy is gonna be better than what the
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:41.360]  next person might be these are the questions I asked now coming up is
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:47.160]  attorney Thomas Renz and we're gonna be discussing obviously what he knows about
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.960]  the vaccine side effects and last night as well now ladies and gentlemen again
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.640]  two of the most popular effective supplements at infowarstore.com our

[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:47.360]  dot com is the website now Tom I understand obviously after last night's
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.520]  event at the football game with the player having the cardiac event on the
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:57.880]  field I understand why people are quite frankly desperate for vindication here
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.200]  and desperate to use this as a moment of vindication and to hope that this can
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.560]  be a moment of awakening and truth and revelation about what's been done to us
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.440]  with the COVID-19 vaccine I say hold up let's wait till we have all the
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.720]  information and guess what we don't need that we've already got the vindication
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.880]  that we need whether or not last night's event was was made worse because of a
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.520]  vaccine or not doesn't change the fact that we're already vindicated we already
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.800]  have all the data we already have all the information but Tom I ask you
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.680]  somebody who's been boots on the ground in and out of courtrooms in and out of
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.120]  hearings analyzing all the data do you feel that we're already vindicated or
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.960]  is the incident from last night's football game going to be something we
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.760]  need to push the ball over the top or across the goal line if you will in this
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:52.440]  vaccine debate Tom rents well nice to see on and yeah I mean we're a long sense
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.880]  vindicated but that doesn't diminish the importance of what happened last night
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.120]  I think last night something that we've got to talk about and it's not because
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.240]  yet when we talk about being vindicated we've got to be very careful this is not
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.240]  and I told you show so moment not in any way here's shape or form this is a
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:15.000]  tragedy with a human being who's who's suffering and may not survive and it's
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.640]  it's it's truly I mean it's horrific you know I mean I played football yeah I've
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.000]  been a lifelong athlete I'm into sports this is one of the most horrible things
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.200]  I've seen the thing about it is though the thing about it is is we aren't pushing
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.040]  I think it needs to be pushed and I think it needs to be talked about but not
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.320]  because I told you so it needs to be pushed because there are still millions
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.600]  of people who are getting boosted who are getting lied to and who just don't
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.880]  know this they're still unaware of the fact that they've been manipulated and
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.520]  defrauded and this should facilitate a national conversation about what they're
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:59.760]  covering up what they're hiding not about I told you so but about what are
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.240]  they hiding and why are there people who still haven't heard the truth well at
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.560]  any time whether it's an injury like we've seen in the past with the Ryan
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.400]  Shazier where a guy we hope can even walk again you know obviously that tugs at
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.600]  your emotional heartstrings that's something where you have questions which
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.280]  are like wow I as a football player now boy this is something I think about this
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.520]  is something I worry about well not everybody plays football but like you
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.960]  said millions of people have gotten these vaccines millions more may still
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:34.800]  yet get them in the future because we're still not getting the truth about them so
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.840]  yeah when I see these players and I see them with tears in their eyes looking at
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.440]  their fellow player out there on the field collapsed with no signs of life
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.840]  you know some of them are probably asking questions whether it's man just be
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.720]  playing the sport is it potentially lead lethal is there a vaccine in my body
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.240]  that could make a hit like this potentially worse for me and these are
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.120]  honest questions that we're not even really getting a fair discussion on the
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.720]  media doesn't want to go there and we know why it's the same why Tom because
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.440]  they promoted the vaccines they told us they were safe and effective they took
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:11.520]  money to promote the vaccines and if this whole thing goes down as one of the
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.720]  biggest crimes against humanity they're all gonna be capable they're all gonna
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:20.800]  be culpable here yeah oh absolutely on I think one of things so you know when I
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.520]  watch this and I've watched I've watched a replay the first thing I want to talk
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.000]  about is this this hit right so I think it's worth breaking this down right
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.960]  there okay so that guy got hit in the upper right hand section of his chest
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.400]  kind of in his shoulder and you see he popped right back up and the impact
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.880]  after the hit it looked like it was more of a head hit than anything when I
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.360]  first saw that and I saw him go back down I was like did did he get you know
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.280]  knocked a little loopy and just fell over what happened there but then you see
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.480]  that when he fell he didn't brace himself he just went down that's either as to me
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.840]  as someone who's taken a lot of hits and here you go lefties you can use this as
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.480]  your joke a lot of hits to the head even you don't that's not a normal reaction
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.280]  right either you were knocked semi-unconscious and then collapsed but
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.920]  then you don't lay there forever or there's something else going on they did
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.960]  CPR CPR is cardiopulmonary resuscitation the reason you do CPR is
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.640]  because there's a cardiopulmonary issue right this wasn't a broken bone or
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.320]  anything and we sense found out it is a cardiac arrest well a cardiac arrest is
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.360]  very consistent in light of the fact that we've got all this information about
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.440]  myocarditis pericarditis and you know the thing about this it's really
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:45.400]  interesting to me is you don't have to be a doctor to know that this is
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.080]  something that we're hearing about over and over again you don't have to have it
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:54.240]  you know I've I've you know I've seen McCulloch statement I've talked to a
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  bunch of doctor friends that I work with you know the odds are that what
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.320]  happened was is this guy probably had my or pericarditis or something along those
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:09.200]  lines it was exacerbated by you know playing an intense athletic game and you
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.200]  know whether the hit contributed or not I don't know but you know something
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:19.920]  triggered that cardiac arrest that is what probably happened now you know why
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.520]  is there any hesitation about releasing his vaccine status you know you say that
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.800]  there's things that we don't know and you're right about that but my question
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.240]  is why don't we know it you would think that given the the concerns that people
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.240]  have about vaccines and given the fact that this is going viral all over on
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.360]  Twitter and everywhere else you would think that they would immediately say oh
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.480]  no this guy is not vaccinated if he's not except for they didn't because he was
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.200]  the bills have been very outspoken about trying to push every one of their
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.320]  players to be jabbed Cole Beasley anybody this guy was almost certainly jabbed
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.720]  I'll wait for confirmation but I want to know why they haven't released
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.040]  confirmation that he wasn't if that's the case because if he wasn't jabbed you
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.560]  and I both know the first thing that would have been everywhere in the news
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:14.520]  was not this comito whatever diagnosis that that literally happens to less than
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.560]  20 people a year and almost never to anyone over 20 years old know what they
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.680]  would have done is they're led well but these not vaccinated they didn't say
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:27.360]  that because the fact of the matter is is he probably was vaccinated he
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.200]  probably was boosted and they don't want that association you don't hide things
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:36.880]  unless you have something to hide well my only response would be they're doing
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.080]  this out of the player's interest they're doing this out of his own
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.520]  privacy interest and maybe if the mother said well go ahead and release a
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.520]  public statement who's probably still with him in the hospital maybe they
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.320]  would release such a statement I agree you'd think they'd want to put the whole
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:55.520]  debate to bed by saying he wasn't vaccinated anyway but they also
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.720]  understand when other athletes have come out against the vaccine they've
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.520]  received extreme backlash and so maybe they're trying to protect a player who's
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.560]  fighting for his life right now from having the the vaccine lovers out there
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:10.040]  say oh my gosh he didn't take the vaccine wow he's such a tale of a person I
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:13.520]  mean that'd be interesting to witness I suppose but maybe perhaps they're trying
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.920]  to avoid that from happening but you know it's interesting because you just said
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.840]  this quickly it normally this only happens in younger players it's my
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.000]  understanding that that's the case because obviously they're not as built
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.640]  they don't have the muscle mass they don't have the bone mass they don't have
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.560]  the professional protective equipment especially if you're a young baseball
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.400]  player lacrosse player but there had been professional athletes that have had
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.960]  this happen to them before like Chris Pronger and the difference was within
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.800]  an hour he was up and responsive and and back to life and we knew the situation
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.680]  we're gonna be looking at a situation now potentially I mean we're more than 12
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:53.920]  hours later almost after this and we still don't know what the situation is
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.600]  the reports I'm getting is that the situation is not good I you know we're
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.040]  waiting to hear what's gonna happen and obviously we pray for this guy I pray
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.520]  for his family I pray for everybody involved you know the whole thing is
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.600]  horrendous and it's just a sad sad thing you know I just I absolutely outright
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.840]  reject the fact that that they're I don't believe for a second and oh and I you
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.080]  know I appreciate your perspective and I understand as a journalist you got to be
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.480]  careful I'm an advocate so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what I think I think that
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:30.760]  these guys are covering it up because there's something to cover up they don't
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.560]  want this out there I don't for a second believe that they care about the privacy
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.440]  of this guy did they care about his privacy when they were telling us that
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.840]  100% of their players are vaxxed did they care about his privacy when they
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.920]  were throwing cold about cold bees least privacy did they care about how
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.320]  about Aaron Rodgers you know Aaron Rodgers wasn't out there trying to be
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.960]  outspoken about his vaccine these are absolutely fair points we're having the
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:58.720]  discussion Tom Renz is with us we'll be right back short break

[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:26.840]  World Order it's Alex Jones quickly here before we go back to Tom Ren's the
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.920]  first round of voting for the Speaker of the House has concluded and Kevin
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:36.720]  McCarthy did not get the votes. In fact Hakeem Jeffries had more votes in him
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:43.680]  with the Republicans divided and Democrats united so that sets up for an
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.520]  interesting afternoon and evening. Boebert and Gates are still both hard
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:55.400]  nose and I think they only need three Republicans not voting for McCarthy to
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.840]  keep him out of that seat I think they've got probably it I mean with 203
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.320]  right now that means they got at least 15 so we'll continue to monitor this now
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  going back to attorney Tom Ren's Tom Ren's dot com how do you think the NFL
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:18.080]  handles this because whatever whatever the story ends up being there's gonna be
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.800]  a major reckoning here like you said you've you've played football before
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.520]  you've been an athlete before I've worked sidelines for NFL football games
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.120]  it's a violent sport folks even a routine hit is violent but you now have one of
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.760]  two paths to walk down if you're the NFL now and I think that maybe this is why
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.800]  supposedly they didn't want to cancel the game last night because they knew if
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.360]  they did that this is gonna be the story instead of whatever the conclusion to
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.200]  that game was and that's you're either gonna have to face the fact that you're
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.880]  talking about your sport being potentially fatal with what is
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.520]  considered a routine hit or that yes the vaccine that you forced a lot of these
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:02.520]  players to get took a bad event and made it much much worse neither those two
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:06.600]  paths are good for the NFL but Tom I don't see any other path available to
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:12.200]  them do you that's well I mean they could actually try to be honest I mean
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.240]  well I'm sorry I guess I didn't think that was in the realm of possibility yeah
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.320]  I know that that seems like a shocker right I mean who would who would do such
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:27.320]  a thing there you know the thing about it is on is that so I have done some
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.360]  behind-the-scenes work with a few people at the NFL and we we were looking at some
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.200]  different cases and you know none of it ended up going forward but you know I've
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.720]  had a lot of conversations with a lot of different players and coaches and what
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:48.400]  we found was that you know the NFL the owners particularly were dead set on
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:54.320]  pushing this and and this was coming from the head offices right the actual
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  NFL itself and owners I have heard reports and these are these are not
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.480]  something that I can prove right so these are reports but I'm gonna put this
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.640]  out there under the speculation category that the NFL was sponsored by by our
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.840]  government you know I mean we know that Fauci was paying yeah would we spend a
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.480]  billion dollars to influence the media apparently from what we're hearing there
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:25.000]  was some money that went towards NFL NBA some these other guys to try and push
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.440]  these vaccines as well they're working actively to recruit all the influences
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:35.000]  whether it's Hollywood whether it's NFL NBA this the scumbags in charge were
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.880]  actively working to recruit influential people to try and promote these death
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:44.160]  jabs the NFL sold out they sold their players out you know they treat these
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.360]  guys like meat they don't care if they get hurt they don't care what they do
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.800]  as long as it's good for ratings and good for their pocketbooks they don't
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.120]  care I think the most important thing that we've got to look at is what are
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:59.720]  the players gonna do are they gonna keep their heads buried in their own
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:04.480]  rears because you know they just want to get that next big contract and is that
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.600]  next big contract worth your life you know I think that these negotiations I
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.760]  think anybody coming in for negotiations ought to be talking to NFL about
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.040]  what sort of money they're gonna get if they're COVID injured or COVID vaccine
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:22.080]  injured because you know well take a look here I hopefully if the players
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.640]  start speaking out I mean I don't know what else has to happen you know this
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:31.040]  couldn't be more clear what's going on here in my mind and you know look at
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.640]  look at what look at what retiring because of heart of heart issues yeah you
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:39.400]  know how many times do we got to see this how about that guy who just died
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:44.840]  died suddenly yesterday who had said that anybody that's not vaxxed should be in
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:50.240]  jail you know listen yeah Uchi and Warren and I was actually gonna ask you
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:54.800]  about him next I mean is this the type of situation with we're seeing some of
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:59.480]  his tweets where you know we heard about influencers online influencers your
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:03.760]  reports from the NFL is this the type of thing where our government agencies
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:10.440]  recruiting these people to be promoters of their pharmaceutical products well and
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.560]  again I I can't prove this but we've got credible information that this has
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.640]  happened repeatedly by credible what that means is I've got people who work in
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:24.040]  the government who said that yeah this is happening now they can't provide the
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:28.440]  paperwork or where they have provided me evidence I can't share it because it
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:34.640]  would it would you know burn my source and I never ever ever do that but you
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.720]  know at the end of the day we know that these guys were doing everything they
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.960]  could to try and influence everybody on the plan to get this death shot and yeah
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.080]  yeah I'm so so sad about what I ladies it broke my heart when I watch this guy
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:55.160]  oh and you've been reporting the truth for for as long as you've known it on
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:59.200]  this right and you know you and I we've been on the front lines fighting to get
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.920]  truth out there we're not fighting because it makes us popular we're not
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.480]  fighting because of all the money we get for fighting we're fighting because
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.920]  we're trying to get the truth out there well after three years of fighting
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.760]  non-stop lies when I saw this guy go down and it's just another 24 year old
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:20.520]  that I see go down and by the way on a daily basis I can't tell you how many
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:25.120]  emails messages stories I get about people in the exact same situation a guy
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.000]  got my jab and my son went down my son you know was in his 20s you know I mean
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.520]  this is constant so when I see this I mean I got to be honest with you I was
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:40.280]  furious I was absolutely furious because these scumbags these absolute trash
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:45.840]  scumbags in the NFL that treat these guys like like meat they treat them like
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:51.000]  property yeah trade them sell them buy them whatever and then when they there's
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.880]  a problem with them they won't even stand behind them I want to know what the
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:59.240]  NFL is going to do to fix this guy's vaccine entries if he survives I want to
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.520]  know what the NFL is going to do to support other players who may have been
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.080]  vaccine entered are they going to support what who had to retire what are
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:09.400]  they going to do across the board to deal with this see where that see where
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:14.320]  that guy's head hit it initially hit in the upper right hand part of his chest
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.200]  shoulder he didn't hit square center in the chest where your heart is it hit it
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.680]  hit up in the shoulder and then slid towards his face you know this doesn't
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:30.960]  strike me is the the that one in one in a bazillion chance this strikes me is
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:37.600]  looking like exactly what it was which is likely relate a hard issue related to
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.600]  this jab that was exacerbated through strenuous activity in a hit that's what
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.240]  the doctors that I've talked to seem to think of course all of them are doing
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.640]  like you said their doctors are scientists I'm an advocate so they're
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.160]  kind of waiting to see you know what they can get but you know my concern is
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:56.880]  is that they're gonna whitewash it and try and hide it and try and cover it up
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:01.880]  I mean I'm I can assure you there are teams working on that now oh as soon as
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.840]  the the guy went down to the ground the NFL went into damage control we're both
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:13.160]  well aware of that and I just don't know what they do because again like you were
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.080]  saying I mean this is like I mean folks we're looking at a potential worst-case
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:20.720]  scenario here I mean this is a bad situation the ambulance waited for his
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.520]  mom to get in with him before they went to the hospital I mean he's on life
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:32.600]  support so this is the story is not going to go away and and the NFL you know
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.800]  they can well here's what you said that was so interesting in the last minute
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.720]  there this is gonna be up to the players because the reports were that the NFL
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:46.240]  said and I this is their standard policy I've worked the games I've worked in
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.160]  these games before they're the standard policy is okay take five take ten get
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.320]  yourself loose get yourself warmed up and and you're gonna finish this game
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.080]  the NFL never postpones games NFL never cancels games they can't the way the
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.760]  schedule works so they don't so for that game to be postponed last night
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.880]  reportedly at the players and the coaches behest that says a big story and I
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.840]  think you've nailed it really this is gonna be up to what the players want to
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:17.280]  do and whether it becomes an issue of player safety dealing with okay the
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.680]  equipment or the helmets or whatever or it becomes an issue of player safety
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:23.920]  dealing with hey you made us get these vaccines now look at us dropping like
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:28.400]  flies if the players take this into their own hands the NFL is gonna have a
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.120]  real problem and you know JJ Watts a league loyalist but I don't think they're
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:39.080]  all gonna be so loyal Thomas no no well they can't be I mean you know their
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.960]  bodies are their livelihoods and if you destroy their bodies with these these
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:49.520]  gene therapy jabs you know I mean that's what do they do right what do they do
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.680]  where do they go from there you know that's that's their profession that's
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.120]  their career you've got a limited amount of time to make enough money to have a
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:01.920]  good life because you know you can only play that sport for so long and you know
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.280]  they've destroyed it you know they're cutting that that amount of time that
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:09.400]  you can play down dramatically by destroying their heart destroying this
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.320]  destroying that and you know the league and the doctors who are lying to these
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:17.320]  players they all knew they were lying this was this was absolutely apparent
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:21.760]  the kind of guys who are doctors and NFL those are quality guys they know those
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.960]  risks there's no way these guys didn't know so the players are gonna have to
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:29.600]  take it upon themselves you know I mean I'll just say right here and right now
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:34.760]  that if any of the players need it you know I'll do my best to connect them
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:38.120]  with real doctors who will actually tell them the truth about this yeah you know
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.760]  what we are up against a break here so let's re-emphasize that on the other side
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.080]  of this short break five minutes left with Tom Renz let's re-emphasize what
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:48.440]  you were just saying Tom we'll be right back

[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:25.600]  otherwise you wouldn't know about us. Yeah and that's why it's important for us
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:28.320]  to be on air so we can do these interviews and get the information out.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:31.440]  Tom one more question I have on the medical side and maybe you've gotten
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.040]  this from a doctor I haven't seen it I haven't seen an opinion offered on this
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:40.440]  anywhere yet you know the situation right now he is they're saying all of his
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.240]  vitals are good but I don't really understand that when he can't breathe on
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.040]  his own I mean he's on live sport he's on a breathing machine they got his
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.640]  heart going again but he's in critical condition on a breathing machine. Do we
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:56.880]  know what the normal circumstances or protocols for a situation like this are
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:04.480]  I mean do they consider this a coma how long do they consider this to be a
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:09.640]  state of we can keep him alive like this for how long do you have any answers as
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:14.240]  far as that's concerned. Well what we know is that there's a lot of questions
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:18.480]  right you know they just like the vaccine status they're not it really
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.880]  putting out a whole lot of information and you know I think the vaccine status
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.520]  is relevant for the country to know about because it's part of a national
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.720]  conversation that has to occur but his private medical condition you know I
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.440]  understand why his family would want to keep that private and no I haven't heard
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:40.560]  anything you know I always said he's on event he's in ICU I know what everybody
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.080]  else knows on that anything else I've heard is pretty speculative there's
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.560]  been some debate about you know this and that but it sounds like I'm guessing
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:53.360]  they're doing everything they can to treat him given his condition but you
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.600]  know I would say that one of the things that would be real interesting to know is
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.080]  have they tested his heart have they checked to see whether there is my
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.760]  or pericarditis in there and you know were there spike proteins in the heart
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:07.920]  I mean that's something else that ought to be checked for you know those are
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.520]  things that I think that that are really relevant and really important but I mean
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.600]  the most important thing right now is just praying for his health and that is
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.240]  his recovery. Yeah and I mean like like you said I mean that's the question is
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.880]  would we even know I mean does he have one of these fiber clots in him from a
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.040]  vaccine did it make a bad situation worse do other athletes need to be worried
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.960]  about this if not then good then then good at least we have some answers there
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:34.280]  but I don't we're not getting the answers who knows that the players are
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.960]  getting the answers some of them might know personally because they know the
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:42.120]  guy personally but whether whatever the situation ends up being folks this has
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:47.880]  really added a lot of fuel to the fire of the COVID-19 vaccine debate and that
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.880]  is not going anywhere anytime soon and we hope the best for this young athlete
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:57.320]  Tom Renz thank you so much Tom Renz at dot com

[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:25.640]  all right ladies and gentlemen we've got to switch lanes now the other big
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:34.120]  story today is what's going on with the Vatican and he recently deceased Pope
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:40.520]  and who better to get on than Leo Zagami from LeoZagami.com and the
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:46.080]  author of Confessions of an Illuminati. Leo you got to just lay out the whole
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.200]  story for me here and what's going on the latest headlines on your website
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.600]  Pope Ratzinger was no saint but he was kept in isolation from 2020 after his
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:02.840]  book with Cardinal Sarah infuriated Bergogoli, Bergoglia I'm butchering that
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:08.040]  Ratzinger's funeral mass on January 5th 2023 and the number 23 in Illuminati
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:14.960]  synchronicity Leo Zagami what's the latest story here. Hey Owen happy new year
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:21.160]  to you and all our viewers of course the latest story from the Vatican is the
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:29.640]  imminent funeral of Pope Ratzinger Pope Emeritus Ratzinger Benedict the 16th
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:38.160]  who was the first pope in recent history to of course resign 10 years ago and he
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:43.160]  has finally passed away the strange thing of course is that the Vatican is
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:49.040]  not really giving any state funerals for this former pope they are rather
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:55.440]  respecting they say a low-key approach but inside sources say that the problem
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.160]  is they don't want to spend too much money because they have probably a
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:07.640]  conclave also coming up this year when Pope Bergoglio Pope Francis will
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:14.120]  probably resign following this tradition exactly 10 years after tradition of
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:20.480]  course of resigning that has a broke with the long-standing tradition of
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:27.440]  leaving the papacy up until death they are of course increasing voices of
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:34.360]  criticisms towards this decision Orban just went to visit the recently as a
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:41.080]  private citizen of course like many others the the popes the popes body
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:48.400]  has been transported in in the early hours of yesterday morning into the
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:57.200]  Basilica of St. Peter's Square it was a small ritual didn't last long they have
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:05.880]  this cardinal of course fumigating him and welcoming him in a way and of course
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:11.560]  that kickstarted all the visits to the pope which are unprecedented that in the
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:18.040]  last 24 hours over 100,000 people have already visited this pope and this is
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.680]  something that really has surprised apparently the Vatican and also the
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.400]  security forces that are of course involved in this visit that of course
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.680]  every person goes there queues up and then has to go for all the various
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.720]  security procedures regarding a rat singer as a figure a lot of people
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:45.360]  claim he was the last real pope he was the last traditionalist but let's not
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.760]  forget that he is somebody who participated to the second Vatican
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:55.360]  Council he is somebody who whose legacy is connected still to the pedophilia
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.560]  cover-up because for many years before becoming pope he was in charge of the
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:07.000]  congregation for the doctrine of faith and now this decaster is a very important
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:13.120]  one because it's the former inquisition and from the 80s till 2005 it was in the
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.360]  hands of a rat singer who covered up a lot of this pedophilia cases until the
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.920]  point of really no return for the church and it was thanks to all these
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:30.520]  cover-ups that the Jesuits were able to actually forcing forcing out of office
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:37.760]  10 years ago and this happened as we all know in February 2013 with his
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:45.600]  historic annunciation in Latin about abandoning his patron ministry but
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  rat singer was also involved in covering up cases of pedophilia during his
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.240]  time in Germany with his own brother who was also a clergyman they covered up
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:05.320]  over a hundred cases of pedophilia only there so I mean saying that rat singer
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.400]  was a good man only because he was a traditionalist or a more conservative
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:16.600]  pope but well that's not enough for me of course the fact that they are not
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:21.280]  giving him a state funeral is in itself a scandal when you think that for
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:25.960]  example India gave a state funeral to Mother Teresa who was a small Albanian
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:33.040]  man wasn't even an Indian but we have also other things that regard of course
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:39.080]  Pope Ratzinger Pope Ratzinger like you cited my article at the beginning of the
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:44.240]  show was involved in this controversy that really isolated him for the last
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:51.560]  two years in February 2020 he came out with a book with the Cardinal Sara that
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:58.460]  was really a critic of all the modernist progressive approach of Pope Francis and
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:04.560]  also of the fact that they were really discussing the possibility of renouncing
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:10.480]  the celibacy for priest and he was vehemently against all that but this
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:19.720]  created a big problem back then in fact the actual secretary of Pope Ratzinger
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:25.760]  who have always been like still maintained in the team of Pope Francis
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:34.560]  Father Georg was literally kicked out of the team of Pope Francis team and at
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.320]  the same time from February 2020 with the excuse of the pandemic Pope Ratzinger
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.960]  was completely isolated he wasn't he was basically at house arrest wasn't
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:51.240]  allowed to talk with anybody and this book with Cardinal Sara he even went on
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:56.040]  record saying oh well I didn't actually co-writed with him he tried to renounce
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  his position as co-writer of this book but it was already too late so that really
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:10.760]  infuriated Pope Francis who apparently shouted and was completely
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:17.240]  angry about this former Pope getting into the business of the church again
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:23.440]  however a lot of tradition is the thought that Ratzinger was also the real
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:32.360]  Pope that Ratzinger in some way had sabotage the formalities of the elections
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:40.520]  of Pope Francis to in a valid manner stay himself as the real people
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:47.320]  figure there is a lot of controversy about this there has been various Vatican
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:52.440]  history who have supported this theory but of course now all these people who
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:59.200]  this traditionalist who had thought they have a Pope in the person of Ratzinger
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.040]  now are very disappointed and they will join in a way they said the back and
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:08.760]  this that the favorians the traditionalist that don't really believe in the
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:13.080]  popes after the second body and cancer but I repeat Ratzinger wasn't one of
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.440]  those Pope Ratzinger was actually involved with also with a figure like
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:25.040]  John Paul II for many years then later on as a Pope he demonstrated that he
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:33.280]  wasn't bringing anything new if not following the path that was dictated by
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.240]  the second body and cancer this reunion of the church that in the early in the
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:44.360]  first part of the 60s changed the church and there is also those people who
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:51.080]  accused Pope Ratzinger in those days he was still a young servant of the church
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:57.200]  of having participated also to a black mass the first black mass within Saint
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:04.160]  Peter's wall in the early 60s that went on during the Second Vatican Council
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:12.200]  this was also an accusation that was in a bail way made by Father Malachi Martin
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:18.440]  in one of his books though he changed of course the names to protect in a way also
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:24.000]  himself though the end of Father Malachi Martin is also a suspicious one
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.360]  so now we have a mass a funeral mass that is going on at 9.30 on the 5th of
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:37.400]  January and this is very significant that there is no papal regalia adorning the
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:43.680]  body of Benedict instead that we had this red liturgical best man's and this is
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:48.360]  not normal and so you're explaining why Leo Zagami is with us Leo Zagami.com

[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:14.400]  called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.800]  course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:25.880]  was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3 you see the sun via your skin helps
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:30.760]  your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:34.960]  not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things

[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:28.360]  Leo Zagami with us from LeoZagami.com and Leo there was one thing I wanted to
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:35.360]  go back to before we get into this ceremony so is that official now that
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:40.560]  popes don't get a lifetime appointment that it's only ten years is that an
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:44.360]  official thing or they're kind of making it an unofficial official thing
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:50.640]  they're kind of making it an in a habit that will probably become
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:57.880]  later on a formality for the moment we have to understand that Pope Francis is
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:05.960]  now at the same age that Ratzinger was when he resigned so it would be a kind
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:13.160]  of a repetition of what we have already seen and this of course normalizes the
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:18.200]  event the fifth of January we will we are approaching of course this funeral
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:25.160]  but it's also full of symbolism because the number five is two and three which
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:31.120]  is also 23 this magical number for the Illuminati which we also encounter in
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:37.120]  the number of this year 2023 which means a lot of things because 23 were the
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:42.120]  grandmasters of the Order of the Knights Templar the last one being Jacques de
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:48.960]  Molay 23 letters we find in the Latin alphabet we have the 23 axioms in
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:55.320]  Euclid geometry we have also the fact that every 23 seconds the blood
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:22:00.720]  circulates in the human body and the human biorhythm cycle is generally 23
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:08.440]  days so the number 23 is very important and is regarded by the Illuminati as an
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:14.760]  in-between year in which there will be some dramatic things definitely
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:22.720]  happening and this funeral is of course the beginning of something that will
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:29.560]  probably put us right in front of this transformation in church traditions which
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:35.400]  is of course another resignation Pope Francis is also very sick he was
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:43.200]  operated but apparently his cancer at the colon is advancing he himself was
[02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:51.920]  being visibly sick during most of 2022 so it seems pretty logic that after this
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:57.000]  funeral there will be probably a resignation but the first the Pope
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:02.160]  Francis is actually expected I think in Africa he has a couple of state visits
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:09.800]  to attend so if he resigns he's not gonna resign immediately now is there I mean
[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:16.600]  is there a reason why let's say the Illuminati the powers that be behind the
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:21.680]  Vatican is there a reason why they would want to have a time limit of the
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:27.960]  Pope's time as the Pope what was the reason for that but there is a reason
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:35.080]  is the sacrality the divine as fear that the figure of the Pope is it was a
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.520]  sacred figure in the tradition of the Catholic Church you will never imagine a
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:47.320]  Pope resigning however it did happen in the past two four different popes but
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:53.840]  these popes never really survived that the resignation in the way that they
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:24:00.320]  will then be having a funeral like the one we're seeing on the fifth of January
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:06.040]  because most of them were either arrested kicked out of the Vatican so pass so
[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:11.280]  in other words past resignations have been on a on a bad note a bad thing has
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:15.520]  happened and the Vatican says you know we're not recognizing you you're not
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:20.080]  gonna get a funeral ceremony you're not gonna have anything from us and but this
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:23.920]  case is it kind of seems like they're kind of playing it in between where they
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:27.440]  are gonna do the ceremony but they're not gonna have it like an official Pope
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:34.240]  ceremony my am I getting that correct yeah and the thing is that actually
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:40.000]  Pope Ratzinger was in a way under house arrest he couldn't really talk with the
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:46.720]  outside world anymore like I said early because of Pope Francis fearing
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:53.960]  fearing the criticism that Ratzinger often had towards this church which is
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.520]  gradually transforming in something else and this one world religion that is
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:05.960]  coming out of it and that clearly Pope Francis is promoting is something a bit
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.680]  different from what we already saw with the interreligious approaches of John
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.480]  Paul the second that we initially invited a lot of different religions in a
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.800]  season making an historic move then we had of course Ratzinger but I think it
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.400]  got in a controversy with Islam as you remember before his criticism towards
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:33.200]  Mohammed and the way he was converting by the sword so he wasn't really joining
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.040]  with the Muslims like Pope Francis who instead from the Abu Dhabi treaty the
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:46.080]  human fraternity treaty of early 2019 is formally bringing together this one
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:52.880]  world religion which is shaping up and it's also goes in line with the the
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:58.480]  elimination of the sacrality of the pope figure the pope is just a bishop of
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:07.040]  Rome in the new vision of the church he can't be regarded as some holy of holies
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:13.080]  that can eventually because they are transforming of course the Catholic faith
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:18.280]  in a religion that can be then molded and crafted together with the others in
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:23.960]  this one world religion that they are of course proposing to the world for the
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:29.440]  arrival of the Antichrist because that's what's coming together here the arrival
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:36.960]  of the Antichrist that will be aided and abated by cyber Satan and of course all
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:45.840]  this is happening in the next seven years from now so Ratzinger was a figure
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:52.800]  that of course in the last years of his life probably realized the errors that
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:27:00.040]  were done even by himself and of course by the second body and counsel but
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:09.720]  still decided to go along with this resignation and of course tried to stay
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:17.920]  in the shadow of Pope Francis until he couldn't stand anymore this destruction
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:23.960]  of the tradition because he was still a man that had some kind of tradition but
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:32.360]  he was of course also a very hypocrite figure because he was criticizing for
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:38.280]  example the homosexual with him his regulation with the father girl was a
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:45.720]  very ambiguous one when he himself was probably involved in pedophilia or his
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:52.760]  brother for sure and so there is some ambiguities he wasn't definitely not a
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:59.320]  saint as some people want to portray him but he was definitely a figure also that
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:04.840]  comes from Germany and from Bavaria and from the borders with Austria in an
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:13.200]  area which has been filled up with illuminati figures that have influenced
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:18.200]  very much the course of Freemasonry and lately also the course of the church in
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:26.600]  fact from Austria comes also the guy who is trying to work with Pope Francis in
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:32.240]  shaping up this one world religion but this is of course a subject we could
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:38.800]  discuss another time I think that is a very significant that at the moment we
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:49.240]  have of course a call by many people for a state mass when of course this pope
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:54.400]  had been a important figure let's talk next seven years on the other side of
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:56.960]  this break Leo we'll be right back

[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:43.960]  the author of Confessions of an Illuminati and is that the eighth edition I
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:49.480]  see behind you Leo is that number eight there? Yes it's volume eight of my
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:56.440]  confessions which has been brought out last month with great success I invite
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:00.200]  all of you to check it out from the rise of the Antiguas to the sound of the
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:05.680]  devil and the great reset is basically the only book that describes the
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:11.800]  occult mission of Hollywood with facts not fiction and with the credible sources
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:18.360]  a book of almost 700 pages that I'm selling for only 23 dollars because the
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:24.520]  number 23 you must be in the Illuminati. Well because the 23 can have a
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:30.600]  positive significance as well as a negative one and we can of course study
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:36.320]  many reasons and cite many reasons for that but definitely this book wants to
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:41.800]  explain how we have been manipulated by the media by Hollywood for the last
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.120]  over a hundred years with the help of the military industrial complex directly
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:51.280]  involved in Hollywood to actually hasher in the ideology of the Antichrist and
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:56.280]  normalize what we are seeing these days that people will not accept this
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:02.520]  reality if they were not brought into it but how this happened of course is what
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:08.920]  I write in my book in which I describe also how LSD was used to transform in
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:14.000]  the 50s and 60s all these Hollywood people and the whole generation that
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:20.800]  then went from the conservatism of John Wayne to the liberal progressive
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:26.680]  approach of Jane Fond so and and also of course of the occult foundations of
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:31.520]  Hollywood people don't know but Hollywood is profoundly occult and the
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:37.760]  first mass the Crowley device was actually celebrated by his disciples in
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:45.160]  Hollywood not in London not in another place and his disciples of course the
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:52.640]  roaring 20s we know that there was a silent movie period in which there was
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:59.040]  already a scandalous approach which is now coming up to light with this recent
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:03.720]  movie from the director of La La Land Babylon which is just being brought out
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:10.520]  and that kind of portrays in a fictional way that period but Babylon was the
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:16.640]  foundation of Hollywood and Babylon is also the scenography that you find next
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:21.640]  to the Kodak and now Dolby theater where they give the Oscars and that
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:29.560]  Babylonian scenography that comes from the movie intolerance from 1916 then
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:35.040]  stayed there for many years because this DW Griffith who created this movie and
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:40.720]  was the first film director to film a film in Hollywood in 1909-1910 he only
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:46.080]  found a very small village there with a dirt road which then later on became
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:50.920]  Hollywood Boulevard and when he implanted this scenography for this film it
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:57.680]  stayed there for years so Hollywood had this Babylonian with all these elephants
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:06.040]  of Ishtar or the symbolism Anki and then this symbolism was revived in 2001 when
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.000]  they opened this shopping mall next to the place where they give the Oscars
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  and it's basically visible to everybody and on the other side of the road then
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.600]  you have the Masonic temple where they actually do the Jimmy Kimball show
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:25.880]  nowadays so Hollywood is Masonic but people wanted to know the real history
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:31.040]  of Hollywood and I offered for the first time the name of the lodges there were
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:34.840]  people like for example John Wayne the Warner Brothers all these people were
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:40.120]  involved in and what they were doing and the influence that somebody like
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:45.200]  Karista Crowley had because he was picking up on that heresy that Sabati and
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.600]  Frank is heresy within Judaism which is really the problem and not so much
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:58.240]  Judaism that's why I I invite Kanye West to read this book he might have maybe a
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:03.920]  better idea of the problems within Judaism instead of accusing the whole
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:08.680]  religion because accusing the whole religion is a bit like accusing Catholics
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:15.000]  of being all Satanist of being all evil that's not the truth Catholics of course
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.680]  who are traditionalists who don't believe in these reforms they stay as good
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.440]  people just as the Jewish people who haven't been affected by this heresy
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:31.920]  that was born in Turkey and then in Poland and then developed and the
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:37.760]  foundations of this heresy then were translated also in the Frankfurt school
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:43.440]  for example which then became the basis for the walk ideology so I also explain
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.840]  the roots of the walk ideology that now pervades Hollywood and we have arrived
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:55.840]  to the point in which now Hollywood is basically the home of the Antichrist and
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:01.520]  they don't even hide it all business TV series dedicated to the Santa Clauses in
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.560]  December with the children saying I love you Satan
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:16.400]  that's a boy how did you miss that one guys geez Leo though you mentioned and
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:20.080]  I'm looking forward to getting your new book your last one was so good all of
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.400]  them are so good but you mentioned in the last segment just briefly what do you
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:32.320]  expect to see in the next seven years well now that basically a rat singer is
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:39.120]  dead the Vatican is completely in the hands of the Freemasons because Pope
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:44.880]  Bergoglio Pope Francis is a Freemason and so they can have complete control on
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:50.480]  establishing the one-word religion that will aid and obey the rise of the
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:56.040]  Antichrist in the next seven years mostly due to technology because the rise of
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:00.080]  the Antichrist will be helped by artificial intelligence and the
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:06.720]  developments within artificial intelligence people in 2023 probably
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:14.480]  will start to become more and more angry towards this oppressive situation
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.880]  which is force upon us the vaccine you're expecting you're expecting that to
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:22.560]  become a reality that people are going to start to see that the technotronic
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:26.520]  grid being set up by the corporate world government I'm curious what do you see as
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:30.400]  Elon Musk's role in all this do you like Elon Musk not do you trust him do you not
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:34.800]  what are your thoughts on Musk in his role in all this very ambiguous figure
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:41.160]  very ambiguous figure because he wants to portray himself as a knight in shining
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.800]  armor but on the other side he's actually portraying the symbols of
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:52.440]  baphomet when he dresses up and he is of course doing things that are also
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:58.240]  ambivalent because even after his takeover of Twitter people like me for
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:04.200]  example I have still my profile that is isolated I can't access it is still there
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:10.200]  you can see it but you know I'm not I'm not able to to have my own the little
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:14.760]  the gummy profile but that's of course a small thing I'm a small fish you know
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:20.640]  this but I can say that Elon Musk of course also is a very ambiguous figure
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:25.000]  because of his financing people don't know this but the financing to buy
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.880]  Twitter came also from Italy from a company called Unipoll. Unipoll is
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:34.280]  traditionally a communist company connected in the old days to the Italian
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:40.280]  Communist Party and still to this day to the Democratic Party in Italy so why
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:47.760]  did Unipoll participate to the takeover of Twitter with Elon Musk this is a
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:51.160]  question I mean I'm asking this question to Elon Musk why are you
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:55.560]  associating with communists I mean Unipoll you can go and study that history
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:01.360]  is pure communism so you are financing this takeover with the communist money
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:06.840]  well that doesn't sound like a really proper so there is some things in what
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:12.200]  Elon does maybe an unknown factor at this point you don't you don't say
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:15.440]  he's part of the problem but maybe he's not part of the solution you're not
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:21.600]  sure well you know when you have so much money like I said in the case of Donald
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:28.320]  J. Trump you are able to not get corrupted at least and and and and so
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:36.040]  Elon depends is he is he corruptible or not is he really a free mind in all this
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:43.640]  or not I mean it seems like all these things that are happening with the
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:50.320]  Twitter of course are destroying our belief in the First Amendment in the
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:53.480]  right all right that's Leo Zagami folks I'm telling you get his books they're
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.760]  great reads at his website leozagami.com

[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:56.320]  come out of this as well as the situation in China that's developing so
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:48:00.040]  that's coming up in the fourth hour I'm gonna be right back here in this chair
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:05.560]  to host the war room at three o'clock now I'm gonna have to reshuffle some
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:12.000]  things because I'm not gonna spend the time on the war room to cover all the
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.080]  news that I recovered dealing with the NFL player collapsing last night and the
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:24.200]  COVID-19 vaccines injuries and of course all of the commentary involving all of
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:29.120]  that I'm not going to go back down that road we did that today we'll upload those
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:33.000]  segments to band.video we're gonna upload the video compilation I told you
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.840]  about to band.video we're gonna have an article at info wars.com we're gonna
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:41.600]  have all those resources available for you so I'm not gonna revisit and
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:48.000]  relitigate that coverage but I do want to take your calls on this including
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.360]  people that probably disagree with me and and don't like my commentary today but
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:57.200]  I'm perfectly fine with that I'm confident in what I said and what I
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.440]  think and and so are other people and maybe me and my guests see things a
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:05.400]  little differently that's fine this is all healthy discussion ladies and
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:10.080]  gentlemen there is nothing wrong with that so I do intend to open up the phone
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:14.640]  lines to take calls your thoughts your opinions your responses to the coverage
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:20.240]  last night today on the NFL football player collapsing last night I'm already
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.680]  offered my opinion it's already been picked up by national media and it's
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:27.600]  like funny leftist media like oh info wars not the leading vaccine skeptics
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:33.720]  this time like whoa no I'm we're the voice of reason here okay so it's okay
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:37.960]  we can have debates we can disagree it's not a big deal we're having the
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:41.880]  discussion though that's the key we're looking at all the elements we're being
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.200]  honest and open-minded about it that's the key so I do want to take phone calls
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:52.440]  on that issue during the war room now we've got the second vote for the house
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:57.120]  speaker that is ongoing right now it appears Kevin McCarthy is going to lose
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:07.000]  again so I again I like what Matt Gaetz is doing I think what Matt Gaetz is
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.080]  doing is a stroke of political brilliance quite frankly I have no
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:18.120]  interest in a Kevin McCarthy speakership so there's gonna be a lot of
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:22.760]  developments there I've got a lot of video clips I think it's safe to say
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  that Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert are never going to vote for Kevin McCarthy
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:32.960]  and then I think there's a short list of it's around 15 to 20 Republicans that
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:39.640]  are not gonna vote for McCarthy for now maybe they can be swayed maybe not but
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:44.360]  I don't think Kevin McCarthy gets in and I think the only way Kevin McCarthy gets
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:50.960]  in is if a Democrat ends up voting for him which don't rule that out now I did
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:57.080]  a live stream on getter last night and I briefly said this I said do not be
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:04.400]  surprised if a certain bold Democrat decides to vote for McCarthy to just
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:09.760]  make some waves or just to kind of throw an idea or a precedent out there like
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:14.800]  hey you know look at how divided the Republicans are in McCarthy maybe we
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:20.520]  should vote to get him in maybe we should add to that maybe we should put a
[02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:25.520]  little more out there for them to be divided on and I said who would be
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:29.800]  bold enough who would be against the grain enough especially now that Pelosi's
[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:34.720]  out to do something like that Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez well she was seen
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:43.440]  having a little sidebar with Paul Gosar just moments ago in an odd incident so I
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:48.640]  don't I don't think Paul Gosar voted for McCarthy now I don't know I'm sitting
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:52.600]  here in studio just looking at the numbers I have on my board I don't know
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:56.760]  if Paul Gosar into voting McCarthy or not I could see him being one of the
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:06.080]  holdouts but what could AOC and Paul Gosar be discussing I wonder I had a
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:11.680]  feeling AOC may try to pull a bold move today I thought it might be voting Kevin
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:15.080]  McCarthy for speaker maybe there's something else being worked right now
[02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:23.480]  between these two and and look I mean for as you know negative as I look at AOC
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:28.440]  as a political leader I do believe she thinks she's anti-establishment her
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:32.280]  actions don't bear that out but I think she in her heart thinks she's
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:36.760]  anti-establishment Paul Gosar is definitely anti-establishment so maybe
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:40.560]  that's not such a bad thing to see but where it stands right now it looks like
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:46.800]  Kevin McCarthy is about to go over to and things are getting interesting with
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:50.520]  some of the back and forth's we've got some other interesting video clips
[02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:55.080]  happening right now in fact I've got clip I've got Chip Roy live is there
[02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:57.840]  any way we can take this live real quick guys I'd like to hear what Chip Roy is
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:01.320]  saying he's my representative thank you in place to stop bills like that but
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:04.880]  that's the problem everybody's out there saying oh we got everything we wanted we
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:08.280]  got rules changes let me tell you something we have no way to enforce
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:12.440]  those rules changes the Speaker-elect has a history of voting with Democrats and
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:15.280]  voting with the minority against the majority of Republicans over the last
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:20.000]  decade he's been speaker or in the leadership of Republicans since 2009
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:24.720]  during that time the debt has gone from 11 trillion to 32 trillion in other
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:28.400]  words we want to be able to have a check against the swamp we made good
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:33.360]  faith good faith changes we worked hard to get them but we needed a little bit
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.480]  more in order to assure that we have the power to actually stop the swamp from
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:41.040]  rolling over the American people who are sick of bills that spend money we
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.960]  don't have are sick of open borders are sick of empowering the bureaucrats to go
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:49.000]  after them and we're sick and tired of a Congress that's not doing its job so
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:53.480]  this is about changing this town I wasn't sent here for second place I was
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:56.800]  sent here to get the job done and we need the leadership and the tools to do
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:04.040]  it so congressman to be clear you are one of the 19 who voted against McCarthy as
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:08.480]  speaker in the first vote our producers tell us you have not voted yet again
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:13.720]  safe to say you are a no again well it's not a no we're voting for names I
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:17.440]  voted for Byron Donalds my friend a conservative someone who is not of the
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  swamp he has been here only for now his second term I might vote for some
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:24.880]  similar folks who have a track record in a history of standing up to the swamp
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:30.240]  what I'm not gonna do is blindly do what the swamp does my constituents didn't
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:34.880]  send me here to do that is anybody listening to this actually happy with
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:39.760]  what Congress is doing is anybody out there are you or anybody in America do
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:44.120]  you think Congress is doing a good job the answer is no so why would we embrace
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:47.560]  the status quo why would we keep doing the same thing over and over again
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:52.440]  that's what's happening in that room and this morning a group of folks threatened
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:56.800]  to some of us and they lost votes on that we're not come back down until we get
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:59.760]  in a room and we decide how we're gonna be able to stand up and fight for the
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:04.120]  American people no matter who the speaker is congressman you just used the
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:08.600]  word threatened there in the house GOP conference meeting this morning can you
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.400]  tell us what happened well it's been public information out there that Mike
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:15.280]  Rogers threatened to say he's gonna kick those of us off of any committees who
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:21.200]  dared to challenge the coronation of the speaker and the reality is that was a
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:25.280]  threat and it was not received well by a lot of people in the room and Mike
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.160]  Rogers is emblematic of the problem he is precisely why we end up with bills like
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:32.880]  the $1.7 trillion dollar all right this is incredible stuff from Troy you you
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:39.480]  also had Don Bacon Republican swamp Rhino threatened conservatives even
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:43.440]  Marjorie Taylor green who I like I really like Marjorie Taylor green a lot but
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:48.520]  but she was out there basically shouting to the media how Republicans that aren't
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:53.320]  voting for McCarthy are causing problems I disagree with her on that and that's
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:57.520]  fine she even said my friend Matt Gates is one of them so it's it's it's fine to
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.680]  have disagreements in important issues like this but I think we have a pretty
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:10.440]  good shortlist now Jim Jordan Byron Donalds Chip Roy Matt Gates Lauren
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:16.000]  Bober those are all hard-nosed I'm I'm suspecting Paul Gosar maybe as well but
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:19.560]  but we don't know that there's probably at least 10 of them McCarthy's not gonna
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:23.560]  get he's not gonna win on this second vote so we'll see what happens with these
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:27.320]  rules changes you know one of the funny things is that Pelosi made every
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.440]  member of Congress every member of the House walk-through metal detectors if
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:34.640]  they wanted to get in that's been removed they've now removed the metal
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:37.720]  detectors so the congressmen aren't treated like terrorists anymore but I
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.240]  guess when you're Nancy Pelosi that's how you view them now ladies gentlemen
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:45.760]  again Maria is he about to take over I'm gonna take a quick hour here and regroup

[03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:30.160]  other day and he was talking about the fact that 2023 is just a continuation of
[03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:37.360]  the agenda and a new year doesn't necessarily spell brand new tactics for
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:43.120]  the new world order I think and it's it's an important time to reflect on what
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:49.840]  we can expect in the coming year to reevaluate our response to the war that
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:55.200]  the globalists have waged upon us and to think about solutions that we can
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:58.760]  implement in our daily lives you see one of the things that they have tried to
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:05.440]  destroy is the power of the individual to take responsibility over their own
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:10.760]  life the power of the individual to have personal accountability personal
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:16.640]  responsibility everything is victim mentality they want people weak they
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:21.640]  want people dependent on the system but I think that one of the positives that
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:27.360]  has come out of all of this is that the people that are aware and I find this to
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:32.560]  be prevalent mostly in those who really understand just how sinister the
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:36.400]  agenda is they're becoming more and more independent they're becoming more and
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:41.560]  more resourceful and I believe in humanity in this regard I believe that
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:46.800]  the more persecution that we are under and history would would back this up the
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:50.840]  more persecution that humans face the stronger they become and I see this
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:56.520]  resilience growing in the resistance movement I see this you know this this
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:02.200]  strength when it comes to being able to assess propaganda for what it really is
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:10.040]  people aren't fearful anymore which is wonderful because the main tool of
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:15.680]  control of the globalists depends on people being afraid of the information
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:19.800]  that they present so today we're going to talk about some of the things that we
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:25.080]  can expect this year and it really is a rolling agenda guys it's not it's not
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:30.680]  anything new because we're looking at agenda 2020 to 2030 this is a this is a
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:35.400]  ten-year rollout of these things and it's happening incrementally it's
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:44.040]  happening in some regard very slowly COVID-19 was if you you know will the you
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:47.680]  know the the initial blow and it came on very hard and very strong but they're
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:53.840]  trying to lull people into a false sense of security by implementing the rest of
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:59.880]  their plans slowly incrementally and this is this is this is a huge part of
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:03.600]  how people will be deceived and the sleepers don't realize what's going on
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:08.560]  if they continued hard and fast many more people would have woken up but part
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:13.720]  of the tactic was to pull back a little bit so that people wouldn't realize the
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:17.280]  plan for a complete global takeover so we'll look at some of the things we can
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:23.080]  expect for 2023 today we'll look at some of the solutions and I also want to
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:27.040]  touch on the China situation because I don't think there's enough coverage on
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.880]  this and it really is a it's a mark of the fact that people are numb to
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:39.360]  propaganda which is great that is good it shows me that the world is not taking
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:45.840]  their BS anymore but we cannot deny that they really are setting us up for a new
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:52.120]  bioweapon for a new attack of some sort and really so gearing up to the
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:55.840]  economic collapse that they want to see happen this year so we'll cover all of
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:04:01.480]  that today but I just want to spend the next few seconds commending people I
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:05.600]  really want to commend the viewers of this broadcast I want to amend the
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:14.120]  resistance worldwide you are some of the strongest people in history you have
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:18.200]  not only survived the greatest psychological war that has ever been
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:24.520]  waged upon you but you have thrived you have come out on the other end of what
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:28.360]  we've been subjected to over the past three years specifically stronger and
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:33.880]  more motivated than ever to defeat the globalist and this wave of resistance is
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:39.400]  not only rising it's spreading like wildfire and it is because of the people
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:43.480]  that saw this for what it was from the beginning you are the reason that the
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:47.560]  world is waking up you are the reason that the mainstream media cannot keep
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:51.840]  their mouth shut your support of independent media is what has got us
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:54.960]  here and I want to thank you we'll be right back on the other side of this
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:05:00.040]  break to keep talking about it I've taken a lot of supplements over the years
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:03.760]  since high school and they had great effects and the science has gotten
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:07.960]  better and better and better over the years and now with all the things were
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:12.640]  bombarded with the water and the food and the feminizing factors it is more
[03:05:12.640 --> 03:05:16.600]  important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male

[03:06:02.800 --> 03:06:11.240]  alrighty so 2023 what can we expect now this is something again it's gonna be a
[03:06:11.240 --> 03:06:14.680]  rolling agenda it's something that we can expect to see for the next seven
[03:06:14.680 --> 03:06:19.520]  years and some of it will be incremental some of it will be sudden but what we
[03:06:19.520 --> 03:06:23.160]  can expect to see this year is a continuation of the climate change
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:27.760]  narrative not only a continuation but definitely an acceleration you see that
[03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:31.120]  they're starting to promote the 20-minute neighborhoods 15-minute
[03:06:31.120 --> 03:06:35.240]  neighborhoods now and it's becoming mainstream knowledge that they're doing
[03:06:35.240 --> 03:06:38.960]  this and of course you know I've spoken about this many times it's going to be
[03:06:38.960 --> 03:06:43.120]  promoted as you know well they're using the words highly liveable cities as if
[03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:47.160]  our cities aren't liveable now or living locally what do you mean living
[03:06:47.160 --> 03:06:54.000]  locally you live local to your I mean I've been over this many times and the
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:58.960]  viewers of this broadcast know this but they a lot of their agendas are now
[03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:02.240]  becoming mainstream knowledge and they're being painted as positive things
[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:07.960]  and so for people that don't understand what a smart city is it may seem like
[03:07:07.960 --> 03:07:11.760]  something great it's convenient it's all of the above we're looking after the
[03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:16.200]  climate so on and so forth but for the viewers of this broadcast and the viewers
[03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:20.640]  of my content you know how sinister this is this is complete total control
[03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:24.480]  geofencing you can't leave your district in fact they're calling them districts
[03:07:24.480 --> 03:07:30.160]  treating you like you are living inside the hunger games and you know being
[03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:34.280]  peasants not being allowed to eat meat having every single move tracked and
[03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:39.360]  traced and controlled it is an absolute nightmare open-air concentration camp as
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:43.400]  Aman Jabi describes it and you would have seen Greg Reese has done a couple of
[03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:47.800]  videos on this over the past two weeks I encourage everyone to watch him if you
[03:07:47.800 --> 03:07:51.560]  haven't he does a fantastic job breaking this down in a short time bite-sized
[03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:55.960]  pieces for the masses share those videos guys share those videos with as many
[03:07:55.960 --> 03:08:00.240]  people as you possibly can to wake them up we can expect an economic collapse
[03:08:00.240 --> 03:08:06.080]  and this is all linked by the way these things aren't exclusive from one
[03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:11.120]  another the economic collapse will be linked to the climate the the viruses
[03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:16.160]  will be linked to the climate and to the economic collapse you know it's it's all
[03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:20.120]  intertwined but I definitely think they're staging an economic collapse and
[03:08:20.120 --> 03:08:24.840]  much much worse than we expected the head of the IMF just said at least one
[03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:30.120]  third of the world is going to head into a recession in 2023 and the countries
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:34.360]  that aren't in a full-blown recession hundreds of millions of their people will
[03:08:34.360 --> 03:08:40.280]  feel as though they are so the the and we'll touch again as I said later on in
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:47.320]  the China situation this is being used to push that final nail in the coffin for
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:52.080]  the global recession because they need the economy to collapse they need their
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:57.280]  fake fiat money system to collapse they need the US dollar to collapse in order
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:02.960]  to bring in a one-world currency and you know the entire goal here guys is one
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:11.320]  government one religion one currency this is what the entire agenda is about one
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:17.920]  religion one government one currency and they've really created this hive
[03:09:17.920 --> 03:09:25.240]  mentality where as I said at the beginning there is no focus on individual
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:30.560]  responsibility individual accountability it's all about let's all get
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:36.800]  together for the greater good and make you know let's all let's all take
[03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:41.720]  injections for the greater good let's all eat less meat for the greater good
[03:09:41.720 --> 03:09:47.240]  rather than teaching people to be strong individuals on their own to take
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:53.400]  responsibility for their health to eat better to exercise to get involved in
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:58.440]  politics and make a better world no they want you less involved in politics
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:03.720]  they want you to buy into campaigns where you can virtue signal on social
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:07.920]  media how great you are because you're joining the the masses in you know
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:13.800]  advocating for Ukraine or something making people feel a false sense of
[03:10:13.800 --> 03:10:22.160]  virtue there's going to be a huge focus and ramping up of the use of AI and data
[03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:26.520]  collection this is across all platforms and there will be a linking of all
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:31.560]  platforms we can expect to see that you know I've spoken about my concerns about
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:35.800]  Elon and Twitter he says he wants to turn this into a platform like WeChat
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:42.640]  WeChat is the very platform that's been used by the CCP in China to control the
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:48.120]  people via a social credit system if you do the wrong thing on WeChat you get a
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:53.680]  red coat you're off to a camp because you're not complying so I think that we
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:56.880]  need to be very vigilant when we're engaging in these platforms they're
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:02.000]  great to get the truth out I myself depend on them because I want to reach
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:06.880]  the masses because it enables me to speak to people that perhaps wouldn't know
[03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:12.480]  what's going on and and we need to do this but it's a catch-22 you've got to
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:16.520]  be vigilant when you're engaging with all of these mainstream platforms because
[03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:20.400]  they are data collecting and think about the fact that they've allowed these
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:25.720]  places to last like Telegram you know they've allowed these places to continue
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:30.960]  because they do end up weaponizing them against the people and I spoke about
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:35.040]  this last week you know it was the situation in Australia they got a plant
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:39.880]  to go into an Australian channel post something that would then be used against
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:45.280]  the freedom loving people of Australia so we have to be mindful of this when
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:50.560]  engaging with these platforms remember they are a tool they are a tool for us
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:55.200]  to get the truth out do not depend on them too much and remain vigilant and I
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:58.520]  believe people are growing in that vigilance we can expect more of hacking
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:03.400]  humans and 5g attacks I really think this is a huge part of their plans this
[03:12:03.400 --> 03:12:07.240]  year I think that in the next few months we're going to see this a lot the
[03:12:07.240 --> 03:12:12.640]  situation in China very well may have something to do with the 5g
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:18.520]  investigating that and speaking to people around the world on that but the
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.560]  the reality is that people have been injected with something now that the
[03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:28.160]  globalists say humans are now hackable animals what does this mean what does
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:32.240]  this look like for the future will they use this to create pandemics will they
[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:36.200]  use this to create climate catastrophes you know all the humans have been
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:41.120]  encroaching on you know environments natural environments too much and now
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:48.040]  we have this virus or that virus emerging you know we've never seen
[03:12:48.040 --> 03:12:54.480]  zoonic viruses passing to to human beings at this scale but according to
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:58.520]  Australia's pandemic preparedness plan which by the way the global pandemic
[03:12:58.520 --> 03:13:02.000]  center is here in Australia this is why you need to pay attention to what comes
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:08.120]  out of here that the entire global pandemic center is here they say that
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:13.320]  future pandemics will be dependent on climate change what is happening with
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:16.720]  humans encroaching on natural environments that's why they want to
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:21.360]  pull you out of rural areas that's why they geo engineer and attack rural
[03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:25.840]  areas so much and flood them and burn them because they want to push people
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:31.920]  into the metropolis the 50 million people in a smart city they have this
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:36.200]  plan in Australia it's a it's a it's a railway all along the east coast and it
[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:40.040]  just so happens to be that the bushfires that ravaged our countries three years
[03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:45.760]  ago were all along the east coast then they ravaged ravaged us with floods
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:50.200]  which by the way have been geo engineered all along the east coast so we
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:54.080]  have weather warfare that we will be facing and I believe that's going to
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:57.880]  increase you know here in the Australian skies you see a few days of clear sky
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:14:01.920]  and then again you have torrential downpour it's absolutely unbelievable and
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:06.600]  of course you know we had the narrative of oh this was you know where we're
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:10.360]  going into an ice age oh no it's global warming and now it's just climate change
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:15.440]  which is an all-encompassing term that they use to cover up the fact that they
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:21.760]  are manipulating the weather so we can definitely expect more of that cyber
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:28.080]  attacks are coming be prepared for this and they tested it on Australia first as
[03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:32.120]  they do with everything we had a huge cyber attack on our one of our main
[03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:37.440]  telco providers it affected over seven million people where apparently their
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:41.040]  personal data was leaked and it was going to be posted on the internet or
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:45.160]  whatever and they did that with another private health provider they've attacked
[03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:50.280]  government agencies allegedly and now they're telling us the EU has said that
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:56.160]  Putin is going to through cyber attacks take down Europe the entirety of Europe's
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:02.400]  energy grid this year so we can expect more of that and we know that they've
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:08.760]  already war-gamed you know cyber polygon more than once for how they will turn
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:13.920]  off the entire grid following a cyber attack a worldwide cyber attack I think
[03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:17.800]  we're going to see more of that war-gamed this year we'll see pockets of it I
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:22.600]  don't know whether we'll see the big one which is coming by the way they've told
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:27.720]  us you can't connect back to the grid without a digital vaccine so there are
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:31.800]  a few steps that need to happen there we need the digital ID implemented we need
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:36.360]  a social credit score implemented we need all of those things in place not we
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:40.960]  need they need I mean they need all of those things in place before they can
[03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:47.400]  stage a worldwide complete blackout but you will see the steps of that coming
[03:15:47.400 --> 03:15:51.960]  this year we're going to continue the globalist plans for 2023 right after
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:54.960]  this show break I'll see you soon
[03:15:55.960 --> 03:16:01.200]  so when I first started taking survival skill basically I was 275 pounds I was
[03:16:01.200 --> 03:16:05.040]  overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:08.840]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the
[03:16:08.840 --> 03:16:12.680]  first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty
[03:16:12.680 --> 03:16:16.040]  good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had you know with
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:19.240]  a deep-rooted source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:24.640]  then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:28.800]  enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[03:16:28.800 --> 03:16:32.760]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I
[03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:36.560]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely
[03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:40.360]  amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:43.800]  you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.920]  is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:52.040]  and the only way to do that is to take our own help into our own hand beautifully

[03:19:54.760 --> 03:20:07.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:15.880]  you know in that break I was just listening to Alex saying how all of the
[03:20:15.880 --> 03:20:21.600]  people so many prominent names are using the terms that info wars really coined
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:26.320]  and pioneered which was an information war and this is exactly what it is and
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:35.680]  you know I don't feature on this broadcast for no reason you know I believe in
[03:20:35.680 --> 03:20:42.360]  info wars so much because info wars played such a huge crucial role in
[03:20:42.360 --> 03:20:47.520]  strengthening me and the information on this broadcast strengthens me a lot of
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:52.680]  people say all the bad news is just overwhelming all the time I find it to
[03:20:52.680 --> 03:20:59.160]  be the opposite I'd rather know what the enemy is doing and prepare myself for
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:05.600]  it and know that I'm dealing with a globalist murderous cult then be
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:10.080]  unaware of that I don't want to be ignorant to that and the more I learn
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:15.160]  the stronger I become this the more resilient I become because we have to
[03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:18.960]  face reality and we have to know what we're up against and we have to know
[03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:24.800]  our enemy this is the key to winning the information war and how do you win the
[03:21:24.800 --> 03:21:28.720]  information war well apart from the victory that we want to see and we are
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:36.200]  starting to see you win it by winning it in your individual life overcoming the
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:41.440]  the the ways that they want you to depend on their systems and I will talk
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:45.000]  about that a little bit later because a big part of what we're going to focus
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:49.920]  on this year I think as as as a collective worldwide is that individual
[03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:54.160]  liberty that individual responsibility and becoming more and more independent
[03:21:54.160 --> 03:21:58.200]  from the systems but in order to do that we have to know what we're facing so
[03:21:58.200 --> 03:22:02.120]  I'll continue on I think that they're going to continue to push the war
[03:22:02.120 --> 03:22:06.400]  narrative it's something that scares a lot of people and of course war is one
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:10.840]  of the biggest tools to collapsing the global economy which is required in
[03:22:10.840 --> 03:22:16.160]  order to move to a CBDC one world digital currency this is the ultimate
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:22.240]  goal I think that potential lockdowns and lockdown conditioning is going to
[03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:28.160]  continue you know we had a recent two recent situations in Australia with you
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:33.080]  know arm tutors and things like that and straight away the words lockdowns were
[03:22:33.080 --> 03:22:40.320]  in the media they said the whole street has gone into lockdown then we had some
[03:22:40.320 --> 03:22:46.160]  top expert on talking to one of our mainstream media outlets saying you know
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:51.240]  we have to be prepared for the food shortages that are coming and the
[03:22:51.240 --> 03:22:57.120]  reason why we have to be prepared is because of the global economy but also
[03:22:57.120 --> 03:23:04.240]  because we may have to we will probably start seeing lockdowns in rural areas
[03:23:04.240 --> 03:23:10.480]  due to disease outbreak these are the words that are used and so they are
[03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:14.160]  continuing on with their lockdown conditioning because the plan is to have
[03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:18.160]  you in a constant state of lockdown and it's not the kind of lockdown that they
[03:23:18.160 --> 03:23:22.240]  had previously where you know you can't leave your home and you can't travel
[03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:25.320]  more than five kilometers to get groceries and you know if you're not
[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:29.400]  injected you can't leave your house but there will be pockets of that but it's
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:34.760]  not that it is now they've hit people with the most harsh form of lockdown that
[03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:40.360]  they possibly can so the other lockdowns that they feed you won't seem as bad you
[03:23:40.360 --> 03:23:44.840]  know little pockets in lockdown because of a little outbreak or this pocket in a
[03:23:44.840 --> 03:23:51.120]  lockdown because of a climate crisis you know short lockdowns will be part of
[03:23:51.120 --> 03:23:56.400]  the of the ongoing conditioning because they want to condition the masses to
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:24:00.200]  accept living in these tiny little cities and never leaving more than 15
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:05.400]  kilometers from their houses or whatever it's it's interesting to watch
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:15.000]  this is essentially this whole thing is is you know the original MK ultra plan
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:22.360]  it's a worldwide simultaneous MK ultra experiment and they've mastered the
[03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:28.080]  globalists have mastered how to control the masses think about this think about
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:32.560]  the fact that they have mastered how to control the whole world if you think back
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:37.520]  to the past three years I mean just just look at what you're seeing on your
[03:24:37.520 --> 03:24:41.720]  screen right now for the radio viewers you can't see but it's a line of cops
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:49.200]  masked just you know goons that are brainwashed New World Order goons that
[03:24:49.200 --> 03:24:57.440]  are brainwashed they have mastered a global MK ultra tactic on the world and
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:06.680]  so you know it's it's part psychological and part medicinal and this is going to
[03:25:06.680 --> 03:25:12.440]  continue this this psychological warfare on the people with the solution being you
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:18.440]  know vaccines pills and whatever drugs Big Pharma wants to release next I just
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:24.240]  I mean wake up wake up from your slumber and know that you are being MK
[03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:33.720]  altered whoever is still buying into this you were currently being you know
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:39.720]  that they think so little of you they think so little of you that they dare
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:44.920]  to continue this experiment on you and they will they will because not only is
[03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:52.640]  it 2030 we have a 2040 2050 leading to the ultimate goal of one religion one
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:57.000]  government one money and it's going to be done through continuation of
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:03.040]  psychological warfare and the pharmaceutical industry they're going to
[03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:06.880]  be disarming the people more and more we've already seen that started last
[03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:11.520]  year and you know call for more gun reforms in Australia even though we have
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:18.120]  some of the strictest gun laws in the world here they want to remove your
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:23.720]  your guns from you in the United States they want to disarm the people in the
[03:26:23.720 --> 03:26:30.600]  United States the right to bear arms exists in the event of a tyrannical
[03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:36.280]  government rising up so the people can defend themselves from that why do you
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:40.240]  think they want to remove your guns your right your ability to defend
[03:26:40.240 --> 03:26:46.880]  yourself we've seen that the effects of this in Australia and once they take
[03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:51.280]  them once they take your ability to defend yourself or at least control
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:56.160]  your ability put measures on your ability to defend yourself the tyranny
[03:26:56.160 --> 03:27:01.600]  that they that they're enabled to do is infinitely worse so we're going to
[03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:06.600]  continue to see a disarming of the people will also see a rise in domestic
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:11.120]  terrorism accusations we spoke about this last week we touched on it Jacinda
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:14.600]  Dern in the United Nations saying anyone who's a climate change denier is
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:18.520]  essentially a domestic terrorist we're at war with them and we have to treat
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:22.280]  this as a war that is going to continue enough in fact I think it's going to be
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:26.760]  on the rise a lot more these accusations of domestic terrorist you're a parent
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:31.000]  fighting for your children not to see pornography in the classroom you're a
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  domestic terrorist you know so these terms what what was initially you know
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:42.280]  after 9-11 supposed to protect the people from an outside enemy has been
[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:48.360]  weaponized and turned against the people on the the countries in their own
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:54.360]  their own countries and it's absolutely devastating to see but if only the masses
[03:27:54.360 --> 03:27:59.680]  had listened all those years ago when broadcast like this were warning about
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:04.840]  the Patriot Act and warning how 9-11 would be used against them eventually
[03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:09.040]  we're seeing it now I think we'll also see food shortages this year this is
[03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:12.520]  going to be on the rise we already know that Antonio Guterres warned about this
[03:28:12.520 --> 03:28:19.120]  last year catastrophic food shortages worldwide and that is not even whether
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:23.200]  they're manufactured or not and they are being manufactured you know food food
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:27.440]  plants being burnt down supermarket shelves empty the distribution from
[03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:32.680]  China which the world has conveniently depended on for so many years being
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:37.920]  under attack now because of what's happening over there it is manufactured
[03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:41.840]  and they're telling us their plans in advance because they want your consent
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:46.440]  for it you know they need to obtain your consent for everything that they do but
[03:28:46.440 --> 03:28:49.520]  it's something that is outside of our control because of the dependence we've
[03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:53.000]  got on other countries I'm going to continue on food shortages right on the
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:58.400]  other side of this break we'll be back in a moment introducing our new
[03:28:58.400 --> 03:29:03.520]  incredible supplement line in force indeed now in 60 seconds it's hard to
[03:29:03.520 --> 03:29:08.360]  tell you how incredible these products are but all of these products are already
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:13.160]  sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:17.120]  selling it to you these are high-end these are the very best you know our

[03:33:11.680 --> 03:33:16.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your guest host Maria Z breaking down
[03:33:16.160 --> 03:33:22.360]  the enemy's war plan for 2023 and beyond today and it is so important that we know
[03:33:22.360 --> 03:33:26.480]  our enemies so that we can resist and become stronger we're just talking about
[03:33:26.480 --> 03:33:30.480]  food shortages before the break this is something that we can expect to see
[03:33:30.480 --> 03:33:35.480]  continue so I will talk about solutions right after we get through this list of
[03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:39.760]  the enemy's war plans which includes preparing for food shortages we're
[03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:43.360]  also going to continue to see an attack on religion this is something that and
[03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:47.600]  specifically Christianity by the way this is something that has been on the
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:53.200]  increase for decades really but particularly in the last year you know
[03:33:53.200 --> 03:33:59.080]  Zelensky banning churches banning orthodoxy is one example and you current
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:04.840]  Ukraine really is paving the way for what they want the future to look like and
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:08.200]  this is why they're funneling all their money into Ukraine you can view the
[03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:14.920]  video on Ukraine being the first you know completely digital city I've shared
[03:34:14.920 --> 03:34:17.720]  that in my telegram before if you're not in there get in there there's some
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:22.960]  really crucial intel it's a media with three E's that I post regularly outside
[03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:26.920]  of the regular broadcasts and interviews that I do but the attack on
[03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:30.760]  religion is going to increase and the major reason for this number one is they
[03:34:30.760 --> 03:34:35.560]  attack Christianity because it's the truth but they also are attacking
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:40.040]  religion because they want one world religion and I've spoken about this
[03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:46.040]  before this this what appears virtuous and for peace and you know to bring
[03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:50.720]  everyone together this is how they deceive people is actually to bring
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:55.640]  people under the lordship of the antichrist when he eventually appears
[03:34:55.640 --> 03:35:00.720]  I'm not going to sugarcoat that that is what it's for the merging of religions
[03:35:00.720 --> 03:35:05.600]  is for that it's not for peace we of course of course we want peace of
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:10.080]  course we want to coexist and be and live in harmony and have everyone
[03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:16.360]  having the freedom of religion we want that Christians included you know
[03:35:16.360 --> 03:35:20.080]  whether we think we're right or wrong it doesn't matter we want you to have
[03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:24.920]  free will to do what you want that's every freedom loving person regardless of
[03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:29.600]  their race or religion wants that but that's not what this is about and you
[03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:34.800]  cannot trust genocidal maniacs who are trying to usher in the antichrist to
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:39.120]  bring any sort of peace it's false peace it's a lie it's a delusion but
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:45.400]  godless people will buy into it and they will think that it's a good thing
[03:35:45.400 --> 03:35:51.080]  godless people will buy into anything they tell them because people need
[03:35:51.080 --> 03:35:57.720]  purpose people need something to serve and they're being sold a lie that what
[03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:03.880]  they're serving is good for humanity again it's a psychological war it's MK
[03:36:03.880 --> 03:36:09.280]  ultra en masse vaccines are going to continue the vaccine agenda isn't going
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:14.040]  anywhere you know we used to depend on things like chicken soup and maybe some
[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:19.400]  patadol when we had a flu you know and now they're talking about mRNA for
[03:36:19.400 --> 03:36:23.680]  cancer they want to inject cows with mRNA vaccines are not going anywhere and
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:29.280]  we're going to see a rise of injections and they're not vaccines anymore but a
[03:36:29.280 --> 03:36:34.480]  rise of injections to treat things that we used to rely on other things for you
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:39.640]  know in Australia they're now talking about a ban on the amount of paracetamol
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:44.000]  that you can buy in the pharmacy if you try to order paracetamol online now you
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:49.960]  can you're limited to two boxes and I think that this is an effort to limit
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:54.760]  people's ability to depend on things that have been maybe safe for many many
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:59.200]  years or they're used to using for many years and push them into you know the
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:04.440]  death camps that they call hospitals and depending on brainwashed big pharma
[03:37:04.440 --> 03:37:09.680]  doctors this is this is how you know limiting people's ability to treat
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:15.840]  themselves at home really is part of it the WHO in their immunization agenda
[03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:20.120]  2030 document you can look it up yourself it's easy to find online say that
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:29.680]  they want to introduce 500 new vaccines by 2030 500 new vaccines by 2030 and they
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:35.280]  say they use the words no one left behind that means you're getting jabbed
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:39.360]  whether you like it or not and they're implementing the treaty or trying to
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:43.560]  implement the treaty now to ensure that they get to do that to you that's why
[03:37:43.560 --> 03:37:48.960]  it's so important to stop it digital ID digital ID is something that they're
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:54.880]  going to be pushing massively we've got news here out of Australia that I said
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:59.960]  that I need to look into more but the essentially it is that if you want to
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:04.920]  register your car you need a digital ID so they're moving forward with that and
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:09.320]  of course your digital ID will be your social credit score link to your CBT
[03:38:09.320 --> 03:38:14.800]  DC which they can play with and turn off and start up you know based on your
[03:38:14.800 --> 03:38:21.240]  compliance or the lack thereof and of course you know this is largely if you
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:25.760]  look at pattern 0606 06 you know the one that everyone knows about Bill Gates
[03:38:25.760 --> 03:38:33.280]  talking about mining being able to mine crypto based on your behavior so you can
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:40.840]  mine crypto currencies add them to your to your CBDC bank that will be limited
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:45.240]  by the way because they're not going to allow you to obtain wealth under their
[03:38:45.240 --> 03:38:49.760]  model they don't want you to be wealthy they want you to have nothing but if you
[03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:56.640]  do what they tell you to do pattern 0606 06 says that you'll be able to mine
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:04.520]  currency and this is of course sending your biometric data to a central
[03:39:04.520 --> 03:39:08.120]  database that says you've been a good boy or girl you've done what the government
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:13.160]  says here's some crypto how does that data that biometric data send to the
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:18.600]  database if you haven't been hacked already if you haven't been injected
[03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:24.440]  with nanotechnology that has the ability to send that biometric data to the
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:30.400]  database in order for you to mine your crypto it's already happened guys it
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:34.120]  happened through the COVID-19 injections and I'm becoming more and more
[03:39:34.120 --> 03:39:37.840]  certain of that every single day the more I speak to scientists and researchers
[03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:43.520]  all over the world so we can expect to see more of that transhumanism movement
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:49.640]  linking humans with AI linking humans with computers and all of the above
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:54.640]  we've already covered climate engineering but you know this is one that I just
[03:39:54.640 --> 03:39:59.160]  want to touch on for a few minutes because or at least a few seconds all of
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:03.360]  these things that I've spoken about today are within our control we can
[03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:07.720]  control whether we subscribe to their systems we can control whether we inject
[03:40:07.720 --> 03:40:11.920]  ourselves with their poisons but we can't control the air outside our homes
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:17.600]  when we leave our front door this is one of the most sinister and egregious
[03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:23.920]  things that they do spraying our skies with toxic chemicals that literally
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:32.840]  cause disease and death and and the air is not safe anymore I personally think
[03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:39.120]  climate engineering is one of the worst things that we're facing because you
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:42.760]  can't control it you can't stop breathing what are we going to all walk
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:46.880]  around with gas masks like the book of Eli because the skies are so ruined
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:53.920]  probably that's where we're heading with you know checkerboards all along our
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:57.960]  skies I heard that they're teaching children in school now that there are
[03:40:57.960 --> 03:41:05.360]  new clouds really do they look like GT stripes in the air unbelievable so
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:09.840]  climate engineering is a huge part of it and I think as people we will have to
[03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:13.040]  look at what what are we going to do to ensure that we're not breathing in these
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:18.840]  poisons huge part of it huge part of it mass deaths we're going to continue to
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:26.040]  see people dying on mass this is this is not going to slow down it's so
[03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:30.000]  exploding so much that it's making the mainstream news in fact in some European
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:33.880]  countries they're openly discussing now that it is the covert injections which
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:37.800]  is great that this is making the mainstream it's not great that it's
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:41.960]  happening it breaks my heart I wish that people listened and again it's not and I
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:46.280]  told you so it's a will you please listen now because the same people that
[03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:49.320]  warned you that the injections were going to kill you and your loved ones are
[03:41:49.320 --> 03:41:55.000]  warning you about all of this other stuff that seemed crazy at the time but
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:02.240]  is proving to be true now and I want to commend everyone that that stuck through
[03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:06.800]  and stuck to the truth and regardless of how much they were demonized and
[03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:11.840]  ostracized said no I know that this is true and I'm not backing down thank God
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:15.760]  for you if you're one of those people and I know the listeners of this
[03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:20.000]  broadcaster we're going to continue seeing those mass deaths it is
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:23.600]  absolutely heartbreaking to watch and they will continue to try to cover them
[03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:28.320]  up with other things like they are in China right now oh it's white lung
[03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:34.400]  syndrome really or is it the injections or is it the 5g that you've done
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:37.840]  something with the frequencies to the people to activate something in their
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:46.440]  bodies God only knows we'll continue we'll wrap up the long game in the next
[03:42:46.440 --> 03:42:51.880]  segment and then I want to talk about the solutions that we can look to in
[03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:56.520]  2023 and beyond I'll be back in a moment with you
[03:42:56.520 --> 03:43:00.600]  you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their globalist agenda

[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:09.080]  the globalist and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down but
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:13.800]  ladies and gentlemen I can't do it without your support and the good news
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:19.000]  is we're only under about $200,000 a month the bad news is the enemy is

[03:47:06.600 --> 03:47:18.080]  all right we're gonna wrap up the long game with the long game and the digital
[03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:23.280]  currency UBI information for 2023 and then we're gonna talk about the solutions
[03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:28.160]  to all of these problems and the solution has always been us but I'll get
[03:47:28.160 --> 03:47:32.120]  into that in a moment for 2023 I think we're gonna continue seeing a push
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:36.240]  towards the digital currency this will depend on them collapsing the current
[03:47:36.240 --> 03:47:40.800]  currency so I really encourage people to prepare for that it will happen
[03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:46.520]  whether it happens now or in 10 months or four months or it's coming so start
[03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:52.400]  preparing now a wise person prepares in advance for what they know their enemy
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.680]  is preparing against them you are in a war knowing this information is going
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:02.640]  to save your life and your family's life and you preparing for it now is going to
[03:48:02.640 --> 03:48:08.240]  be the key to your survival it's that simple and the sooner we accept that the
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:12.480]  sooner we just accept the fact that we're at war there are people out there
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:19.560]  globalists that want us dead deprived poor starving dumb the sooner we can
[03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:23.960]  overcome these things that's what knowing your enemy is about and any wise
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:29.160]  soldier evaluates their battle plan when they know that they're in battle no one
[03:48:29.160 --> 03:48:33.440]  goes into battle blind no one goes into battle without considering their enemies
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:40.160]  next moves and this is what it is so we're going to see the push for digital
[03:48:40.160 --> 03:48:43.600]  currency and we're also going to see them selling the UBI this is what they did
[03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:47.160]  with the welfare checks the stimulus that you know all around the world that
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:51.000]  they released during the lockdowns this was to condition people to be lazy we
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:55.200]  have a problem I'm sure it's a problem in every country but I could speak
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:48:59.240]  specifically for Australia with people not wanting to work not only are they
[03:48:59.240 --> 03:49:03.560]  sick and unable to work because they're injected to the eyeballs they are not
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:08.080]  wanting to because the government made them lazy with stimulus checks this was
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:12.360]  conditioning you for a UBI and now we've got people out there talking about how
[03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:17.720]  great UBI's are and how everyone should be on a UBI why so that you can be
[03:49:17.720 --> 03:49:22.680]  rewarded for doing what the government wants you to do and nothing else so you
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:27.920]  can serve daddy government I mean it's the most insane form of slavery making
[03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:31.240]  you a slave to the little bit of money that they want you to have and not
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:36.360]  allowing you to prosper forget about it forget about it and of course the long
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:44.760]  game guys is indoctrinating the children see we may be the last generation
[03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:50.800]  that understands what's going on because the new generation which if we're
[03:49:50.800 --> 03:49:56.360]  honest many of us struggle to understand are so engrossed in you know the CCP's
[03:49:56.360 --> 03:50:01.280]  weapon that is tiktok and all of the other social media that where the
[03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:08.440]  algorithms have destroying their brains and making them depend on dopamine hits
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:16.120]  for rewarding bad behavior or pointless behavior not actually encouraging them to
[03:50:16.120 --> 03:50:23.920]  do anything noble or great in life you know do a stupid dance and become famous
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:30.520]  overnight I mean honestly this is what tiktok is a weapon there are fantastic
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:34.400]  documentaries you can watch on this do not let your children onto tiktok it is
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:41.920]  a CCP weapon but the indoctrination through the schools is happening all
[03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:47.120]  over the world and this is part of the part of the way that they are
[03:50:47.120 --> 03:50:51.640]  transforming the future generation if we don't remove our children from these
[03:50:51.640 --> 03:50:58.480]  institutions these indoctrination camps called schools we will lose them to the
[03:50:58.480 --> 03:51:04.600]  beast this is something that you must understand so I encourage people please
[03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:10.760]  homeschool your children get them out of these these death cults where they're
[03:51:10.760 --> 03:51:15.760]  encouraging them to mutilate themselves in school and telling them that they may
[03:51:15.760 --> 03:51:22.240]  not be the gender that they are it is satanic I really believe you know parents
[03:51:22.240 --> 03:51:27.360]  do have the ability to teach their kids the right way but you're taking a risk
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:32.120]  when you send them to these institutions we have to preserve the future
[03:51:32.120 --> 03:51:38.960]  generation because if we don't we will lose this is a huge key to us being
[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:43.800]  able to have any semblance of righteousness or goodness or honesty or
[03:51:43.800 --> 03:51:48.400]  love left on this earth it depends on what we teach them and that they've
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:53.000]  killed off so many of the older population now that we've lost all that
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:58.400]  wisdom we've lost that all those people that knew how to manufacture and use
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:04.680]  items reuse them make things because they don't want us to make things in the
[03:52:04.680 --> 03:52:09.040]  new world they want us to hire everything they don't want us to be
[03:52:09.040 --> 03:52:12.600]  self-sufficient so let's talk about some of those solutions I believe that this
[03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:16.200]  year things will become clearer and be revealed and we're already seeing that
[03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:19.200]  start to happen I mean we've got the Twitter files it's a fantastic thing
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:22.920]  that's coming out you know regardless of what you think of Elon and Twitter it
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:26.480]  is wonderful that this information is coming out the question is why is it
[03:52:26.480 --> 03:52:31.920]  coming up but we'll talk about that another time things will become clearer
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:36.200]  things will be revealed as they do we need to be ready to embrace those
[03:52:36.200 --> 03:52:40.640]  people even those who hated us and I'm not talking about the globalist I'm
[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:44.680]  talking about regular people that were fooled hoodwinked yes we need to be
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:49.400]  ready to embrace those people and bring them on the journey with us waking up
[03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:54.360]  is not an easy process for a lot of people it's really not it's devastating
[03:52:54.360 --> 03:52:57.880]  actually when you realize that there's a globalist cabal that are trying to
[03:52:57.880 --> 03:53:01.520]  usher in the Antichrist and kill people off in the process yeah that's hard to
[03:53:01.520 --> 03:53:07.440]  cope with for a lot of people so we need to we need to bring those people in
[03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:11.520]  with open arms parallel systems are being built and we're seeing this more
[03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:16.320]  and more where it comes to food where it comes to you know people bartering
[03:53:16.320 --> 03:53:21.400]  trading parallel health systems I'm seeing safe blood banks being advocated
[03:53:21.400 --> 03:53:25.960]  for these things are going to continue and I think we need to support those
[03:53:25.960 --> 03:53:29.960]  things where they're viable as much as possible because we won't be able to
[03:53:29.960 --> 03:53:35.360]  rely on them on the main systems until more people wake up and that's a
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:41.200]  reality of the situation we have to rely on parallel systems there'll be I'm
[03:53:41.200 --> 03:53:45.280]  seeing more and more people preparing for the food shortages preparing for the
[03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:50.960]  economic collapse you know precious metals food preparation long-term food
[03:53:50.960 --> 03:53:56.640]  storage dehydrating foods storing them in miler bags later on you can you can
[03:53:56.640 --> 03:54:01.080]  bring that out when food prices are too high or if your neighbors hungry these
[03:54:01.080 --> 03:54:06.680]  things are good things to be prepared for we're also seeing people you know
[03:54:06.680 --> 03:54:11.160]  talk about trading services parallel systems and communities are being built
[03:54:11.160 --> 03:54:15.640]  where people are trading services as well which is great this is how you build
[03:54:15.640 --> 03:54:19.560]  your local communities where you no longer have to depend on the globalist
[03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:24.800]  systems you can depend on those around you who you know you can trust they're
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:28.280]  not going to turn around the next time that there's a globalist lie and sell
[03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:34.000]  you out and you know send you dob you into the police because you didn't get
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:39.360]  a death shot there's going to be a mass exodus from big farmer and more and more
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:43.120]  people are starting to depend on alternative and I don't even want to
[03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:49.960]  use the word alternative just natural medicine and this is wonderful and I
[03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:53.360]  think that there are some you know pharmaceutical products that are great
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:57.200]  and have saved many lives but there are also ones outside of the system that
[03:54:57.200 --> 03:55:01.520]  have done that and so more and more people are taking to learning about
[03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:05.480]  natural remedies and ways that they can look after themselves and their families
[03:55:05.480 --> 03:55:10.000]  and protect themselves against the attacks on our health you know info
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:15.760]  wars has a great range of products and people are turning to natural remedies
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:20.240]  in their gardens even which is fantastic it's fantastic we will see more of that
[03:55:20.240 --> 03:55:25.520]  more self-sufficiency more off-grid living we're seeing that on the rise as
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:30.640]  well and that is great so many people are moving out to communities where they
[03:55:30.640 --> 03:55:34.080]  they have formed relationships with the people around them where they can share
[03:55:34.080 --> 03:55:40.600]  food they can share resources and that is what we need to do because I'm just
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:44.280]  going to be honest with you guys if we don't defeat them they will destroy
[03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:50.680]  everything that we know so we have to be ready to depend on one another so get
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:54.360]  in touch with local farmers local communities build those relationships
[03:55:54.360 --> 03:55:58.480]  now make them strong make them a fortress so that you can protect one another
[03:55:58.480 --> 03:56:03.840]  for the things that are coming ahead what we saw during COVID was child's play
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:07.440]  guys we have to be ready we have to be ready
[03:56:07.440 --> 03:56:11.800]  soldiers that know that they are in a war which we are in an information war
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:17.800]  have to be ready stronger communities people turning to other forms of
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:23.560]  communication trading bartering learning how to do that again you know the real
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:28.560]  value of things where you trade you barter not where some central bank
[03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:34.840]  determines what the value of your dollar coin is people are getting stronger in
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:39.120]  their religion and I saw Alex talk about this recently there's a clear divide
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:44.880]  happening and I agree with that people are either completely losing faith and
[03:56:44.880 --> 03:56:48.280]  depending on what the globalists tell them they should or they're depending
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:52.320]  more on God and they're depending more on Jesus Christ and this is wonderful and
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:59.360]  there are platforms being built for all of these alternative systems I think
[03:56:59.360 --> 03:57:03.760]  that I can see people getting stronger I can see people getting more resilient
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:07.680]  and doing all of these things we've just spoken about and I encourage people to
[03:57:07.680 --> 03:57:13.240]  continue to do so we have each other more will join us but the month for the
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:18.360]  most part those who are awake are really awake and that is a good thing they
[03:57:18.360 --> 03:57:21.840]  know that they are up against a globalist enemy they know that they're up
[03:57:21.840 --> 03:57:25.960]  against a satanic agenda and they are ready they are ready and they're getting
[03:57:25.960 --> 03:57:29.200]  more and more ready and I'm so grateful for that I wanted to get into the China
[03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:33.000]  News today I didn't get to go to my telegram it's all in there Z media I
