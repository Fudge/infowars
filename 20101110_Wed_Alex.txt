[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  but I do want to continue to hear from TSA victims they will go to the head of the
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  line I want to hear your eye witness accounts of what has happened to you I'd also like
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  to hear from callers about what's happening with the dollar and the economy and every major
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  finance minister in the world saying that this will cause a global depression we're
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.000]  going to be covering all of that today as well now I want to talk about the TSA because
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  this is a lot bigger than just what's happening at the airports number one the homeland security
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  admits they're setting the precedent for these quasi police minimum wage agents who
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  aren't real peace officers and who are federal violating the ninth and tenth amendment to
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  seize all infrastructure quote critical infrastructure power plants malls are listed train
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  stations bus stations highways and to have them march out on the streets of the country
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  with mobile x-ray vans it's all being deployed 18 wheeler trailers who can march three rows
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  of people through that was announced last year so a this is a huge federal power grab
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  be its dog training for the public on how to submit and see and it goes right through
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  z I mean I could make endless points on this they're lying they lied and said they weren't
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  saving the images they're saving them in courthouses and airports and everywhere else
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  they said that they couldn't see your genitals when in its own training manual it says you
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  need to be able to see the genitals to know that it's tuned right and so they've been
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  caught lying about that you've got all these TSA people going crazy planning drugs on
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  people demanding sex reportedly TSA workers caught being pedophiles with small children
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  TSA workers brutalizing handicapped people who can't walk they make them get up they
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  they make other travelers because you know they're gods and can't help you hold up old
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  people people who are paralyzed from the chest down the list that we're talking about here
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.000]  goes on and on and on now got something in my eye now we're gonna be covering that but
[10:47.000 --> 10:55.000]  but there's this issue of these people lying and lying and lying and lying and lying about
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  everything oh there's no radiation danger in the machines turns out it's 20 to 50 times
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  depending on which they have two different systems 20 to 50 times that they previously said
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  they've also been caught lying saying and this is put out on the official TSA website
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  yesterday and they responded to this big controversy this big national issue that we
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  basically started that the Drudge report pushed nationwide worldwide it's now hundreds and
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  hundreds of articles a day the airline unions the pilot unions the flight attendant unions
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  the airport worker unions that's the biggest issue here is this is a revolt against a key
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  globalist takeover is not just happening here in the US the exact same systems of control
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  under different names are being put in all over Europe and other areas and Europe Italy
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  has said they're taking the machines out British Airways doesn't want the machines
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  they say it's killing air travel that it doesn't protect people so magically the printer
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  cartridges get mailed out the week after all of that gets announced to try to you know
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  sell the fear again shirt off who ordered the machines two years ago right before
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  Obama came into office the head of Homeland Security is the CEO of the of the biggest
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  company making billions of dollars a year off of this he also previously consulted for
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  the other company there's two main companies are putting out two different systems they
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  are going in nationwide but this is now a big national international news story and
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  everybody is going wow I felt like I was alone being groped I felt isolated you mean
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  people don't like this I'm not the only one people are angry so it's giving people the
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  courage to speak up and to say no we are very close to being able to expose the naked
[12:49.000 --> 12:56.000]  body scanners the groping the federalization indoctrination program and so the fight is
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  joined and the feds and the globalist may mail out more dud bombs they may activate
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  more people under and we're all a lucky under direct Pentagon command they may launch
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  more fake al-qaeda attacks but all of this is segue into a debate about how terror is
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  fake even if you believe that this supposed terror is real why can illegal aliens according
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  to mainstream news march it anywhere in the U.S. and go rent any aircraft they want and
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  the TSA just waves all security checks see they're not meant to get in the way of big
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  companies commerce that it's just there to train you and to have this federal power grab
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  the borders are wide open hundreds of boats a month are coming up on the California
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  San Diego shore with Chinese immigrants Mexican immigrants you name it just pouring
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  over they're not dispatching any feds no security no police but then they
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  new radically obsessed over these airlines we've got 28 to 29,000 dead in the last year
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  or two on the U.S. Mexican border it is descended into hell higher death rates per
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  year than at the height of the Vietnam war but all of that's not a problem they ignore
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  that and then hyperventilate over oh my gosh al-qaeda wants to sew bombs and women's
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  breast so we've got to have chest x-rays oh my gosh al-qaeda wants to sew bombs and
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  dogs so we're not going to let dogs fly now even in cargo they're talking about no
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  more printer cartridges you can't mail printer cartridges you're al-qaeda the
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  government's got to tear into your packages they've got to x-ray all your packages
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  don't worry churros got bigger x-ray systems to sell you they reported in New York
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  state just a few months ago over 2000 arrest with the National Guard out with
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  high-powered mobile x-ray systems driving people's families under them on the highway
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  radiating them radiating the troops I mean this is a big takeover the power the
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  control the domination the hundreds of billions that'll be made in total in the
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  next decade if they get these on all the state and federal courthouses in all the
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  malls and now we're confirming many public schools are ordering them they're
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  going in the mobile trucks you drive through I mean this is checkpoint Charlie
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  this is America being East Berlin this is the complete and total takeover but the
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  good news is we're now forcing a debate about this and as Paul Watson writes
[15:29.000 --> 15:39.000]  today for many many years going right back to late 2001 right from 9-11 they
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  have groped women made old people take down their pants I've got a bunch of
[15:44.000 --> 15:54.000]  mainstream news articles dealing with that today they have been making people
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  take their pants off women raise their dresses up and they would always deny
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  this though I've been in the airport and seen it you've been in the airport and
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  have seen it so they're also a pack of liars they're a pack of liars and any
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  TSA agent that has a problem with this they're just fired so they're creating
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  this giant army of mindless power tripping goons some of them are good
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  people who just want a job but still they're going along with something that's
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.000]  wrong and a lot of them are perverts and control freaks and people on power
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  trips but it's all coming out now and people are speaking out and sexual
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  assault victims are talking about how particularly traumatizing this is for
[16:39.000 --> 16:47.000]  them but I also saw in comments and in TSA press releases and in media reports
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  folks attacking yours truly when I've talked about all the people that have
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  been killed or beaten in the US in Canada in England by the TSA goons they
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  have their counterparts in England and Canada and in Europe and so I thought
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  just briefly go back over some of this this is CTV the big television network
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  in Canada man who died in the airport likely asked for help he'd been stuck
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  for more than a day in an area without a bathroom without food he couldn't speak
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  English and he began yelling and so they attacked him tasered him and jumped on
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  his head and he died man who died in the airport likely asking for help says
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  mother and it describes how the RCMP used tasers to subdued him and then
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  there's video of it jumped on his head with their knees and he died and they
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  said the taser didn't kill him and we didn't kill him we're not saving the
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  naked images we're not groping you and when they kill you they didn't kill you
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  that's Canada here's another one woman who died in airport was rehab bound
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  lawyer mom handcuffed attained at Phoenix airport was on her way to alcohol rehab
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  program a woman who died for being handcuffed and detained at the Phoenix
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  airport was underway to an alcohol rehabilitation program in Tucson her family
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  lawyer said Carol and got bomb 45 became my right Friday when she was late for a
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  flight and a gate crew didn't let her on the plane officers handcuffed her
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  back and took her to a holding room where she kept screaming authorities said
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  authorities not servants authorities got bomb was wrestled to the ground as she
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  fought back report CBS news correspondent kind of like the guy in handcuffs
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  fought back they said but then we got the video at the dart platform and in

[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  and meanwhile what does the TSA say on their official website as of last night
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  TSA there's no fondling or groping or squeezing that's taking place at
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  airports that's perception management lying but see it doesn't work once you
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  know the government and the dominant media are lying once you understand that
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  the trick doesn't work it's kind of like somebody you've done business with
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  who's cheated you four or five times you just stopped doing business with them I
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  stopped the first time and I used to be a lot nicer guy first time somebody
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  messes with me in any way doesn't do exactly what they said I'm done with
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  them and the same way with government it's the same way with neighbors it's the
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  same way with yuppies at a soccer game with your kids of their acting uppity
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  and snobbish I don't even talk to him who cares I don't sit there and care
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  me we've got to get more hard-nosed in this society and stop being so
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  domesticated but again TSA just keep lying and saying you don't record and
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  save the images I mean how many TSA workers have gotten in fist fights or
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  been fired or how many women have filed lawsuits when they're going baby I love
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  those gigantic I'm not going to say it that's a quote or hey look how little
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  your and then the guy punches him in the nose I mean they're sitting there
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  making fun of everyone I can't tell you how many times and it seems it's the
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  spirit of airport to airport it's the same basic molestation but some of them
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  are quote more professional and solemn and look embarrassed about it but then
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  you go to certain airports and it is like a party I mean they're laughing in
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  between screaming and yelling and shouting at people and you know women
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  having their dresses held up I mean I've seen this I've seen them stick their
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  hands in baby carriages they get the baby out and then they run their hand up
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  between the baby's legs and squeeze and it's being described all over the media
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  as reporters are going yeah it's happened to me they almost lifted me up
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  they put their hand between my legs they grabbed my breast this is all coming
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  out as people start standing up and telling their stories now TSA two weeks
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  ago announced we're going to have enhanced pat downs if they were already going on
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  but now they're expanding under every airport and yes we're going to touch
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  your genitals yes we're going to touch your breast but it's for your own good
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  now they go oh we never said that we're not doing this TSA no fondling
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  groping or squeezing is taking place at airports hmm kind of like they said for
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  years that I was a kook and others were that Obama's real name wasn't Barry
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  Sotero that he didn't give up his citizenship that he didn't go pray at
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  mosque now the news yesterday's like he really is a Muslim and his name's Barry
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  Sotero mainstream news it's just oh but what's wrong with that well not bad that
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  he's a Muslim but the fact that he lied about it despite multiple reports of TSA
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  agents groping molesting and sexually assaulting passengers and killing him I
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  would add in a nationwide epidemic of abuse a TSA.gov website claims there
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  are no instances of groping or ever squeezing according at all and the TSA
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  agents are quote completely professional in their duties the denial appears on
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.000]  the TSA.gov website an official transportation security administration
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  clearinghouse for news about the TSA and airport security after being asked a
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  question of the TSA website responded and said there is no fondling squeezing
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  groping or any sort of sexual assault taking place at the airport you have a
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  professional workforce that's kind of like Nazis were professional remember
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  Bush would talk about waterboarding and go it's so professional oh they're so
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  professional you have a professional workforce carrying out procedures that
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  we were trained to perform to keep aviation security safe but she give the
[28:38.000 --> 28:46.000]  illegal aliens a pass to rent aircraft ABC News this claim is of course a
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  flagrant lie designed to quell the massive backlash against invasive new
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  airport security measures which is being led by numerous problem prominent travel
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  and pilots association including the head of British Airways the new TSA pat down
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  measures introduced at the end of last month for people who refused the
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  dangerous naked body scan involved TSA agents using the front of their hands
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  and literally cupping and squeezing women's breast and men's private parts
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  and women's private parts as USA Today reported last week quote the searches
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  require screeners to touch passengers breast and genitals that's from the TSA
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  USA Today so see they try to sell you on yes we're gonna grop you oh you don't
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  like it we're not doing that remember when they thought you were scared for 9
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  11 and they said yeah we're torturing people on the news and then later when
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  they got in trouble they said we never said that and now Bush is back saying you
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  bet I ordered torture well then why are all those people you ordered to torture
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  in prison all right we're gonna come back give out the phone number get into the
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  economic news and a lot more but the TSA is in deep trouble we're on the March

[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  up defending yourself and then get into the Cointel probe by responding that's
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  why we don't respond to the lies and disinformation as the establishment at
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  the highest levels of national media think tanks foundations fake alternative
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  media literally swing every gun they've got and fire on us and what does it do
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  it makes us bigger because the globalists are smart but they're not
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  gods and they're not invincible bill clinton every state he went in campaign
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.000]  for the candidates lost in most cases they'd be neck and neck or or or the
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  republican to be five points ahead bill clinton would come to town the person
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.000]  would suddenly get a 15-point lead a 14-point lead a 12-point lead but still
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  bill clinton came to town still they got him up there in speeches with jack
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  conway they think they're invincible they've been winning so long they don't
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  know they're getting their butts kicked right now now it's a big number since
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  he does for five months ago and said a humanity is awake and staring and
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  recognizes the puppet masters not the puppets now the whole discussion of
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  puppet on the left puppet on the right wake there's one guy controlling both
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.000]  puppets that is now mainstream people are really starting to have a paradigm
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  shift and a big awakening and yeah they'll be shills and they'll be fake
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  tea party people and it doesn't matter real issues are now on the table and
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  they're not going away I mean Rick Perry you know talking about secession in the
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  new world order and Ponzi schemes in the Federal Reserve I've got him in the
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.000]  San Antonio Express news today he helped pass four new systems of taxes in
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  Texas he's four NAFTA and get for them for the NAFTA superhighways four
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  forced Gardasil shots the guy is a nightmare but to win he had to take on
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  the political coloration of a patriot but when he doesn't deliver on that he's
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  in deep trouble and now they can't make fun of us when we talk about real issues
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  because the Republicans have been forced to act like patriots you realize
[39:11.000 --> 39:19.000]  what a key psychological mass capitulation victory this is the system
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  is capitulating for decades they made fun of people that talked about world
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  government of the private Fed they told people on neocontoc radio just five
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  years ago that the Fed wasn't private and the Fed was good now they don't do
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  that more and more you watch the banking committee hearings in the House and
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  Senate and it's like watching the Alex Jones show what the congressmen and
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  senators are talking about whether they're really good or whether they're
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  really bad it doesn't matter because now they're forced to camouflage
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  themselves some are good some are bad it gives other people in government and
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  media courage to come out and join us folks can see the momentum and then the
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  wolves and sheeps clothing will be identified faster and faster now this
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  is a key juncture right now the world government's coming down like a ton
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  of bricks on us they're bankrupting the nation they're doing all these
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  horrible things but the people are now recognizing who the true authors of
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  our great troubles are that is what is so amazing and dynamic about what we're
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  seeing history is being made we're not winning the fight but we're starting to
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  win we were losing in the first rounds now we're in around six seven eight we
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  are starting to hurt them badly for decades when top scientists came out and
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  said bisfree and all a and most plastics was sterilizing and hurting people
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  and causing cancer the media made fun of it now they're taking it out of
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  plastic all over the world they made fun of fluoride now there's massive resistance
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  to that they're pulling it out all over the place they made fun of us decades
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  ago warning you about deadly vaccines now people just read the insert and
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  read about brain disorders and sterilization and cancer record low
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.000]  numbers of people in modern history taking the stinking shots the globalist
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  will probably launch a bio attack to make us be scared and go out and take
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  them down the road but but still at least we're fighting back I mean we know
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  that if we get in a fetal position and curl up they're gonna kick our hind in
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  politically spiritually psychologically economically all we can do is just
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  realize we're our backs against a wall societally and we don't have a choice
[41:35.000 --> 41:43.000]  we got to go 110% and I liken it to all the confirmed police reports going back
[41:43.000 --> 41:50.000]  over a hundred years of a wagon tumps over full of grain in one case on to a
[41:50.000 --> 41:56.000]  two-year-old girl and the men are all standing around while the baby's screaming
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.000]  and can't get it off the baby and and the mother just goes crazy and lifts the
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  entire thing off or the cases of women lifting cars off of children it's the
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  same thing your your brain has a governor just like a high-powered race car
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.000]  it I mean I mean it could give you two thousand rpms three thousand four of your
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  seven thousand whatever the rpms are I forget how the the whole gauge of rpms
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  but but it's got a governor blocking the rpms so you don't blow your engine
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  well these are the times to blow your engine folks these are the times to take
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  the governor off and slam the pedal down 110% it's time to lift the car off the
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  baby okay and when men and women can do things like that that's why the top
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  power lifters they actually put them under hypnosis now because they found
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  they can trick their brain to to to to turn off the governor that blocks them
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.000]  for being able to you know squat 1400 pounds or bench press 700 pounds or
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  whatever the case is I'm having one of those moments where I forget the rpm
[43:05.000 --> 43:16.000]  gauge rpm gauge want to look at rpms yeah so I guess most cars it goes up to 8000
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.000]  rpms and I've read and I know much about engines you can correct me if I'm wrong
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  but you know they they could potentially you know take the governor off had the
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  thing go up to 20,000 rpms which are going to blow your engine well so so
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.000]  that's my crude parallel or parable or analogy for what's happening and for
[43:34.000 --> 43:46.000]  what's going on with what's developing societally if you decide to get angry
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  your town every day can be covered with flyers with info wars dot com prison
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  planet dot com or whatever news site you like or whatever political message you
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  want and it will change the entire direction of what the town's talking
[43:59.000 --> 44:05.000]  about your truth will cut through all the local news all the local radio all the
[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  local dog show flyers or or garage cell flyers your patriot website will cut
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  through all of the mindless celebrity tripe your local newsletter because it
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  has truth in it will have a greater effect than all of the king's horses and
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  all the king's men all the propaganda your information that you call into a
[44:28.000 --> 44:33.000]  talk radio show with may change the entire direction of the discussion as
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  more people call in the cowardly talk show host will begin to agree with your
[44:38.000 --> 44:43.000]  political views because now they feel safe to do it see the the final
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  illusion the final lie to drop is that we who want liberty and freedom are the
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  minority we are the majority but we're not connecting with each other and
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.000]  that's why when the dredge report now for six days straight is linking to info
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com to hard core proof of the tsa beating
[45:08.000 --> 45:14.000]  people killing people molesting people planning drugs on people robbing people
[45:14.000 --> 45:22.000]  expanding out nationwide to the streets the victim testimonies people coming
[45:22.000 --> 45:31.000]  forward it's a revolt point and it shows us the power of revolt it shows us the
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  power of peacefully saying not just no but absolutely unequivocally no no no
[45:38.000 --> 45:44.000]  no no no don't tell me it's for al-qaeda when the borders are wide open and
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.000]  legal aliens can walk in and rent any aircraft they want source ABC news don't
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  tell me that one and we're all a lucky the head of al-qaeda secretly hanging out
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  at the Pentagon source AP Fox News don't tell me this anymore don't tell me
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  tortures good don't tell me du's good for the troops that's another rant I'm
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  gonna do tomorrow because I want to write some notes up on it really think
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  about it I'm even cut a YouTube video tonight veterans days tomorrow and I'm
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  supposed to wear an American flag tie and talk about how much I love the troops
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  and how good you are and how heroic you are but then not defend you don't talk
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  about Obama openly wanting to take your medical benefits and make you buy your
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  own insurance don't talk about that no supporting the troops means feeding them
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  into a meat grinder don't talk about troops dying from DU exposure when the
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  army's own top scientist admit it's deadly poison depleted uranium don't talk
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  about prudential another insurance company signing a deal 11 years ago to take
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  all the death benefits through fraud from six million dead and dying World War
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  two vets right through to current vets just just just just let them take their
[46:55.000 --> 47:01.000]  money that they paid into from their widows and widowers let the troops be
[47:01.000 --> 47:10.000]  used as guinea pigs for for anthrax shots and other experimental vaccines that
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  admittedly have killed them and maimed them in mass like the smallpox causes
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  an immune response in the brain and the heart with a smallpox some reporters
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  died over in iraq being given those yeah don't actually really support the troops
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  and say hey they shouldn't be in these criminal wars Anthony Schaefer colonel
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  Schaefer says they should all pull out and it's all fraud and creates terrorists
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.000]  but no he actually has been over there as a commander so let's not listen to him
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.000]  no I'm supposed to I'm supposed to buy phone cards for the troops so they can
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  I mean why isn't the government with Skype internet providing free phone
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  calls I mean I could go to Afghanistan right now dial into Skype and sit there
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  and make phone calls 24 hours a day for free it's all baloney it's all petty
[47:56.000 --> 48:05.000]  ways so you can feel like you're involved in charity you can feel like
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  you're supporting the troops when you aren't really supporting them and I'm
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  not saying you're bad if your radio station or whatever buys phone cards for
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  the troops that's great the point is is that it is that the system promotes
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  these little ceremonial things instead of really supporting the troops and
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  getting them out of these fraudulent wars our country's bankrupt we can't pay
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  for it's one of the biggest parts of the budget it's a black hole of corruption
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  these mercenaries that get paid on average 180 grand a year when the troops
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  are getting paid on average about 30,000 a year these mercenaries I've got a
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  license to kill and commit crime the Marines just got caught selling guns
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  to street gangs in the US Navy Seals now been arrested trying to sell
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  hand grenades and weapons to Mexican drug cartels then the government uses
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  that trying to restrict our second amendment when these aren't things you
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  buy at the local store fully auto and hand grenades and rocket launchers
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  again I mean do you really support the troops I mean I mean do you hear Rush
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  Limbaugh reading out a Bloomberg and AP where six million veterans when they
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  die their wife gets the notice by the way we did a deal we're keeping all your

[54:24.000 --> 54:27.600]  think about it they want to give you petty ways to supposedly support the
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.600]  troops when you support them by not letting them be used as guinea pigs with
[54:32.600 --> 54:37.600]  du and all these vaccines you support them by not letting veterans affairs
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.600]  signed secret deal 11 years ago to steal their death benefits you support them by
[54:42.600 --> 54:45.600]  getting them out of these illegal wars but see this is a way for everybody to
[54:45.600 --> 54:49.600]  feel good and make sure you don't actually do something real for the
[54:49.600 --> 54:53.600]  veterans who homeland security admits is the number one enemy in this country
[54:53.600 --> 54:57.600]  because we have terrorists running the country so of course they hate the
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.600]  military of course they hate libertarians and conservatives I mean but it's so
[55:02.600 --> 55:06.600]  brazen it's so naked it's so out in the open that a lot of people miss it because
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.600]  it's hidden in plain view now I want to get into the incredible developments on
[55:10.600 --> 55:14.600]  the economic front Barack Obama says we must embrace globalism and the emerging
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.600]  world economy globalism has really been good for us hadn't it Chinese credit
[55:18.600 --> 55:24.600]  raider downgrades u.s. Wall Street Journal analysis German tempers fray as
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.600]  u.s. policy Gulf widens they call it undiplomatic the way they call the u.s.
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.600]  clueless the again it isn't the u.s. it's the foreign banks that run this
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.600]  country and they're so calling it undiplomatic well printing is going to
[55:37.600 --> 55:40.600]  be well over a trillion not 600 billion they now admit a trillion dollars and
[55:40.600 --> 55:47.600]  devaluing of that's that's not diplomatic we've got China maybe bigger

[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.600]  do they have the right to do this and the agent the tsa agent said yes they do
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.600]  have the right to do this they can do it they need to so i called my senator
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.600]  senator bennett and the lady on the phone she's like if you have a problem with
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.600]  this you need to write a letter to the tsa or homeland security so then i called

[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.600]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only

[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.600]  holding it on the air I'm fired up man we're breaking through we're having
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.600]  victories we beat the Copenhagen Treaty well you know we're getting the
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.600]  best we all lay out of the ball out of the plastic we're having victories
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.600]  it sounds like a plan you know baby steps baby steps you know
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.600]  well I wanted to talk to you about he didn't see that you had posted up on
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.600]  info wars did you see the thing about the FCC voting on November 30th to control
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.600]  the internet I know for years they've been saying they want to take over the
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.600]  internet and start restricting speech and we've had a bunch of the czars
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.600]  including the FCC diversity czar say they want Hugo Chavez, Venezuela in
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.600]  control and praising Mao Zedong you can't make that up I mean it's just too
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600]  insane and don't believe me folks just search czar's praise Mao or
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.600]  diversity czar praises Chavez censorship you'll see the video at FCC
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:37.600]  panels but no I'll search that term FCC what's the headline it's a big
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:44.600]  government dot com and it was November 30th your phone's really really kind
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.600]  of watery there Tim okay so it's just FCC will decide on controlling internet
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.600]  right right we'll look it up Tim I appreciate your call great points and
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.600]  again you've got a lot of government operatives but also camp followers
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.600]  because the government created a cult of hating me it's actually only helped
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.600]  us get the word out because any attention is good these days and so
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.600]  they're just very very upset in fact we may have to fire up my phone system
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.600]  because it's easier to control from here if we have this type of thing going
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.600]  on and that guy said he disagreed to get on air first so he could then do that
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.600]  to distract you because you imagine how upset the system is right now that
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.600]  that we're breaking through nationally on so many issues on the vaccines on
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.600]  the best phenol a on the fluoride on the carbon taxes on the greenhouse gas
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.600]  tax hoax of the Copenhagen they are in trouble Obama it's now all over the
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.600]  news that his real name is Barry Sotaro and that he's a Muslim I mean it
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.600]  just everything is coming out that they're a pack of liars and people are
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600]  upset and I want to thank the people attacking us you really give me energy
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.600]  one of the few things gets me up in the morning is defending against scum
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.600]  let's take another prank caller if they are Thomas in Oklahoma you're on the
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.600]  air go ahead hi Alex no I'm not a prank caller but just thank you for
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.600]  everything you do I had a couple of things I just wanted to go to the info
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.600]  warriors and you've covered it you've been mentioned it today about calling
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.600]  into other talk shows on Saturdays I listened to several programs and I
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.600]  attended 2,500 plus Baptist church here in Oklahoma and I can't get anybody
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.600]  to wake up they're all you know bushbox I would call them and they listen to
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.600]  people like Richard Land Phyllis Schlafly which they're good people but they
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.600]  don't address the issues what's really going on so I just want to call out
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  everybody I've got another point also but I just want to call out to the info
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.600]  warriors to pay attention to these Saturday programs I think Richard Land
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:44.600]  on it you've got Richard Land live and Phyllis Schlafly's got a program but you
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.600]  can look it up when they're on but call into these people and be polite and
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.600]  educated and that they have guests on all the time that talk about that you
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.600]  talk about they talk about them from a neocon point of view and you know Jesus
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.600]  is coming soon they said I'll pay attention anyway but but just just calling
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.600]  intelligently I was able to get in one time and and if you just you know are
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.600]  polite and kind they'll they'll let you absolutely and then we force them to
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.600]  cover real issues but I would go after the really big shows but I wouldn't
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.600]  stop there start uploading YouTube videos of yourself talking about issues
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.600]  everybody needs to get involved in every social media format there is where you
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.600]  can reach a lot of people and start talking about these issues don't just
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.600]  send me emails and say Alex we're so glad you're there we're glad somebody's
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.600]  doing this no this is all of us together saying collectively no to tyranny
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.600]  good points there Thomas Ben in Texas you're on the year
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.600]  Alex yes sir can you hear me yes I can I had some thoughts on the naked body
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:52.600]  scanners that actually kind of I don't travel a whole lot but I was kind of
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.600]  worried about if I were to travel with my wife were to travel the effects that
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.600]  they would have on my family well I mean don't believe me just type in naked
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:08.600]  body scanners or or or body imagers airport scanners cancer and you'll
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.600]  get LA Times New York Times Washington Post Associated Press the Daily Mail
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:19.600]  with top scientists all saying it's deadly right and I think the I guess
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.600]  what they're doing instead of those and groping and that thing is also supposed
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.600]  to scare us away from flying and since I don't travel much I can't really do
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.600]  much about it well there is something to the feds wanting to bankrupt
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.600]  transportation and then reorganize it and take control of it and that's also
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.600]  what's going on here yeah I mean this country is going into depression and
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.600]  the last five years you can pull up the numbers tourism is down over a third
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.600]  and people cite that this country is a police state it has nothing to do with
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.600]  fighting terror yeah well I think what we should do if people who fly
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.600]  normally I think we do have to stand up I heard a lot of interesting calls on
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:03.600]  Monday and a couple said they they just said you will not touch me I was
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.600]  molested or whatever you need I don't even think we have to do that if we
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.600]  just stand up and say no you have no right to even touch my body and you
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.600]  have no right to force me to go through this that's right and if they yell at
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.600]  you and if they yell at you you say you don't talk to me like that don't get
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.600]  angry say you don't talk to me like I'm a slave good points I appreciate your

[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:44.600]  with even more this is a process of breaking our will the economy is coming
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.600]  up but I want to continue with your phone calls on issues across the board
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.600]  Fred in Ohio you're on the air welcome
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:59.600]  thank you Alex and I want to say that to all your listeners to start calling the
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.600]  new congressman and calling for the impeachment of Obama's tutorial both
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:09.600]  on his best certificate and on the fact that he holds two jobs ahead of the
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.600]  UN Security Council and then go after Biden and the US Supreme Court
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.600]  Justice for aiding and embedding and I have already started calling my new
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  congressman and look you know this movement is gaining steam they're
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.600]  already talking about congressional investigations of Barry Sataro aka
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.600]  Barack Obama and if we don't stand to see they're afraid of us standing up
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.600]  and then having victories because then we learn how much power we have and then
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.600]  we start standing up and taking action on every front they want us to feel
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:45.600]  desperate and weak but we're not desperate and weak okay we are getting
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  into a desperate situation that's why folks are finally starting to fight back
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.600]  and they're finding out they have power you notice the TSA doesn't come out
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.600]  and defend the naked body scanners or defend the groping they say oh we're
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.600]  not recording your body oh we're not groping then they're caught in a lie
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.600]  then they lose any moral high ground they had I mean we are just hurting the
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.600]  globalist bad and I just want to say folks think of the risk I'm taking I fly
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  these people kill folks sometimes they could take me behind closed doors and
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.600]  murder me if they murder me I'm not gonna resist them if I fly in TSA or cops
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.600]  on their payroll ever kill me behind closed doors as they do a lot of people
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.600]  I did not fight back they murdered me but again we cannot be afraid of these
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.600]  people I'm out here openly taking on Homeland Security's key program of
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.600]  domestication of the American people teaching us that we are the terrorists
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  they are taking the internalization that we're terrorists that they're
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.600]  training the police and feds with through the Mayak at Homeland Security
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.600]  reports and they're now externalizing it and teaching us that we're the
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.600]  terrorists and we are here at the tip of the spear blasting through their lies
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.600]  and if they strike me down it will only make the message that much more powerful
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.600]  anything else Fred? Yes and on this all these congressmen that voted for HR
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:11.600]  3534 to give away all of our water to the UN they should be impeached along
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:18.600]  with HR 1430 feet which is another land grab that takes land from Niagara Falls
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.600]  West Virginia to Virginia Illinois and Alabama we've got to stop it all and
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.600]  they're trying to hand over all the navigable waterways that's even little
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.600]  streams to the UN right now that bills very close to passing they are in
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  top I mean literally large sectors of our infrastructure is being handed over to
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.600]  foreigners everywhere the globalist again they say it's America against China
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:46.600]  no it's not the banks moved to China they set China up now the world is blaming
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.600]  the United States for the financial collapse but we were just one base of
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.600]  operation the whole world is now preparing as I said they would many years ago
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.600]  to scapegoat us for the world depression and now what's happening which means
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  we're getting very close to it right now Fred? Yes and one more thing real fast
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:10.600]  and World War II we built up like it was overnight and we could actually do the
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.600]  same thing again with an American president absolutely if we didn't have
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.600]  foreign private banks that want to destroy the economy so they can buy it all up
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.600]  for pennies on the dollar they want to put us into repossession we are into
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.600]  repossession right now they are now it's the number one news story all over
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.600]  talk radio print and television that it's America's fault and the Chinese
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.600]  ministers the German ministers the French ministers the Brazilian
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:46.600]  ministers all of I mean literally all of them are blaming us for the global
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.600]  derivatives crisis they're blaming the people for everything that's happened
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.600]  when the globalists set this thing up worldwide moved everything to China
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  gave them the Panama Canal gave them Long Beach I mean this has been a
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.600]  strategic plan and how many years have I said listeners that when they get
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  ready for the full collapse they're going to blame the United States for it
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  what are you now seeing I mean this is a and they're openly saying the UN wants
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.600]  to tax the US and quote control our Federal Reserve it's not our Federal Reserve
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.600]  the Federal Reserve is already setting up the world government now they act like
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.600]  they're getting in trouble and oh the IMF World Bank UN's going to take us over
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.600]  as if they're the solution to our bad behavior when the Federal Reserve is
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:35.600]  the foreign takeover of our country we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.600]  broke down how this financial master plan takeover is going to take place I
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:05.600]  want to briefly encapsulate it when we start the third hour coming up here in
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.600]  about 30 minutes I'm going to continue with your phone calls start getting
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:15.600]  into the financial news hearing about 15 minutes into the third hour today but
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.600]  we are at the critical juncture I cannot stress to you and obviously you
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:26.600]  already can see this how important this information is all of it I mean I'm
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:30.600]  not risking my life for nothing if I didn't know that we could beat the
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.600]  globalist or at least stall their program and by time I wouldn't be here
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:40.600]  okay I mean I'd be you know working on a farm or a ranch or oil painting or
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.600]  something that's what I really like to do this is stressful it's hard every day
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.600]  I come in here and it's just sickening to have to go over the news but it's
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:54.600]  like lancing a boil or setting a broken leg it's painful but it's got to be
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.600]  done and it's also exhilarating to see the success we're having together I want
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:04.600]  to briefly bring up Paul Watson Watson you're doing an exemplary job so it's
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.600]  Kurt Nemo and Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes we are now six days into drudge
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:15.600]  every day top linking our stories we have to salute drudge but because you
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.600]  don't see any other big national media figure leading the charge with our
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.600]  hardcore info I mean he's kind of like the big howitzer cannon and we're the
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:31.600]  we're the the Sabo round you know that they're cramming into the breach there
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.600]  and to have drudge firing info wars.com and prisonplanet.com weapons at the
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.600]  New World Order is a big deal and we know why drudge hates being searched at
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.600]  the airport who doesn't we're all in this together the New World Order is going
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.600]  to hurt all of us and it's going to hurt us with dollar devaluation it's going
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.600]  to hurt us with vaccines it's going to hurt us with GMO crops it's going to
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  hurt us with these wars bankrupting us it's wrong and we're all in this
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.600]  together who did Rothkopf the head of the Kissinger group and then in the
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.600]  Washington Post say runs the world six thousand people are less and most of
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  them are compartmentalized this system isn't good for anybody even the
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.600]  globalists but they're so megalomaniacal they're on such power trips they
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.600]  can't help their wicked nature now Watson I think we need a story whether it's
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.600]  Steve or or you or whoever wants to do it we need a story the lies of the TSA
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:32.600]  you know the lies and abuse of the TSA and and and point out that they've
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.600]  lied I mean you can think of a bunch of lies I won't even think of because
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.600]  there's so many they lie about people dying in their custody and other similar
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.600]  TSA systems in Canada and England they lie about the radiation danger they
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.600]  lie about saving the images they lie about the groping they lie about the
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.600]  fact and I even have CBS News admitting that they never stopped one terrorist
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:00.600]  and then tie into that the illegal say TSA approved flight training and how
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.600]  our borders are wide open and how none of this has to do with security I think
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  a headline I don't know what's your idea Watson this is what we do in the
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.600]  morning every day anyway I like to do it on air sometimes total transparency
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.600]  here in the transmission what's a good headline to really crystallize and
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.600]  boil down you know TSA's culture of lies exposed or why it's important that
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.600]  the TSA are liars and don't protect you Watson what do you think that
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.600]  headline should be I'll normally write the article first and then create the
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.600]  headline but TSA's culture of lying here something like that and then you
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:43.600]  know the other secret article I want you to write in the morning about TSA and
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  I'll have to meet with you later on the phone to go over that but just briefly
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  before I go back to calls I mean I'm sure you're listening to show today do
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  you agree with me that this is a major breakthrough and it shows the underlying
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.600]  rage and anger at the hands of these federal abusers that are that are
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.600]  literally taking over our society as a beachhead of federal tyranny I mean I
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.600]  mean you don't even want to come to the US now because of what you go through
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.600]  the same things going in in England break it down Watson what's your view on
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:17.600]  how important this breakout of information is well it's like the canary in
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:23.600]  the coal mine because as soon as we started focusing on this intently and
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  then drudge picked it up around with it literally every day there are new cases
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.600]  of TSA abuse pouring forth and in fact just in the last half an hour or so drudge
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.600]  is linked to another one involving again an attractive young woman who was who
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:45.600]  opted out of the naked body scanner on the grounds that it increases your
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.600]  risk of getting cancer as the University of Columbia and the chief radiation
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:56.600]  global radiation body have now said and she merely asked the TSA agents what
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  they were going to do with her and their response was to completely flip out
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.600]  handcuff her to a chair rip up a flight ticket and call in 12 Miami cops who
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.600]  then escorted her out of the airport and this is a story that's gone up on
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:18.600]  YouTube just today which drudge is linked to so it's caused this wave of new
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.600]  examples of TSA abuse people more confident to speak out and again she's
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  a genesis again she's a genesis talk show host on free talk live where is the
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.600]  resistance it's coming from this radio network now with all the shows combined
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.600]  over 500 I think Ted told me last night 506 affiliates I mean and the bigger
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.600]  issue here is that's why they want to start censoring the internet and talk
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  radio and alternative news because we're giving a voice to the people and
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.600]  showing that almost no one is buying into this and it's creating a huge
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.600]  political movement against this that is a centerpiece of the globalist
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.600]  takeover and how for the most prominent travel and pilots associations in the
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.600]  world are coming out and saying the same thing you have the the express yeah
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  airlines pilot Michael Roberts who refused to be broke he was the friend
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.600]  that he fired from his job and so you've got extremely prominent people now
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.600]  coming out as part of this back class but what are they going to do when more
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  of the pilots say no and the stewardess a flight attendant union going public and
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  the head of British Airways are the globalist going to mail a few more and
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.600]  more all the locky CIA lackey cartridges that ain't going to get it done
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.600]  Paul some people speculate that this mysterious mistyle was about bringing
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.600]  down an airliner so don't be fooled into thinking they won't try anything like
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  that because they've done it on repeated occasions in the past because if they
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  win at the airports they can do this everywhere and they've announced they
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  are this is the key parapet in the fight for the republic they are coming up
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.600]  over the parapet people have finally learned to start fighting back and guess
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  what we're starting to have victory well that's right I mean as you said
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  before the US has lost about a third of its income in tourism since 911
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.600]  there was a major study in 2006 because people just refusing to go there
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:23.600]  it's not only the TSA officials even if you get past them you know unscathed
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:29.600]  then you're faced with homeland security last time we went to Austin there was
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.600]  this Mexican you know Spanish-American homeland security guy who we could barely
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.600]  understand just barking orders as an interrogating if you don't know the
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.600]  phone the exact phone number the exact address of your hotel all this
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:49.600]  information they just turn you away so it's several layers of the tyranny
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:53.600]  meanwhile as he said they just let illegals the TSA just clears them to
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.600]  hire that guy was probably an illegal and it illegals build the border fence
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.600]  exactly in fact that's actually oh that's another point I forgot there have been
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  a bunch of cases going back nine years of TSA being illegals oh that's a key
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.600]  report illegal aliens search Americans oh that's an even better one Watson that
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.600]  will really illustrate all this there was a big scandal in the UK a couple years
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.600]  ago about how the fact that the people who handle all the cargo security at UK
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  airport they're all illegal aliens you know the reason example with the planes
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.600]  in you know East Midlands Airport this supposed ink toner package and all the
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:37.600]  people handling all that security are illegal aliens so you know up is down
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.600]  black is white well that's because there's a lot of animosity in Europe and
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  the US against illegal aliens because they get special treatment or welfare
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  they keep their own culture of the government loves that I've had members
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:54.600]  of parliament on admitting that over half of the CPS people are foreigners
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  because they'll steal and they hate Brits and they love taking kids I mean they
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  bring in foreigners to rule as Paul I mean you go down to St. Pancras
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  international law basically any of the London airports and it's all foreigners
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.600]  running all the security I mean it seems to be a case discrimination because
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.600]  you know most of them are foreigners don't know if they're illegal or not but
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  it seems to attract to that kind of person and then you've got these CSA agents
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.600]  who are just you know the worst kind of humans come you can imagine that they
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.600]  get to run this system which makes complete sense when you know what it's
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:38.600]  all geared towards which is complete degradation and humiliation of the
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  weakest people in the human race you know the elderly disabled people women and
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:49.600]  children that's who they target most and Paul it's key in their propaganda that
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.600]  we call them officials authorities that we worship them that we appreciate them
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  and thank you for naked body scanning me with radiation thank you for fondling
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.600]  my two-year-old that's what they need but now as everybody just says you know
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.600]  what we see through your fake terror what you're doing is wrong the borders are
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  wide open you're a bunch of scum it's going to make their system fall apart
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.600]  and no amount of globalist putting ink toner bombs on planes is going to let
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  little shirty little shirt off the devil that's what it means in Russia get what
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:28.600]  he wants well that's right I mean people need to file lawsuits we've already got
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  the electronic proofs the information that could take him them on with the
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.600]  body scanner issue so you know if you do get abused you just need to find out
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.600]  these people names and sue them because that's the only thing that's going to
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.600]  really turn it around and they get it and they claim immunity they don't really
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:51.600]  have immunity but they're still gonna have to respond to the lawsuit well
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.600]  exactly and I mean it's not as if this is a new phenomenon 2002 there was a case
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:05.600]  with blue Rockwell dot com journalist called Nicholas monitor and his pregnant
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.600]  wife heavily pregnant was had a breast bundled in front of hundreds of other
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.600]  passengers had a Jennifer squeeze and she feared losing a baby at the time
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:22.600]  because of the trauma and then her husband who wrote the article complained
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  about it and he just threw him in the airport jail so it's been going on but
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  oh let's expand let's get your brother or or or Kurt to write you know
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:38.600]  chronicles of TSA abuse or TSA hell because remember the the Ron Paul you
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.600]  know official guy he had a few thousand cash on him because he was going into
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.600]  what was it Kansas City for a campaign for Liberty event he recorded them and
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  they said why do you have three thousand dollars or whatever it was and he said
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.600]  look it's none of your business man I'm a citizen you've already fondled me they
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.600]  aren't screaming at him and threatening him I mean it's their bunch of lunatics
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.600]  they know full well you're not terrorist they're a bunch of power-tripping scum
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.600]  who couldn't get a job cleaning toilets but they can sure squeeze your wife
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.600]  all the borders are wide open Watson that's another thing now they've got
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.600]  cash sniffing dogs roaming around so if you've got you know I mean when I go on
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.600]  holiday if I'm paying for everything I need you know I need a couple I go to
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.600]  France I need a couple thousand euros if I'm going two weeks but they don't allow
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:28.600]  you to take I think he's over a thousand euros so if you've got all that on your
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.600]  person then you're done with the treating cash like it's dirty like drugs now in
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.600]  the airport and then meanwhile for all you guys what's right drugs yeah the
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.600]  government grows the drug ships a man they even admit it it's all hidden in
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.600]  plain view it's just total criminal scum Watson well done we need somebody to
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.600]  tackle other crimes the deaths we forget about all people they've killed all they
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.600]  say he fell and hit his head or she choked herself with the handcuffs behind
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:01.600]  her back we need to really show people who this scum you know is Watson good
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:07.600]  job thanks so thank you Paul Watson in prison planet.com Tom in California then

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.600]  Tom in California thanks for holding her on the air hey how are you doing today
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.600]  and I'm wound up hey I'll I hear you I'm out here in LA I'm kind of at the base
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.600]  of the thing about mountains so I see missile trails all the time coming from
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  Vandenberg and so I'm watching the film on your site yesterday and you know I know
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.600]  what I saw you know what you saw so on the news out here last night 11 o'clock
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  CBS they say that what you saw was a was a con trail it was actually a plane
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.600]  coming towards you you know I've got the reports meanwhile they've interviewed
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.600]  NASA people they've interviewed we've got it posted one of the former joint
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:54.600]  chiefs of staff and they're saying that is a missile trail yeah well I mean of
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.600]  course but they're trying to actually I couldn't believe it that I was what I was
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.600]  hearing last night was that they're trying to tell me that well what you saw
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.600]  and it just reiterated what you've always been saying about how stupid the
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.600]  government thinks we are and it was just like I could not believe that this guy
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.600]  was reporting this and then when they went back you could tell by the look on
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  his face that I can't believe they made me say that you know I thought wow I'm
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.600]  gonna have to try to get on your show today to get that point across because
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.600]  you know I mean it's obvious what what it was well there's more than they don't
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  just lie to train us to accept it they do it so that the so the debate is about
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.600]  is it true or isn't it so that you never have a debate about who shot the missile
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.600]  now it's about was it a missile or not a missile it's all military tactics when
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.600]  they're rolling in in World War one over trenches with tanks on both sides they
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.600]  had electronic you know big bull horns saying you're not being attacked you're
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.600]  not being attacked lay your guns down when you laid your guns down they came
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  over and you know machine gunned you and bayoneted you I'm not attacking you know
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.600]  a great analogy of that is in saving Private Ryan where they're having a knife
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.600]  fight in one of the you know shot out bombed out houses and and the Americans
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.600]  about to win and be able to stab the German and the German says I'm your
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.600]  friend I'm your friend and the guy kind of gives up and then he goes like yeah
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.600]  it's like just like Waco we're not assaulting we're not assaulting as they're
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.600]  just machine gunning the families Delta forces and they're just just on video
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.600]  flare just murdering everybody and and and it's like this is not an assault
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.600]  it's the same thing DU's not bad for you D you know a Mercury's not bad for you
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.600]  Mercury's good for you you're like well Mercury's deadly and they're just by then
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:39.600]  it's too late so again it's all a military tactic Tom just unbelievable I
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.600]  couldn't believe it kind of actually play that off and real quick but you
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.600]  notice and save it Private Ryan and they'll have you make your point because
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.600]  it's so accurate even though it's fiction many things like that happen in war I've
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.600]  read the accounts the guy figured out the German was lying in a few seconds but
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.600]  it was that hesitation it was that hesitation see when when the military
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  is about to come in and kill you and they're telling you lay your guns down
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.600]  we're not going to kill you all cowards want to believe that oh I can get out of
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.600]  this so you lower your gun now they win just like you stop speaking out because
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  you feel like you're alone they win it's all globalist propaganda sorry go ahead
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.600]  no I just had one I just had one final thing with the TSA thing most of these
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.600]  guys are like boobs that couldn't get a job working at you know for security
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.600]  guard probably couldn't get a job taking tickets at a matinee but I did have an
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:36.600]  idea for your you you wanted an article chapter for your PSA I came up with
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.600]  PSA scum of lies right rises to the surface see eyes a lot a history of lying
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.600]  rises the surface good headline good points appreciate that call Tom we're
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  going to come back jam in Dan Nick Walt and others very very exciting what's
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.600]  happening though but again what do you expect to happen as the whole world
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  governments announced as the dollar is imploded as the world blames the
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.600]  United States and sure the American people deserve some blame our politicians
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.600]  deserve a lot of it they've been bought out by these people we've been the engine

[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:31.600]  call welcome here in Vale Colorado this morning on my iPhone I had a message
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.600]  and the message said alert missile launch unknown missile launch over
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.600]  California I want to hear if you've heard about that
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  sure who was the alert from
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.600]  it was right under the time on my iPhone yeah well Homeland Security announced
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.600]  two years ago they want all smartphones all radios with chips in them the phones
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  already have it where they can turn your radio or TV on and give you brainwashing
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.600]  messages you know we're big brothers just everywhere California wants their license

[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  for whatever but I've been talking about the missile they've interviewed
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.600]  former top experts in the Pentagon generals NASA people we've got the
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:22.600]  newscast linked up at infowars.com and prisonplanet and they say it looks like
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:28.600]  a Polaris type submarine or ship launch missile but the media I mean I've got
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.600]  mainstream news articles in 2000 when North Korea launched a test missile it
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.600]  didn't have a warhead and it broke up coming back into the atmosphere over
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:42.600]  Alaska but this wasn't launched from another continent or over the North Pole
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.600]  this was clearly launched off the coast and we were just talking about that we
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.600]  were just just talking with a caller about the lies you know they're now
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.600]  saying it must have just been a chemtrail a contrail I'm aware of the report
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.600]  and the thought the video from the news but I just want to put that out there
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.600]  about the iPhone alert and the big brother trying to scare people
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  absolutely Dan good point glad you raised it nick and mash you're on the year

[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.600]  this is Nick from lookupandwakeup.org I just want to tell you a little story about
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  it was late August I flew back into the country into Fort Lauderdale and at the
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:30.600]  customs they made me go through to the security check you flew back into the
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:36.600]  homeland yeah I know what a bad decision that was so I came back in and after I
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:41.600]  went I put all my stuff through and then I went to the security metal detector
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  nothing went off but then he wanted to pat me down so then he goes to pat me down
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.600]  and he's like what's this I'm like I pulled out a small little bag of pretzels
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.600]  from the airplane they go you got to run that through I'm like you want me to run
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.600]  a bag of pretzels through the airplane through the x-ray now I kind of start

[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:18.600]  bad oh look more than three ounces of toothpaste it's all about psychologically
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.600]  training a bunch of goons that citizens are scum

[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:49.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:54.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:58.600]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.600]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.600]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.600]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:26.600]  everybody should make videos recounting their horror stories and everybody

[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:26.600]  that's MSNBC that's all coming up let's go back to Nick and math show your
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.600]  you've got a little bag a little tiny bag of the free pretzels in fact usually
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.600]  it's just a little straight pretzels right tiny little bag of goodies they
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:41.600]  gave you and what happened so it wasn't it wasn't even open mind you so after
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.600]  this is very frightening though yeah absolutely so I go back to the metal
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.600]  detector again and it doesn't go off again so then he passed the pat me down
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.600]  again and I'm so well pissed off about this and I look at the female TSA agent
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.600]  on her other her other line and now they had to make it by scanners there but
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.600]  they weren't using them they had them all there they had about four or five of
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.600]  them there and that and that terminal they weren't using them and so I
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.600]  look at the TSA agent the female one who's watching this happen and I just go
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:16.600]  pretzels pretzels and I just kept repeating pretzels now now I do everyone is
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  watching me and I hope they were because it was just ludicrous but what's
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:27.600]  happening you know so how did all this end evil Nick well then I went I went
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.600]  to I had to go back to customs the second checkpoint and I had a piece of paper
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.600]  I threw it on the what the method or in the trash in the bathroom but hit the
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.600]  ground and then it wouldn't leave me let me leave customs because I didn't have
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:41.600]  that piece of paper and I'm like oh you got you'll get it and so I was you'll
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:44.600]  go back to get the piece of paper I'm like oh I actually missed the trash
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.600]  lucky for you and then in TSA hold on customs oh yeah they always make they
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.600]  always make jokes Nick anything else in the story no that's all just keep up the
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.600]  good work Alex and we'll make it headway now I feel we are we are making
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.600]  headway because we now know we can make headway we can always make headway if we
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.600]  believe we have right on our side I haven't told this story in the last couple
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.600]  of years now that we've pushed this TSA abuse story out into the national debate
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.600]  it's one of the top three or four biggest stories in the world right now
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  conservatively what's happening financials number one Obama you know being
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.600]  Barry Sotaro that's all over mainstream news that's probably number two his
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  trip being so expensive probably number three which is a diversion they just
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:28.600]  want to make sure everybody thinks of him as the puppet so he gets the blame for
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  everything so people don't think of him as the puppet but I remember isn't going
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  four years ago flying back out of LA X and I I mean I have a lot of pairs of
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.600]  shoes because I like to be clean and I wear you know two or three different
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:48.600]  pairs of shoes every week point is my feet don't sting okay and you know my
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  exercise shoes I put desin X in them and everything so if it smells like
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:59.600]  anything my shoes smell like a medicine cabinet but the point is my feet didn't
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  stink and I'm going through take my shoes off and they and it was one of the
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.600]  few times they did want me and they were going Mr. Stinky feet it was a couple
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  black guys are making fun of me and laughing at me and I said you know I don't
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.600]  like being called stinky feet they kind of got a little bit angry but it's like
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:23.600]  we're not human it's just it's just it's ridiculous and laughing at me calling

[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.600]  you know I covered this yesterday I want to recap before I get to the new big news
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:48.600]  you in calls for higher taxes to combat climate here's Bloomberg bank tax
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:53.600]  co2 auctions recommended by Soros panel to help climate efforts but when you
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:58.600]  actually read the fine print it's to fund the new IMF World Bank global SDR
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:02.600]  that they're talking about at the G20 ahead of the G20 tomorrow being partially
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.600]  sold back so all other currencies can't compete so everybody rushes out for the
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:10.600]  digital currency that's on a card and already US packages shipped out of the
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:16.600]  United States are denominated in SDRs this new global cashless currency so the
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:20.600]  banks that have engineered the crisis they're now as we've been telling you
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:25.600]  for years ahead of the derivatives collapse give them more power let them
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:29.600]  transcend governments and control all governments through debt that's why they
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:32.600]  love debt it's why they love corruption it's why they love welfare to get
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:37.600]  everybody in debt to them and they make the money up out of nothing so we've
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:43.600]  got those reports here's Zolik seeks gold standard debate ahead of the world bank
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:49.600]  that's financial times of London now here's the other humongous news and we
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.600]  told you this was coming the same things already but done in Europe and I told
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.600]  you they're about a year and a half ahead of us in Greece and Spain and France
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.600]  and England that's why there's rioting for over a month and a half going on
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.600]  non-stop because they're having their social security cut and they take
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:09.600]  masses amount of money out of your check if you got three four percent return on
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.600]  which is a guaranteed investment you know on average you'd get four times the
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:17.600]  money but see now they've stolen it all so now they say we're going to even cut
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.600]  that we're not just going to freeze your cola cost of living expense we're
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:27.600]  going to cut it u.s. debt proposal would cut social security Medicare the
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:31.600]  co-chairman the president Barack Obama's debt reduction commission will
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  propose cuts to social security and Medicare as well as reductions to
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:41.600]  income tax rates in exchange for curbing tax breaks according to Republican
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:46.600]  aid who attended the meeting which the chairman's panel is already causing
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.600]  some Democrats and Republicans on the 18 member commission to bulk and you watch
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:56.600]  when they finally pass it they'll up the income taxes but cut the social
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.600]  security but they put something in that sounds good kind of like putting
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.600]  cyanide and Kool-Aid so the kids will drink it the chairman's plan is already
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:08.600]  causing some Democrats and Republicans on the 18 member commission to bulk the
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  plan will be announced at 1 p.m. Washington time today so I guess it's
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.600]  being announced right now or was announced about an hour ago this is not a
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:20.600]  package that I could support representative Jane Shonkowski Illinois
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:24.600]  Democrats said during a break in the meeting you know I've been attacked by
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.600]  media matters and others for talking about how they want to cut social
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:30.600]  security saying I'm a liar when all I was doing was reporting on this
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.600]  commission and similar commissions over the years so I guess they'll say I'm
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:40.600]  lying reading this today so you know here comes all of those different
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  activities globalism is designed to destroy the real economy and transfer
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:49.600]  everything to the mega financial centers who are also shutting down the
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.600]  small banks and regional banks and credit unions and they're all
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  complaining as well saying it's fraud and so now Obama and others are saying
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:02.600]  we need more globalism that's the answer and a speech yesterday Obama said
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:06.600]  this will keep America on its toes America's going to have to compete
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.600]  there's going to be a tug of war with the US between those who see globalization
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.600]  as a threat and those who accept we live in an open integrated world which has
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:19.600]  challenges and opportunities remember what a few weeks ago the Canadian
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  Prime Minister said he said yeah we've got to give up sovereignty we're part
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  of globalism now we've got to give it up to private banks remember that quote I
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:32.600]  played quote if the American people feel that trade is just one way street
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:37.600]  where everybody is selling to the enormous US market but we can never sell
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.600]  what we make anywhere else then people the US will start thinking that this is a
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.600]  bad deal for us and will come up leading to a more protectionist instinct in
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.600]  both parties not just amongst Democrats but also Republicans so that we have to
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.600]  guard against it so they've debased the currency it's all we had left to buy all
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.600]  these Chinese goods that was all done by design and now they say any type of
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.600]  protectionism is bad so we develop some industry here they don't want that they
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.600]  want to force you to only take government jobs and I have the report here
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:16.600]  today more federal workers pay tops $150,000 and overall federal pay has
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:22.600]  increased massively the number of federal workers earning $150,000 or more a year
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  has soared tenfold in the past five years and doubled since President Obama took
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.600]  office so the mega banks are making record profits and they're in high cotton
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:36.600]  and the government people are doing well state employees are having a lot of
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.600]  their pay cut key city employees like city managers who run the double set of
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.600]  books swindle op and invest your tax money in derivatives that's been stolen
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.600]  they're paid to some cases a million bucks a year and there's big revolts all
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.600]  over the country about that continuing including by city employees getting
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  their pay cut or being furloughed or being laid off people are waking up
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.600]  Sarkozy signs deal raising retirement age again the austerity is here they're
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  cutting back on lights or dimming them in England because everything's got to go
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.600]  to the bankers the entire economy's got to go to them just like Nigeria or
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:19.600]  Argentina where if you look at it you know in some cases the case of Nigeria
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:23.600]  90 plus percent of their tax money goes to service debt to the IMF and World Bank
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  a billion dollar loan in the 70s you can pull this up they've paid over 50
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:32.600]  billion on that one billion dollar loan and now they still owe over another 50
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:35.600]  billion that's pretty good you pay a hundred billion on one billion that's
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  pretty good and the bankers just made it up see everything has been about
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.600]  bankrupting us getting us domesticated and maneuvering us into this position
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:50.600]  Ireland's crisis flares as investors dump bonds Ireland's financial troubles
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.600]  loomed large Wednesday as investors betting that the country soon could
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:58.600]  join France and seeking a EU bailout drove the interest rate on the country's
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.600]  10-year bond to a new high food prices fears as US warrants have cropped
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:08.600]  yields and that's a cover for what's happening with commodities going up
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.600]  because of dollar devaluation another great article by Steve Watson World
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:18.600]  Bankings to criminal banking cartel kind of breaks it all down the G20 starts
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:22.600]  meeting tomorrow we already know what they're going to announce there we are
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:25.600]  now and I'm going to talk about this after the break because this is the
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  frame up of the United States but we're now seeing the IMF the World Bank
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.600]  we're now seeing the the French the German the Chinese the Brazilian the
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:42.600]  Indonesian the Japanese all of them coming out and saying this QE to
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  monetary devaluation is going to cause massive inflation and the world is
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  then forced to buy dollars to try to prop it up because it brings down the
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  whole world economy and it causes other countries to try to devalue their
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:03.600]  currencies and then we hear it's a currency war it's not a currency war
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.600]  this was always the plan they have to debase all the global currencies ahead
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:14.600]  of the new SDR that you'll pay carbon taxes financial VAT manufacturing VAT
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.600]  total gross VAT and you notice you got a lot of republicans starting to float
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.600]  that some of them ignorantly thinking they're going to get rid of the income
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  tax and have the VAT no they're going to have both and it's all going to be
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  paid to this private group this is the financial Armageddon this is the
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:34.600]  financial takeover this is a financial invasion this is their carefully
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:38.600]  plotted program a hundred years ago at Jekyll Island they just met last weekend
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.600]  celebrated their domination of us to take over the globe this is financial
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:46.600]  domination and tyranny I'm going to come back and get into that their master
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:50.600]  plan briefly I'm trying to encapsulate how this is going to unfold unless we
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:54.600]  stop them and this is so out in the open and so illegal if we stand up and
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:58.600]  say no we got a fighting chance you might as well fight folks they're going to
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:01.600]  suck you down I want to bring Ted Anderson up briefly we'll have a lot of
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:05.600]  time Ted and I appreciate you coming on but they they tried to send golden
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:10.600]  silver down it shot back up today we see this look at the month the year the
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:15.600]  10-year graph it straight up it is now time to get involved in golden silver
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:19.600]  ladies and gentlemen to protect yourself because then you can always cash it
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:26.600]  in for the devalued currency but you'll get your value transferred people
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:31.600]  people say well why do I want gold well you know if they keep devaluing the
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:35.600]  dollar and then you've got to cash gold in to get regular currency to operate
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:39.600]  that freezes it so it doesn't devalue if you've just put money in the bank it's
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  going to be devalued but if you put it into gold gold as a main commodity in
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:47.600]  store of wealth will move with a devaluation so your gold hasn't really
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:51.600]  gone up the dollar and currencies have gone down then it's an emergency store
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:55.600]  of wealth Ted explain that to folks and give them the toll free number to call
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:00.600]  well it's just as simple as this gold has held value for 6000 years this fiat
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:05.600]  money that we have now was attached to gold all the way up to 1971 and has
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:09.600]  done nothing but lose purchasing power since then gold is good continuing to
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:15.600]  go up I mean gold shot up $14 an ounce opened up this morning at 1383 20 now
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  trading at 1400 and 480 and seen a high of 1408 30 silver again I mean they
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.600]  raised the reserve requirements for the futures market and it drops over
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.600]  yesterday in price but then boom right back up again from 2651 to 2810 Alex
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.600]  this is no joke gold and silver is just pretty much beaten off any any
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:42.600]  intervention or or planned by the globalist to knock it down and to support
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:48.600]  the dollar it's just absolutely shedding it so this is really a testament to
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.600]  how strong gold and silver really is and now they're announcing they want to
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.600]  start stealing social security and private pension funds as we knew they would
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:02.600]  Bloomberg and MSNBC folks it's time to get physical gold and silver and the
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:05.600]  radio deals that Ted offers are the best you're going to find anywhere and I've
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.600]  done the research his regular deals are very competitive and excellent these
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:15.600]  radio deals on silver half dollars on Frank's on sovereigns on the three
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:20.600]  silver dollars for eighty nine dollars shipping included and three of my best
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:24.600]  selling films on top of it a hundred and sixty dollar value for eighty nine

[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:03.600]  eight six two three seven Ted I finally wanted to get into their master plan
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.600]  we've known exactly what they would do we've laid out exactly what they did do
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:11.600]  not just myself but you and many others on the show they created the glass
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.600]  stigle imploded the economy got everybody in debt now it's all over the
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.600]  news anybody who listens to radio or watches TV or reads the paper every
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  major finance minister blaming America for the global meltdown and saying do not
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:29.600]  devalue your currency something China's done for a long time so that we can't
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  compete and this kills our buying power it kills our savings it lowers our
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  standard of living we know this is this is horrible what's happening but it's
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.600]  all designed in these offshore banks blame America for all of this happening
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  and say we've got a solution world we'll make the Americans and rich Europeans
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:56.600]  and Aussies and Kiwis and others we'll make them and China saying this we want
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:00.600]  an audit of the Fed we when the Fed are globalist you know we want the US to
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:05.600]  have to pay for this they're saying make us pay into this new world government
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.600]  banking system as the new global cashless currency that they're talking about
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  being partially gold back to further kill all the major currencies that are
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.600]  competing with it so they've organized this whole thing and then they pose as
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  the saviors I mean Ted this is incredible it sure is because once you back
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.600]  of a world currency with gold and you leave fiat currencies that are that are
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:29.600]  really quite worthless in the nations to compete people are going to go to the
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.600]  gold back currency globally you won't have a choice you'll end up having to
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  accept foreign currency as an exchange for means and goods and services here in
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  the United States I mean that is a direct attack on our liberty here and it
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:45.600]  just shouldn't be done which should never have happened and here we are
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.600]  sitting in the position just like you said it would happen many many years
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:52.600]  ago and talked about it I mean everybody thought that you were not selling
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:55.600]  you can see what they were doing they said what they were going to do they
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  done it in third world countries over and over again we knew the model that's
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:02.600]  that's just exactly what I what I was trying to say here it's like you know
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.600]  people people looked at looked at your show and then thought how crazy of an
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  idea was that we're gonna be slipping into a world government and now it's
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  happening and everybody's waking up to we just need to fight it you know the
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.600]  Chinese are just downgraded our bonds here in the United States I know well
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.600]  they did a few months ago now they've accelerated it I mean this is I think
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.600]  Gerald Salente may have been right saying we're gonna collapse by December I
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  mean we're already are basically collapsing now they just haven't told people
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.600]  well looking at the golden silver prices you can certainly see that as an
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.600]  indicator I mean silver's been rising at a dollar a day well remember three
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  months ago Bloomberg and others reported that the majority of future options on
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:45.600]  gold for mid December of 1500 an ounce I mean the insiders aren't betting on
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.600]  that because they're idiots no no they're not they they know what's going on
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  they they know exactly what's going on and that's why they're predicting it
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:57.600]  that's why they're acting upon it and I can tell you the people the United
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.600]  States of America better wake up they better get away from this fiat money
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:05.600]  that we have because it's gonna become worth a lot less and you're gonna be
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  competing for goods and services that you might not even be able to buy you
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:13.600]  better have gold and silver take advantage of those silver dollars or that British
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.600]  sovereign get the videos pass them off and tell them it's the radio special to get the lowest
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:24.600]  prices possible 800 686 2237 800 686 237 10 thank you so much

[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:51.600]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:56.600]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:29:56.600 --> 02:30:02.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.600]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:10.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:14.600]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:23.600]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:26.600]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:54.600]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:32:02.600]  well I've got to salute everybody world government's out in the open and the liberty patriot movement has been essential in getting it out there
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:09.600]  the system tried to deny that all this was happening so that we couldn't have a real debate about it but now more and more people are getting out of denial
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:17.600]  and we've had five or six different stories that we've written last week and this week at drudgereport.com
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:29.600]  that has caused a firestorm hundreds of mainstream news articles la times ap major pilot associations flight attendant associations today
[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:39.600]  foreign associate all coming out members of the Indian parliament in India complaining about it
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:47.600]  I mean people have always been angry and they were always accelerating and expanding the abuse the genital squeezing the breast squeezing
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:53.600]  now they're trying to lie and say they don't do it even though their own press releases say they're trying to face us in for everybody
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:33:01.600]  prisonplanet.com article TSA no fondling groping or squeezing is taking place at airports a complete lie
[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:09.600]  flight attendants outraged over intrusive pat downs airport screening it's more aggressive with pat downs we've been covering this since last week
[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:21.600]  now it's up on drudge USA Today and it goes on to quote it here as saying that your genitals and breast will be touched
[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:29.600]  so it's just all all beginning to come out a pilots union opposes full body scans for cancer reasons and pat downs
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:37.600]  for privacy reasons union president tells us airways pilots to avoid body scanners I mean this is all this is all happening
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:45.600]  flight attendants union upset over new pat down procedures woman who died at airport was rehab bound they killed her in the back room
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:55.600]  other people killed I mean I mean this is big and I've told listeners go on talk radio make your own YouTube videos talk about the abuse
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:01.600]  you've been under organizations are forming lawsuits are being filed and they say well we're keeping you safe from terrorism
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  meanwhile it's mainstream news that illegal aliens illegal say TSA approved flight training with no ID no nothing they were just boom
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:19.600]  you can rent any aircraft you want for training now that's ABC News 5 out of Boston this is all a joke this is about training you
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:26.600]  to submit to people putting their hands on you and the TSA has announced and they've already done it they're going nationwide with mobile
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:35.600]  body scanners checkpoints at malls schools the US armies involved we have links to mainstream news where they drive cars through it in places like New York
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:44.600]  state in the middle you know the countryside making families drive through giant radiation systems you know huge x-ray systems where they drive under these huge
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:53.600]  wands that beam through the car Forbes reports 500 high powered mobile trucks driving around looking through your walls and cars 10 times the
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  power of a chest x-ray dwarfing the radiation of the naked body scanners you got the military being radiated the TSA the people driving these
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:09.600]  cars they're not under any radiation regulations the regulations and laws are there they're just completely ignored
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:18.600]  I mean this is all going on setting the precedent for insanity there's another video linked up on drudge report it's also on infowars.com
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:26.600]  Meg McLean she moved to New Hampshire from her hometown of Portland Oregon at discovering the true nature of government it's harmful effects
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:34.600]  she came to the town of Keene with a degree in film production and the desire to be active in to shift the government from violence to a peaceful and consensual
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:43.600]  society she's a blogger she fills in on a Genesis show free talk live I've been a guest only been a guest here that syndicated I forget I'm like 50
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:52.600]  something stations last time I checked they're doing a great job and she was abused and not you know not just one of my employees not just the women last
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:36:02.600]  Tuesday that I watched in California only women and children being sent to the naked body scanners and being fondled by men and women
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:09.600]  men are fondling women and little girls but people point out it's not okay to have a woman fondle a woman I mean it's just crazy
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:19.600]  so joining us is Meg McLean to break down what happened to her Meg good to have you here with us you bet so
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:27.600]  wow you're up on drugs report right now that's very exciting hundreds of thousands of not millions will see what happened to you tell folks about what happened
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:39.600]  well I was down here in Miami visiting some other wonderful activists from Libertyontour.com and I went to go home and you know they just chose me
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:52.600]  of course randomly out of seven people who I would probably even be shady looking at all of them to go through the body scanner and you know instantly I just said you know I'm not doing that I don't have any comfort
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:37:03.600]  stepping in that thing so they immediately just started screaming opt out and that took me off guard it kind of frightened me that you know everybody in the entire airport was staring at me at that point
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:12.600]  and they walked me over to this area and before they even started because like I've read into these procedures and I knew I wouldn't be comfortable with somebody touching me in that way
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:26.600]  so I just said you know before this happens I have a few questions and that alone just sent them into this huge frenzy and ended up with about 12 police officers surrounding me and 70 F agents
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:36.600]  it was just the most humiliating thing I've ever been through and when you know nobody would answer my questions and so I wouldn't consent to the pat down until my questions were answered
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:40.600]  they finally just escorted me out of the airport
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:45.600]  now it's described as you being handcuffed and yelled at what happened with that
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:58.600]  well at one point when after the first TSA lady when answering my questions and she was just being very rude I asked to talk to her supervisor her supervisor came over I got maybe 30 seconds into the conversation
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:10.600]  and she ran off and got the cops and it was at that point that you know as a liberty activist I understand the power of the camera and so I reached for my bag to get my camera out to you know at least protect myself with that
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:20.600]  and everybody started screaming you know don't touch your back and so they handcuffed me and told me to sit in the chair so that I wouldn't touch my stuff I guess I don't know
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:28.600]  and then they you know proceeded to give me about a 30 minute very loud lecture in front of everybody in the airport about terrorism
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:46.600]  I could not believe what was going on and they had me literally right outside of the exit for the normal metal detector so everyone who went through security was staring straight at me being yelled at at this point I'm sobbing I can't wipe my face because my hands are behind my back
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:59.600]  and so I just look a mess and everybody has to watch me do this and it was so humiliating and it was obviously just you know a tactic to get people to be scared this is what's going to happen
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:10.600]  well yeah let me tell you a story we confirmed this in Kansas City in Houston Texas they have the 4-H club and they have the county fairs and it also happened in Colorado
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:21.600]  they were trying to force animal ID premises ID and it wasn't a law five years ago the feds would just send you forms waving your rights to the government allowing inspections of your farm
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:34.600]  but to intimidate people to get them to accept this they would say oh you've got to sign up for animal ID premises ID with the feds if you want to show a cow or horse a pig or goat at the county fair
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:47.600]  and they would always pick a nice little young lady they would give her the grand prize and then on stage police would come and handcuff them and announce they did not sign an animal ID premises ID
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  or in some cases they wouldn't handcuff them and bring them crying away to scare everyone to then go sign animal ID premises ID
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:08.600]  so this is all you know screaming opt out opt out lifting women's dresses up in front of everybody handcuffing people screaming at them groping people this is all an act to dominate folks you agree with that analysis
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:22.600]  oh definitely yeah I could tell that you know I was probably the least threatening person in that entire airport I'm you know 110 pounds on a good day and I had nothing threatening on me
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:26.600]  I don't know I'm looking at a photo of you you look pretty al-qaeda-ish right now
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:36.600]  yeah and because they sat me in front of that space like nobody else had to go through the body scanner or the hand shutdown because I was taking up the area
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:50.600]  so you know I was the only person of interest in that area and I didn't understand it at all I mean I don't come off threatening I don't say things they're threatening I just had questions and they cannot accept questions
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:52.600]  so how did this end?
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:41:03.600]  I ended with the 12 police officers that they called surrounding me and then walking me out the airport with the TSA carrying my stuff including my shoes and my jacket
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:10.600]  so I had walked out of the airport barefoot no jacket and freezing cold just
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:13.600]  oh so they so they took your clothes too
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  but they took me yeah I think I had all I was wearing was a t-shirt and pants that's it
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  and I mean were you asking may I please have my stuff or what did they tell you
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:28.600]  well when the cops originally showed up and they wouldn't answer my questions either
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:36.600]  my stuff was away from the entire security area and we're searching it despite me yelling like I don't consent to searchers
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:45.600]  and then I didn't see it again until I got outside they had it outside waiting for me on the curb which it was unattended so I wasn't
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:48.600]  I was actually really surprised that it was still there
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:56.600]  well you know what they've done starting out in New York and then Boston and Houston and LA going back five or six years
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:02.600]  they now have random checkpoint searching citizens just like in the airport so things they could never do before
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:09.600]  for this non-existent once in a blue moon terrorism situation they're telling us that this is for our own good
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:15.600]  this is really just setting the precedent to live in a system far more oppressive than 1984
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:25.600]  oh yeah I I've never felt so humiliated in my life and I was so surprised that you know anybody who could be the one to humiliate me
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:30.600]  it was the U.S. government that's just for me
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  what do you think of the TSA coming out after they announced that they do touch your genitals and breast
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:46.600]  of other women and men that now they're saying oh no we don't we don't grope or squeeze I mean they're caught red handed lying
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:54.600]  I mean they lied about saving the naked body scan images they lied about them having radiation I mean they just lie lie lie
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:43:02.600]  that's right I guess just what they're trying to do is lie because we can't you can't tell everybody what you're going to do
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:10.600]  and have them just blindly accept it nobody's going to accept it if they say what they want to do so they have to lie
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:18.600]  I've also seen media reports and talked to eyewitnesses over the years other talk show hosts that it's particularly attractive women
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.600]  that they really go wild over
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:29.600]  I actually spoke to my mother shortly after this whole incident happened because you know obviously I was just stuck in Florida at this point
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:36.600]  I was just calling mom to tell her what happened and she said that she flies a lot and she's not an unattractive woman
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.600]  and she has very very large breasts and she said every time she goes through she always gets picked
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:46.600]  and even when she flies with my dad which my dad is kind of a shadier looking guy
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:53.600]  my mom is not sure you've been in any way shape or form but she's always the one bit and it's just because you know we're women
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:44:02.600]  people get attached to us then and nobody wants that I don't know anybody who feels safer as a result of that I don't
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:12.600]  Well there's a thuggish type of mentality that enjoys forcing something on a woman and I'm sure you've seen the reports of implanting drugs on people
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  and then demanding sexual favours or how many TSA workers have been caught being pedophiles
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:21.600]  I mean this is the job to get if you're a control freak scumbag
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:26.600]  Oh yeah and it's the type that is attracted to that job as well
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:33.600]  I mean nobody who values people or the human race in general would ever be attracted to a job like that
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:39.600]  it's just the horrible people who have no moral judgment on their own and are willing to blindly follow orders
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.600]  no matter how far they take it and I kept asking them what's your line in the sand
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.600]  at what point do they give you an order that you think they know that goes too far
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:53.600]  and they just said we're just following orders you know it's all for the greater good and I think there's no good game came here
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:45:02.600]  I am just following orders for the homeland I mean look at the nomenclature the homeland the troops the face scanning cameras
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:08.600]  papers please it's not papers please it's shouting at people and groping them I mean this is insane
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:15.600]  Yeah I've never had so many grown men with guns screaming at me for no reason they were so frightening
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:21.600]  Well Meg that's what this is all about it's about making us the terrorist and training us that we're bad
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:27.600]  and that we're going to be shouted at by our government protectors and notice this is all happening right as the economy implodes
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:34.600]  right as the global government's being announced right as the police state's unfolding it's all been timed perfectly Meg
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:35.600]  Yeah
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:43.600]  What do you think of the backlash to this and I don't know if you're tracking it but I mean the internet mainstream media is on fire with this
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  and the establishment media is trying to promote it like it's a good thing but people aren't listening to them anymore
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:59.600]  Yeah and like I've been really immersed in the whole TSA issues for a while I mean I did a video on go with Sam Dawson of Obstetruth
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:07.600]  and you know he was harassed throughout that entire thing just for having a video camera and so it's something that I followed closely
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:15.600]  and it's very dear to my heart because it feels so bad for especially like crime victims
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.600]  I mean I don't even know what they go through when they have to deal with that
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:24.600]  it's something that my heart breaks for them and to see like people putting their children through that
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:29.600]  just like watching somebody beat a child on the side of the road I can't just keep my mouth shut about it
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:33.600]  there's nothing more I can do other than speak up
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:39.600]  Well that's wonderful Meg I mean this is human dehumanization, degradation
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:46.600]  the airports are giant reeducation centers where we are indoctrinated in the religion of tyranny and abuse
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:53.600]  Yeah and I can only hope that you know the people who had to walk around me during that entire hour
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.600]  at least saw what I was dealing with and heard what I was saying because
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:05.600]  everything I said I was obviously not a threat to them and it was all just about you know making me feel
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:14.600]  as stupid and you know as bad as possible even though I hadn't done anything and I wasn't going to stuff that
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.600]  So I hope that the people who saw that took that with them
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:24.600]  Absolutely look when we resist we educate others and they want to intimidate people and make it very uncomfortable
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:30.600]  so you don't resist because imagine what's coming after this if we put up with this
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:36.600]  Yeah I can only imagine and I really don't want it to get to that point and I always tell them like
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:43.600]  I'm doing this not just for me and for my loved ones but they're the face of whatever you know
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  perhaps the government throws down on the people and for the people when they're pushed too far
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:55.600]  they're going to snap and they're going to attack these people who are the face of the tyranny not the actual tyranny itself
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:01.600]  and so I'm trying to help them as well because they're on the losing side of a war and I don't want anybody to get hurt in this
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:04.600]  I just want them all to realize what they're doing and step away
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:10.600]  They're on a losing side of a war you can feel the momentum towards liberty in your gut can't you?
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  Yeah I mean I packed up and moved away from I love my grandpa more than anything in the world but I had to move to New Hampshire
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:26.600]  because you know it's a place where we're actually doing things to move it to that point and we've had so many successes
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:33.600]  and you know even though it was heartbreaking to give up living with my grandfather I had to do it
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:36.600]  How bad was the police state in the previous state?
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  In Oregon? Yeah
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.600]  I'm sorry what? Yes in Oregon
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  It wasn't horrible but at the same time but it is a very civil community and so they like their police
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:59.600]  and I was never really an activist there it's a little bit more difficult when there aren't very many like minded people around
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:02.600]  I understand you wanted to get out of the zombie like environment
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:10.600]  Yeah it's just everybody sort of takes government as a given there and you know it's just one of those necessary evils of life
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:16.600]  and any evil doesn't have to be necessary there's no such thing as a necessary evil
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:26.600]  Meg I want to talk about your ideas to get on the offensive and to remove these machines and the groping that's going on
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:33.600]  and the abuse of behavior but then we have to talk in that solution about dealing with the stage terror
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.600]  and this is something that a lot of libertarians and people don't want to touch
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:42.600]  though Noam Chomsky a liberal he's now come out and said there's nothing to do with 9-11 because if you
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:45.600]  They helped to create a new world order
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  We are part of a new world order
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  A new world order based upon collective action
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:55.600]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:02.600]  It means all the world under their control
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  The United Nations would take over America
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:08.600]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:16.600]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:21.600]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.600]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:30.600]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else

[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:06.600]  Up on screen, I have the Daily Mail dining with the enemy Al-Qaeda leader, linked to 911 hijackers, was invited to the Pentagon
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.600]  Launched two months after the attacks
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:16.600]  Here's Fox News, failed Al-Qaeda plot involving showing bombs inside dogs, now they want to ban dogs flying
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:19.600]  Meg McClain, here's the issue
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:27.600]  If we don't talk about Gulf of Tonka and other stage terror attacks, or that Amar al-Alaqi's run all the major terror attacks and is admittedly government
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:35.600]  They're going to continue to mail toner cartridges and blow stuff up and say that it's foreign shadowy men doing it
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:44.600]  They have the trump card, or the checkmate, or the ace of spades, the royal flush, if we don't come out and talk about stage terror
[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:46.600]  I mean, what's your view on that?
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:58.600]  Well, my view is that I don't really care what's been done or what could happen is what you're doing today to people is inappropriate
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:05.600]  And for me, it doesn't matter the past or the future, it's today
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:10.600]  Sure, sure, but Megan does matter if the TSA works for the group that stage the terror attacks
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:20.600]  Well, obviously it does, but I can't convince anybody of anything other than what I am experiencing at that moment
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:28.600]  What are your ideas to counter this? Because I want to read Texas law here in a moment, but what are some of your ideas to respond to this?
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:30.600]  Obviously, expose it, but what else?
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:40.600]  Well, for me, different strokes for different folks, there's all different kinds of great activists and great actions that can be done
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:46.600]  But for me personally, it's just saying no, if enough people refuse, there's nothing they can do
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:52.600]  I don't know if you've heard of the 420 celebrations in my hometown now in New Hampshire
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:55:00.600]  We just started gathering on the city square and openly smoking cannabis to try to drug law
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.600]  Sure, so it's the Gandhi nonviolent resistance
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:11.600]  Yeah, and there were some arrests, but now we've basically created a demilitarized zone where anybody at stage could go in there and smoke weed anytime they want
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:15.600]  They won't be bothered, and that's a great success
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:19.600]  Well, the government doesn't like marijuana because that's the only drug they don't mainly ship in
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:22.600]  Let me read to you from Texas, and it's the same in all 50 states
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:25.600]  That's an important headline, TSA breaking state and federal laws
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:32.600]  Right beneath section 2111 in decency with a child is Texas defines assault as follows
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  Sexual assault of any person commits an offense if a person intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:46.600]  When the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:51.600]  And then it goes on in other sections if it's a sexual area, it's even more time in prison
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:57.600]  So that's pretty serious, I mean they're breaking the law right there
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:01.600]  Yeah, and they just excuse it, and I had to, you know, code word terrorism
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:05.600]  They gave me a 30 minute lecture while I was in that chair on terrorism
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:12.600]  They said that, you know, 17 of the 911 hijackers came through that airport, and I was like, so you guys suck at your job too?
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:19.600]  And, you know, for me the only thing I can do is just keep saying no and keep teaching people about these things
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:25.600]  Well Meg, I mean there you go, sure, but I mean, I've interviewed the former head of the embassy over visas
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:30.600]  They were ordered to let them in just like the underwear bomber was ordered to be helped on the flight
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  Source associated press, this is not an accident, it's my point
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:38.600]  I mean they didn't screw up their job, they did their job, they were ordered to let them in
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:46.600]  Yeah, they did a really bad job because, you know, their job is hurting people
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  That's all they do, it hurts people, they don't keep anybody safe
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:56.600]  And, you know, they're like, well we're keeping you safe, and I just said, you know what, at this point I would rather take my chances blowing up in the air
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:02.600]  Well, Meg McClain, we really appreciate you joining us, we appreciate your courage
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  Your spirit of liberty is an example to us all, we salute you, and we got about 10 seconds
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:11.600]  How did you get back home? Did you drive home from Miami?
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  I'm actually still in Florida
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:15.600]  Oh, so this just happened?
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:17.600]  Yeah, this was about two days ago
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:18.600]  Unbelievable
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:33.600]  That's all folks, retransmission starts now in FullWars.com, I'm Alex Jones
