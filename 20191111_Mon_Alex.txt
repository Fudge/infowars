[00:00.000 --> 00:10.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:10.080 --> 00:31.120]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones it is
[00:31.120 --> 00:39.600]  November 11th 2019 on this Monday live worldwide broadcast I am your host Alex
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.680]  Jones and a lot of you that watch this on television we summercast radio and
[00:44.680 --> 00:51.480]  TV I've been asking why lately I've been out front when we start the show many
[00:51.480 --> 00:57.640]  times instead of behind the desk well over the years many times I've gotten up
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.320]  to go to the map wall or go to a video feed and point some things out like a
[01:01.320 --> 01:08.880]  weatherman would do but this would be a political weatherman but with only 357
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.840]  days left to this historic election I'm doing it because I want to note
[01:14.840 --> 01:22.480]  visually to everyone that we're not in Kansas anymore that the world is really
[01:22.480 --> 01:28.280]  on the brink of total breakdown and disaster if good people don't exert
[01:28.280 --> 01:34.120]  our full political cultural economic and spiritual will because if we fail with
[01:34.120 --> 01:36.560]  that we're gonna have to exert our physical will because we'll have no other
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.440]  choice because what's coming at us is so damn evil there will be worldwide
[01:41.440 --> 01:46.800]  massive civil war and violence because if we fail there were there will have to
[01:46.800 --> 01:54.520]  be and I'm not saying that to sound tough it's just a fact now you see when we do
[01:54.520 --> 01:58.680]  exert our will against tyrants good things happen when we don't all hell
[01:58.680 --> 02:06.120]  breaks loose so let me let me walk towards the camera a little bit here
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.480]  something I've never done to really get people's attention because I'm gonna
[02:12.480 --> 02:19.360]  lay out information here on the show today that is of the complete paramount
[02:19.360 --> 02:29.920]  importance Nikki Haley the former governor who became the head UN
[02:29.920 --> 02:36.240]  ambassador from the US had her issues and I've had problems with her but she
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.480]  at least understands that it's treason when you undermine the president and
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.160]  try to set him up and when he signs the executive order you take it and throw it
[02:44.160 --> 02:50.280]  in trash can or when he says bring me info wars comm articles daily and you
[02:50.280 --> 02:59.720]  refuse to do it that is treason against the voters against the system because
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.760]  every tyrant group that undermines the president or overthrows the system always
[03:03.760 --> 03:09.360]  says they're doing it for the best of the society but now we understand that
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.720]  and we already do this was going on I don't just believe Nikki Haley we knew
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.960]  this was going on with Rex Tillerson the Secretary of State former Exxon
[03:18.960 --> 03:29.800]  Mobile CEO and former head of Homeland Security and General John Kelly and they
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.640]  were not just trying to undermine the president they were blocking his agenda
[03:33.640 --> 03:39.360]  and then leaking information to cover their ash with the establishment because
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.320]  they came from the establishment and because they're not their own men
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.240]  they're followers who might have physical courage in the case of Kelly but he
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.720]  doesn't have moral courage we're gonna roll through this and lay this out and
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.440]  and prove it today but here's the key understanding how the deep state has
[03:59.440 --> 04:05.520]  already tried to take Trump out the previous two times we can defeat this
[04:05.520 --> 04:12.920]  third attempt and then stop future attempts because this isn't even about
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.240]  Trump this is about due process about our country and about we the people and
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.440]  about us getting control of our government back what they're doing is
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.360]  illegal and the fact that we forced the deep state out in the open to admit
[04:25.360 --> 04:30.240]  they're doing all this is a seismic event so the blueprints of victory are
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.000]  here the blueprints of our enslavement are here as well we have to go over this
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.320]  judiciously and we will when we come back after this 60-second break please
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.720]  however you're watching or listening tell folks to tune in now you're listening
[04:43.720 --> 04:47.720]  on local radio tell folks in the local station if you're listening at band-dot
[04:47.720 --> 04:51.500]  video or watching a band-dot video or m4s.com or it's less show be the Paul
[04:51.500 --> 04:57.440]  Revere's this country in the world needs please everything hangs on you
[04:59.720 --> 05:04.520]  folks ask me Alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.840]  because different types of physiology's different types of metabolic systems and
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.040]  people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth
[05:16.040 --> 05:19.960]  crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[05:19.960 --> 05:25.440]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[05:25.440 --> 05:29.720]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or
[05:29.720 --> 05:34.600]  friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the
[05:34.600 --> 05:39.960]  globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes
[05:39.960 --> 05:43.800]  you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality iodine
[05:43.800 --> 05:50.000]  info or store.com and help fund the info or info or store.com we've got a huge
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.360]  sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types
[05:54.360 --> 06:00.200]  of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[06:09.560 --> 06:15.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[06:15.960 --> 06:29.080]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones it
[06:29.080 --> 06:41.120]  was late in 2017 and newspapers across the country reported that info wars was
[06:41.120 --> 06:48.600]  banned from the president reading it in the White House and John Kelly later
[06:48.600 --> 06:54.480]  confirmed that indeed that was the case now we now know in hindsight why that was
[06:54.480 --> 06:58.480]  in fact we knew back at the time via Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and their
[06:58.480 --> 07:05.560]  sources that were separate but very very accurate. Soros via General McMaster had
[07:05.560 --> 07:10.320]  gotten Fiona Hill in who then loaded the National Security Council and the State
[07:10.320 --> 07:16.280]  Department with Soros operatives Trump's removed about half of them so far that we
[07:16.280 --> 07:21.960]  know of. We specifically as loyal Americans who want to stop globalists
[07:21.960 --> 07:31.120]  that have hijacked our nation specifically exposed the individuals by
[07:31.120 --> 07:34.200]  name and exactly how they were doing it and how they were sabotaging the
[07:34.200 --> 07:38.200]  president we even had sources who would be out at dinner high-powered donors
[07:38.200 --> 07:42.200]  billionaires with McMaster and he would be drunk saying Trump's an idiot Trump's
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.080]  a fool we hear him the establishment know how to run things he'll be out in
[07:46.080 --> 07:51.080]  just a few months they called the president up and couldn't even get him
[07:51.080 --> 07:58.880]  on the phone so they called Roger Stone and they had Roger's phones tapped he
[07:58.880 --> 08:02.880]  got a bunch of death threats the next day and so did I we got told if you don't
[08:02.880 --> 08:08.200]  keep your mouth shut you're dead and I had people I know call up that have worked
[08:08.200 --> 08:13.680]  high-level CIA you name it and threaten me basically I told them piss up a rope
[08:13.680 --> 08:19.360]  and you better better make sure I don't see you coming I'm an American I'll piss
[08:19.360 --> 08:25.160]  on you how's that sound so this is what this all comes down to is a political
[08:25.160 --> 08:35.840]  class that has hijacked the country and they think they own it and all they do
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.440]  is glad hand around talking about how smart they are and how great they are
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.600]  and how good they are now all the rest of us are scum and that's where the
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.720]  Hollywood hatred of America comes from it's where the Americans are dumb
[08:49.720 --> 08:53.960]  America was never great I'll ever be that great you wonder why the mainline
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.240]  professors and mainline universities and mainline Republicans even have that
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.240]  attitude because when you are conquering a nation and selling it off and
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.720]  butchering it and dumbing it down and psychologically demoralizing it and
[09:06.720 --> 09:10.320]  poisoning it that's all the WikiLeaks you can turn the damn TV on see it though
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.200]  you don't even know it's in a secret document because you can see it breaking
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.240]  up the family everything we're being poisoned that's how you do it from
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.240]  within the rot from within there are the 49 secret plans of the communists to
[09:24.240 --> 09:28.480]  bring down the US and all the famous senatorial reports but it wasn't the
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.440]  Russian Communist with the globalist 30 taken over Russia we're using the same
[09:32.440 --> 09:35.160]  poison on us we ought to read those lists here on air today
[09:35.160 --> 09:48.680]  fact we will and so these individuals like John Kelly and all of them go into the military so
[09:48.680 --> 09:51.880]  they can make you think they protect America and that they care about the
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.600]  nation and what they really care about is running it and controlling especially
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.080]  with somebody like
[09:59.080 --> 10:06.400]  Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut and he's in the Marines too well hell
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.360]  Benedict Arnold was helped found the country he was in the army look look at
[10:10.360 --> 10:15.520]  who he was double agent of the British so that's who they are but we already
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.880]  knew what Nikki Haley has come out and said was true that they would come to her
[10:20.880 --> 10:25.840]  and say Trump is an idiot he's gonna destroy the country you've got to help
[10:25.840 --> 10:33.120]  us undermine him and not support him and block his agenda when the globalist
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.160]  have sat here and presided over the deindustrialization of America the
[10:38.160 --> 10:45.080]  dumbing down of America our life expectancy plumbing plummeting infant
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.440]  mortality exploding and all the other curses that are upon the nation and
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.760]  then Trump comes in gets elected tries to be the president tries to stabilize
[10:54.760 --> 11:00.320]  the economy tries to have fair deals with China that'll bring jobs back gets
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.400]  us out of the globalist compacts that are unconstitutional and that are
[11:05.400 --> 11:16.640]  illegal like these fake so-called Pacific partnerships that Hillary Clinton and
[11:16.640 --> 11:24.040]  others wrote the TPP Trans Pacific Partnership and they want him out and
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.600]  you learn from what she says exactly what Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and
[11:28.600 --> 11:37.000]  others all laid out here on air at the time and I've got to tell you all these
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.640]  movements that tell you everything's fine everybody's secretly good in the
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.280]  government Trump's about to take down the whole deep state go back to sleep
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.280]  everything's okay Trump's invincible that's right out of their department run
[11:47.280 --> 11:56.200]  by them like it's currently run by Kelly I'm told who absolutely hates my guts
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.680]  and if he could get the green light guaranteed they'd send somebody for me
[12:00.680 --> 12:08.200]  which knock yourself out rather knock yourself out so that's really what's
[12:08.200 --> 12:12.560]  going on here and we've known about it the whole time and these people believe
[12:12.560 --> 12:16.440]  they had America they were cutting it up and selling it off the highest bidder
[12:16.440 --> 12:26.360]  they literally see us all as flyover country and people like Rand Paul is
[12:26.360 --> 12:31.400]  for real and people like Scalicia for real and people like Hurley are for real
[12:31.400 --> 12:38.320]  and people like Jordan are for real I'm for real because we're all under attack
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.560]  and you can see it and Trump's for real but everybody else is being threatened
[12:43.560 --> 12:46.400]  everybody else being blackmailed everybody else feels like they're part of
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.400]  the establishment and oh you've got to save America and the world from Trump
[12:50.400 --> 12:59.600]  you're our only hope so America has to ask we want to be ruled by a bunch of
[12:59.600 --> 13:05.320]  bureaucrats the fourth and fifth estate you've seen what they've done does so far
[13:05.320 --> 13:12.200]  you've seen their weaponized alliance with China against us you've seen what's
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.040]  being taught the schools that's what the ruling class thinks of you and what they
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.960]  want to do to you because we've always been the big system to conquer and they
[13:19.960 --> 13:26.760]  almost tax and they if they control America they will control the planet and
[13:26.760 --> 13:32.120]  America was attacked when America was asleep and then America was put into a
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.800]  globalist induced cultural spiritual economic coma and we're out of the coma
[13:36.800 --> 13:42.680]  we're sick we're stumbling around we got diarrhea running down our legs but our
[13:42.680 --> 13:47.120]  eyes are getting clear and we see what's going on and even though we're in a
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.600]  debilitated state we're bigger and stronger than these gremlins that had
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.960]  us tied down on the operating table and that we're about to finally finish us
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.560]  off and sell our organs off to the highest bidder that's the metaphor and I
[14:01.560 --> 14:05.160]  personally am doing everything I can I got my hands on a couple of the
[14:05.160 --> 14:08.320]  gremlins and I'm squeezing them and they're dying well they're stabbing me in
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.360]  the guts I'm just that I want to throw these down and grab some more the only
[14:12.360 --> 14:15.680]  way I can do that is when you spread the word and when you buy the products and
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.120]  when you pray for it you do that I can just start smashing goblins smashing
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.720]  them smashing them smashing them and just pulling them up against the wall and
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.160]  break every bone in their body and then I'm just gonna aim like a big right
[14:27.160 --> 14:34.480]  Osiris and just run through them I'm gonna hammer them until the last ounce of
[14:34.480 --> 14:38.280]  our operational capital and will runs out and I believe we're gonna overrun them
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.160]  and defeat them they can feel the defeat right now but it's never been more
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.760]  epic the chai comms in the EU and the Hollywood America haters all allied
[14:46.760 --> 14:50.400]  with a bunch of the professional class that has been selling out and carving
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.040]  this country up for 60 70 years British intelligence knows how to take over a
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.920]  country and corrupt its establishments it sets up Royal Institute of
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.800]  International Affairs models CFRs in every country it comes in and buys off
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.200]  the establishment tells them they're the elite gets them to slowly incrementally
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.920]  generationally sell out their country and that's all these people are that
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.920]  presided over the gang raping of America want to tell you that sabotaging the
[15:18.920 --> 15:23.560]  election sabotaging Trump since during the internet calling all the American
[15:23.560 --> 15:28.880]  Patriots Russian agents all the things we've been sending people to shoot up the

[15:34.200 --> 15:40.360]  that is coming down and they're not gonna win and America is choosing what
[15:40.360 --> 15:43.760]  side it's on and they're gonna be defeated one way or another no matter
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.880]  how this goes for us individually they're going to be defeated because the
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.360]  cats out of the bag the genies out of the bottle the toothpaste ain't going

[21:03.520 --> 21:09.560]  the next segment let me just do this I just launched into the Nikki Haley
[21:09.560 --> 21:14.160]  revelations that broke yesterday afternoon I'm gonna get back into those
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.080]  and play a bunch of clips coming up here at the start of the next segment but I
[21:19.080 --> 21:25.840]  wanted to just do a big picture first thirty five thousand foot view here the
[21:25.840 --> 21:32.840]  Jeffrey Epstein revelations and attempts to cover it up has blown a giant hole in
[21:32.840 --> 21:38.640]  the globalist satanic ecosystem that cannot be repaired that's what I wrote
[21:38.640 --> 21:45.880]  yesterday for m4wars.com now think about that that's not just words that's not
[21:45.880 --> 21:55.320]  really sexy scary fiction science fiction meets horror horror fiction science
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.720]  horror fiction it's official Epstein blew a giant hole in the globalist satanic
[21:59.720 --> 22:04.360]  ecosystem that cannot be repaired DC pedophile networks outed
[22:04.360 --> 22:09.840]  Dems caught rigging election machines nationwide Trump declares we're kicking
[22:09.840 --> 22:16.120]  the New World Order's ass he actually said we're kicking the deep-states ass
[22:16.280 --> 22:22.520]  that was Sunday's show and that's what we covered because we're in an amazing
[22:22.520 --> 22:28.640]  time on a time of awakening of the biggest zeitgeist anywhere when a Navy
[22:28.640 --> 22:37.160]  Seal or a Army Ranger is on TV or somebody's at a football game and gets on
[22:37.160 --> 22:42.160]  a local TV or national television or people on a brewery so they're put on
[22:42.160 --> 22:46.800]  the bottom of each can Epstein didn't kill himself that act of the people
[22:46.800 --> 22:53.360]  showing how they can communicate in all these incredibly inventive ways will
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.640]  never be able to be stopped by authoritarians or by AI or by any of it
[22:57.640 --> 23:02.400]  and it's only when the system starts to try to suppress everyone's speech that
[23:02.400 --> 23:11.240]  people remember how valuable it is and start using it again so there is a
[23:11.240 --> 23:15.880]  giant awakening happening but the globalist knew that was coming so
[23:15.880 --> 23:21.640]  they're building a post-human world where human activity is obsolete and to do
[23:21.640 --> 23:26.680]  that they don't just make everything robotic and mechanized and
[23:26.680 --> 23:36.120]  technotronic technocratic they domesticate us and literally chemical eyes and
[23:36.120 --> 23:44.680]  brainwash the human resistance out of us to where we're helpless beyond
[23:44.680 --> 23:52.320]  domesticated slaves and so the fight for human future is really neck and neck
[23:52.320 --> 23:58.120]  between the two sides and a lot of people that are actually competent and
[23:58.120 --> 24:03.000]  good people are so tired of trying to wake up the general public that they
[24:03.000 --> 24:17.360]  decided to try to avoid the globalist to hide from it and when you do that when
[24:17.360 --> 24:20.960]  you try to hide from the globalist then they come looking for you and they say
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.640]  no do this for us and we'll leave you alone and then once they've gotten you
[24:25.640 --> 24:30.960]  to do that first thing you metaphysically aren't protected by God anymore
[24:30.960 --> 24:35.760]  and they get you to do more and more and more and then you find out that you are
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.840]  so close to the devil while you're right underneath his wing safe for the
[24:40.840 --> 24:49.880]  moment but destroyed for eternity think about that think about that so this is
[24:49.880 --> 24:53.280]  an amazing time and I think everybody really realizes now that I'm not just
[24:53.280 --> 24:58.120]  hyping that up that's really where we are at this historic economic cultural
[24:58.120 --> 25:08.200]  industrial spiritual galactic infinity jump point fork in the road crossroads
[25:08.200 --> 25:18.280]  isn't enough of a term but such a societal cultural species level decision
[25:18.280 --> 25:27.920]  and you see the establishment showing folks what side they're on you see the
[25:27.920 --> 25:34.400]  lawyers for the whistleblower and others coming out and saying we like kids we
[25:34.400 --> 25:42.080]  like pedophilia we like to get pedophiles jobs and national security why
[25:42.080 --> 25:49.560]  would you tweet that out because it's about rubbing our noses in it to break
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.000]  our will and normalize it so that when we get upset about it and warn people
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.920]  people go oh just get into it so even greater excesses can be exercised and
[25:58.920 --> 26:07.640]  visited upon us you feel safe you feel good deep inside laying down that no
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.800]  you don't you want to take action against it don't you well the question is how
[26:12.800 --> 26:16.000]  do we do that effectively without falling into the traps the system has set
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.880]  for us so when we come back I'm gonna get into just how massive and we cover a
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.200]  lot of really important things here it's all epic the fight between good and
[26:26.200 --> 26:35.800]  evil but Nikki Haley is somewhat politically correct is a TV ham but
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.120]  she gets you're not supposed to try to undermine the president you're not
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.760]  supposed to sabotage the president and she knows it's gonna come out in the
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.480]  deep-state criminal investigations that are going on about who was running the
[26:47.480 --> 26:55.600]  coup against the president that general Kelly and Rex Tillerson and others were
[26:55.600 --> 27:04.480]  working with Hillary Obama Mueller and all the rest of them because that's what
[27:04.480 --> 27:11.200]  they do they're from the establishment and then what they did is treasonous
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.400]  Kelly's quoted as saying well of trying to save the country and give the
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.160]  president the best advice there is in the government on things that are
[27:19.160 --> 27:23.680]  happening if that's undermining him then guilty is charged no we know what you
[27:23.680 --> 27:27.800]  did you would take his decisions and block them you throw stuff away you'd
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.880]  brag about it you'd shoot your mouths off you'd calling names because you would
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.520]  get in such a furor of the of the of the support you were getting in the
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.840]  establishment in the orgy of Trump hating that you would all shoot your
[27:40.840 --> 27:47.360]  mouths off the truth is this loser this big baby with this fake New York Times
[27:47.360 --> 27:54.640]  reportedly John Bolton written by the New York Times anonymous book about
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.360]  Trump being such a buffoon it's just more of fire and fury and more of all
[27:59.360 --> 28:04.560]  the rest of it that's coming out you know right as the impeachment warms up
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.280]  into Thanksgiving with the vote in the house and then into Christmas and by
[28:09.280 --> 28:12.400]  the time you figure out one thing's a hoax they've got a new hoax and a new
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.320]  hoax a new hoax and Lindsey Graham is saying hey don't worry it'll be dead

[28:20.640 --> 28:24.620]  other crap on the way to the Senate and they're gonna twist those arms till they
[28:24.620 --> 28:33.360]  break off in the Senate all they need 20 senators and so I wouldn't take the
[28:33.360 --> 28:39.080]  confidence talk from Graham as if it's a sure thing my guts never wrong and I'm
[28:39.080 --> 28:44.160]  telling you that this whole country and President Trump of the world is in grave

[33:18.160 --> 33:41.920]  of the info war
[33:41.920 --> 33:49.040]  we are back live broadcasting world-wide I am your host alex jones and we're
[33:49.040 --> 33:54.320]  only here on air because of you and if you just joined us nicky hayley's
[33:54.320 --> 34:00.200]  revelations simply confirm everything that we'd already told you about not
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.360]  just the democrat deep state but the republican deep state trying to take the
[34:04.360 --> 34:07.640]  president out I'm gonna go to these clips and break it down and give out the
[34:07.640 --> 34:13.640]  number here in just a moment now as a lot of you know I said that the
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.360]  everything must go mega special was gonna end last Sunday and I usually
[34:18.360 --> 34:23.240]  extend sales a couple days because I'm so busy covering news and stories and
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.080]  filing reports that I never have time to come up with the new sale until the old
[34:29.080 --> 34:33.080]  sale is supposed to already be over and because of election fraud in Kentucky
[34:33.080 --> 34:36.040]  that we pioneered and broke with our investigative journalist that's just
[34:36.040 --> 34:40.240]  earthshaking and all the probably 20 hours I've spent on that since last
[34:40.240 --> 34:48.000]  Friday and just all the other continual big breaking stories that I'm filing and
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.480]  putting out and all the other things I'm doing here I was up here chilled eight
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.280]  o'clock at night every day last week on average some nights 10 o'clock some nights
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.360]  seven o'clock but I was up here I've been up there seven days a week and I'm
[35:02.360 --> 35:08.760]  not tooting my horn this is an important time and it's very hard to not stay in
[35:08.760 --> 35:12.720]  the gunner's seat when you've got targets and the fight for liberty is so
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.920]  close against evil so that's why there is new specials and quite frankly there
[35:17.920 --> 35:25.080]  may not be for a couple days because I just have so much to do and so much
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.720]  research to do on critical things that I'm not able to look at all the
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.360]  inventory and go over it all and come up with a new specials but I'll tell you
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.920]  this what I told Tim for Shay that runs this last week as I said just things
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.120]  that are almost sold out we can't not have inventory of a lot of this take them
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.640]  off sale so that's what's happened with the sale is of the hundreds of great
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.520]  items there upwards of a third of them or more now have either sold out or
[35:51.520 --> 35:56.600]  about to sell out so they're going off from sale at 50% off to regular price
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.800]  to super blue fluoride free a toothpaste we have plenty of the children so it's
[36:00.800 --> 36:06.440]  still a 50% off that's an example of what's going on at infowarstore.com and
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.520]  I've talked about to fund ourselves we've kept these big sales going selling
[36:10.520 --> 36:13.440]  on a product not even knowing which products we're going to be able to keep
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.080]  in stock into the future but obviously our best sellers we are reordering are
[36:17.080 --> 36:22.640]  going to have those for you at least for now but that's how serious this fight
[36:22.640 --> 36:29.720]  is so your purchases of the products make everything we do here possible now
[36:29.720 --> 36:38.000]  that said we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.840]  they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them want to
[36:40.840 --> 36:45.000]  thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game-changing
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.920]  toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five a
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.600]  colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's these
[36:54.600 --> 36:57.600]  are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers
[36:57.600 --> 37:03.280]  people love it this is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea
[37:03.280 --> 37:10.640]  coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth then it has the
[37:10.640 --> 37:16.560]  patented silver saw silver in it to knock out the bacteria that caused
[37:16.560 --> 37:21.400]  gingivitis this is all proven you can make claims of this and so much more and
[37:21.400 --> 37:28.080]  it's concentrated as well now it costs more to produce than super blue and it's
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.000]  apples and oranges so this is not meant to compete the super blue that has
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.920]  thousands and thousands of five-star reviews but I have to tell you no one
[37:36.920 --> 37:42.200]  has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.960]  cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel a lot of
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.080]  the cleansing toothpaste really do cleanse them but they eat your teeth
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.000]  this is designed by my father we still got his license please retired dentist
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.200]  and oral surgeon working with the top silver producers the folks that put
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.160]  this out of the ones that supply the silver products the hospitals and over
[38:02.160 --> 38:05.400]  the counter as well they put out the silver wound gel you love so much for
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.080]  the only ones in the country allowed to private label that this is not a private
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.000]  label like the super silver wound gel this is proprietary that we made with
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.120]  them the silver cream the face cream with a hyaluronic acid and all the key
[38:18.120 --> 38:22.960]  minerals and vitamins that people love men and women they're the ones that
[38:22.960 --> 38:30.760]  helped us make this two years in the making two years and it doesn't have
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.480]  the iodine it's the only way it's different from super blue so we're
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.520]  really proud of it it funds the operation info or store.com it will sell
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.800]  out in the next two three days but the good news is in December it looks like
[38:43.800 --> 38:51.240]  we're gonna they're manufacturing it in Denver right now so it's
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.840]  being made in Denver right now and again you've got to pay for the patents and all
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.360]  of it to have the silver salt so that's why even discount 25% is $14.95
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.840]  because this is not your regular toothpaste I can sell super silver you
[39:06.840 --> 39:10.760]  know products discounted like the skin cream is we don't have to pay for the
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.040]  patents for that even though it has the patented ingredient in it I was able to
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.040]  get a better deal not on this it's still amazing info or store.com of the 12

[40:00.840 --> 40:04.760]  do marketing when I'm tired after the show I can't get excited about marketing

[40:49.240 --> 40:54.000]  want to shut down look at how the internal coup against the president with
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.640]  John Kelly and Rex Tillerson with the deep state with the Democrats and we
[40:59.640 --> 41:02.580]  first told you about that that's why they wanted this destroyed because we had
[41:02.580 --> 41:09.040]  guest on exposing by name who the deep state globalist are who the fake
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.560]  whistleblower is Sierra Mella and all of them and they they were in foreign

[41:47.400 --> 41:52.280]  bull I'm an American I care about freedom and I'm not gonna be their slave
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.840]  they are a bunch of baby killing devil worshiping scum that run it and then a
[41:57.840 --> 42:01.040]  bunch of yes men that love to be told how smart they are and how great they
[42:01.040 --> 42:04.080]  are and how they're the best and how they're gonna save America from us evil
[42:04.080 --> 42:08.720]  Americans in flyover country they have this elitist attitude towards everybody
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.920]  and I'm sick of it they're not elitist all these people in the government at
[42:12.920 --> 42:16.560]  that level got there by brown nosing they got there by being yes men and
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.120]  that's why they were promoted Trump came from the outside just like I did just
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.720]  like you do and that's why they're so scared of us and that's why we're still
[42:23.720 --> 42:28.000]  on air thanks to you and our local affiliates and I'll say this it's just
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.600]  as important to support M4s as it is to support the local affiliates who are
[42:32.600 --> 42:37.480]  these shows put us on we're standing up for babies most your churches aren't I
[42:37.480 --> 42:41.120]  would give your money to the local radio stations the year it's on literally I
[42:41.120 --> 42:44.680]  make a tithe weekly or monthly instead of those local churches that won't do a
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.880]  damn thing but make you feel good about eternity while selling out

[42:52.520 --> 42:55.880]  hardcore report on the treason that's been discovered and confirmed it's so
[42:55.880 --> 43:02.360]  bombshell stay with us folks ask me Alex why do you have two different types
[43:02.360 --> 43:07.240]  of iodine well that's because different types of physiology's different types of
[43:07.240 --> 43:12.800]  metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just that simple
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.160]  x3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[43:18.160 --> 43:24.160]  all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're
[43:24.160 --> 43:28.000]  both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.520]  family or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the
[43:33.520 --> 43:39.040]  globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.760]  sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality I don't
[43:42.760 --> 43:48.920]  enforce or calm and help fund the info or info or store calm we've got a huge
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.280]  sale running right now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types
[43:53.280 --> 44:00.920]  of iodine with selenium for 60% off together the witch queen of the deep
[44:00.920 --> 44:06.960]  state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate whores
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.200]  in the media busily covering up her giant had a file in blackmail rings
[44:11.200 --> 44:17.320]  thought that her victory was assured now that the enemy lost that election they

[48:49.640 --> 48:52.480]  few weeks ago he said the hardest government he's had to deal with is the
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.720]  US government because it's not the US government it's the imperial globalist
[48:56.720 --> 49:04.920]  court they transferred America into an imperial empire and they want the
[49:04.920 --> 49:09.040]  American people to pay for that corporate empire that benefits the Chai

[49:39.080 --> 49:45.200]  zeitgeist you were the zeitgeist literally with Kelly was in the New York
[49:45.200 --> 49:48.440]  Times the Washington Post everywhere but I confirmed inside the White House it
[49:48.440 --> 49:58.280]  was do not let him have info wars calm do not let the president talk to people
[49:58.280 --> 50:06.200]  like Dinesh DeSousa they tried to keep Trump Jr. out who brings him the truth
[50:06.200 --> 50:13.120]  Trump doesn't know all of this stuff until people show him and he knows we
[50:13.120 --> 50:22.800]  exposed Fiona Hill first here we exposed Sierra Mella here simultaneously with
[50:22.800 --> 50:30.080]  Mike Cernovich and the deep state thought that Cernovich and I had the same
[50:30.080 --> 50:35.800]  sources we learned later they were different sources and I never out sources
[50:35.800 --> 50:43.920]  he had quite a few and still does but it was public that Don Jr. was releasing
[50:43.920 --> 50:46.960]  information so when I released that I was not releasing that one of his sources
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.720]  was Don Jr. he still got pissed off about it no fine I guess that draws
[50:52.720 --> 50:56.000]  attention to what's already admitted but there are a bunch of other sources and
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.600]  then inside Google sources and everywhere else why do you think on this show
[51:00.600 --> 51:06.000]  repeatedly it's been brought up by James O'Keefe that when we got all these
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.720]  videos inside Twitter Facebook and Google it's you it's info wars is the
[51:09.720 --> 51:16.000]  number one thing they name you that that their bosses want you shut down you
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.360]  must have really done something James O'Keefe said yeah we did something we
[51:21.360 --> 51:26.840]  accurately assessed the geopolitical system and the ruling political class in
[51:26.840 --> 51:33.960]  this nation that hates America and is now externalized the hierarchy where the
[51:33.960 --> 51:38.800]  hatred of America and the globalist ideology of the people at the top of it
[51:38.800 --> 51:45.680]  is now openly taught everywhere and the British under Cecil Rhodes tried this
[51:45.680 --> 51:52.160]  from up the 1890s to the 1940s it failed it wasn't the British people but they
[51:52.160 --> 51:57.440]  called them Anglophiles they called it an Atlantic accent where Americans who
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.280]  were in the first movies and on radio would talk with a British accent and
[52:01.280 --> 52:05.720]  Americans were taught to drink tea and love the Queen and all the tabloids
[52:05.720 --> 52:08.520]  you ever wonder why you go to the checkout counter it's the Queen and how
[52:08.520 --> 52:14.040]  great she is British intelligence spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the
[52:14.040 --> 52:21.400]  last hundred and twenty years or so or more making you love the monarchy we had
[52:21.400 --> 52:27.960]  a war with that monarchy Churchill wrote three books the history of the English
[52:27.960 --> 52:32.440]  speaking peoples about how he wanted to merge the Empire with America and it
[52:32.440 --> 52:35.880]  happened and I'm not even against people that are Anglophiles I'm proud of my
[52:35.880 --> 52:43.360]  British background the point is or Welsh a little bit north of the British it
[52:43.360 --> 52:47.720]  doesn't matter it's the global corporate system that uses pedophilia and
[52:47.720 --> 52:52.520]  corruption it's not British it's globalist they perfected it through the
[52:52.520 --> 52:55.680]  British East India Company and all these corporate governance systems that's all
[52:55.680 --> 53:02.080]  this is and so John Kelly and all these people came up through that the Exxon
[53:02.080 --> 53:06.800]  mobile head they all tell Trump their loyal to his face how smart he is to his
[53:06.800 --> 53:11.320]  face and then they behind his back try to sabotage the agenda try to leak try to
[53:11.320 --> 53:19.120]  remove him from office because they were put in by the establishment you ask
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.560]  why does Trump then do this well he thought the former head of the border
[53:23.560 --> 53:31.880]  patrol would be good Kelly and Kelly you know did had a good resume and the same
[53:31.880 --> 53:36.840]  thing with Tillerson but they still came out of the swamp but now Trump knows you
[53:36.840 --> 53:40.120]  saw him a month ago say anybody that's been a member of Trump or I don't care
[53:40.120 --> 53:44.240]  who you are you're out of my administration and now you've got the
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.280]  anonymous book being written by the New York Times coming out and I think this
[53:47.280 --> 53:50.940]  week right for the impeachment officially that starts with the from
[53:50.940 --> 53:58.240]  secret kangaroo hearings to the show trial and think about Trump he's got to
[53:58.240 --> 54:06.000]  have the never-trumper vitamin is still in the White House on the National
[54:06.000 --> 54:12.400]  Security Council he can't even get rid of these people they're all-rounding
[54:13.160 --> 54:18.400]  undermining sabotaging lying leaking this info and then when you've got this
[54:18.400 --> 54:26.040]  Eric Sierra Mella that we expose as a CIA operative trying to overthrow Trump two
[54:26.040 --> 54:34.720]  plus years ago in late 2017 that's what the CIA does is overthrow countries and
[54:34.720 --> 54:40.960]  now the rogue leftist globalist America hating CIA run by all these blue
[54:40.960 --> 54:47.280]  bloods all these libtards all these libtards that have a hard-on for America
[54:47.280 --> 54:53.360]  because they're all limp-rested cowards and the Sierra Mella's lawyer can't stop
[54:53.360 --> 54:57.840]  talking about how much he admires Epstein when he was in jail and how he has
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.120]  pedophile clients how he gets some national security clearances and how
[55:02.120 --> 55:08.440]  much he loves visiting children's parks taking photos with them sick man but you
[55:08.440 --> 55:13.000]  know they think they're better than us because we put up with it and they're
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.840]  dug in now the federal government funds drag Queen's story time and so does the
[55:19.840 --> 55:23.320]  EU because they want you to get used to your kids sitting in the laps big fat
[55:23.320 --> 55:29.400]  men dressed like women but oh the bad guys Trump but he's the big buffoon he's
[55:29.400 --> 55:34.160]  the big idiot he's the guy they were going to defeat but he beat them coming
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.040]  from the outside self-made his own system outside of their system and that's
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.240]  why they hate Mavericks it's why you get into the whole homeland security thing
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.480]  they're worried about individuals that have leadership that they don't control
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.120]  because it's a power cult
[55:49.120 --> 55:58.920]  it's a coup against the election of 2016 and they intend to win because
[55:58.920 --> 56:03.720]  everything these losers have done is bet on finally defeating America they can't
[56:03.720 --> 56:07.760]  win any war they launch they just make trillions off of it and feed our men and
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.040]  women into meat riders they're totally inept they didn't see the fall of the
[56:11.040 --> 56:15.520]  Soviet Union the fall of Berlin Wall they just sit around flying around all
[56:15.520 --> 56:19.120]  rich and powerful with their thumbs their rear ends a bunch of blue blood in
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.700]  bread social retards they don't remember Bush senior didn't know what a food
[56:25.700 --> 56:30.720]  scanner was 15 years after they were ubiquitous they're on their own planet
[56:30.720 --> 56:35.320]  but we all step and fetch and bow down to them so we think that's just the way
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.760]  it is I'm gonna go to break and come back and take your phone calls and get to
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.800]  these Nikki Haley clips and all the rest of it but here's from the vault two
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.760]  years ago when they're reporting that info wars has banned the White House by
[56:46.760 --> 56:53.760]  John Kelly according to gizmodo the new White House chief of staff John Kelly
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.720]  has told President Trump's aides to not bring the president any news stories
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.720]  from info wars a conspiracy theory website funded by Alex Jones this
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.600]  website covers stories such as child slavery on Mars another website Axios
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.800]  says that got news a website run by far-right blogger Chuck Johnson has
[57:11.800 --> 57:16.560]  also been banned Johnson said to the Washington Examiner we in the alternative
[57:16.560 --> 57:22.400]  media won the election for Trump ladies and gentlemen a million dollars you
[57:22.400 --> 57:25.600]  can find me say there's slave colonies on Mars never said it just totally a
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.560]  lie but that's who these people are they've had their foot on America's neck
[57:31.560 --> 57:36.440]  for a long time because we were asleep now we're not asleep and all they're
[57:36.440 --> 57:39.600]  doing is pissing us off the only question is how bad is it gonna go for
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.320]  them a sick part of me hopes they remove Trump it's gonna blow up in their face
[57:44.320 --> 57:52.560]  ten times worse the red bug the time has come to defy the thought police they
[57:52.560 --> 57:56.800]  are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year they're waging war
[57:56.800 --> 58:02.160]  on communication itself as the Fabian socialist promise they would do more
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.480]  than 70 years ago from their command base in England we've had Oxford come out
[58:07.480 --> 58:12.840]  and ban clapping the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of
[58:12.840 --> 58:17.800]  college destroy you have you arrested in some areas if you do the okay symbol

[58:21.960 --> 58:26.840]  doing these people are authoritarian and they're dangerous and the answer to
[58:26.840 --> 58:31.800]  their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face we have a it's okay to be
[58:31.800 --> 58:36.040]  okay politically incorrect ball cap it's black and white very nice as the okay

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:16.920]  through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones. Oh the MI6 founder and
[1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:23.760]  main funder of the White Helmets so ISIS Al-Nazar Al-Qaeda could jump back and
[1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:28.160]  forth between the ambulances and to their mortars and heavy machine guns
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:33.840]  just got found dead in his home in Turkey. Yes he didn't complete the mission
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:39.000]  like he was supposed to so now the cleanup crews are out another so-called
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.520]  James Bond found out that James Bond is just a fantasy this is the reality
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:55.440]  pushing daisies now hmm wonder wonder what happened to him he looks so young
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:01:01.400]  and healthy how what are how John McCain's doing he helps set all that up
[1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:10.400]  too he's not doing too well now so I'm gonna go to your phone calls starting
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:17.360]  next segment and I think then I'll play these clips to that all go together and
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:26.520]  just recap briefly but think about how we've gotten comfortable with just the
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:31.080]  terms of mainstream news saying we're in a civil war well between who are the
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:37.160]  sides and that the president was sabotaged by Secretary of State and his
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:42.720]  chief of staff they were undermining him trying to get him removed trying to
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:48.120]  stop the will of the people sabotaging when he signed executive orders they
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:53.760]  just throw him away he'd say declassify this and they wouldn't do it they
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:01.840]  protected the deep state and now yeah print me that article yeah now mainline
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:05.640]  news is saying oh the civil war is begun yeah where'd you hear that first and I'm
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.680]  not up here saying hey we told you this hey we told you that first to go oh look
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:14.880]  we're big we're smart the deep state wants us off air because we are actually
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:21.200]  looking at the real blueprints we're not singing from some choir hymn of leftist
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:27.040]  garbage or establishment rhino bilge we've done the original research we know
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:34.560]  what we're talking about we have the real scan of the topography of the layout
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.680]  of this system and we know what the globalists are up to and we know how to
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:44.720]  defeat them toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539 already have loaded
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.640]  phones but now when you hear somebody hang up that's your chance to call in if

[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:08.560]  I'm gonna play five clips when we come back in the next 10-minute segment and
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:14.560]  just lay out the the magnitude because again I say this constantly we're
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:19.400]  covering huge issues all the time but Nikki Haley coming out and laying out
[1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:23.200]  what we already knew when we first broke that's been confirmed by many others is
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:28.480]  just incredible because it gives us the blueprint on how to defeat these people
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:34.440]  and I'll explain that as quickly and as focused as I can you've got my
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:39.240]  commitment on the other side of this break to do it I'm begging you for

[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:12.040]  disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:21.760]  info war it is Monday November 11th 2019 your phone calls from balanced
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:26.240]  transmission coming up let's get right to it
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:31.680]  Nikki Haley has come out confirming but we first broke more than two years ago
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:36.880]  from inside White House sources and patriots inside the State Department CIA
[1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:41.880]  and the Department of Defense Nikki Haley reveals attempted sabotage against
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.720]  America and President Trump attempts to derail Trump and suburb of 2016 election
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:53.280]  is a hundred percent textbook treason and Nikki Haley has now come out ladies
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:59.840]  and gentlemen and exposed the facts that Rex Tillerson and John Kelly were
[1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:03.920]  saying oh save America don't do what he says he's not executive orders they
[1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:10.640]  literally shred them that is a federal crime obstruction it is just fraud but
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:17.440]  they but Kelly says hey if giving him the best advice of the government is bad
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:24.680]  that I'm guilty no you obstructed the president again these are yes men from
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.320]  the establishment told what geniuses they are now Trump's this buffoon by this
[1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:33.520]  deep state that's hijacked our country and literally has run the nation into
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:38.480]  the ground so you guys must be really pathetic if Trump and in force run
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:43.560]  circles around you and that's really the solution here is these guys think they're
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:48.080]  so incredible as white shoe boys and so invincible why are they so worried about
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:55.280]  info wars why are they so worried about Trump you see the truth is they've sold
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.080]  out to the chai comms and others pretty easy to run the country and run in the
[1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:02.480]  ground and sell it off we're fighting back against you we're not a bunch of
[1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:06.240]  yes men and either as congressman Scalise or congressman Jordan or
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:12.920]  congressman newness or some of the best senators that are up there like the
[1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:20.680]  senator from Missouri hurly turly all those guys are fighting hard so let's
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:26.880]  go ahead and go to Nikki Haley laying out this incredible piece of the puzzle
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:31.000]  and then the secretary of state tiller someone on to tell you the reason he
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.760]  resisted the president's decisions was because if he didn't people would die do
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:41.640]  you memorialize that conversation it definitely happened it absolutely
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:46.040]  happened and instead of saying that to me they should have been saying that to
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:51.800]  the president not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan it should have
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:55.560]  been go tell the president what your differences are and quit if you don't
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:01.800]  like what he's doing but to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:05.840]  and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:12.040]  people want it was was offensive we asked them to respond John Kelly tells
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:16.880]  Sunday morning if by resistance and stalling she means putting a staff
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:21.200]  process in place to ensure the president knew all the pros and cons of what
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:25.520]  policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:34.400]  decision then guilty is charged so there you go know what they did was go around
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.240]  and try to organize a cabal against the president in the name of saving America
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:43.360]  never actually again confronting him and then look at the policies they wanted
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:48.640]  the endless war deindustrialization open borders the UN running our refugee
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:52.680]  program and saying who could come into the country not the president he
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:10:01.640]  reversed that the Trans Pacific Partnership all of it and now they
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:04.880]  said oh we'll just crash the economy and raise interest rates eight times to
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:09.560]  start that process these people are our mortal enemies we don't need friends like
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:17.640]  them remember just because Kelly wore a uniform so did Benedict Arnold think
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:22.040]  about that these are globalist these are yes men they got put in positions of
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.560]  power anybody the military I'll tell you somebody gets to general level now it
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:29.280]  means they've sold people out it means they'll do what they're told the
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:33.680]  military is now a social engineering brainwashing facility they're replacing
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:36.840]  the troops with robots
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:47.880]  now here's Roger Stone in 2017 and we got another clip of him just a year and a
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.280]  half ago breaking down John Kelly now they were working with Steve Bannon to
[1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:57.880]  bring in the deep state and only sorrows people like Fiona Hill and Eric
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:07.000]  Sierra Mella what does Bannon do he leaves in August and by October he has a
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:14.680]  financial deal with clock to finance a band to finance Breitbart as the
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.880]  mercers who I do think are patriots appear to be ready to throw in Trump a
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:25.360]  trader at the same time talking to a snake reporter that he brought into the
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:30.240]  henhouse and at the same time using national security intel to then go
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:34.800]  basically get money off of somebody so that he could be the person's political
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:39.840]  protector by every stretch the imagination by every historical yardstick
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:45.520]  this sounds like treason to me and then that's a particular clip dealing with
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.800]  Bannon the clips we have you can just type into Google if you want Roger Stone
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:57.320]  says Kelly's on his way out Roger Stone says that Kelly has brought in sorrow
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:00.880]  sites those of the clips I said the crew will play those for you a little bit
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:07.760]  later but continuing here now ladies and gentlemen we have the New York Times
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:13.840]  coming out saying they're getting ready to publish this anonymous book the word
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:22.760]  is it's John Bolton we know wants to testify against the president even
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:25.480]  though there's a separation of powers the president by law is supposed to be
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:28.400]  able to keep him doing it he wants to go bear the false witness because he's a
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:33.360]  neocon was always a neocon but lied to Trump's face that he would try to carry
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:39.080]  out the president's agenda the person that we elected book review is a warning
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:44.400]  anonymous author makes case against reelection and Steve Pachennick who's
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:48.320]  worked with a lot of these people says that John Bolton is today's Benedict
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:55.360]  Arnold here he is from his YouTube channel hi this is Dr. Pachennick and
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:13:00.840]  today I want to talk about John Bolton the Benedict Arnold of America now why
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:07.400]  do I say that a book came out that was written by anonymous and it's written
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:12.560]  about the Trump administration and how childish they are how pure and how
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:17.600]  effective they are in fact John Bolton calls the president a 12-year-old but
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:22.040]  doesn't know what his mental condition is I haven't to know John Bolton and I
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:26.160]  think he's a sociopath but as an intelligence operative what I did was to
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:31.440]  create agitation propaganda I purposely created a proposal for my own book
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:36.720]  which will come out in a few weeks which talks about the real Jack Ryan and the
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:41.360]  person who really implemented a lot of the coups and countercoups in this
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:46.520]  administration now I'm doing another coup what I'm trying to do is to get John
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:53.600]  Bolton blown out of the water because he came in as an anonymous writer what and
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:58.200]  how did I figure that out number one the passages that came out and were written
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:02.560]  in the New York Times and Washington Post said the following thanks to our
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:08.400]  great 9-11 a situation we have gone into now a purile situation or self
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.120]  destructive situation in other words what John had written and the only person
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.480]  who could write that was somebody deeply involved in 9-11 when I wrote my
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:21.160]  proposal and presented it to Hachette and I'll talk about Hachette in a minute
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:25.480]  they turned me down immediately because they knew that the history of the real
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:33.280]  Jack Ryan was involved in breaking up the 9-11 coup now let me say to you how
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.600]  this came about John Bolton's figure in personality fits what we call in the
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:46.560]  intelligence world mice M standing for money I for ideology C for cash or for
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.320]  compromise and E for ego John needs the money he's ideologically always been a
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:58.360]  neocon see he's always been compromised by someone or an institution in this
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:03.960]  case Yale where he went to Yale and worked with Bob Woodward and John Kerry
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:10.320]  who would now on ABC News and NBC News and the last one was ego his ego is
[1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:16.000]  immense Carl Ford one of my intelligence operatives said correctly that John
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:22.200]  needed to always suck up to the superior and always deprecate the bottom
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:27.440]  ladies and gentlemen the CIA is a rogue agency out of control run by foreign

[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:10.840]  metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just that
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:16.280]  simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:22.280]  people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get
[1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:26.400]  both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give
[1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:31.320]  the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:36.160]  harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:40.880]  lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high

[1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:05.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:32.640]  we know that Rex Tillerson and John Kelly working with the deep state help
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:38.360]  bring in people like John Bolton make master the rod and Fiona Hill all of
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:44.400]  them we expose them at the time these guys are part of butt sniffing white
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:49.320]  shoe boy establishment types who get into power because they go to these
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:54.280]  committees of the globalist of the establishment and make sure that all the
[1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:58.000]  lawyers and everyone signs off on what they do and then they just organize the
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.560]  sell-off of the country and now they're pissed we elected a president that
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.960]  actually thinks he's running the country and they're trying to cause a
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:09.280]  depression and a civil war to get him out and finally defeat their enemy the
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:14.280]  American people and just because people think oh Kelly was in the Marine Corps
[1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:18.680]  yeah well Benedict Arnold was the most decorated general after George Washington
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:25.080]  and he was a British double agent these guys like to play both sides of the
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:30.840]  fence they think it's smart that way they always just go up up up up up up as
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:34.880]  the country and the world goes down down down but I told you we disagree go to
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:40.480]  the head of the line whistleblower in Texas that's like a royal title almost
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:45.320]  whistleblower it's like dossier I better keep your anonymity secret but
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:49.520]  those being accused are publicly on trial the whistleblower says that maybe
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:53.880]  I'm a pumpkin I'll turn into one it's a magical thing whistleblower in Texas
[1:21:53.880 --> 1:22:00.720]  disagrees says Trump should resign tell us tell us well Trump's next move is
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:06.040]  resignation you know how he's got the how he's just given up residency in
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:09.960]  New York he's going to Florida he's gonna he's gonna back his lizard bottom in
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:17.560]  the sun and play golf and be on trial for the remainder of his days he might
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:24.120]  not ever go to jail but that's that's what's next who knows how long it's
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:28.240]  gonna take but that that's the the dominoes that are falling well you sound
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:33.720]  like you have satisfaction like you're powerful and if this happens it's like a
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:40.160]  victory for you is that what you think no I think I think it's just hopefully
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:47.520]  the the way that I've read it I don't I don't revel in I don't revel in our
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:54.000]  country having gone through such a terrible crisis but I see this as being
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:59.240]  the result you know the end result like him trying to control the totally open
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:02.880]  border and the UN flooding us on purpose or him getting out of the TPP that
[1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:06.960]  Hillary secretly wrote that's one-sided trade deals I mean just the terrible
[1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:12.240]  crisis of having a president actually try to be president no I think it's a
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:17.920]  person that didn't intend to be president in the first place he was just
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.240]  running a PR campaign so he could do the apprentice for he's gonna do really what
[1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:25.600]  does that say about the big establishment Hillary that didn't see it
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:33.000]  coming and there isn't one that's what it says it says there isn't one it says
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:39.680]  that that's a fantasy oh you're with an older downloaded propaganda where
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:45.160]  globalism doesn't exist the deep state doesn't exist oh there's hold on a
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:48.560]  second there's no anti-Christian or anti-Christmas movement there's no
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:52.360]  anti Thanksgiving movement that's all over the news there's no attempt to
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:57.840]  sexualize children what you're saying is is oh so there's no permanent
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:02.960]  establishment in DC I mean there is one there are a bunch of idiots who all
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:06.040]  tell each other how great they are they're getting their ass kicked yeah
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:11.640]  yeah there's that and then there's and then there's just real people you know
[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:18.440]  this is this global cabal whatnot is is all fantasy Balderdash whatever so
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:22.640]  wait a minute when G.G. Ping went to when G.G. Ping almost three years ago in
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:27.800]  in early 2017 right after Trump was inaugurated when he went to Debo's and
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:33.000]  said our global government will continue Communist China will empower it you know
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:38.240]  David Rockefeller you know helped us we will help you defeat Trump and whenever
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.400]  Yunker the literal heir of the Nazi fortune whose grandfather ran Nazi
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:46.080]  Germany with Hitler said we'll stop the Americans we'll teach them we'll teach
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:52.360]  the Brits not to leave none of that was real oh so I I don't know what your
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:55.640]  reference thing so well you're saying there's no global government there's no
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:03.680]  deep state there's just there's none of that yeah yeah and I think I just want
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:10.880]  to say thanks for playing that drop from a face in the crowd last week the
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:17.760]  Andy Griffith movie yes that was that was a wild ride quite enjoyable

[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:35.960]  we'll play it after the next break for TV and radio listeners but sir what I'm
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:41.000]  telling you is there is a global corporate governance system that is
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:47.300]  screwing over everyone and his tax exempt and then Trump gets in and actually
[1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:50.560]  sees America getting one-sided trade deals and just wants to get a better
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:54.920]  deal for the country and exercise real American power instead of selling out
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.040]  American power and then you make childish statements about how there's no
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:03.560]  global government there's no deep state when it's in all their emails it's in
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:08.040]  the WikiLeaks it's these corrupt groups they are incompetent they are a bunch
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:13.280]  of inbred scum and Trump's right on Friday when he said we're kicking their
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.960]  ass did you see that video I've read the headline sure sure would you like me to
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:24.840]  play that clip for you to you can play anything you want my phone's about to
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:28.520]  die and I know but there's this arrogance of people that think they're
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:32.800]  part of the establishment who say there isn't an establishment so that we can
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:36.920]  never get to square one about saying hey let's have the rule of law and a pro
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:41.760]  American future govern our nation and let's get this all these special
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:45.160]  interest out that think they own and run the country and then one side of deals
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:48.960]  to China and others I mean that's a fact it's a fact China owns our debt it's a
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:53.240]  fact China owns most of Hollywood and controls all these movies and I don't
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:57.720]  like that we don't control their movies and I mean are you saying the chai comms
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:01.520]  aren't trying to run our country we control everyone because we have
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:07.520]  Hollywood but no if you buy up Hollywood then then America doesn't
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:12.920]  control it and then and what is America Hollywood is a bunch of America haters
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:17.400]  that tell us the country was never great will ever be great this is the
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:20.440]  greatest country on the fucking planet all right you just cussed I got to let
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:25.920]  you go there's a lot of people that buying into hating Trump because they
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:29.920]  get to bitch about it at work and they get to talk about it and whine about it
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:34.440]  and have some fake solidarity but these are all followers and they're all
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:42.120]  people that wouldn't help you out in a jam they're all sunshine patriots folks
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:46.720]  they're not winter soldiers and Trump's a winter soldier and he's done a really
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:51.240]  kick-ass job and everybody's being put under massive pressure to turn their
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:54.280]  back on him just like they've been put under pressure to turn their back on us
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:58.200]  and they're being told oh as soon as he's gone all the problems will be gone
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:02.480]  and all the infighting will be gone the people creating the infighting and the
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:06.440]  racial division and the attack on our children are the ones that were already
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:10.400]  doing it they just accelerated their program when President Trump got into
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:15.760]  office and now they're the ones trying to crash the economy in the words of
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.720]  Bill Maher to teach Americans not to support nationalism they're the ones
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:24.880]  that tell us nationalism is dirty and nationalism is bad and all you fools
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:29.040]  that happen to be tuning in on our regular listeners but the people that
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:32.680]  really think you're betting on the winning team I told you Trump was gonna
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:37.440]  win he did I told you globalism is in trouble you can see it it's back on its
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:43.040]  heels and even if you remove Trump which there's a 50-50 chance I think not
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:48.080]  during this cycle when he in a second turn that is an even bigger defeat for
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:52.920]  you you watch and all the censorship that's happened to shut us up it ain't

[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:20.280]  handle an executive session this is CNN
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:29.080]  those morons out there I got them like this you know what the public's like a

[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:26.480]  me think of it where she goes look you don't tell him we're gonna take all
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:31.440]  their guns from the stupid flyover country Christians and then Obama saying
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:34.840]  yeah the bitter clingers I'm not gonna let him know I'm gonna take their guns
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:42.240]  and their Bibles and their kids he didn't say that part until I get in but
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:47.760]  we're gonna put a big cuz I want to do a big review of face in the crowd and
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:55.680]  notice they point that film because they're leftist Hollywood scum at Roy
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:59.280]  Rogers who was a populace that they couldn't get the people to hate so that
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.200]  movie was against Roy Rogers after he was gone and dead
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:14.200]  or will Rogers and I'm teleproper free folks so that's how they operate and I
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:18.760]  don't feel good imagining conning people I don't get a good little spring in my
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:23.280]  step calling in like that last caller no wonder he likes that movie I guess it's
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.840]  about him he thinks no one way I read this he'll be gone real quick he's
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:35.480]  already running down there to Florida shut in his lizard butt in the sun and
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:40.920]  the satisfaction that that guy has like he's part of the establishment is
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:45.960]  sickening isn't it I mean you heard it for yourself
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:51.520]  meanwhile our children are being sexualized they're killing babies after
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:58.400]  they're born 5g is going in that gives people cancer on record the society's
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:02.080]  falling apart all these federal judges are trying to block Trump but he wins
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:07.360]  every Supreme Court case he's gotten or love to overturn the Constitution and
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:12.080]  this guy's like our nation will be alright he'll be gone soon our nation
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:15.800]  will be alright when Trump says we should love our nation and it's good to
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.360]  have countries CNN and MSNBC says that's racist that a country existing is
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.480]  bad
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:31.320]  but you hear the conceit from people that think they're part of the
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:37.080]  establishment when 99.99% of people that go along with globalism are
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:42.960]  screwing their own future but they don't care these are the people that tune
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:49.680]  into Bill Maher and feel like he's their buddy I've noticed the ratio of people
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:54.880]  that are for the establishment is how much television they watch I mean and
[1:37:54.880 --> 1:38:01.800]  also the bigger the losers they are they're either on welfare or they've
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:05.600]  got three degrees that are worthless they can't make a living but they get to
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:10.320]  mentor young people that means brainwash them so so the currency they they want
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:14.760]  is having people in their cult but they don't even get any power out of that
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:19.640]  either you get power out of empowering people then the rising tide raises you
[1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:25.880]  globalism doesn't empower people it's a post-human system I'm gonna go to your
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:30.160]  phone calls said I'd go quickly with that one caller got a whole segment but
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:35.040]  since I mentioned it here's Trump because he is kicking the deep-states
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:39.560]  ass we're for everything that is proven to be a lie but like shark teeth one
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:45.120]  group of lies falls out another rolls forward you don't kill a shark by pulling
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:49.240]  his teeth out you kill a shark by putting a bullet through its brain and I'm not
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:52.480]  calling for violence I mean that is a metaphor just like I don't want to pull
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:59.280]  sharks teeth out and we have to expose their ideology that's why they say you
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:02.960]  heard that caller oh there's no globalism there's no deep state they're
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:07.480]  trying to go back to the old propaganda they don't want you awake knowing its
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:11.920]  special interest from outside screwing you over selling you out demoralizing
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:16.200]  you on the way so you never get back control of your country and find out
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:19.760]  what they've done and the election fraud let me tell you how it works since that
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:24.760]  fella called in this Kentucky fraud the thousands of pages the proof of one
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.840]  company and dozens of states with both parties in an intelligence agency
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:32.760]  connection with the modems between the Secretary of State's office and all the
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:36.000]  voting machines even though they're different companies the modems are
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.400]  where they're loading the software in and tallying the fraud everybody look
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:44.440]  at these documents that Bev Harris has seen that we got and has been well
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:47.480]  she's know these are real this is bombshell showing the fraud in Kentucky
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:54.040]  and more illegal aliens voting aliens voting Republicans they don't live in
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:58.560]  the state voting for Democrats the Republican governor only lost by 5,000
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:02.440]  votes he should contest it and he is but not with a recount this right of the
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:06.680]  same computers again get to show the index of 175,000 people off the rolls
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:11.400]  they put back on that aren't even citizens reportedly there's more than
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:15.240]  20,000 of those in there then that ends the whole election because you match that
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:24.440]  to who voted in that name game over but you see people go well then why do the
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:27.120]  Republicans stay in office in some places because the blue bloods know how
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:30.840]  this game works and they know the Republicans are really the dominant
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.160]  party in this country except for the few blue cities the globalist control where
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:38.640]  they fully exploit the slaves so they've got a deal with the deep state where they
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:43.040]  divide up who gets different territories just like mafias but the last decade or
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:46.760]  so the Democrats started cheating it's like China had a globalist deal to sell
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:52.640]  out America but slowly they're doing it too quickly they weren't supposed to
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.800]  launch their military right away they weren't supposed to expand and announce
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:01.640]  they would dominate us right away so they broke those public agreements
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:09.280]  and so now the deals are broken and the Democrats are trying to become a one-
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:13.200]  party state so the Republicans have figured out they've broken the deal and
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:17.760]  the blue bloods are all resigning to go get jobs or they get blackmailed and
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:22.200]  exposed but all the real Republicans are staying in and saying election fraud
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:30.160]  treason chai-com traders kangaroo courts they're trying to kill us breaking our
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:39.240]  ribs shooting us it's treason they're against America because that's what it
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:45.040]  is that's what's happened that's what's gone on that's what's unfolding that's
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:55.280]  what's developing and that's it are you an American or are you a globalist and
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.880]  so that caller calls in and says there's nothing going on there's no deep state
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:04.520]  I'm like wow Trump sure beat the deep states ass the guy's like no doesn't
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:09.400]  exist but really I'll tell that to Brennan who goes on TV and says thank God
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:14.240]  for the deep state our intelligence agencies will remove him for the good
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:19.000]  of the nation when they stand for getting rid of it and almost did but the
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:29.320]  best-laid plans of mice and men often go astray Humpty Dumpty ain't getting put
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.080]  back together again I'm gonna write your calls to come back in with that Trump
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:34.480]  clip because I know we didn't want to hear Trump about kicking their ass and
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:39.480]  and yeah in the real world we're kicking their ass but you see we have to
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:43.720]  identify the fact how pathetic is Kelly and Tillerson and Hillary and all that
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:47.840]  they can't beat info wars that they that we beat them there's the secret is
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:51.600]  realizing how much power we have and we're promoting justice and freedom and
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:56.960]  a nation for all and there's not even a debate with these people the time has
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:02.640]  come to defy the thought police they are banning hundreds and hundreds of
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:08.080]  symbols every year they're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:12.160]  socialist promise they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:18.480]  in England we've had Oxford come out in band clapping the ADL and others will
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:22.640]  literally bankrupt you kick you out of college destroy you have you arrested
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:27.320]  in some areas if you do the okay symbol that's the international sign language
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:31.520]  symbol for okay they know what they're doing these people are
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:35.760]  authoritarians and they're dangerous and the answer to their attack on speech
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:40.640]  is to exercise it in their face we have a it's okay to be okay politically
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:44.960]  incorrect ball cap it's black and white very nice as the okay symbol on it it's

[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:07.920]  because different types of physiology's different types of metabolic systems and
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:14.120]  people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:18.320]  crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:24.120]  to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:28.520]  you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:34.000]  bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the globalist want you
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you

[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:05.000]  metabolic systems are diverse some of us are deficient some things and not in
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:08.360]  others there's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you

[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:21.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show I'll tell you the whistleblower I call
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:27.240]  him the fake whistleblower he gave a fake report of my phone call and when I
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:31.240]  did it all of a sudden when I released that call all of a sudden everybody
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:35.760]  disappeared the whistleblower disappeared what ever happened to the second
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:40.840]  whistleblower why isn't the first whistleblower gonna testify anymore you
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:46.680]  know why because everything he wrote in that report almost was alive because he
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:51.720]  made a phony phone call my phone call was perfect he made it sound bad that's
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:56.640]  why I had to release now they so the whistleblower is a disgrace to our
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:01.200]  country a disgrace and the whistleblower because of that should be revealed
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:09.240]  and his lawyer who said the worst things possible two years ago he should be
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:15.560]  sued and maybe for treason maybe for treason but he should be sued his lawyer
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:21.240]  is a disgrace but disgrace and then ask him this where is the second
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:26.200]  whistleblower right where is the witness that gave the whistleblower the
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:33.160]  information they all disappeared because Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:39.080]  he's corrupt he made up a speech and he put my voice in it he made up a speech
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:45.960]  had nothing to do with what I said Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician that's
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:52.280]  not giving us due process not giving us lawyers and despite all that we're
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:49:01.240]  kicking their ass don't hold your breath whistleblower from Texas when
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:09.240]  you're not your god Eric Sierra Mella who can't have his name known even though
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:14.000]  it's illegal and lawful put it out because people are being mean to him
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:22.560]  oh what CIA agent looks like a libtard libtard looks like he's got like a 60 IQ
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:30.240]  came and tie a shoelace as we can sure make up crap the deep state and where's
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:35.680]  it going for him a bunch of pretentious fops a bunch of wannabe blue blood
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:45.720]  jokers oh but Trump's inept he kicked your ass we're kicking your ass this
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:49.360]  listenership who are in the arena are kicking your ass we're going back to
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:57.560]  your calls but I'm gonna say it again the globalists think they own this
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:01.600]  nation and they're mad that we have a president that thinks he's the president
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:05.560]  but he is encircled by traitors that tell him they're gonna do what he says and
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:11.280]  then don't do it and then it turns out his plans his idea have been excellent
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:15.960]  and are the deals that were agreed upon decades ago in the case of the Kurds and
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:22.720]  the Syrians and all the rest of them it it ends the conflict but the system
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:27.600]  doesn't want that all these geniuses that pat each other on the back and now
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:31.720]  you're gonna see more and more lies and more and more fake whistleblowers but
[1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:39.960]  Trump's not gonna resign he's gonna go all the way but he's surrounded by a
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:43.760]  bunch of cowards because the swamp is deep has been bringing its people in
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:48.120]  forever and America has become soft a lot of good people a lot of strong people
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  but we didn't desire power we didn't get into government and so these systems
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:58.440]  are just filled with ass kissers that don't care about the nation in fact they
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.200]  hate it and they tell us they do and you look at the whistleblowers and who
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:07.800]  their lawyers are and you see the things they say and they do openly
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:13.720]  promoting pedophilia saying they love to defend people that are pedophiles and
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:17.640]  get them national security classes why would you say that in public even if you
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:24.440]  were one of those people and it's because they're bad news folks and they
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:31.040]  think we're done what do you think it'll be like if you roll over to these
[1:51:31.040 --> 1:51:34.960]  maniacs you think it'll get better a lot worse
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.080]  steven colorado you're on the air worldwide go ahead thanks for holding hey
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:47.840]  thank you Alex I've been listening to you since you started first time I've
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:55.240]  ever called God bless you thanks for getting on thank you well you know we
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:59.160]  know what they're doing you can see what they're doing and it's not going to
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:04.560]  stop this isn't going to stop you know there's not going to be anything on
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:07.720]  mainstream to let the American people think that oh maybe these people are
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:13.680]  doing something wrong and if they can't if they can't take them out of handcuffs
[1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:18.520]  like they want they want him in handcuffs in front of the American people if they
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:23.600]  can't do that if there's any hint that there's actually can be elected that's
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:27.560]  when they're gonna blow this thing up there's they're not gonna allow him to
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:34.960]  be elected they're gonna blow this whole thing up completely and then the
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.160]  question is as well when do we call in the Marines but you can't call in the
[1:52:39.160 --> 1:52:45.240]  Marines right now because they look like a dictator and obstruction so he's got
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:52.360]  to let them do their whole fake illegal scheme and then when it comes time where
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:56.800]  they are actually going to try to remove him that's when he can pull the trigger
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.320]  if if the circumstances allow I mean they're gonna either pull him out of
[1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:06.800]  there in handcuffs or a straightjack well that's it they're not they are not
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:13.160]  gonna allow him to be elected period this is it it's oh yeah it's done and the
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:16.880]  Democrats have said that they're coming after everybody after that and so I'll
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:21.040]  tell you I'm not scared they ought to be scared but see these guys always push
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:24.200]  and push and that's the good news they're you're right they're not gonna stop and
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:28.800]  then they're gonna run into it immovable force and that's the way these things
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:34.400]  tend to go and it's very very sad but America's forgotten our poor children
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:38.040]  we've killed 60 million plus babies and now we keep them alive and sell their
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:42.480]  organs and now pedophilia is being mainline and so we're a cursed nation
[1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:47.360]  and if we don't support Trump and we don't turn the tide then we deserve what
[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:53.240]  happens to us God bless you I appreciate your call sir a lot of calls about Steve
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:58.520]  Pachinic we ought to get him back on the show that and you talk wants to talk
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:02.760]  about Pachinic so does Casey he's saying that the mole with the anonymous
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:07.720]  personally or times is Bolton well I said that back when he got in and he is
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:11.360]  the one and he now he's gonna testify it's the president against the president's
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:14.040]  orders because that's that's the executive prerogative to say no you
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:20.960]  don't separation powers it's just incredible so let's go ahead and go to
[1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:27.160]  sad and you tell you're on the air go ahead how you doing Alex this is that
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.960]  aka chief bowls with Titans of Liberty how you doing today I'm very glad to hear
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:36.640]  that you have Steve Pachinic on the radio again you know dr. Steve has been
[1:54:36.640 --> 1:54:41.640]  putting it out there with Bolton and his white shoe boy ties to Yale he's always
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:48.200]  been unequivocally been in in the in the the power circle that's basically
[1:54:48.200 --> 1:54:54.760]  driving this this coup d'etat against our great 45 it's amazing to hear Steve

[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:04.120]  to come on he's refused to come on the show he's refused to come on the show
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:07.840]  well I think everybody you know everybody should know you took a lot of a
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:12.600]  lot of flack Alex you know because dr. Steve was the one who originally you
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:16.720]  know brought up the idea that there could be some kind of ulterior motive
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:22.080]  with Sandy Hook and you know what all those press people that you know that
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:26.120]  that say that they protect their their sources I mean you're actually that guy
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:30.520]  Alex you're the one that that didn't say put anything on dr. Steve you know you
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:36.760]  you protected dr. Steve and I admire that about you man because I'm not
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:39.440]  trying to put him down you were just kind of like hey where's Pachinic and I
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:42.120]  get a lot of that so I'm like well he refuses to go on the show we've invited
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:46.680]  on the show many times and I'm not gonna say he's a coward I know he got put
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:49.920]  under a lot of heat coming on he's been called into federal court he's been
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:53.320]  called into federal court on other things that were set on the show so
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:56.800]  there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes and he's still speaking out and
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:00.400]  saying more bold things than ever that I agree with the things I've seen are
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:05.440]  dead on and so yeah he's been a source on many things we have a lot of other

[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:16.960]  minutes then he got real pissed off and said you know I'm not coming on anymore

[1:59:54.480 --> 2:00:06.280]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:20.280]  I remember when I lost my mind there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions have an echo in so much space
[2:00:20.280 --> 2:00:32.160]  when you're out there so much space but it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:40.960]  I know too much that does make me crazy all right that in Utah this is all
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.760]  transparent we know it's Bolton we always knew and if you want to say
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:49.960]  something Trump's done that's incompetent is he brought in all these deep
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:54.640]  status because they'd lie to his face and he'd never seen that in business
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:59.440]  people get promoted in business for doing well and executing properly and he
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:03.560]  thought it oh we just had bad management people want America to continue on and
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.080]  not go bankrupt and no they want to destroy the country and he said that he
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:11.880]  said I underestimated how bad the swamp is and how corrupt they are and how much
[2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:18.320]  they hate the country because he offers a money and power not to sell it out a
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:26.160]  big seat at the table these minions and they're working for other groups he
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:31.200]  trumps his own man so he projects on to them that hey come on up to America you'll
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:35.400]  be more successful and you don't screw anybody over they're like no I'm better
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:40.080]  than you I'm a genius you're an idiot America sucks that's the elitism behind
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.760]  the scenes now it's out in the open and Trump's like what you'll be more powerful
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:49.440]  and make more money and have a seat helping run America just don't eff the
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:53.360]  country over and you don't want it they go that's right and I'm gonna get you
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:02:00.160]  I'm better than you it's the little ding dong syndrome it's the chicken sh-t
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.840]  dimension these people it's spiritual folks and you've got to get that because
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:09.200]  the average American is nice and cares and isn't arrogant and is humble and we
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:17.840]  project that on to these people like the so-called whistleblowers lawyer and you
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:22.800]  research these people and they're almost all like signaling hey I like creepy
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:27.360]  bison girls I go photograph them when alone at Disney World and at water parks
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.720]  and I represent pedophiles and I think Jeffrey F. steams great and I get
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:36.960]  pedophiles jobs and national security I mean why the hell would you tell people
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:43.120]  that on Twitter because man these folks are taken over the people that do it and
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:50.440]  then the Renfields that assist in it and so there you go I mean you when you're
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:56.360]  faced with something like this people are just don't know what to do that's how
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:02:58.920]  they got the Boy Scouts of America just like the Catholic Church they start
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:02.880]  taking over and then people can't believe it well it'll bring down the church
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:07.240]  it'll bring down Boy Scouts if we it's so pervasive and then you start turning a
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:12.800]  blind eye now you're complicit and now they take over the whole shooting match
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:18.600]  that's how you compromise something so you can't compromise with any of it just
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:24.080]  say full-speed attack see that's why I always say I frontal attack I could get
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:27.080]  all Matthew Valley but that's a mental illness and creep around and do side
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:29.880]  things and dirty tricks they always think I'm doing that the globalists have been
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:32.600]  so freaked out all these lawsuits they haven't found any dirty tricks any
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:38.320]  secretiveness any manipulations because I've chosen to go full broad daylight
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:42.520]  frontal attack because I don't even want to play games with my brain to get into
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:47.560]  a position where I operate like they do even in the name of good because then
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:51.880]  you spend your energy in in all these other manipulations instead of just
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:57.200]  full-bore attack it's the spectacle I want of us crashing into them and
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:02.560]  exploding and burning quite frankly and it's not that I'm a sadist or one
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:08.800]  up get hurt or want to do be a martyr I just cannot merge my
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:15.240]  interdimensional essence with devil worshipping Satanist comebacks so my
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:19.000]  will is assault them with everything I've got and if I get destroyed in the
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:23.200]  process and torn inside out that's good because I will certainly not be with
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:31.680]  them I want to hit them and explode in center rating their operation and I
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:37.400]  want in the last essence of feeling I have to bring them down burning and
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:41.520]  collapsing into hell with giant the only thing I'd go to hell for would be to
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.920]  take them to hell I want to be with God so bad if God wants to send me to hell
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:52.040]  to take them then damn me to hell if I need to go to hell I will

[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:21.080]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. Well we just joined us
[2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:24.600]  Nikki Haley came out so we already knew what we broke exclusively over two years
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:32.560]  ago Rex Tillerson Kelly all of them trying to appease the deep state and
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:37.440]  double deal and sell out Trump and the agenda by declaring themselves geniuses
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:42.840]  that would save America by violating the will of the American people and ending
[2:06:42.840 --> 2:06:47.560]  business as usual it is a criminal coup that we caught right in the midst of it
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:51.920]  Fad in Utah what are your other points about this in general anything else
[2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:57.760]  you'd like to add? Well Alex really all I wanted to say in regards to that
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:07:03.680]  whistleblower in Texas this is something that we hear quite frequently and it's
[2:07:03.680 --> 2:07:08.560]  mostly with people who are just completely uninformed and you could
[2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:16.680]  hear the joy in that person's voice in regards to having the president. Well you
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:20.840]  could heal you could hear the conceited power trip of someone that's
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:25.320]  powerless too did you hear the weakness? Absolutely absolutely and as somebody
[2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:30.240]  who just left Austin Texas I can tell you that is something that I heard quite
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:36.320]  a bit I just left Austin and that that little snarky tone is something that has
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:40.800]  very much invaded the great state of Texas. Texas is in trouble the whole
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:44.280]  countries in trouble people ask why do I live here this is where my family's from
[2:07:44.280 --> 2:07:52.520]  since the literal 1820s and and just to watch Texas fall to the sickness the
[2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:56.480]  same snake that bit California used to be as conservative as we are now is
[2:07:56.480 --> 2:08:00.140]  slithered over here and people say why do they bring it with them because they're
[2:08:00.140 --> 2:08:04.160]  the ones that suck California dry they're the soulless vampires and now
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:10.160]  they're here. Yeah absolutely and you know for someone to just blurt out that
[2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:15.080]  they believe or they do not believe that the deep state actually exists just goes
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:20.120]  to show you that they do not read the economists they did not read the agenda
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:25.840]  2030 it's all public financial times Atlantic monthly the globalist admitted
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:31.580]  that again I was being offered 20 years ago 10 million dollars a year in book
[2:08:31.580 --> 2:08:35.440]  deals and Glenn Beck's job before he even existed and I mean I had it on paper
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:39.840]  from the of the big corporations I mean that guy would fall over in a second if
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:43.120]  somebody offered him 10 million dollars but nobody's offered him 10 million
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:46.920]  dollars because he doesn't have any talent or the spark of leadership they're
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:50.360]  all a bunch of sycophants that think if they kiss butt long enough they'll
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:54.880]  finally be a real man when they'll never be a real man God bless you I
[2:08:54.880 --> 2:08:58.520]  appreciate your call yeah that 10 million dollars a year is pretty cheap now
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:02.640]  huh takes what 30 40 million dollars a year to run in fours all the bandwidth
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:08.240]  all the crew all the legal so that was cheap wasn't it first it was a million
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:11.640]  then 3 million then 10 million then the book deals and all of it you think I
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:19.280]  want to be somebody else's man what do you want a billion dollars to sell out
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:23.960]  humanity or bullet in your head I'll take the bullet but I'll die trying to
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:30.360]  stop you because it's the soul it's the essence it's your will that transcends
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:37.120]  don't let them have your will don't bow your will to them bow to God and then
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:41.280]  instantly you'll go I'm not bound to God I've just joined with God and I've got
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:45.800]  so much power now it's insane but you won't even want the power like the
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:51.440]  metaphor in the Bible of throwing down their crowns after thousand years with
[2:09:51.440 --> 2:09:54.640]  you know Christ God I don't want these crowns I don't want these awards you
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:10:00.440]  don't want it because it doesn't matter anymore the ego is gone it's all the
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:05.800]  real plan KC Mississippi wants to bring up Pachennik
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:08.920]  there's a smart guy dr. C. Pachennik who's been out there talking about the
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:13.520]  deep state of the coup yeah the CIA leftist globalist arms of it are carrying
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:17.320]  on a tip in overthrow of America they run the media and it's unbelievable that
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:21.840]  all Americans don't instantly join with Trump and with info wars against it even
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:24.800]  if you disagree with some policies of Trump and not what they make up in the
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:30.880]  news it's still about us running our own country it's outside forces trying to
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:35.200]  destroy the nation state and turn us into a vassal state of the globalist we
[2:10:35.200 --> 2:10:40.120]  must say no it's ridiculous I'm surprised we're not winning by a long
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.400]  shot we're barely beating them right now Trump's right we're kicking their ass
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:50.440]  but you know what they are squeezing the hell out of America and putting an
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:53.800]  authoritarian censorship and control and if they take Trump out they'll try to
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:57.920]  complete that because they're scared they're gonna accelerate the
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:03.560]  authoritarian takeover and we can't let them do that Casey Mississippi thanks
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:08.640]  for holding go ahead thanks for taking my call I appreciate it thank you well
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:12.400]  you know anyone that says there isn't a deep state or shadow government is
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:16.880]  either disingenuous or like the last caller said doesn't have their eyes
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:23.800]  open is not paying attention to the very clear and blatant propaganda that they
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:28.320]  put out oh no no he did it to disrespect us and play gaslighting games because I
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:30.720]  guarantee you that guy's probably an educator or something and does that to
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:34.640]  little kids all day I mean you can hear the MO that's why that misleads people
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:39.760]  that's somebody that enjoys leading people astray absolutely and you know
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:43.360]  really what it what I would look at is as the deep state would it was a movie
[2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:46.040]  that came out a while ago I can't think of the name right now but they called it
[2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:53.400]  a college of corporations and you know I think that that ultimately it is that
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:57.720]  it's a college of corporations with you know kind of like the the banking head
[2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:02.360]  master if you will yeah that's that's that's network and rollerball the
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:06.360]  original which show you how they really run it and that's actually written by
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:09.720]  folks that were externalizing the method that's actually what it is it's a
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:14.960]  college of corporations that trade humans is stock just as the Bible says
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:21.160]  they traffic in the souls of men not just that the bodies and ideas and they
[2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:25.400]  want a one-world government system where you have to have their currency to live
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:29.920]  of which is the global casual society their final dream I agree with you a
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:32.800]  hundred percent and I think a lot of the kabuki theater that we see coming out of
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:39.120]  DC is distracting us from that you know the control grid which pairs with the
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:44.680]  casual society the cybernetic control grid that you know that is 5g that is
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:50.960]  all the smart devices basically you know from my understanding 5g is a
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:56.960]  computer-to-computer comm system that will connect your your phone with you
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:01.760]  know appliances TVs anything that that has that type of it's already doing it
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:05.240]  without asking me and people say we'll just get a droid it's just as bad if you
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:09.320]  have one it's all the same globalist plan and it's all these governments
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:13.320]  competing for control of the eye you know the one ring it's all that allegory
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:17.160]  that's how Satanism works they're all building their own destruction hoping
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:21.200]  they can be finally in control of it suddenly I'm telling it no the phone
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:24.960]  is dolled into my car it knows when I need gas where we're going all the
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:29.240]  sensors I can't turn it off I go into the menus it still just reuploads this
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:34.000]  is the AI push where even if you turn it off it's turned out Apple Google never
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.120]  really turn it off and now they won't let you turn it off they're just letting
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:40.680]  you know we're in control of everything and they're flipping the switches on
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:46.400]  right now absolutely and you said I remember you saying but I can't think
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:49.040]  of how long ago it was it's over a year you were talking about them
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:55.040]  terraforming the planet and really the way that strikes me now is being
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:59.080]  terraformed for AI even the chemtrails of Trabzburg aerosol injection with a
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:03.800]  metallic oxide makes everything more receptive to frequency and this control
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:07.520]  grid the cybernetic control grid you know is more or less run on
[2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:13.040]  frequencies I mean EMF the RF ULF everything so that's right and what did
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:17.480]  they tell you in transcendence with Johnny Depp he becomes AI becomes a dust
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:22.680]  that is in the sky that is a smart dust where they can have a whole computer
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:29.520]  system you know way more advanced even a smartphone in a single molecule and then
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:33.200]  it will be everything and absorb us and that's the end game plan where you can't
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:37.280]  escape it and they're now already putting the binary weapon system into you
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:41.040]  the aluminum dioxide and the other systems so that then the when the
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:44.680]  nanotech hits they believe it will then be able to find a place in your body and
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:48.520]  bind to that and then through the six seven eight G they're already rolling out
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:53.040]  and test it will then be able to oscillate and program that to basically
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:57.840]  kill you fry you so the so the game isn't even get control of us it's it's
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:02.320]  get control of us long enough to have a spiritually cut off from God because our
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:07.040]  DNA has been proven to be a transceiver they want to jam that frequency then
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:12.120]  program us to worship Satan which isn't just some cosmology out of a church it
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:16.960]  is merged with that AI synthetic system and that's what Elon Musk and others have
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.720]  told you there the religion is you go to these and now the FDA just came out and
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:25.720]  said okay we can do the ambrosia operation where parents will take their
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:29.360]  kids if they sign the agreement forms the children have their own rights that
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:32.760]  now they want five-year-olds to start giving blood and then the biggest
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:35.920]  people that want the money and they're gonna roll out the whole agreement is
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:40.280]  Silicon Valley will literally now openly be vampires and then everybody
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:43.480]  living in the Silicon Valley area will then come and bring their fresh blood
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:47.040]  to the Silicon Valley lords who will then pump it directly into their arteries
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:51.320]  I'm not kidding folks that's the whole plan I think the human AI gets a KC I
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:57.760]  bless you'll be right back maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon you'll

[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:17.040]  that the enemy lost that election they are awake and throwing everything they've
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:20.960]  got at us and conservatives and nationalistic Christians and patriots

[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:04.760]  she had her digital textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:09.240]  periodic table and I clicked on iodine and it says that 2 billion people have
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:13.000]  low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:16.720]  of iodine that's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:20.800]  crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:25.240]  click it saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:30.680]  you take a high-quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:36.160]  so vibrant why you're so alive it's it's one of the reasons that you're so much
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:39.880]  healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and it just really blew
[2:19:39.880 --> 2:19:45.280]  her away to read it there for herself they know that two billion people ladies
[2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:48.960]  and gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:52.240]  now because of iodine deficiency research it and find out for yourself
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:20:12.240]  now info wars.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:38.400]  whoa whoa used to mean look out whoa danger you know I'm a big fan of the
[2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:41.840]  Misfits and usually you're not as big a fan of the Misfits or a band when they
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.320]  have another singer that comes along but in the case maybe a van Halen the
[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:49.640]  singer was better the same thing with the Misfits and Michael Graves a good
[2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:55.480]  patriot smart guy official Michael Graves.com he's here in Austin and he's
[2:20:55.480 --> 2:20:59.920]  had his sold-out shows canceled because of his evil support of info wars and
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:04.000]  Alex Jones and Breitbart but he's here to give us an update on how that went he
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:07.920]  hadn't been here in about a year travels all over the world good to have you here
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:11.960]  my friend good to be here Alex thank you for having me back thanks for having
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:15.760]  time to be here we're going to go to all the callers that are holding like
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:20.800]  Jeff and Gary and all these folks you will get to you too we've got show some
[2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:24.800]  lentil take over about 15 minutes the next hour but but you're you're you're
[2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:28.960]  loaded for bear you've got a lot to talk about and how this is all interconnected
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:33.040]  we've also got a special report Savannah Hernandez shot it's up on info wars.com
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:36.600]  it's incredible it's 10 minutes long I'm only there two minutes of it in the
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:39.600]  last segment of this hour but she went out and asked is it okay to be white
[2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:44.800]  and people said no so I mean this is the brainwashing that that's happening
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:49.240]  we'll get to that also where are the globalist operating with the homeless
[2:21:49.240 --> 2:21:53.120]  where people get arrested for nothing and the homeless can shoot up heroin and
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:56.920]  beat people up well there's a plan behind that we'll hit that too but
[2:21:56.920 --> 2:21:59.880]  obviously Nikki Haley comes out confirms what we broke two years ago with
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:04.960]  Roger Stone and of course with Mike Cernovich who they demonized and de
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:08.240]  platformed a lot of places for exposing the fake whistleblower but you've got it
[2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:11.920]  you tie it all together during the last break you were on fire so good to have
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:18.120]  you here and let them have it well again the Epstein the way that that the
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:24.400]  Jeffrey Epstein suicide has hit has hit the popular zeitgeist is amazing you
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:28.640]  hear it everywhere I hear it everywhere every night to the point where we're
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:34.720]  making there's memes about it's it's it's funny right so so to prepare for
[2:22:34.720 --> 2:22:41.320]  for today and and I I went to info wars.com and there's the report off
[2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:47.920]  about Roger Stone talking about Steve Bannon and yourself and he references
[2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:55.160]  and talks about Miles Kwok who is this Chinese national who is who China is
[2:22:55.160 --> 2:23:02.000]  looking to expedite back to China for his for his crimes right and that ties
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:08.120]  together Steve Bannon and how Steve Bannon was was basically infiltrating
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:14.680]  the the the Trump campaign for his for his own gain and then I started to think
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:22.160]  about the chessboard if you everything that is on the chessboard and I went
[2:23:22.160 --> 2:23:28.040]  down the rabbit hole starting with Mark Zeid who's who's the the whistleblowers
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:33.480]  lawyer this guy that has pictures of himself at Disney World and it's
[2:23:33.480 --> 2:23:39.000]  clearly linked to some sort of child there's a total prepasoid if you see
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:42.480]  the latest thing a hundred percent where he says I represent pedophiles get a
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:46.440]  man right security clearances and it's and it's still up on Twitter for for
[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:51.000]  everybody to see he's planting it now this guy started what's called whistleblower
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:56.800]  aid which is a nonprofit that was the Trump administration took over and in
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:03.200]  2016 and went around and and advertised for whistleblowers people within the
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:08.240]  administration to to basically spy and and come out against the
[2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:12.320]  administration right so you're right he organized people that were inside of it
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:15.760]  to then go out and do what the so-called whistleblowers done say
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:19.640]  something that no the witnesses or transcripts ever saw who was and he's
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:25.000]  also connected to the James Madison project which also on the board of the
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:29.720]  James Madison project that's connected to John Podesta which is connected to the
[2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:33.720]  Center for American Progress which is connected to the Southern Poverty Law
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:40.480]  Center which is connected to the ACLU funded by George Soros right and then
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:44.160]  that's what the ACLU will not defend free speech they got bought and then
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:48.440]  according to and this is coming from again this is this isn't me making it up
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:52.240]  this it's an Aaron Klein report they're facts right I didn't sit up last night and
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:57.440]  just analyze this so within tax documents that were looked at in this
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:03.040]  report you find out that the open society which is George Soros is right
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:08.600]  is funding all of this which then is connected to the United to Protect
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:14.640]  Democracy United to Protect Democracy is a group that is has it's filled with
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:20.040]  former top lawyers from the Obama administration which does which is does
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:25.800]  advocacy methods methods to oppose the Trump administration right so that's who
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:30.080]  this is is George Soros Hillary and a bunch of globalist and it turns out they
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:33.960]  had Kelly turns out they had Tillerson because these people are all scared
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:38.560]  literally working for them and then they brought in McMaster they brought in
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:43.080]  Fiona Hill they brought in all these people to fill up the administration all
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:48.240]  under Trump's nose and now Bannon goes and testifies against Stone and says
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:50.920]  well he didn't tell me he was talking to WikiLeaks or had it but that he was
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:53.840]  trying to get it well of course we were all trying to get it and now Roger
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:57.640]  faces certain presence so why is this all important to the impeachment had as a
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:02.480]  tie-in well because numerous aspects of the whistleblowers claims relies on
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:07.560]  information that's tied to CrowdStrike and then when you start to look at
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:16.920]  CrowdStrike and who they are the FBI never never investigated the DNC hack it
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:22.520]  was CrowdStrike that investigated the the the hack because it wasn't it was a
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:27.480]  download at the point it was never that and Roger Stone made a motion to
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:33.680]  suppress evidence in in May for this very reason that the DNC hack it was
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:36.240]  questioning it was questioning the legitimacy of the information was never
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:39.800]  proven the Russia said anything offered by the prosecutors because the FBI
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:43.960]  didn't investigate or they failed to investigate or they just decided not to
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:50.640]  and they relied on the information from CrowdStrike who was who found that
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:55.960]  Russian state players were to blame and gave the information to WikiLeaks and
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:27:00.520]  that's where the whole Russiagate thing is is is coming which is ridiculous it
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:04.280]  was a giant consortium of patriots in the government that leaked that
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:07.320]  information and I've had that from William Benny from everybody it was
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:11.560]  downloaded inside the DNC other stuff was downloaded inside the National
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:15.840]  Security Council inside the NSA and inside the CIA that's where all that
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:18.960]  stuff's coming from because there are people in the government that don't like
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:22.160]  the deep state there's a civil war in the government between the pro-Americans
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:26.440]  and globalist and the final straw was Obama given the office of personnel
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:30.440]  management hack 22 million names of the entire US intelligence their families
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:36.440]  everybody to the chai comms so then here I am so it's starting to crystallize for
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:42.040]  me as as you you get all of this information and I start to you start to
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:48.920]  see groups like CrowdStrike you start to see the you know DNC and Adam
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:54.120]  Schiff who's tied to Ukraine who's try who's tied to the Atlantic Council and
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:28:01.200]  I thought and and then so the Atlantic Council the Atlantic Council is funded
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:07.320]  by and works with in partnership with wait for it barisma barisma holdings
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:13.160]  Google as well Google capital a hundred million dollar funding drive
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:18.440]  financed by CrowdStrike why do you think in full wars and Alex Jones is
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:25.760]  under attack Google there's ties oh the Atlantic Council is former CIA from the
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:28.800]  left and they admit they go in congressional hearings and say shut
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:33.520]  Alex Jones down they're running at all absolutely American citizens under CIA

[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:49.120]  Michael graves finishing up with this deep state coup it's incredible how
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:53.400]  transparent it is how fraudulent it is and Lindsey Graham says it's gonna be
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:57.360]  dead on arrival in the Senate they're gonna launch a bunch of other lies once
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:00.640]  they get up next to that vote and then they're gonna launch a bunch of other
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:04.720]  lives when the Senate's having its trial we're about to see their full vomiting
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:09.160]  of propaganda and disinfo I'm not saying they're gonna win I'm just saying
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:12.680]  people that think it's in the bag I think are really underestimated remember
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:15.920]  folks I'm the guy that told you Trump was gonna win for sure and my gut told
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:22.480]  me that I'm telling you it's not the bag right now what do you think I I I
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:29.840]  agree with you I agree with you 100% that it's not in the bag how however like
[2:34:29.840 --> 2:34:34.240]  you always say and people call up this show and they ask what can they do and
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:37.680]  and aside of the obvious about supporting the broadcast and buying the
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:42.440]  products it's exactly what I what I just did I'm a punk rock musician I'm a
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:47.880]  musician I maybe spent two three hours last night researching right in my notes
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:51.160]  the hotel wouldn't let me print out all things I want to print out so I wrote
[2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:57.120]  them down and just with a little bit of of of thought and a little bit of
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:04.040]  research you can put this whole piece this whole puzzle together and then you
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:10.520]  can you can talk to other people as well again I'll reach out to I know that
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:13.960]  there's a lot of musicians I know that there's a lot of artists out there that
[2:35:13.960 --> 2:35:17.840]  listen to this broadcast I wear the shirts I'm out there every single day
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:23.480]  almost 40 something cities 55 cities on the tour that I'm doing and people come
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:28.240]  up to me all the time Alex and they say nice shirt I listen to info wars and the
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:33.400]  question back is well what are you doing you have to do something and and they
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:37.320]  have to be leaders I'm not bitching at people it's just the time is now the
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:39.840]  system is afraid of the show because the focal point they're afraid of you
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:43.800]  everybody's got to start speaking out they've got to take action all they have
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:48.840]  is is is holding on to the narrative and trying to control the narrative the
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:53.560]  president keeps keeps saying witch hunt we have to remember the lessons of the
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:58.360]  Salem witch trials in the 1600s the lack of judicial regulation the the
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:02.920]  controlling of the narrative and at the end of that there were people that were
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:07.520]  dead and there were people that were in prison and and it's that spirit within
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:11.760]  what happened in the 1600s that propelled us forward that eventually our
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:17.840]  forefathers and the Constitution and the birthing of this country was born
[2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:21.280]  through and that's why there was judicial tyranny going on all over the
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:25.120]  Collins all over the place and there was the controlling of the narrative and
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:30.480]  the ignorance of the people that were involved in that that is what led to such
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:37.960]  a horrible out and the left is trying to create a witch trials hysteria a hundred
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:42.360]  percent of they absolutely are failing except they've got a lowest common
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:45.960]  denominator that buys into it you were talking about them what you've seen in
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.160]  Los Angeles what you're witnessing all over the particular the West Coast right
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:57.280]  so so the whether it's antifa or if it's the environmental activists you're
[2:36:57.280 --> 2:37:02.280]  talking about the supporters of the New Green Deal the AOC people they are
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:07.120]  convinced that they are fighting real Nazis they are convinced of all the
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:12.640]  lies that that are put out through through the media and these and these
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:18.640]  crazy people that you see on screen there it's another thing that I that I
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:22.920]  that I recognize with the the anonymity of the whistleblowers and the
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:26.840]  anonymity of all these people that hide behind everybody covers their face
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:32.640]  nobody wants to stand up and and actually have themselves be known these
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:38.960]  people are violent they are ignorant they don't understand the the founding of
[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:43.600]  this country what it was built on they don't understand history they are
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:47.440]  looking into their cell phones they are getting the information their mesmerize
[2:37:47.440 --> 2:37:53.080]  a hundred percent I know that we don't necessarily have time to get into the
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.920]  social the big social engineering part of all this I know that obviously here on
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:02.600]  on the on the broadcast you've talked about the the Tavistock Institute and
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:07.440]  and all of the things that go into that and and what's being done to us on so
[2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:12.280]  many different levels you had a conversation on the Sunday broadcast
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:17.920]  with Alan Keyes that was amazing and you and Alan spoke about what type of
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:25.240]  people would look over death camps in in Auschwitz where how do you grow a crowd
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:28.720]  of people like that where where do those people come from and ladies and gentlemen
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:33.280]  they are you just saw them on on the TV the people that will look over these
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:41.520]  camps if this goes through the way that that the left the progressives or is it
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:45.560]  all the Soros people are hoping that it goes through they are gonna come for us
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:49.520]  all and it's those people right there and they say they are too that you know
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:52.880]  that's what's really creepy about it the type of people that would eat oh and
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:59.160]  shroyers microphone windscreen are going to be looking over and and and have the
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:06.400]  hate in their hearts because they are disconnected from God and again I love
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:12.080]  how you've become more spiritual on the broadcast and allowing that to flow
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:18.680]  through on this broadcast and again part of my notes I wanted to bring up again
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:25.800]  that it's important to understand that we're not at the end of the day
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:32.160]  wrestling with with with with human forces and and that it's it's a it's a
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:35.360]  supernatural force and it's gonna get more and more obvious all the Kim
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.560]  trailing and the AI and the anti-human future this headline mainstream news
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:46.480]  inside Amazon's plan for Alexa to run our entire lives it's all there if this
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:51.040]  is a takeover and humanity has to decide do we want to be human and continue on
[2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:55.240]  and grow normally the way God has planned or we want somebody else to come
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:40:00.040]  through and tell us give up our humanity mers with machines and be their
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:03.840]  slaves I mean this is really this is happening we're on a planet folks it's
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:08.080]  not a science fiction movie it's the real world I want to go to some calls
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:13.160]  a little to continue into the next hour this is all important and I've got some
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:18.800]  clips Savannah Hernandez went out to UT this last weekend and because there's
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:23.560]  all over the news it's like is is okay to be white white supremacist the FBI is
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:26.600]  investigating because there's all this thing that white people are evil well
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:29.760]  that's the universities that's the left trying to create a race for so of course
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:33.160]  it's okay to be any color but we're gonna play some of that coming back next
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:36.360]  segment right now let's go to a caller let's go to Gary who's been holding the
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:40.200]  longest and James and Elijah and Jeff and many others Gary thanks for holding
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:43.400]  you're on the air what do you think Trump should do to stop this attempt to
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:51.280]  take over hey Alex how you doing I'm good brother listen I want to tell you
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:56.280]  you like Trump the times get tough your products get better you work harder you
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:03.720]  get more focused and he does the same thing in regards to Trump here's what I
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:10.520]  think I think that no man's an island and what's what's getting me today there's
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:15.280]  always new news is this guy Lindsey Graham they'll come out and they'll say
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:21.320]  it's dead in the Senate and then two days later he comes out and instead of
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:26.520]  talking infrastructure instead of talking to Mexico deal he says he's gonna
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:33.400]  partner with Romney to come up with a climate change bill unbelievable okay so
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:37.080]  that's got to make you things like this when I say that means turn off America's
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:40.540]  energy when nobody else has to make the cuts that's what that is that that's
[2:41:40.540 --> 2:41:45.760]  warfare it's what I'm saying when they either come up with crazy statements or
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:50.200]  they do something that's so abnormal you got to stay say to yourself what is
[2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:54.280]  going on well remember Lindsey Graham said a few weeks ago they'd never vote to
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:42:00.720]  start formal impeachment in the house they did right so he's like like the
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:05.120]  last minute in regards to all the time they put into health care that guy came
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:09.520]  by his buddy and he votes no on health care at the last minute and cost the
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  American people and trillions of dollars well in regards to this impeachment if
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:18.960]  we're gonna put we know the Democrats are bad we know there's all this up it's
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:24.320]  the Republicans that worry me yes it's the deals that the Republicans have made
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:29.480]  it's what's going on it's it's always the guy that's on your side you can sit
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:33.600]  there and get ready for the for the for the hordes that are in front of you but

[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:49.800]  that's it is they've got sleeper cells they've got operatives and they're
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:53.360]  about to make their move will be right back and get everybody's take on that
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:59.920]  the Alex Jones show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:04.080]  had her digital textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:08.760]  table and I clicked on iodine and it says the 2 billion people have low IQ's
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:12.440]  are mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:16.080]  that's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're crazy and
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:20.120]  it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I click it
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:24.480]  saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have you take
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:29.720]  the high-quality pharmaceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:34.640]  vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's it's one of the reasons that you're
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:38.480]  so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and it just really
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:43.640]  blew her away to read it there for herself that other 2 billion people
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:47.480]  ladies and gentlemen 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:50.720]  earth right now because of iodine deficiency research it and find out for
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:58.280]  yourself now info wars dot com folks ask me Alex why do you have two different
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:02.400]  types of iodine well that's because different types of physiology's
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:07.040]  different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:12.560]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other
[2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:17.400]  types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:22.920]  pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for you whichever one you like use
[2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:28.200]  that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is essential
[2:44:28.200 --> 2:44:32.480]  that's why a harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:37.080]  lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:41.760]  simple get your high-quality iodine info or store.com and help fund the info

[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:54.320]  percent off together.

[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:03.320]  The witch queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:07.560]  corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile in
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:13.680]  blackmail reads thought that her victory was assured now that the enemy lost that
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:18.240]  election they are awake and throwing everything they've gotten at us and

[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:19.800]  band today official Michael Graves.com he just told me tonight just with the
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:25.080]  crew at a little uh restaurant I've been to before called Patsy's they got great
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:27.800]  chicken fried steaks at least last night there a few years ago we'll be

[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:40.520]  there I guess with some of the crew they're gonna shoot some video and he'll
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:43.640]  also be on the war room coming up today we're trying to get through your calls
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:46.400]  he's got a lot more to add and I've got a lot to add and I've got a few reports I
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:52.680]  want to get to but let's comment on what the last caller said Michael that's
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:57.040]  absolutely true as Cicero said it's not the enemy that openly has the banner at
[2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:00.920]  your gate you can mobilize against that if Rome's gonna fall and America's like
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:04.000]  a modern Rome make no mistake where as close to it as anything ever has been
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.360]  mm-hmm it's the enemy within it's the traitor they're the plague a hundred
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  percent it's from it's from the inside it's it's it's internal and that is why
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:20.960]  it's important to to continue to pay attention and not trust that caller was
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:26.720]  just talking about Lindsey Graham and not to not trusting these elected
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:33.160]  officials as far as we can throw them the end game here is to remove Trump
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:39.640]  whether it's by impeachment whether it's by assassination the end game and it
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:42.920]  doesn't matter how they get to that they need to discredit the Liberty Movement
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:47.680]  they need to discredit the Liberty Movement remember what what Hillary
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:53.400]  Clinton said remember what she called us irredeemable the pluribals when you
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:58.600]  look up irredeemable the definition of irredeemable is is not a good thing you're
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:03.200]  right and I and I actually and I looked it up it means worthless crap no value
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:07.920]  can't fix it get rid of it deserving strong condemnation shockingly bad and
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:12.320]  quality we were talking about Auschwitz we were talking about camps before that
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:17.840]  was that was signaling to us what's gonna happen when somebody like Hillary
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:24.720]  Clinton and her minions get control when they when they when they seed
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:31.960]  control back and push what what they are trying to do it really is camps and
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:36.400]  they really is coming to get us oh I mean they say we're gonna obliterate them
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:39.400]  once Trump's out we're gonna arrest them we're gonna and then people ask why is
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:44.200]  DC so cowardly the military is great but once you get up to generals because
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:47.000]  they were picked because they're yes man they were picked because they're
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.880]  duplicitous and now we know that Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich were right with
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:55.040]  their sources here on air that made them so mad that we named who the globalists
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:59.800]  were who they were bringing in it was dead on Roger Stone is being railroaded
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:02.840]  again there there's another canary in the coal mine what's happening to Roger
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:09.600]  Stone I read a lot about about World War two I've read a lot about the death
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:15.200]  camps and and one of the things that I find when you when you when you read
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:18.320]  about that history when you read about the people that were involved in that
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:21.760]  it's always the same thing the people in these communities in the Jewish
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:25.400]  communities that were that were sort of far removed from it we're always it ah
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:29.080]  well you know we heard about it and we didn't really think it was a big deal and
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:33.040]  then it got a little bit worse and then we got concerned next thing you know they
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:39.720]  were on a train headed to a death camp because George Soros was 14 but looked
[2:50:39.720 --> 2:50:43.520]  even younger he was called a bloodhound he was able to find people hiding but
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:47.880]  he'd rat them out and he says it was the happiest time in his life right the
[2:50:47.880 --> 2:50:51.520]  happiest time I mean one of Dylan and then the ADL calls him a Holocaust
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:57.280]  survivor and then back to these anti-foot kids again that in in what I do
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:01.000]  for a living we were talking about before I'm in these venues I see these
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:04.760]  bands you've always been a real anti-fascist and what is it like to see
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:07.960]  them literally working for a former Nazi collaborator calling you a Nazi I
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:13.400]  started my professional career in 1994 1995 it was the end of the punks and this
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:19.440]  and the real punk rock skinhead wars I knew and was part of what were called
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:24.000]  the Sharpies right there were there were real they were nationalists before it
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.560]  the freedom movement it started with in the punk rock in the hardcore community
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:33.200]  we loved America a lot of the guys that I knew went on to join the military
[2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:37.600]  because they loved their country they wanted to have families and they were
[2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:42.040]  actually fighting the real white supremacists these these bonehead
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:48.520]  meathead guys that hated everything they hated gays they hated Jews they hated
[2:51:48.520 --> 2:51:54.160]  everybody and they had made no qualms about it and that movement that white
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:52:02.280]  supremacist movement seems to have morphed into this this Antifa movement
[2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:07.600]  it's it like it's it's it's shape-shifted into the anti-trilogy just an excuse to
[2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:12.200]  be nasty it really isn't to be disgusting and to be deplorable look at
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:17.640]  these back again when I start and I've been in enough fights and and and
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:23.040]  skirmishes you know back in the day if there was gonna be a fight you know two
[2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:26.280]  guys would go outside and they would and they would fight they would look at
[2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:30.720]  each other their their faces would be bear and now and and they would do what
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:35.360]  they needed to do and and and go away would you say that punk rock was was
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:38.600]  more nationalistic or right-wing and then rejected the skinheads trying to
[2:52:38.600 --> 2:52:41.120]  take it over or whatever because I mean I would say even before you were there
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:45.080]  wouldn't you describe Glenn Danzig as kind of right-wing a nationalist I think
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:49.600]  so yeah well at least I know that Glenn Danzig now certainly is is is awake and
[2:52:49.600 --> 2:52:53.480]  he he understands from from the interviews that I've seen in things
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:57.920]  that he said statements that he's made that he's awake and he understands what
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:53:03.240]  the left is and and and what's happening again he's he's been in the game long
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:11.400]  enough to remember the what came down on him and the rock music industry and the
[2:53:11.400 --> 2:53:16.920]  censorship yes yes and and tipper gore had nothing on the left today yeah but
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:22.520]  that's I mean punk rock is always overlapped with left-wing politics but
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:25.880]  that's what I'm saying I'm saying but more the the misfits version was it was
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:29.760]  more pro-military and stuff like that yes yeah when you really dig into Glenn
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:33.840]  Danzig's lyrics at least what I get from again Hollywood Babylon if you know
[2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:38.720]  anything about what Babylon is and what it was and what it represents it it was
[2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:46.880]  synonymous with with evil an evil horrible system you get a sense that
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:50.800]  that yes music like like Glenn was making was definitely not thinking of
[2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:55.160]  horrible and evil I want to play just two minutes of the Savannah Hernandez
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:59.520]  report the full thing is so important I posted under the live show feed today
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:03.360]  Nikki Haley reveals attempted sabotage against America and President Trump I
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:05.920]  want to play this get your take on it and then go back to phone calls but
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:09.440]  imagine Martin Luther King just taught what Christians already knew everybody
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:13.480]  is equal in God's eyes well different gifts but you don't judge smile what
[2:54:13.480 --> 2:54:17.000]  color they are but off what they do like good music okay we'll call your listen

[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:24.160]  color you are even what your religion is you know even if it's good you know
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:28.440]  like a rug you over a meal you made or song you wrote I mean do we all think
[2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:33.440]  obey tovans Christian and we just think that's amazing but this it's not okay
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:36.080]  to be white whoever came up with the idea I guess four-chan dead is smart
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:40.000]  because people say no it is bad and whites are inherently bad and most of
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:44.640]  people she talked to at UT who were white said yes being white is not okay
[2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:47.760]  and it's bad to put those up now she talked to black folks most of them are
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:51.440]  like no it's okay to be white they get that it's just crazy how the left's
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:56.720]  trying to sell this idea that is true racism here it is this poster has been
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:55:00.400]  put up around universities all over America it's okay to be white what do
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:05.000]  y'all think about that I mean we have a lot of privileges as white individuals
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:08.560]  so like no we don't like be proud do your own thing but I don't think like
[2:55:08.560 --> 2:55:14.920]  posting that necessary I'm not sure it's I would probably resent that group or
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:18.880]  like the people that were putting it up it's like saying you're the new royalty
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:29.080]  of your wife what no whites are for extravagan I agree with you although I
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:36.000]  feel that if that's like if that's their pride then I think it's fine for them to
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:39.640]  do that just like everyone else what do you guys think about it how would you
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:45.040]  feel if you saw it popping up at UT I mean obviously it's not good how come
[2:55:45.040 --> 2:55:51.400]  because that's pretty right I mean it's pretty racist I guess just feel weird
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:54.600]  yeah it doesn't have to be done because they're teaching them why is your bet I'm
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:56:00.560]  not sure how I would feel I guess it isn't the right place but I don't think
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:04.600]  it's necessary to put up posters like that I feel like it's a given in any
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:08.720]  society that it is okay to be white and there's no like really it's given
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:14.360]  precautions to being white there's no repercussions additional difficulties
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  that they have to face I'd be disappointed because I don't know
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:25.960]  it in person white people are oppressed in some way and we are not there's white
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:31.880]  supremacists everywhere and they're everywhere do you think that this
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:37.000]  phrase you think that if people are posting this sign or saying this phrase
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:45.640]  around conscious they should be punished for that yes well I I believe in the
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:50.040]  first amendment so like if it's not like hate speech but I understand they're
[2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:54.520]  also like they all use these buzzwords majority millennials say oh we believe
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:57.640]  the first amendment but if something's hurtful arrest you it's just like blah
[2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:02.600]  blah blah first amendment right hate speech right white supremacists like
[2:57:02.600 --> 2:57:08.080]  get some kind of rise out of them yeah that you get sick I'm not sure if it goes
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:11.680]  so far as to be qualified for hate speech but what is hate speech to let this
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:15.040]  term for banning speech we're gonna come back with your calls stay with us

[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.720]  is just as good but you never really hardly ever see is where the next
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:39.080]  singer in a band is just as good different style but just as good as the
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:42.480]  Eagles dare that it's not a family-friendly track didn't even know
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:48.120]  that was in the computer in there but right now probably not make happy but
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:51.480]  we're taking calls right now with Michael Graves of official Michael Graves
[3:00:51.480 --> 3:00:55.680]  dot-com he's playing a free show tonight out there for all the patriots at
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:59.680]  Patsy's in Austin Texas off to down and told some of the crews gonna be in there
[3:00:59.680 --> 3:01:04.160]  and beyond with Owen Schroyer today during the war room but right now let's
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:07.560]  go ahead and go to we're gonna go to April in a minute we're gonna go to Elijah
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:11.400]  right now we'll go to everybody before our guest leaves Elijah in New York you're
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:15.440]  on the air thanks for holding hi how you doing Alex how you guys doing over there
[3:01:15.440 --> 3:01:21.440]  good brother go ahead good um listen okay so the thing that Trump can do I'll
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:27.000]  tell you this he could go push as hard as they are pushing against him by
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:30.680]  exposing the whistleblowers lawyer giving clearances to guys who had child
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:35.360]  born I mean that right there blows it all up another thing is he could also
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:39.600]  push on for the Kentucky at their election fraud at the Dems they stole
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:44.640]  no I agree Trump should go after the lawyer for the fake whistleblower the
[3:01:44.640 --> 3:01:49.880]  CIA coup who literally just you can't swoon just everywhere is I like Epstein
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:55.520]  when he's arrested I love to go to theme parks alone and foes them with kids you
[3:01:55.520 --> 3:02:01.720]  know I help people with pedophile stuff get jobs I mean it's just crazy right
[3:02:01.720 --> 3:02:05.680]  exactly and that's the that's the whole thing is like you expose them and then
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:09.880]  okay so for example I went out today in my college and I said I printed out the
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:13.360]  article eco genocide 11,000 scientists signed the order demanding global
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:17.560]  eliminate billions of humans from planet Earth I printed that out and I
[3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:22.160]  actually changed about seven people's mind to not trust the scientific
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:26.080]  community fully to not fully trust them put all of their heart into it exactly
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:30.320]  period if we just use human intelligence and human action to just wake a few
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.640]  people up it's game over because we've reached the tipping point exactly so I'm
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:38.280]  doing that locally actually because you know you guys inspired me to get my own
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:42.080]  channel and get out there the camera I saved all the money up though I worked
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:46.280]  to save up but I guess like you don't even need all that you just need to go
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:51.120]  locally into your community and just stay as active as possible because even
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:56.360]  if you just fall back a little bit the more of their system will take over and
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:00.040]  more people won't won't won't yeah their system only succeeds if there's no
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:04.120]  pushback because it's so anti-human it's so horrible and that's beautiful what
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:07.960]  you're doing what do you think about Epstein how it's really blown up now
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:17.160]  people get it okay so it was good when it was active and then as soon as it's
[3:03:17.160 --> 3:03:21.360]  dropped no one really cares about it anymore but though I am still trying to
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:26.200]  bring it up and say hey look we almost grabbed them we almost caught them and
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:30.720]  basically people are they agree on that I say hey listen this is site by these
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:35.040]  products and I told them to say who was this Alex Jones info was like yeah this
[3:03:35.040 --> 3:03:37.680]  is you know you're nice to tell them get the products that's how we find
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:40.960]  ourselves in there great just send people to band on video and say hey you
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:43.720]  know the guy that first exposed Epstein they want him off the air you know the
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:46.560]  guy that first exposed the cool against Trump find out what you're not supposed
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:49.800]  to hear doesn't everybody know that they tell you you can't have something you
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:53.400]  should go look it up and see their big lie is Jones is off the air you can't
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:57.200]  find him people don't think hey info wars.com this is wars.com God bless you I
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:02.200]  appreciate your call but I was asking you Michael I mean how big is it that I
[3:04:02.200 --> 3:04:05.320]  mean this Epstein thing they didn't get away with it by killing him I think it
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:11.360]  convicted him this is really hit the zeitgeist. It absolutely has this was
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:15.880]  the little it's the boulder that that's gone down the hill that's created the
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:22.640]  avalanche nobody believes that this man who was connected to British royalties
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:29.520]  connected to the Clintons connected to to everybody he is he's that key to this
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:35.520]  whole pedophile ring and and the child trafficking the Luciferian the spirit
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:42.680]  cooking the whole the whole nine yards and now that it's obvious this guy didn't
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:48.000]  do this swan dive off the bed because he was he was it can fix the whole rotting

[3:05:53.080 --> 3:06:23.040]  and so much news is breaking makes my head spin look at the story breaking
[3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:28.400]  Google running a brilliant project to secretly hoover up health records of
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:31.520]  millions of Americans across 21 states Wall Street Journal of course they've
[3:06:31.520 --> 3:06:35.080]  always been doing that healthy gabbards to be in Hillary retract Russia remarks
[3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:39.880]  video of that on info wars.com Bernie Sanders AOC will pay very important role
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:45.360]  in White House if I'm elected my god so much more Democrats support their own
[3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:49.680]  quick pro quo those are reports up on info wars.com Michael Graves former
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:52.720]  frontman but a smart guy that we don't have him here of the misfits of the
[3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:55.920]  great bands official Michael Graves.com sir with us we're jamming in some final
[3:06:55.920 --> 3:06:59.960]  calls here before Jill Salente takes over but I was asking you about the
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:06.000]  collapse of the West Coast particularly which the Democrats will allow the
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:09.600]  fentanyl and heroin shipped in then they have local welfare controllers that
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:13.400]  give them the check they cash it pay it in the drug gangs they order the police
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:16.440]  have to stop it then that money goes right back to Democrats we were saying
[3:07:16.440 --> 3:07:20.080]  it's more than that it's about the demoralization I totally agree we have
[3:07:20.080 --> 3:07:24.440]  this video it's up on info wars.com a Kit Daniels article California man
[3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:30.680]  arrested for eating a subway station you know sandwich on a train station
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:35.360]  meanwhile though homeless shoot heroin up on the trains don't get in trouble
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:39.200]  poop in the trains poop on the streets don't get in trouble why do they
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:43.760]  persecute citizens but not people that have totally given up let's play that
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:50.960]  clip of the man being arrested here it is you are detained and you're not free to
[3:07:50.960 --> 3:07:57.680]  go you come up here and fuck with me you see go me out at all these people you're
[3:07:57.680 --> 3:08:06.120]  eating so what it's against the law what I try to be done working on work I have
[3:08:06.120 --> 3:08:10.600]  the right to detain you no you don't yes I did please let my backpack go are you
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:17.320]  going to jail I'm not going to jail for you know fucking sound right now for
[3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:20.600]  resisting arrest I'm not resisting arrest I'll stop there it had been
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:25.880]  blamed but and again he was gonna give him a ticket search his bag the guy
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:31.240]  starts complaining but my point is is that literally the homeless are bit my
[3:08:31.240 --> 3:08:35.800]  cousin in Seattle and he got blood poisoning and died he was what he was
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:40.560]  giving one guy a $10 bill the other guy got mad and bit my cousin who died from
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:48.120]  it so literal zombies killed my cousin I was very close to it I've heard that
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:52.400]  story before Alex and it's horrible it that's a that's a terrible story but I
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:55.800]  just came from a string of shows in the Pacific Northwest and it is
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:09:01.280]  absolutely disgusting up there there's homeless people everywhere and we were
[3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:06.600]  just talking during the break I think it's it's it's throwing that depravity in
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:12.080]  our face these people who are our disease they're sick they're broken in
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:18.000]  their minds they hate everything their drug addicts to push that depravity on
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  us and you see the the the other side of that just some guy eating a sandwich
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:30.280]  um it's it's a demoralization effort but I also believe that it's also a way
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:35.520]  for like I was saying the left and the progressives and these people to gain
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:41.680]  compassion oh well we have to help these people they are the least you know
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:46.280]  among us and they need our help and it's because of the conservatives it's
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:51.360]  because of the the the people that support Trump that our world is like
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:57.400]  this absolutely and again total homelessness in many areas the country
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:00.240]  where the left are but they'll in Chicago they'll give you a ticket for eating
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:03.520]  a sandwich on the train you're not throwing food around it's like throwing
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:07.280]  food around you're gonna take it but the point is is that no no no then the
[3:10:07.280 --> 3:10:09.680]  gangs are shooting each other nobody even goes in those neighborhoods that's
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:13.600]  how the Democrats roll it's how they run things what are some of the things
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:15.840]  you're gonna talk about when you're on with Owen Schreuder today during the
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:19.600]  war room I really want to talk about perhaps getting into the more
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:25.840]  spiritual side of things and and we talk about this the energy and the the
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:30.920]  spirit of things I'm a musician I'm an artist and so it's important for me to
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:37.160]  be to be clear-headed and to make sure that I'm able to tap into that unseen
[3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:43.160]  force that that that that that higher power that is that we're all can I've
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:46.880]  been preaching a lot about connectivity in the way that music affects us and
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  by the way all these powerful people know this they're not really atheists I
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:52.000]  mean I don't want to give it to Glenn Danzig we never talked about the other
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:55.720]  times you're here but he says no there's power in Christ and power in the
[3:10:55.720 --> 3:11:00.480]  devil he at least admits it and knows it and is getting power from the dark side
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:03.760]  but but then on one side saying I'm not a leftist and I don't support the left
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:07.440]  hand bad but then singing songs about left hand rise above that's somebody
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:10.920]  that's like fouls caught between two worlds many of these people that are
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:16.880]  under Satan's control don't even know it that's true yeah you know and and and
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:22.760]  you look at communism and socialism it's it counterfeits Christianity because it
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:28.760]  goes with it it goes with the premise that that that man is flawed that that
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:34.120]  we're broken and that communism and socialism can fix it but as believers
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:39.680]  we know that that man is inherently broken and the and and and it's and it's
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:43.680]  the the grace of Jesus it's the grace of God and what was done at Calvary on the
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:49.880]  cross that saves us it's not man that saves us and as as as we get closer to
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:55.840]  that spirit and I was saying how how how the info wars products and keeps my
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:12:00.960]  spirit clean it keeps my body healthy so that I can function at a higher level
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:08.360]  my body's able to my brain's able to like the best x2 I love the x2 what's
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:13.800]  really really really changed my life not is is the is the knockout but also the
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:19.480]  chill force with the GABA has changed my life I'm one of these people again you
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:22.680]  know I'm an artist so you know I'm a little bit of a diva I have problem with
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:26.560]  anxiety I've experienced depression and since I've been on I've taken the
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:31.400]  chill force challenge with chill force and brand force the GABA has done
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:39.240]  amazing things for for me with anxiety and and keeping me you know me calm and
[3:12:39.240 --> 3:12:44.600]  and and not having me react the way that you know your brain reacts when the
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:50.480]  neuro transmitters just would just fire and and if again you'd go and research
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:53.680]  the products and what they can well that's what we do is we go out of what's
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:57.920]  already proven to work then we just source organic and high quality forms of
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:00.680]  it make sure there's a lot of it in there because you know I mean take
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:06.920]  something like what happens with turmeric well most of it has three to five per
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:10.120]  secret humanoid we actually went up the highest anybody can make 95 percent
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:14.200]  humanoid so the amount it doesn't even say giant on there because you're not
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:18.800]  supposed to count it as a concentrate you just say it has turmeric in it but
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:22.120]  it's really the strongest turmeric you're gonna find out there and that's why
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:25.320]  the stuff works so good and that's what I treat but folks like I want to be
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:29.040]  treated I take all these products my children take the products that's how
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:32.560]  we find the operation but I appreciate the fact that you use them and you like
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:38.080]  them and absolutely do chill force isn't a downer what it does is it when I take
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:41.920]  it it gives me even more clarity when I'm taking natural stimulants like
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:44.840]  turbo force which I don't take every time sometimes I'm gonna be up for 20
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:48.200]  hours working I already have so much energy I will take half a packet of
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:53.960]  turbo force but then I'm gonna need to take chill force and knockout to come
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:57.960]  down off of it and a lot of folks take it with the natural stimulus to make it
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:02.200]  smoother so that you don't have the well I can get aggressive other people can
[3:14:02.200 --> 3:14:05.160]  have anxiety attacks but that's just the way this stuff works look mother nature
[3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:08.720]  is where the drug companies got all their stuff they just twisted around and
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:12.280]  that's all we're bringing you is what God gave us and so they are amazing
[3:14:12.280 --> 3:14:16.160]  products and I appreciate you saying those plugs for my friend the war is I
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:21.240]  mean it I always hear people as well a call up and they and they want to know
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:27.120]  what they can do to they know what's going on they understand the the the
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:32.240]  problem that that were that were facing with with all of the tyranny the
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:37.120]  oppression what can I do I'm just a regular person everybody should be
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:42.600]  brushing their teeth so I mean you can buy a toothpaste everybody drinks coffee
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  in the morning buy buy coffee from it from well I appreciate you doing that
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:52.280]  into this operation we're able to pay the bills right now but I want to expand
[3:14:52.280 --> 3:14:55.200]  and I want to really give them a run for their money in 2020 because I think you
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:15:00.120]  can see it's all on the line here Gerald Salete's coming up but Jefferson Tom
[3:15:00.120 --> 3:15:05.840]  James Phillip and Jeff speaking of products go and make sure we do this
[3:15:05.840 --> 3:15:09.240]  because I hate it when they hold for this long and then I'm it's my fault

[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:16.440]  the front of the line because I don't want to cut it any more drill time and I
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:20.200]  also want to get there I know it's a hassle for those call answers but get
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:22.800]  their name and number and I want to mail them all a free t-shirt and whatever
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:25.600]  size they ask for because I apologize for keeping it all I know you had great

[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:20.480]  weeks that's right into the repo markets what's a repo market who cares it's a
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:25.280]  repo market it's money for the gamblers to get cheap so they could keep the
[3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:33.760]  equity markets going today's a shaky day now is down now it's up a bit but over
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:41.160]  there in China not happy days now Hong Kong market down over two percent as
[3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:49.760]  violence increases over there Shanghai and the Shenzhen now markets in China
[3:21:49.760 --> 3:22:01.760]  down Europe down this is artificially being propped up the protests in
[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:08.000]  Hong Kong this is a big issue and something we're following very closely
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:14.440]  the world is on fire now I think that only those fires out in California in
[3:22:14.440 --> 3:22:21.600]  Australia and Indonesia and other places that's on fire you know my saying is
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:25.680]  when people lose everything and I'm nothing left to lose they lose it and
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:33.240]  they're losing it in Hong Kong all yet began with that extradition law if you
[3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:37.360]  was found guilty of something in Hong Kong you could get transferred over there
[3:22:37.360 --> 3:22:42.360]  to China to really get shifted by the government that was the initial protest
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:47.800]  but the protest is much bigger than that the protest is against inequality you
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:52.400]  got a few people in Hong Kong at almost at a joint a lot of people living in
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:58.640]  shoeboxes over there and they don't dig the Chinese consumers even though Hong
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:02.720]  Kong you know it's Chinese until the British of course took it over and gave
[3:23:02.720 --> 3:23:10.880]  it back to China partially and the deal made in 1997 that will be semi-autonomous
[3:23:10.880 --> 3:23:16.720]  another 40 years ago all over to China and they don't like that at the Hong Kong
[3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:23.400]  people they don't want to live under an authoritarian government these protests
[3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:28.960]  are big I want to also point out to you the hypocrisy of the way the American
[3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:35.280]  media reports this in the Western media two protesters were killed in Hong Kong
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:42.040]  yesterday today this couple of days to hey how many were killed in Yemen
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:49.920]  what's the Yemen hey how about how many were killed in Congo in Sudan hey how
[3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:53.920]  many were killed down there in Chile hey don't say anything a bit about Chile
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:59.040]  America likes that billionaire in charge over there and income inequality in
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:07.800]  Chile is one of the worst in the so-called developed world United States
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:14.840]  isn't far behind of income income inequality how about the people that
[3:24:14.840 --> 3:24:20.720]  were killed in Ecuador they don't count as much so I'm wondering why two people
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:29.760]  and this is big news hey how about this one how about the 320 people that were
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:33.600]  killed in Iraq as they're demonstrating against their corrupt
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:39.680]  government and the violence and poverty racking that nation brought to you by
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:45.960]  the United States of course under the war criminal George Bush and penis
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:53.000]  Cheney I can't say dick I don't want to get censored oh no forgot Condoleezza
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:59.400]  Rice if only a woman was in charge yeah doesn't make any difference black white
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:05.600]  green yellow gender race creed color doesn't make any difference good in bed
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:14.800]  comes in all of them but going back to Hong Kong two deaths big news Iraq over
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:25.160]  300 nobody knows not a major news story so going back to the economy this is a
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:34.880]  huge issue for China because President Xi met with this lamb Mary had a little
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:40.440]  lamb no not that one there's no be honest lamb she's the chosen person to be
[3:25:40.440 --> 3:25:45.040]  running Hong Kong and they met last week this is the first time that she went
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:54.200]  to China to meet with President Xi of China and they made it very clear it
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:59.000]  will not tolerate what's going on in Hong Kong and we'll do everything to
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:04.400]  quash it I'm mentioning this because it goes back to the markets what I talked
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:16.040]  about to begin with and that is Hong Kong is the investment hub of Asia and a
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:24.960]  lot of banksters in there and guess what you're moving their money out China
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:32.240]  cannot afford to lose Hong Kong as the banking center of Asia so they're in a
[3:26:32.240 --> 3:26:41.640]  very difficult position here of stopping these protesters so keep your eye on
[3:26:41.640 --> 3:26:49.080]  that so going back to the equity markets it looks again I I would have thought
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:56.840]  the bull run was over in the equities that was my forecast that they are top
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:06.120]  you'll see it going much higher but when does a junkie have enough and that's
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:12.960]  all they are they call them investors on Wall Street in money junkies their
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:25.400]  addicts they can never get enough and the Fed is giving them their fix the
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:30.200]  monetary method on so the markets are gonna keep going up or looks like for a
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:37.720]  while unless there's a wild card event so you may be seeing new highs and the
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:50.920]  markets are up S&P 500 up some 23% this year hitting new highs so gold prices
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:59.600]  they came down a lot and now below that one thousand four hundred and sixty
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:09.520]  dollar an ounce mark so how low can gold go will it go lower or will it go
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:17.000]  higher because you know my forecast is part of it and gold breaks over 1450
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:22.760]  which it has it's gonna spike to a 2,000 and started going there but now
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:32.440]  there's a reversal so here's the reversal side of it can go go on the 1450
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:42.680]  an ounce tell you where it's gonna go you come back just a few minutes don't

[3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:02.320]  iodine well that's because different types of physiology different types of
[3:32:02.320 --> 3:32:07.880]  metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just that simple
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:13.280]  x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:19.280]  all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're
[3:32:19.280 --> 3:32:23.160]  both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to
[3:32:23.160 --> 3:32:28.640]  family or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the
[3:32:28.640 --> 3:32:34.000]  globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:37.880]  you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality eye on

[3:32:47.520 --> 3:32:56.680]  both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together you're listening to the
[3:32:56.680 --> 3:33:11.840]  alex jones show
[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:19.420]  waging war on corruption it's Gerald Solente you're listening to the alex
[3:33:19.420 --> 3:33:28.920]  jones show hello hello so where's gold going here's where it's going if it
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:36.920]  breaks below one thousand four hundred and fifty dollars an ounce my forecast
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:42.960]  is that it'll bottom out at one thousand three hundred ninety that's my
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:49.520]  forecast you know can it go lower hey who knows but that's where I see it
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:54.800]  going I don't see it going much lower than that because all the central banks
[3:33:54.800 --> 3:34:00.320]  around the world are lowering interest rates over there in the underdeveloped
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:09.120]  nations they're very risky you see the dollar is staying strong and it's
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:16.000]  staying strong because the other economies are so weak for example we're
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:23.260]  just writing the trends journal it's a weekly now and we're writing about the
[3:34:23.260 --> 3:34:30.200]  economy just before I got on the air and talking about Germany German nation
[3:34:30.200 --> 3:34:35.000]  stagnation industrial production in Germany Europe's biggest economy has
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:46.480]  slipped 4.3 percent in the 12 months to September one group is forecasting GDP
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:35:00.920]  growth at 0.3 percent in the third quarter and if forecasting GDP growth in
[3:35:00.920 --> 3:35:10.280]  all of 2020 to only one percent others are saying it's going to go lower it's
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:16.240]  coming Thursday they're coming out with the GDP numbers and Germany could now
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:21.720]  have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP which officially puts them
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:28.440]  into a recession I'm mentioning is because it's Germany so the dollars
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:35.160]  staying strong because other economies are going so weak what are the interest
[3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:48.280]  rates in Europe negative 0.5 negative what are they in the United States only a
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:56.520]  plus 1.5 oh so it could go lower here how much lower they gonna go into negative
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:03.240]  territory over there going back to the underdeveloped nations and other
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:11.880]  nations including China they have masses amounts of debt in dollars the
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:17.760]  stronger the US dollar gets the weaker their currencies go that means they
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:25.800]  have to pay back their debt with more dough as their currencies go low so
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:30.440]  that's what's going on in the world the United States is separate in so many
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:37.960]  ways from the economic indicators that are showing real serious problems coming
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:44.800]  about that aren't reported in this country before I got on the air I went on
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:52.880]  to CNBC I clicked on business and then I went to the economy do you know the
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:59.760]  last economic story they put up there on the economy on CNBC was from November
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:08.240]  10th that's right so they're not looking at the world you look what's going on in
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:16.760]  China there's a slowdown going on they're hesitant as opposed to what
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:22.880]  President Trump is saying to lower the value of their currency the you want
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:32.720]  because they have so much debt in dollar denomination it's estimated the
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:39.560]  private sector has some 16 trillion dollars in dollar denominated debt so
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:44.200]  the lower their you want goes the more they got to pay it back and now by the
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:53.320]  way the you want is going back up and it's not affecting trade because in the
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:37:59.680]  United States we saw the trade numbers come out and despite President Trump's
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:06.200]  pledge to reverse the negative trade deficit imports for goods and services
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:20.320]  leaked 5.4% last month up 17.8 billion dollars that should be yeah and for the
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:31.080]  full third quarter up to this year 481 billion dollar trade deficit or I
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:41.760]  should say imports meanwhile exports fell by 7 trillion dollars so this trade
[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:47.520]  war tariff war there's no war it's a losing war kind of reminds me all the
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:53.600]  other American wars yet a Vietnam war to Hong Kong war hey about the Iraq war
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:38:58.880]  what about the Afghan war maybe the Libyan one I got into Syrian war no
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:05.560]  winners all losers another losing war and by the way I am totally in favor of
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:15.280]  restoring the trade regulations that existed before slick Willie Clinton
[3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:23.600]  brought us into NAFTA and the World Trade Organization laws so I'm in favor of
[3:39:23.600 --> 3:39:28.800]  a self-sustaining economy so I report these numbers it's not what I
[3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:37.920]  like what I want what I wish it's what is so now when you put it all together
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:46.160]  and going back to what's going on around the world these riots and uprisings
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:54.000]  these revolts it's all about the bottom line because all the money that's been
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:40:01.760]  created has gone to the 1% and I'm not making that up the facts are there and
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:07.520]  now you're hearing all these guys like Jamie Diamond by the way you know the
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:16.600]  head of the JP Morgan Chase Bankster another guy with an attitude born on
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:25.840]  third base in 30 at a home run that's right daddy was a bankster daddy worked
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:34.240]  on Wall Street daddy open the doors to him Harvard Princeton Yale bullets bombs
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:45.640]  and banksters you got it the arrogance of these people the arrogance hey and who
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:53.880]  didn't you liberals don't forget who helped a lot Obama the Nobel Peace of
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:41:00.120]  Crap Prize winner the liar-in-chief the pathological liar-in-chief who lied his
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:06.240]  way into office as an anti-war president and he was gonna take after that
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:11.680]  Wall Street gang that shifted so many people around this country and ruined
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:16.960]  millions of lives and didn't put one of the banksters in jail you remember
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:24.200]  Eric Holder oh yeah hold this at Eric Holder oh yeah now the attorney general
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:32.600]  back then now working for a white shoe law firm over there in Wall Street gang
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:42.480]  it was too big to jail that's what's going on the money is all going to the
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:49.320]  top and the rest of the country is going to the bottom around the world but
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:58.080]  over around the world he's fighting no fight in the USA no no bullying zones
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:04.240]  you got no bullying zones you can't go out and fight that's right then the
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:11.600]  little girls and women how about the women hey where the where are the me
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:16.360]  two women and what they did to that woman down in Bolivia the mayor of a
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:20.920]  city oh you didn't see that because they didn't report it because the American
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:25.320]  government doesn't like the government in Bolivia oh all they did was drag her
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:33.960]  out of her office cut her hair poor red paint on her and make her walk barefoot
[3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:39.680]  hey where's me too you didn't see that one could you imagine if that was in a
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:46.280]  country that America liked be a different story but it's all the fairy
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:49.920]  tale when you watch the mainstream media and that's why you have to support

[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:58.800]  what you can I'm gonna try that product so talking about the economy talking
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:14.840]  what's going on around the globe and how the 1% has gained so much it's the
[3:49:14.840 --> 3:49:23.480]  numbers are real you're seeing now they've come out with the 1% has now
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:30.840]  more in assets in the entire middle class so that's why you're seeing these
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:37.960]  outbreaks around the world Lebanon that's what it's about inequality corrupt
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:46.240]  governments poverty when you go to Ecuador Chile all the countries I've
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:56.880]  been mentioning or Algeria it's about the 1% owning everything and poverty crime
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:03.040]  and corruption being the foundation of most governments I'm mentioning this
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:07.080]  because you know I'm forecasting the greatest depression is going to hit in
[3:50:07.080 --> 3:50:13.960]  2021 I'm saying 2021 because the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:19.680]  as I said to near zero to negative interest rate policy and so to banks
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:23.600]  around the world are going to do what they can to keep injecting more monetary
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:28.320]  methadone to keep the bull running but it's not going to work if you think you
[3:50:28.320 --> 3:50:32.320]  see a homeless price crisis now you haven't seen anything and I know they
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:39.760]  have one down there in Austin and when I read the mayor down there he wants to
[3:50:39.760 --> 3:50:43.800]  bring a homeless person here home here you and the governor doesn't want to
[3:50:43.800 --> 3:50:48.640]  and the governor is doing what I had proposed to do and have been proposing
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:56.880]  and that is with all the state land that we have start putting the homeless not
[3:50:56.880 --> 3:51:02.240]  in shelters but start building facilities you want to camp out you can
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:08.280]  camp out in the beautiful nature and we have farms and production they can get
[3:51:08.280 --> 3:51:15.000]  to work doing things and living decent lives rather than putting him in
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:19.400]  homeless shelters in the middle of cities where they're going to get in
[3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:27.000]  cities we get a lot more if they go to the country so anyway that's my proposal
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:31.080]  that I'm mentioning the homeless because it's this greatest depression hits
[3:51:31.080 --> 3:51:33.840]  people are going to be out in the streets they're going to be losing
[3:51:33.840 --> 3:51:38.800]  everything and when they have nothing left to lose as I said they lose it so
[3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:43.280]  you're gonna see more rights more demonstrations more crime people will
[3:51:43.280 --> 3:51:48.520]  steal Rob kill to get what they need this thing's gonna be out of control so
[3:51:48.520 --> 3:51:53.040]  when I talk about this also considering all the other products that info wars
[3:51:53.040 --> 3:52:00.000]  has you want to prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't happen and you're
[3:52:00.000 --> 3:52:05.320]  prepared for it you lose nothing if the worst happens and you prepared for
[3:52:05.320 --> 3:52:13.520]  nothing you lose everything or odds are you will so going on again about what's
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:21.680]  going on around the world one key indicator to look at are auto sales and
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:28.360]  auto sales are in a big slump trade war they don't have one over there in
[3:52:28.360 --> 3:52:35.800]  India but India car sales are down some 41% in the United States they're
[3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:41.280]  flattening out they're going down and the debt that people are taking on
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:47.760]  puff they have cars now because they're trading in the ones that they bought and
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:55.520]  taking out a new loan they're getting deeper and deeper in debt when you put
[3:52:55.520 --> 3:53:02.560]  student loan credit card debt the national debt the debt from Social
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:10.720]  Security all the debt that the United States is piled up the global debt they
[3:53:10.720 --> 3:53:17.000]  say is about 250 trillion dollars the United States debt bubble is about
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:24.120]  270 trillion dollars so things are not going to get better this is
[3:53:24.120 --> 3:53:35.480]  artificially propped up so again as we know by I mentioned Jamie Dimon Bankster
[3:53:35.480 --> 3:53:44.560]  with the JP Morgan Chase outfit weren't they convicted a bunch of guys there for
[3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:52.200]  rigging the gold market huh seems like I can recall that so the markets are rigged
[3:53:52.200 --> 3:53:59.960]  the banksters don't want to see gold prices spike it's best for them to keep
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:06.600]  gold low and talking about banksters you got that Deutsche Bank over there in
[3:54:06.600 --> 3:54:14.280]  Germany yeah it's a big bank one of the biggest in the world laying off 18,000
[3:54:14.280 --> 3:54:24.280]  people commerce back one bank after another laying off people and although
[3:54:24.280 --> 3:54:31.080]  we see the markets going up according to the latest reports coming out buybacks
[3:54:31.080 --> 3:54:41.680]  have increased stock buybacks by some 23% and trading volume is low and although
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:50.000]  money's coming back in is still great concern so we're saying is prepare for
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:58.440]  the future and on another note veterans day and I just saw a report that most
[3:54:58.440 --> 3:55:05.200]  veterans believe the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan weren't worth fighting
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:10.040]  majority of US military veterans say America's most recent wars were not
[3:55:10.040 --> 3:55:19.160]  worth fighting according to results of a Pew Research Center study it comes down
[3:55:19.160 --> 3:55:23.800]  to when it comes to the this is their language when it comes to the global war
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:32.920]  on terror roughly two-thirds of veterans 64% say they think the war in Iraq was
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:41.680]  not worth fighting in light of quote the costs versus the benefits to the United
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:50.080]  States and let us also look at the numbers what is it some 20 to 22 veterans
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:59.480]  are committing suicide a day this is a tragedy and it's immoral I hear all
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:03.480]  these liberals around me near Woodstock over it's 15 minutes from Kingston
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:07.680]  Kingston New York and by the way Kingston where we are over here what
[3:56:07.680 --> 3:56:15.160]  press put in Kingston the Guardian the English newspaper put in Kingston in
[3:56:15.160 --> 3:56:22.360]  Vogue magazine Kingston is the hotspot anyway 15 minutes northwest of here's
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:30.760]  Woodstock oh we abandoned the Kurds in Syria well the liberals say you're
[3:56:30.760 --> 3:56:36.960]  there illegally can anybody say the word illegally your rock war and illegal
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:42.800]  war the Afghan war these illegal and the people that suffer for it in our
[3:56:42.800 --> 3:56:51.160]  country are the troops and they're saying they don't want to suffer anymore so
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:58.160]  consider occupying peace WWW occupied peace the people are against these wars
[3:56:58.160 --> 3:57:04.480]  as well it's time to bring liberty love joy and beauty back to America not fear
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:08.880]  and terror and that's not my trip and I know it's not yours because you wouldn't
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:14.800]  be listening to info wards and again the trends journal we used to be a
[3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:22.840]  monthly first a quarterly and now it's a weekly no magazine in the world like it
[3:57:22.840 --> 3:57:30.880]  if there is let us know but again do what you can to support info wars and do
[3:57:30.880 --> 3:57:36.640]  what you can to change for a better future remember it does not take a
[3:57:36.640 --> 3:57:41.560]  majority to prevail but rather than I rape Tyler's minority Kenan setting
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:47.800]  brush fire
