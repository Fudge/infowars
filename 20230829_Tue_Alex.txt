[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.280]  The breaking news, stay at home, that is the order tonight from four state governors.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.900]  You absolutely must stay at home.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.680]  You must stay at home.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.800]  All gatherings are canceled until further notice.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.040]  I have issued an executive order, it's not a suggestion, it's an order.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.800]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.020]  we will take you to jail.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.960]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.200]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.640]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.160]  Quarantine will be mandatory.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.120]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.040]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040]  it.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.340]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.340]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.180]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful and I hope
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.420]  that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had chills
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.420]  since last night.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.100]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself because
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.940]  I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims, this just confirms
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.020]  everything else we've already researched.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.780]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.420]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, everything that's in the other documents, but this
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.820]  dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.780]  to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.940]  just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.940]  madmen.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.700]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.020]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.940]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.700]  It's scary.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.100]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.680]  just to keep everybody safe and that starts with the vast majority of teams deciding already
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.900]  that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games and every
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.940]  single player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.860]  keep their distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.460]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.140]  Players are not excited about this kind of idea.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.140]  No fans.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.100]  Yes, but they may have to get used to it.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.540]  But all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.300]  No fans will be allowed in.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.220]  I can't imagine how he'd play in the NFL this day and time with no fans there.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.500]  I honestly can't even conceive that.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.620]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.580]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.980]  Don't get the vaccine.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.780]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.780]  Don't have the vaccine.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.780]  You should.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.780]  Can't go to the ball game.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.940]  Don't have the vaccine.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.860]  Can't go to work because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.860]  now and go.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.860]  We've been around about everything else.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.860]  Maybe we should look into this.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.220]  Look, you'll believe it if they release it.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.260]  So just remember this transmission then.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.340]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.860]  days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.060]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.060]  vaccine.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.580]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.600]  My little sister just died her first dose.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.020]  And in Orange County, an X-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.700]  the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.500]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.200]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.420]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.060]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.380]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.780]  Don't resist when they release the bio weapon.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.180]  Submit and die with pleasure.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:05:01.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.640]  Coffee has not been available at InfowarStore.com for two years because the price went up
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.900]  too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.340]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.380]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.500]  I was blown away.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.740]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.000]  to you right now.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.260]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.980]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at InfowarStore.com
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.500]  exclusively.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.900]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast tastes great.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.180]  It's the strong one.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.180]  Really strong.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.780]  These are all close second and thirds.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.780]  Medium Roast.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780]  Wake of America.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.780]  Woo!
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.780]  That's what my go-to.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.100]  Dark Roast, Tip of the Spear tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100]  strong.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100]  Gives you that pep.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.460]  They're all three available at InfowarStore.com and they fund our operation and each order
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.220]  gets a pocket Constitution citizen rollback.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:16.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.860]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.860]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.180]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:48.380]  It is Tuesday, August 29th, 2023.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.380]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.340]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.220]  I'm hosting all four hours today.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.620]  You have so many big guests joining us.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.260]  We have eyewitness reporters that have been getting the nightmare bombshell footage of
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.620]  the downed power lines and the cover-up that's going on and the water being turned
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.140]  off and eyewitnesses that the police now confirm or tell them the truth that both
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.420]  ends of the town, only one exit, one entrance were blocked under orders from the police
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.540]  chief and the emergency managers.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.660]  They're going to be joining us.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:31.940]  Coming up in the second hour, Eric West, a well-known developer and real estate agent
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.200]  and very respected in the community and of course, Fish and other well-known respected
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.620]  person in the community.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.820]  They're going to be joining us coming up next hour.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.980]  Stu Peters is going to be joining us as well.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.620]  And then in the fourth hour, Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:54.620]  Now that said, let me just say something about yesterday's show.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.100]  I got a little mad and walked off the show the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100]  That's not an act.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.920]  Anybody that's watched the show for decades knows occasionally I get so mad just about
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.020]  things in general that I can't do the show or I'm going to yell and scream and do all
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.520]  those things that go viral, but they're not good for me and it's not good for people
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]  in general.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.260]  It may be entertaining, but that's why you don't get the big blow ups really ever on
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.360]  air anymore or nothing like they used to be because I leave.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.980]  And I am fundamentally upset about the world just like you are.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.300]  I am so pissed about what's going on.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.820]  And I love the audience.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.820]  I love the crew.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.620]  I love everybody.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.900]  And that just happens occasionally.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.620]  And I get up here and start threatening to leave or quit.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.940]  That's something that's always in my mind, but something I can't ever physically do.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.620]  So maybe one one-thousandth of the time I want to quit.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.380]  99% of the time I don't want to, but I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.660]  When I get upset, when I get angry, when I start going into a rage, I just say what
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.520]  I'm thinking.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.260]  And that's what I was thinking.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.460]  I did cogently when I was getting remarried seven years ago in Hawaii of all places.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.680]  My second wife, who soon to be was pregnant with my fourth child.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.940]  My daughter is now almost seven or six and a half.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.760]  She wasn't pressuring me to quit or cut back.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.340]  I said, hey, I work, as you know, 15 hours a day.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.820]  I never take off back then especially.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.700]  And I said, I'd really like to keep influence going with other hosts that host the show.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.220]  I like to do special reports a few times a week, write books, make films, and really
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.340]  come in with well thought out mini documentaries and things like I've done
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.580]  in the past that are really the most effective.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:50.180]  And that after, at that point, doing like 24 years, 23 years on air, now it's 29,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:57.260]  that I really wanted to make that transition.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.620]  And I hate to let our enemies govern what I do, but they do because the world's just
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:10.420]  in too much trouble for me to try to shift into more of a analysis guru type guy that
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.540]  just sits back and puts out the Jordan Peterson broad brushes.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.060]  I've got to stay as a general in the information war right in the thick of the battle.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.500]  That's my lot in life.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.780]  And the fact that my enemies really want to get me off air and really want to silence
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.020]  me and know how important our role is lets me know that it's my responsibility.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.660]  And so instead of cutting back, as you've seen, I started a new show weekly with Crowder.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.620]  We'll be starting shows about three days a week very soon.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.420]  And we're doing more special reports again, and I'm writing books, and we're going
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.260]  into development on films, and I'm going in a lot of other shows.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.780]  I can always, we can always open up the company email and have 50 interview requests
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.780]  a day.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:01.060]  And for years, I just politely declined almost all of them just because it's too exhausting.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.860]  But now I'm doing interviews every day, some days, three, four times a day.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.700]  And I just want my enemies to know that you did this.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:17.380]  And that's how the Lord works is because I'm not going to be allowed to, like at the
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.820]  end of the Patriot, Mel Gibson is a composite of three, two stories.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.060]  Three true stories, composite of historical fiction.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.820]  I'm comparing myself to him, a fictional composite of real characters, Swamp Fox and others.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.100]  But it really just does come down to that is its duty.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.420]  And I'm going to continue on and most days I want to be here.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.700]  Sometimes I do want to forget this all exists.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.620]  But on one end, you've got us that are totally committed to fighting and you the hardcore
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.780]  listeners and viewers and activists who I salute.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.860]  On the other end, you got people that still are in La La Land and have no idea what's
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.300]  going on.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.260]  And the globalists count on keeping all of them in the dark so they're not aware of
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.260]  what's going on.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.520]  It's really that simple.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.980]  And so we can go try to disengage the new world order, but it's coming for us.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.580]  It's not going to go away.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:16.580]  And the road of sticking our head in the sand, even partially, very quickly will bring
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.500]  us into a dystopic nightmare.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.340]  As you can already see, we're entering.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.420]  And so the cautionary tale I give you about myself is one for yourself, because I would
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.180]  imagine a lot of you would rather we're not in this situation.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.340]  In fact, I think all of you.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.300]  But we talked about those that are still asleep and those of us that are awakening
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.780]  or coming to new levels of understanding.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.300]  But then there is that tiny minority of people who erase color and creed, but they
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.340]  serve evil.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:54.320]  Who count on our laziness or count on the fact that we're sick of engaging them or
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.420]  count on the fact that they're so disgusting that we really don't want to get in the
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.220]  pit with them and fight them.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.300]  Not out of cowardice, but just out of disgust.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:12.300]  But you got to understand, those of us that are warriors have to climb down into that
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.500]  pit.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.300]  And we have to engage these people because that pit is caving in all around itself,
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.860]  sucking like a black hole, all of civilization into it.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:32.900]  So I was also frustrated with myself yesterday because two and a half hours into the show,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.340]  I had only hit maybe three of the stacks.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.060]  And every one of these stacks, a bunch of them from yesterday, a bunch of them from
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:45.580]  today is beyond amazing, beyond critical.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.820]  So we have official U.S. government documents on weather control to control the population.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.660]  Going back to 1965 and up to today, easily you can spend two hours on that.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.420]  We're going to hit it and spend 10 minutes on it.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.580]  Give me the synopsis.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:06.580]  We've got the over-the-top developments in Ukraine and Russia.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.560]  We've got the Washington Post and New York Times and others in new articles calling for
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.700]  censoring the public for the greater good, evil for the cause of good, injustifies
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.340]  the means.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:25.900]  We have the insane developments in the different Trump kangaroo trials that are being developed
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.100]  and set up.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.740]  We have it all coming up today and so much more.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.860]  So you will definitely want to stay with us for this.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:47.820]  Now the first thing I want to hit when we come back is California and New York,
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.060]  two captured states on each end of the country, on each coast, on the Atlantic and
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:15:00.260]  Pacific side, have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:10.940]  websites and I'll show it to you and said that indeed they're bringing back the controls.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.860]  Now we're not spineless creatures so we're going to be able to expose this and block
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.380]  this on the second go-around, but we really caught them with their pants down almost two
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.060]  weeks ago with the whistle-blower info, they still want to head with their roll out of
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.380]  the fear and it's here.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.020]  But I was sent by the whistle-blower this morning, a link to the California website
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:41.140]  they just updated yesterday and it says the controls are back and here they are, right
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.340]  there in black and white, they're going to roll them out.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.160]  So we have that and a lot more.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.920]  It's just one of the stacks, right here.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.600]  When we come back it's all on Infowars.com, the tip of the spear in the fight for human
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]  liberty.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.920]  Stay with us.
[00:15:57.847 --> 00:16:05.847]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength.
[00:16:05.847 --> 00:16:08.847]  And they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:13.847]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:19.847]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:24.847]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:05.847]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:08.847]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:17.847]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases into fluoresolicic acid.
[00:19:17.847 --> 00:19:19.847]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:25.847]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:33.847]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:42.847]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:19:42.847 --> 00:19:47.847]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:19:47.847 --> 00:19:53.847]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.

[00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:34.909]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:36.909]  Well, so do I.
[00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:38.909]  And I know how to do it.
[00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:40.909]  And you know how to do it.
[00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:47.909]  And together, we're going to choose the way forward as we arrive today.
[00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:56.909]  At the exact center of the fork in the road.
[00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:59.909]  And there's no going back.
[00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:05.909]  There's the path of resistance, or there is the path of total enslavement.
[00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:07.909]  Come on.
[00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:10.909]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:12.909]  You're stronger than this.
[00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:16.909]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities.
[00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:22.909]  And you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:29.909]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:36.909]  All right, it's official. It's everywhere they're rolling out the COVID restrictions, as my whistleblower told me two weeks ago.
[00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:40.909]  We released the info about 11 days ago, 12 days ago.
[00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:43.909]  California, New York, you name it, you should go read it for yourself.
[00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:46.909]  I didn't even pay attention to this. Was it in the news?
[00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:52.909]  The whistleblower contacted me this morning and sent me this document I'm about to show you.
[00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:55.909]  And I went and looked. They updated it yesterday.
[00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:58.909]  And they said the COVID restrictions never went away.
[00:21:58.909 --> 00:22:01.909]  And they were about to be brought back.
[00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:03.909]  Nice.
[00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:06.909]  Double speak.
[00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.909]  And it's incredible.
[00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:10.909]  It's right there.
[00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:22.909]  And through the institutions, the corporations, to the hospitals, to the hotels, through the colleges, through the public schools, all over the country,
[00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:26.909]  shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:30.909]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:32.909]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:37.909]  And remember what I said two Fridays ago.
[00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:44.909]  I said, my sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said,
[00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:50.909]  said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:56.909]  Now, five, six days later.
[00:22:56.909 --> 00:23:02.909]  It's a little longer. It was last Tuesday, so about eight days ago.
[00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:05.909]  Seven days ago, they said, you know what?
[00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:11.909]  We're going to have a new shot that's just happened to be ready for the new variant on the 15th of September.
[00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:12.909]  Now, what did I say?
[00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:16.909]  They were told the beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:24.909]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later, everywhere.
[00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:33.909]  They just opened up on the public every control corporate outlet and then the institutions to create the fear.
[00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:37.909]  And now you go to the grocery store here in Austin, a third of the people are wearing masks.
[00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:40.909]  Two weeks ago, you might be in there and there'd be 150 people.
[00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:43.909]  You might see two masks.
[00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:45.909]  Now you go everywhere.
[00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:46.909]  That's where I live.
[00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:48.909]  We're getting reports, the same thing everywhere.
[00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:49.909]  And the articles are coming out.
[00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:52.909]  Oh, last week it was just a few hospitals in New York.
[00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:54.909]  Now it's most of them.
[00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:55.909]  It was a few nursing homes.
[00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:56.909]  Now it's all of them.
[00:23:56.909 --> 00:24:04.909]  And the same thing spreading all over the country from the west and east coast towards the middle.
[00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:09.909]  So they've attacked the August 18th episode.
[00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:14.909]  Saying, oh, it's disinformation because they don't want you to develop your own opinion now and say no,
[00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:16.909]  they want to just slip it in before you say no.
[00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:21.909]  So here's some excerpts of myself, not last Friday, but the Friday before last,
[00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:28.909]  and then a clip of the press secretary yesterday afternoon announcing the quote new booster.
[00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:36.909]  Whistleblowers from TSA and border patrol have raised the alarm to info wars that the Biden administration is setting the stage for full COVID lockdowns
[00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:42.909]  that will begin with incremental restrictions like masking TSA employees in mid-September.
[00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:49.909]  The Biden administration is setting the stage for full COVID lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions in mid-September.
[00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:55.909]  Two weeks later, FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:24:55.909 --> 00:25:02.909]  So currently they said that they will have and there'll be an updated vaccine September, mid-September.
[00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:09.909]  The Biden administration is setting the stage for full COVID lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions in mid-September.
[00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:12.909]  There'll be an updated vaccine September, mid-September.
[00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:14.909]  So are we going to sit here and take this?
[00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:20.909]  Are we going to sit here and lay out of this and let them put the narrative out and use the fear mongering?
[00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:25.909]  And then it's the concerts and then it's the grocery stores and then it's the fear and all the same thing.
[00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:28.909]  We're going to go through Groundhog Day again.
[00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:31.909]  We'll work hard to expose it. It'll get us ahead of it.
[00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:36.909]  But I got to see the suspicion we'll be sitting here very soon going Alex Jones is right again.
[00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:38.909]  Let's not fail this time, folks.
[00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:46.909]  Please, please.
[00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:53.909]  Now let's play the full clip of the press secretary yesterday afternoon.
[00:25:53.909 --> 00:26:02.909]  Eleven, twelve days after we broke it, saying September 15th, in the full hour I did, I said September 15th.
[00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.909]  That's what I was told.
[00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:05.909]  I said it like 10 times.
[00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:10.909]  He said, we'll be getting the guidelines the next week.
[00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:13.909]  But then by September 15th, they announce it.
[00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:19.909]  Well, now the guidelines are out, just like he told me.
[00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:21.909]  Here she is.
[00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:28.909]  The president said in Tahoe that he intended to believe, decided to recommend everyone get the new vaccine.
[00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:30.909]  When is he going to decide finally?
[00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:33.909]  So I think you've heard from the FDA and CDC.
[00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:36.909]  They've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:44.909]  So certainly they said that they will have and there'll be an updated vaccine in September, mid-September, I believe.
[00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:59.909]  So we know that, as you all know, vaccinations against COVID-19 remains the safest protection for avoiding hospitalization, long term health outcomes and death, which is why we are we are going to be encouraging Americans to stay up to date on their vaccines.
[00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.909]  And she says it's the 15th.
[00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:06.909]  So our whistleblower nailed it because they were getting the direct info.
[00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:07.909]  Of course, they nailed it.
[00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:11.909]  It's hard to nail it when you're just telling the truth.
[00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:16.909]  Totally nailed it, nailed it, nailed it, nailed it, nailed it.
[00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:24.909]  Not just, oh, it's a whistleblower naming the day over a week and a half before they set it themselves.
[00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:29.909]  That's called nailing it.
[00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:38.909]  That's like Michael Jordan flying 35th in the air and dunking and breaking the rim.
[00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:40.909]  That's what we did together.
[00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:43.909]  And they are freaked out.
[00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:46.909]  They are super pissed right now.
[00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:49.909]  We're not getting caught with our pants down this time.
[00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:52.909]  They've been caught with their pants down, but they can't help it.
[00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:56.909]  They're still rolling ahead.
[00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:58.909]  But you catch what she said there.
[00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:00.909]  She reads the notes.
[00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:02.909]  Whatever the question is, she flips the page and reads it.
[00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:03.909]  OK, the 15th.
[00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:04.909]  It'll protect you.
[00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:05.909]  It's hospitalization.
[00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:07.909]  You know, spreading and getting sick, whatever.
[00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:10.909]  Shame old lies.
[00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:12.909]  They always tell.
[00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:18.909]  And it's sometimes you'll watch a football game and the coach just keeps running up the middle of the same play.
[00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:21.909]  Or they go.
[00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:33.909]  You know, out for a far pass or whatever, and they just run the same play over and over again, and they're just run the same play, same play, the same play, the same play, same play, same play.
[00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:34.909]  All right.
[00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:40.909]  I'm going to come back and drill through all this when we return, because it's wild and it's on.
[00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:43.909]  You got to go to info wars dot com and read the article.
[00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:45.909]  You got a link through to the California site.
[00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:47.909]  We're going to link to New York as well.
[00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:49.909]  Got to tell the writers about that.
[00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:52.909]  And it's it's it's announcing it all right here.
[00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:58.909]  Most populous state teeing you up for the same garbage.
[00:28:58.909 --> 00:29:02.909]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that are amazing.
[00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:04.909]  High quality coffee has not been available.
[00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:09.909]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:12.909]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:21.909]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:24.909]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:33.909]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:35.909]  It is game changing.
[00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:37.909]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.

[00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:02.909]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them.
[00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:06.909]  But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:11.909]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy.
[00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:13.909]  To slay those whose ways are upright.
[00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:18.909]  But their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken.
[00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:22.909]  Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of any wicked.
[00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:27.909]  For the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:33.909]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever.
[00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:36.909]  In times of disaster they will not wither.
[00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:39.909]  In days of famine they will have plenty.
[00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:41.909]  But the wicked will perish.
[00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:44.909]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field.
[00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:48.909]  They will be consumed and they will go up in smoke.
[00:30:58.909 --> 00:31:00.909]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:03.909]  Yeah they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power.
[00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:05.909]  But they can be defeated.
[00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:08.909]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:12.909]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body.
[00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:16.909]  By purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:20.909]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:22.909]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:25.909]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:29.909]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:31.909]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:34.909]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.

[00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:54.909]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:57.909]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:31:58.909 --> 00:32:05.909]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:09.909]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:11.909]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom.
[00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:13.909]  A massive dose of bee pollen.
[00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:18.909]  A gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:20.909]  It's about to sell out.
[00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:21.909]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:23.909]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:36.570]  Breaking through the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:47.169]  You know, a lot of people think that rock and rollers party, but I can tell you, it's
[00:33:47.169 --> 00:33:48.169]  easy.
[00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:49.169]  Top parties.
[00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:56.010]  A little bird told me once, one of the crazy things I've seen in this wild 29 years on
[00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.010]  there.
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.010]  Whoo!
[00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:22.970]  All right, let me get into the big news on their attempts to bring back all the restrictions
[00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:30.450]  election for mail-in ballots in a moment, but first off, I'm very extremely excited to announce,
[00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.529]  sold out for six, seven, eight months.
[00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:36.529]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest ecumenoid out there.
[00:34:36.529 --> 00:34:40.650]  Most turmeric is 5%, does a great thing for you, even if you buy bags of it, that's
[00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:45.370]  what curry is, tastes great, I'm addicted to it, but that's at 4 or 5%.
[00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.270]  That's what raw turmeric is.
[00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:55.830]  This is 95% ecumenoid, all naturally compounded, the strongest on the market, period, the leading
[00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.830]  competitor is 75%.
[00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:02.670]  We went to a top manufacturer years ago, and we said, how much more does it cost
[00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.150]  to go the strongest you can do it?
[00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.750]  They said, we'll get back with you, they said, we can go 95, that's the strongest
[00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:13.810]  you can do, unless you use chemicals to concentrate it, and we didn't want that.
[00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:19.330]  We said, do it, cost like $3 more a bottle for us, on top of the price it already was.
[00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:24.810]  Strongest you're gonna get, anti-inflammatory immune system, flexibility support, joint support,
[00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.690]  beyond that, it is rocket fuel, it is amazing, I'm so glad it's back, because
[00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.650]  I ran out of my supply, and I took a bunch of it this week, and my Achilles pain and
[00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:38.810]  my knee pain is gone, because this right leg has been through an Achilles-blown, leg-broken
[00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.690]  compound fracture, I mean, this right leg has been through hell and back.
[00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:48.490]  I'm not gonna mention half the other injuries, but pain-free right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:52.529]  I remember about four years ago, my wife had really bad sciatica, she's playing so
[00:35:52.529 --> 00:35:58.850]  much tennis, she's also a yoga instructor, and looks like a Greek statue with her clothes
[00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.770]  off, and I said, but she's in perfect shape, it's ridiculous, looks like a 20 year
[00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.970]  old gymnast, and she said, I got these horse pill turmeric, and you're saying
[00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:07.970]  that's gonna help me?
[00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.529]  These barely help, I gotta take three of them, and each pill is three times stronger
[00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:16.490]  than yours, and I said, that's cause under FDA, you gotta just say, it is a raw turmeric
[00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:22.810]  value, you're not allowed to, you say it's a quote, concentrate, technically, the way
[00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:26.049]  the rules were, you just gotta call it turmeric, she said, okay, let me try it,
[00:36:26.049 --> 00:36:31.049]  she said, it's incredible, it got rid of 90% of my sciatica, whereas I had to take
[00:36:31.049 --> 00:36:35.049]  three or four of this other one, I take one or two of these, boom, it's almost gone,
[00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:41.130]  not totally gone, almost gone, a lot of stretching and other things, she's able to get
[00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.569]  rid of it, but she plays tennis sometimes two hours a day, and hopping around on the
[00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:48.890]  concrete, you know, it does that, so she's very good, one of the best players in Austin,
[00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:54.130]  but that's a sad issue, this she loves, this she's religious about, it ran on a few
[00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.370]  months ago, she's, where is it, and I said, it's gone, well I know you got
[00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.930]  some around the office, bring it to me, we didn't, cause any loose bottles of this
[00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:06.130]  disappear, infowarstore.com, it is back, joint support, mobility support, flexibility
[00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:11.610]  support, inflammation support, turmeric, root, extract, 95% humanoid,
[00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:19.810]  baswala, cicreta extract, organic, spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thine leaf,
[00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:25.490]  pepperdine, concentrated black pepper, for better upload, it's back, 25% off,
[00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.210]  infowarstore.com, and despite the fact we're going to sell out of X3 in the
[00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.730]  limited supply we got, the best iodine out there, and vitamin real fusion, we're
[00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:39.650]  keeping both up in the flash sale until they're gone, and that is less than one
[00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.970]  week, and it'll be ten weeks until survival shield X3 comes back in, and
[00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:48.170]  about a month until more vitamin and mineral fusion comes in, but we're still
[00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.770]  discounting, cause I want you to try it, I want you to experience it, and we need the
[00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:56.970]  funds right now, the flash sale for vitamin and mineral fusion and X3 is live
[00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:02.770]  right now, take advantage of it, separately we have three limited edition shirts,
[00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.490]  one of them, hardly any left, it's our mugshot, when they didn't do the mugshot
[00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.450]  in New York a few months ago, we made our own mugshot, same political
[00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.810]  prisoner, there's like 500 shirts left of that, when it's gone, it's gone, it's
[00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.930]  like Alex Joseph, president, limited edition, no longer available, even though
[00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.529]  people liked it, I said these are all limited edition, shirts going forward,
[00:38:20.529 --> 00:38:23.890]  limited edition, we run them for a few months, that's it, but we have the two
[00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.450]  new real mugshot ones, that say never surrender on the back, infowars.com,
[00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.930]  on the front, political prisoner, we'll support the broadcast, support
[00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.370]  president Trump, and get them, those are being printed right now, they come next
[00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:39.290]  week, so get your order in now, they'll be shipped out to you as soon as they
[00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:44.890]  arrive, you got Trump, 2024 on the front, on the back, never surrender, and then
[00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:50.170]  the other shirt says, political prisoner, there's also a gold version as well,
[00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:55.490]  that's a pretty gaudy, but definitely matches with the golden toad, el
[00:38:55.490 --> 00:39:00.730]  Trumpo, so those are all available, the shirt that's selling out is discounted
[00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:08.610]  1776, the others are limited edition as well, fundraiser shirts, okay.
[00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:37.670]  Let's dive in and get done with the big COVID news. It's so important because we know we can do something about this. We know we've already two in a Muhammad Ali fight, and we're fighting George Foreman. This is hypothetical. George Foreman was a tank and this never happened.
[00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:56.670]  This is like we've already been in a competition, already been in a match years ago with George Foreman and he barely beats us. And now we got the rematch and we came out, ladies and gentlemen, and literally knocked his ass down in the first round.
[00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:27.310]  That was getting the jump on him. And he laid on the mat till the nine count and barely got back up. So if we come in on the global list, this is an allegory. I don't mean actual violence. It's a parable. It's an analogy. I know you know that listeners but the media will say something other so I have to do the proviso. That's just a little asterisk at the end. We don't mean real violence at the end.
[00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:57.310]  It's an allegory. It's a parable, as I just said. Do we let him, now that he's got back up, get his wits about him? Or do we go ahead and just finish the fight right now? And that means you share the articles. You share the videos. You call Congress. You call talk radio. You cut your own videos. You comment on videos. You make the biggest buzz you can. You go speak at city council. You go speak at county commission. You go speak at the state house peacefully.
[00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:27.310]  They lied about the mass. They lied about the origin of the virus. They lied about the injections. They hurt our children. They caused mass suicide. They collapsed the third world and killed over 80 million people with starvation. The UN's got their big UN treaty. They want to ram through with a new hysteria and they're trying it right now. Let's not go along with this. Let's say no collectively together.
[00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:57.310]  George Foreman's starting to get back up. And I know really when the boxing only do it up to like, they go all the way to 10, I forget. The point is, is that George Foreman's getting back up. And I hate to compare the great Christian pastor, amazing person, probably the best boxer ever when it comes to being a good person. Also one of the best boxers ever. I don't want to say it's wrong to describe George Foreman as the new world order. In fact, I just kind of spit these analogies out. And now in hindsight, I want to apologize.
[00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:27.310]  The fellow Texan, George Foreman, I'm trying to compare him with the new world order. I apologize. But I mean, I'm talking about a formidable opponent. I think the American people are the best there is. So I'll call this Muhammad Ali. And he's getting up. Anybody knows about George Foreman? You knock his ass down. When he gets back up, he's coming with everything he's got. So let's not sit here and get all excited.
[00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:57.310]  About how much success we just had. We'd knock George Foreman down because he's getting back up right now. Now I'm done with the analogy, so let's plow the news right now. And again, I could spend the whole show on just the California new COVID guidelines they put out that the TSA told us was going to be coming out in the next few weeks. Here it is. California is the bellwether, the test site for all of it. The test balloon site.
[00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:25.310]  Alex Jones is right. California launches COVID guidelines page warns COVID-19 has never gone away. And it goes in to say, take all your shots, have your vaccine passport with you to travel to get into businesses. Don't go to work if you think you're sick. Again, wear your mask everywhere.
[00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:44.310]  And it goes on to say the mask protects you and all these lies. Lockdown 2.0, fact checkers say COVID mandate are not being rolled out as they are being rolled out. Very important report. You saw the White House press secretary say it as well.
[00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:57.310]  Of course, the Democrats continue the proud tradition of wearing white masks to show their political affiliation like they did at the end of the Civil War and like they do now as the KKK and now the KKK 2.0.
[00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:20.310]  Here is the actual current safety measures. As you can see on screen of your TV viewer COVID19.ca.gov. See that right there. And I suggest you go read it. It's only 123456789 pages long.
[00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:40.310]  And it's all right there. It says it never ended. And now we're bringing it back. And that we've got our smart plan and the past restrictions that they say are coming back, what to do. And it is the original plan. Quarantine isolation, digital vaccine record.
[00:44:40.310 --> 00:45:01.310]  Education and childcare, putting the mask back on the kids. Masking, vaccinations and testing at the schools, all back. Workplace safety, maskings, all of it, all the same policies back.
[00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:11.310]  Wear a mask to keep from spreading the virus to those who are vulnerable, even though it doesn't. This includes those with immune systems, those who are pregnant and the unvaccinated.
[00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:21.310]  So we put a check on that. Travel, keep California healthy and our communities open by following CDC travel guidelines. Remember, do what we say and we'll stop the spread.
[00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:33.310]  Do's and don'ts. Protect yourself and others by keeping these common safety steps in mind. Get your shots. Wear your mask. On and on and on. Get tested.
[00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:47.310]  Do not lose your proof of vaccination. You'll need it. Gathering safely. Basically the exact same policies. It's a huge section.
[00:45:48.310 --> 00:46:12.310]  The smarter plan. Do what we did last time. How our experiences last time inform our future. How we're preparing for the future. Well, last time we know that you lied to us, it was all a giant fraud. Caused depression, death, destruction of the economy, collapsed the third world. But they say that's the plan. COVID-19 disease control and prevention. And it goes through it all.
[00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:26.310]  Okay, so they're rolling it back out again. But remember, the illegal aliens were all exempt from the shots because the UN said they wouldn't sign on to the liability protection that the western governments signed on to.
[00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:43.350]  Just remember, they didn't give an F about masks, vaccines, or lockdowns while they were importing massive amounts of migrants into the country without your consent.
[00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:56.350]  Oh, but conspiracy theorists spread false information about the return of COVID. That was last Friday. That didn't age too well, did it?
[00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:05.350]  UMass Memorial reinstate staff mask mandates have dramatic increase in COVID cases. CBS News.
[00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:11.350]  Five administration eyes mid-September for new COVID-19 booster shot rollout. What did I tell you weeks before?
[00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:19.350]  CDC denies COVID restrictions coming back, but they are. He says it's for everybody and it works this time.
[00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:38.350]  So, that's that stack. I'm going to set it aside until Dr. Staniel, Stella Emanuel joins us. And now, let's move the next stack into position.
[00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:53.350]  Let's look at cause and effect. I talked about this yesterday, but I didn't get to it. So, let's get this important little stacky out of the way.
[00:47:53.350 --> 00:48:03.350]  Daily Mail. And they have the same numbers in the United States per capita. It's much worse numbers, but per capita it's around the same.
[00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:24.350]  And they're having all sorts of problems. At least 500 UK flights canceled by air traffic chaos as controllers input flight plans by hand.
[00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:35.350]  And that causes delays here. And bosses admit they have no idea when network failure could be fixed while thousands are stranded across the world.
[00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:45.350]  And we've had the same AI automated systems fail here multiple times the last few years. We're told there's problems here now.
[00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:51.350]  Remember Southwest a few months ago got totally shut down for a couple days. But this is system-wide in the UK.
[00:48:51.350 --> 00:49:04.350]  And they say they don't have enough trained FAA folks in England, it's called something else, to actually bring the flights in. They don't know how to do it anymore.
[00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:17.350]  So, see how when you only have AI and only have computers that run it all, like most of the flights, take off smooth, land smooth, but it's a autopilot flying.
[00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:27.350]  And they're talking about getting rid of pilots altogether. They introduce legislation and only have one pilot in planes, which gives the global total control.
[00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:34.350]  And that leads us to this point. AI humanoid pilot might be able to solve pilot shortage.
[00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:41.350]  It's an article from Zero Hedge linked to an article from American Airlines.
[00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:49.350]  AI humanoid pilot might be able to solve the pilot shortage. The pilot shortage is due to heart attacks, blood clots, and myocarditis.
[00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:59.350]  So, see, you hit the general public with the shots. You hit the airline pilots with the shots.
[00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:11.350]  They then can't pass the medical, just like you put transgenderism and critical race theory and all the rest of it in the military and force shots.
[00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:16.350]  Good people get out, and then now the military can't function. They put an order out last month.
[00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:23.350]  Secretary of Defense saying, if you're transgender, no need to show up for your formation or drills or even wear a uniform. You can just do whatever you want.
[00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:30.350]  I thought that was a joke from MASH, where, you know, the guy's always running out of the military.
[00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:36.350]  So he wants to get a Section 8 to say he's mentally ill. But if you're younger, you don't know about MASH.
[00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:42.350]  But there's a comedy show in the 60s and 70s based around the Korean War.
[00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.350]  Can we play the theme song, maybe a MASH, if you can find it?
[00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:55.350]  But now just totally destroy the force right as they convert over to robots.
[00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.350]  I've been telling you that for 20 years. Here it is. And here it is.
[00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:06.350]  A.I. brings the robot wingman to aerial combat. This is out of the Defense Department.
[00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:12.350]  How now they're going to have – make sure you've all got a robot wingman.
[00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:20.350]  Plus the pilots can't seem to be able to fly anymore because of all the heart attacks and blood clots and myocarditis.
[00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:25.350]  So they've got that all taken care of.
[00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.350]  All right.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:35.260]  Let's now, because we're doing the whole next hour on Hawaii and boy, the biggest developments
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:40.820]  yet are about to come out. Let's talk about how the system plans to block us as we try
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.180]  to wake up humanity. Now, I talked about this over a decade ago. We learned about
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:49.520]  it and then I talked about it a lot when I was under attack by it and watched congressional
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.940]  hearings where they had the CIA and the Defense Department at the House Armed Services
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:58.260]  Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee that I wasn't invited to. And even when I went
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.780]  up there later for more hearings, they wouldn't let me in. Oh, we're just going to accuse
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:13.780]  you of being a Russian spy in here. You can't come in here. I'm a Russian spy. Sure.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:19.780]  So here it is. The Washington Post calls for reducing free speech to improve democracy.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:25.620]  So we've got to silence everybody that doesn't agree with us and all their past lies or we're
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:34.420]  surrendering. And look how we're surrendering. We're surrendering to them, actually. This video
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.900]  of this, a 12-year-old student in Colorado Springs was removed from class and bitched out
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.780]  in front of the class for having a Gadsden flag patch on his backpack. That's the oldest flag,
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:48.820]  the first flag that we had at the start of the Revolutionary War, even before
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:59.140]  the militia leader's wife came up with the flag and ended it,
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.100]  according to George Washington's specifications. She made the flag in less than one day.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:12.180]  And, well, the school claims the flag has origins of slavery. Well, you could say that
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:17.860]  about the U.S. flag or any other flag. Kid just grins. He knows his history better
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:24.740]  than the teachers. In fact, let's go ahead and roll the audio. Here it is.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:36.100]  Do they know what the Gadsden flag is? The historical flag? So the reason that they do not
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.940]  want the flag, the reason you do not want the flag,
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:51.780]  is due to its origins with slavery. You can go to Africa where slavery is still legal in
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.220]  six countries and say take down their flags, or Saudi Arabia that has it going on.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.220]  There's the U.S. flag right there that later fought a revolution and a civil war to end
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:08.900]  slavery. But they've already said they want that flag, too. The comeback is the Gadsden flag
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:14.900]  is the oldest U.S. flag there is, different variants of it. It's the colony should unite
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:19.300]  Snake, don't tread on me, and then it's the first Navy flag. That's the Navy flag
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:28.020]  that John Paul Jones flew. That is the oldest flag in the United States.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.580]  That's actually what Benjamin Franklin wanted it to be, was a rattlesnake.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.260]  Yeah, wouldn't being an eagle be a rattlesnake?
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.700]  You can make the joke that only the Mexicans have a snake on their flag. Actually,
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.780]  they're probably stealing it from us. But the point is,
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.140]  that's the original American flag, and they're saying you can't have it.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.780]  Again, that's the level of this crap. Sorry, go ahead and roll the video.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:55:02.340]  That is what was, that's the reasoning behind the Gadsden flag.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.260]  The don't tread on me. Which is the Gadsden flag.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:15.540]  Okay, so he, what's going to happen if he doesn't take it all?
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.500]  I mean, he is able to go, I was actually just telling him, like,
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:26.260]  I was upset that he was missing so much school. I'm like, ah, so I asked him, can he just take
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.700]  his stuff out of his bag and go back to class? Like, I just wanted to go back to class.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.340]  All right, it goes on another two and a half minutes. We're going to post it on the live
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:38.020]  show feed on Infowars.com. So that's who these people are. They want control of everything.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:44.100]  Judge rejects sorority sister's lawsuit, walking trans woman from joining. The court will not
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:50.740]  define a woman, but they'll define your quote, a minority for special benefits.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:57.300]  Half of transgender prison inmates convicted of sex crimes, Wisconsin data shows.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:04.180]  Parents slam California school for holding no whites allowed kids' play date at school.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:08.180]  The left's doing this everywhere to separate people and it's weirdo white people running it.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:14.660]  And again, judges, you're saying we're going to put a fat man in your sorority club.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:20.900]  We can't define a woman. They're all waging war against us. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tweeted
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:25.460]  a very powerful tablet mag report. Everybody should read. It's very lengthy. How the US
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:30.660]  government disinformation enterprise is destroying liberal democracy. I'm not exaggerating. Read
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:36.740]  this monumental article. Yeah, it's like 30, 40 pages long. I read the whole thing dead on.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:44.420]  Meanwhile, Ireland's media minister says under the UN rules and the EU rules, the DSA,
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:49.140]  every state will designate a body when it comes to misinformation on the internet and fining,
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:54.820]  banning and arresting people. There's video of that. Fauci talks about having to go out people
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:57:03.460]  that say that masks don't work or that his shots don't work. The censorship is everywhere.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.300]  All right, we're going to go to break, start the next hour.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:16.900]  We've got a huge guest on eyewitness reporters in Laina in Maui. And this is a
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.620]  cautionary tale to everybody. Over a thousand dead children missing. They're putting up black
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:28.020]  curtains all around the town. I mean, this is a desperate cover up happening right now.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:32.420]  We're going to be talking about that coming up. We have huge Ukraine news.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.300]  Ukraine has definitely lost the war. It's not Ukraine, the globalist have.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:40.020]  That's all coming up. We've got a big second, third and fourth hour,
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.220]  most in all four hours today. Please spread the word and tell people to tune in right
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:47.780]  now to mfowars.com. When you do that, it changes the world.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:57.279]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[00:57:57.279 --> 00:58:03.120]  diet. They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:08.920]  ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:16.320]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content. Your best option

[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:56.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:10.740]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say, I don't know what's
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:15.300]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight? You better believe you got one!
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:22.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:53.940]  In 1972, The Limits to Growth was published by the Club of Rome. The book suggested
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:01:01.860]  that swift human depopulation would save the planet. In 2018, The Limits to Growth co-author
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:10.980]  Dennis Meadows explained how we need to murder billions of people. The planet can support
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:19.220]  something like a billion people, maybe 2 billion, depending on how much liberty and how much
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:26.180]  material consumption you want to have. If you want more liberty and more consumption,
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.340]  you have to have fewer people. And, conversely, you can have more people. I mean, we could
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.420]  even have 8 or 9 billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.660]  is smart. Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships. They're always stupid.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.259]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you could have a...
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.060]  We want to have freedom and we want to have a high sentence, so we're going to have a billion
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:56.740]  people. And we're now at seven, so we have to get back down. I hope that this can be slow,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:03.140]  relatively slow, and that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:09.860]  Overpopulation is a lie. With old-school sustainable farming and the end of big government,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.620]  there is enough room on this planet for several billion. And while the Earth's climate does
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:22.180]  change, most of what we are seeing is contrived. The fires breaking out all across the world
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:27.060]  are being blamed on climate change, even though hundreds of arsonists have been caught
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:33.060]  starting them. Most recently, 79 people were arrested for starting fires in Greece.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:39.940]  Direct energy weapons, or DUs, are able to start fires from above and can utilize
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:47.460]  microwave technology to burn homes from within. In 2013, the mainstream media reported
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:53.220]  that we were able to make rain and lightning. I mean, lasers, really, to change the weather?
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.860]  By firing trillion-watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons creating what are called ions,
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:03.380]  and these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:09.700]  This week in Michigan, residents reported a strange strobe-like lightning. The event was
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:14.420]  captured on weather radar, which showed a very unnatural-looking spiral.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.180]  That's some conspiracy theory shit right there.
[01:03:18.819 --> 01:03:23.460]  Making it rain has been possible for decades, and we have come a long way since then.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:30.020]  With a high-frequency active auroral research program known as HAARP, we can now create
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:36.660]  hurricanes, and we can control their direction with next-generation weather radar transmitters
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:44.100]  known as NEXRAD. By building up an electromagnetic charge and dispersing it underground as direct
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:50.580]  current VLF waves, or very low-frequency waves, the NEXRAD radar transmitters are able
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.620]  to trigger earthquakes. Earthquakes and explosives can trigger tsunamis.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:02.420]  These are the technologies that we know of, and that only leaves volcanoes and tornadoes.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:09.620]  Funded by Peter Thiel, AVE Tech Energy Corporation began work in 2012
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:16.340]  on a device to produce a 130-foot-tall tornado, and a former U.S. intelligence officer
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:21.700]  recently told State of the Nation that the U.S. has already triggered a volcano.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:27.380]  Climate change is not only a hoax, it's a depopulation program,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.260]  and our entire government is going along with it.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.100]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Ries.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:59.860]  A
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.420]  lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality coffee
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.660]  has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans,
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.819]  and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with
[01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:20.260]  us, but now we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:26.260]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated. It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:34.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:39.220]  drank. It is game-changing. All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it. I know you're
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.779]  gonna be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win. Go to infowarsstore.com

[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:59.540]  now exclusively available at infowarsstore.com. Get your coffee now.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:31.300]  It's been more than two weeks or 20 days or so since the tragic historic fires hit
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.700]  Maui, Hawaii, and Lahaina, a place I've been many, many times for well-watching and
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.980]  luau's, you name it, one of the best places in my favorite place to visit in the 50 states,
[01:06:44.819 --> 01:06:50.740]  Hawaii. And when we first saw eyewitnesses like Fish and others who I looked up in her
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.700]  town fixtures, were very credible saying that they blocked off the roads. I was blown away.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.180]  I believed him, but I had to prove it. Then the locals came forward and said, no,
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.100]  same thing happened to us. And then countless videos of people that went ahead and
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.060]  broke through the blockade that survived, thousands others didn't. But the big question is where
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:18.340]  are the children? Now Fish called it a coordinated event or choreographed destruction.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.300]  I called it administrative mass murder. We don't blame the police themselves.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.779]  They were compartmentalized and didn't know that both ends had been blocked. They didn't
[01:07:25.779 --> 01:07:30.340]  know the fire was coming in. Once they did, basically too late, they tried to let the folks
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:37.140]  through. Some got out. So for the balance of the hour, Eric West joins us. He is a
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:41.620]  well-known real estate agent and businessman in the area, very respected. He's also a citizen
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.340]  journalist and he has been showing the black tarps they're putting up around the town,
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:52.340]  the 12 mile exclusion zone. He was manhandled and thrown out yesterday. We've got
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:58.180]  that video coming up, but we know they left almost all the power on. They did turn off one
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:03.060]  system. Now Black Rock that owns it is denying it, but it's all confirmed. We see the power
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:12.340]  lines following the fires, countless videos of peoples ring doorbells. We see them not
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.580]  delivering them the water, denying it that day during the fires, during the fires,
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.860]  admitting they did it with the local water district that is headed up by Obama
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:30.580]  foundation member, who's big in Hawaii, obviously. And then we learn about the blockade and the
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:36.740]  sirens not being turned on. It's simply staggering. So I've got a lot of videos to play
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:43.860]  here and we're going to be getting to them of this citizen being thrown out of his own town
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:52.340]  yesterday in the live stream of the coverup. And the big question is who gave the orders,
[01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:59.860]  who coordinated this symphony of destruction, or as Fish called it,
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.780]  coordinated destruction? Because you can have, as Fish said, and as Eric West said,
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.820]  one thing fail. Maybe he should say it in his own words. He says it better than I.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.140]  You'd say, well, that can happen or two. Yeah, maybe. But when everything fails perfectly
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.820]  and it's the most valuable land in the United States per square inch
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:28.420]  in that little town, it's incredible. Absolutely incredible. And some of these families are
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:32.660]  completely wiped away and we're not hearing anything about them. The mainstream media is not
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:37.700]  asking where the children. So joining us is Eric West of Hawaii real estate.org,
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:44.580]  Maui LFG.org. And I'm told by locals, he's doing a great job actually getting aid to them.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:51.460]  We have FEMA getting $1,000 a night rooms at the Four Seasons owned by Bill Gates.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.580]  Hawaii is very expensive because the billionaires that have all moved there, over a hundred of them.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:05.140]  And the cheapest hotels, $200, $300 a night, $700 one-time payment for whole families when
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.980]  almost 200 billion has been shipped to Ukraine. This is a sick joke, but it's really captured
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:14.980]  the soul of America and the world. And people are really having a big wake up here. Biden
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.940]  refused in four different events for the first couple of weeks to even talk about it. Then he
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:26.500]  did show up. So to talk about the waterfront and what really happened is Eric West
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:33.059]  and we'll go through these videos. If you want to announce which one you want, we'll play them.
[01:10:33.059 --> 01:10:36.660]  We're getting the clip right now of them handling you. We just learned about that.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.780]  They've done it to other reporters. We've seen the footage. But first, here's a short
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.780]  two and a half minute compilation from a 30 something minute interview we did with Fish
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:48.820]  a couple other days ago. And again, Fish is somebody who's not from there. I call him a
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.980]  local, but he's a fixture. They all love him. And he's very respected. And he told us what
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:58.900]  he saw. He was the first voice that got out, barely survived. But now we have the videos.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.100]  It's all confirmed. They admit they left the power on. They admit they didn't give them
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.500]  the water. They admit they didn't trim the trees and brush. They admit they didn't
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:13.300]  activate the sirens. They admit they blockaded them inside. But here is what Fish said a few
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:18.820]  days ago with Eric West. The only people survived were the ones that went through the
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:27.059]  barricade. It was a choreographed disaster. The pattern of it is just too obvious.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.900]  Not only were they blocking where I was at, the other end of town I find out they had
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.620]  Maui Electric was trying to set the poles up during the wind and they had the highway
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:44.660]  blocked off with that. The lack of communication, the sirens not going off, the water not being
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:52.500]  used. I mean, you could go on and on. And then they're lying to us about the people
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.820]  and the children. That's what a lot of people have been calling them. What happened to the
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:02.980]  kids? All you have to do is extrapolate. There's 3,001 students in Lahaina. A thousand
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:07.940]  of them have been accounted for. They're going to either alternative schools or online.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:14.420]  That's 2,000 children not accounted for. And I looked over at the policeman and I said,
[01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:21.460]  what are you doing? And he says, I'm just following orders. I said, there's a fire back
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:28.820]  there. And he goes, I'm just following orders. And I'm wondering, what is going on?
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:35.059]  Well, it's something probably anyone who's been on the internet for 30 years like I have knows
[01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:39.059]  that BlackRock and Vanguard are the owners of the Hawaiian Electric Company
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:44.100]  where FEMA is staying at their $1,000 plus rooms. It's owned by Bill Gates.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:52.260]  All the same names keep popping up. The sheriff who was involved with the Las Vegas
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:58.980]  duplicate, he was here for five weeks. He wants a 29% increase in pay. And he's not only
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:03.460]  the police chief, but he's the coroner. Which is against the statute, right?
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.620]  It's against the statute of the Hawaiian law. But there it is. What are you going to do
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.860]  about it? So he's in charge as a coroner. Well, it's the same as Hunter Thompson,
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.580]  who wrote a book on George Bush. And he was very excited about getting it published
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:22.340]  two days before it was getting published. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:27.540]  head twice. The coroner put it out as a suicide. So.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.180]  And the same video, we'll play clips coming up. He witnessed him block the road out and
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.540]  after they directed people into the town, the road out the other direction.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:42.420]  So who gave the orders? Eric West, thank you for joining us today.
[01:13:43.059 --> 01:13:46.020]  I'm going to try to give you the floor till we go to break in about 15 minutes
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.740]  to talk about what you witnessed, what you've seen, the bizarreness of this,
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.580]  the ongoing obvious cover up, how the people are responding.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.580]  I've seen the different council meetings. The Hawaiians are usually pretty calm and nice.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.740]  They're hopping mad. Both the people that are indigenous, but also folks that have
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.700]  now call Hawaii home. So you're right in the middle of it.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:09.780]  You've got a lot of courage to be going up against the system. Give us your breakdown.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.780]  First of all, thanks, Alex, for having me on the show. I appreciate it. I've been following
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:20.260]  you for years and I just want to just give you a shout out for what you've done as a patriot
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.820]  and for leading the charge in this thing and everything that they say was a conspiracy
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:31.059]  as always seems to come true. And I want to get in front of this thing. So we'll talk about
[01:14:31.059 --> 01:14:36.660]  what's happened, but I really want to encourage your listeners to let's get into action here.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:41.300]  Let's make this a call to action, not just to fellow patriots, but to the world,
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:46.260]  because I believe this is the beginning of something really bad or it could be the
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:51.220]  beginning of something really amazing in terms of an awakening. And this is now on the world
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.540]  stage and this needs to be played out in the world court, if you will, because there's
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:59.380]  people that died here that were from all different countries. And as you know,
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:04.580]  a lot of things become an issue as jurisdiction. And I don't believe this is no longer in the
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:09.380]  jurisdiction of Hawaii. I believe this is not even in the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.820]  I believe this is in the jurisdiction of the world and the world needs to pay attention and
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:18.020]  needs to wake up, but I'll walk you through what's happened so far. And I could go through
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:23.700]  the colossal list of items that have gone wrong. You live there, you didn't break it down.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:30.820]  Okay. The colossal list of everything that went wrong simultaneously, and I'm not here to point
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:35.700]  the finger at who or what. I'm just going to show you what we are seeing and what we've seen.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.780]  But let's begin with the first thing, which is the total utter lack of communication that
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:46.580]  we've had on the west side of Maui. I'm here just north of the burn zone, north of
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:52.580]  Lahaina, very close. The fire came within a mile or two of my home. We've been evacuated
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:59.220]  three times. We've had fields set fire around my home. Just the other day, I went live with a fire
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:06.740]  that broke out just a few yards from my house spontaneously in the middle of the day. On that
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:12.660]  particular day, the alarms went off, Chinook helicopters came in. We got text messages. So
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:18.900]  it's almost like, see, they're trying to show that they're competent now. But back when the
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:24.180]  big fire broke out and there was multiple fires, it wasn't just a fire in Kula that broke out,
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.180]  but also a fire in Lahaina. But there was multiple different places where this thing
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.220]  broke out. On that particular day, everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. For
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:40.580]  example, there was no sirens. Hawaii has the most sophisticated siren system. It did not go
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:46.740]  off. And they tried to spin it by saying that we're trained as the people here to run uphill
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:52.500]  because it's a tsunami warning, but their own website says it's not. It's for emergencies.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:56.260]  And when the alarm goes off, you're supposed to tune in to find out what the danger is and act
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:00.260]  accordingly. But to this day, they haven't retracted their statement that's saying it's
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:06.820]  for tsunamis only. Even if it was, people would not run uphill into a fire. So the sirens
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.860]  did not go off. The text messages, we received text messages all the time for emergencies.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:17.540]  Those text messages also were not sent out. And we were able to receive text messages
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:23.860]  throughout this entire breakdown of communication. Text messages always worked. We could never
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:29.700]  respond to them, but the text messages didn't go out. There was water was not provided in
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:34.420]  the area of the fire. I have eyewitness accounts of people that came home that morning and they
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:39.460]  couldn't take a shower or they couldn't turn on their washer at home because there was no
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.340]  water. So the firemen had no water to fight this fire. And then they tried to say it was
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:49.780]  because of some kind of water rights issue, which is ridiculous because the water works or
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:53.780]  the water doesn't work. So why was the water turned off? That day at four thirty in the
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:18:00.580]  morning, there was no power. Power was turned off on the entire west side of Maui. So later
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.820]  on in the day, you'll find out they were trying to redirect cars around downed power lines
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.059]  as if the downed power lines were dangerous because of electricity. But there's no electricity
[01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:13.139]  running through those downed power lines. So they could have quickly, you know, move those
[01:18:13.139 --> 01:18:18.260]  poles or saw them or done something. But instead, you saw people getting corralled
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:24.100]  literally into the town of Lahaina in the direct path of the fire. And that that that
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.660]  is irrefutable. I have many, many accounts. I don't mean to interrupt you, but you're the
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:32.260]  expert, but I'm going to follow this very closely. Some of the main power lines out on
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:37.700]  the highway were turned off. But the particular power lines in the town, we've seen the footage
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.139]  and they've admitted even The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post that indeed
[01:18:41.139 --> 01:18:45.700]  they left those on. We've seen those falling down and starting fires. So can you explain that
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:51.780]  to us? Well, I can only go from what I've heard personally and talking to people is that
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:56.820]  the power was was lost at four thirty the morning of the fire, four thirty a.m.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.700]  by other people that have reported that there were certain there's I guess there's websites
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.300]  where you can see where there was pulsing. There was different pulsing through the
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:10.180]  electrical system, but we did not have any power. You know, silver lining and all this is
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:14.180]  because there was no power. There was no the restaurants were closed that morning. The
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.740]  shops were closed that morning because no one could obviously transact business. So,
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:24.020]  you know, in a sense, that was a godsend because the line of town wasn't full of all
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.020]  the normal hustle and bustle because there was no power that morning. There was definitely
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:32.660]  no cell communication. You could not call anybody. You could not get on the Internet that
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:38.660]  morning. It was a complete communications blackout. And then on top of it, you have
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:44.340]  absolutely no support on the ground from people going door to door, knocking or bull horns.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:50.980]  The people were warned by word of mouth. The only warning that they had with this blowtorch
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:56.980]  coming at them was word of mouth warning. Also, I noticed at ten thirty in the morning, a
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:04.020]  massive black cloud of smoke that looked like the like the nine eleven towers. And so there was a
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.820]  small brush fire that occurred that morning and a message went out for that saying one
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:14.500]  hundred percent contained. So they actually put everybody at rest saying that the fire was
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:19.059]  contained that morning. So there was even misinformation happening, trying to make people
[01:20:19.059 --> 01:20:23.780]  feel like they were safe when in fact they weren't. But the fact that people were guided
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:27.780]  into the fire and then got trapped and were going in circles in the small little
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.500]  behind the town, it's incomprehensible.
[01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:37.890]  All right, I want to keep making your points, but let's walk through this.
[01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:44.390]  The government is now saying only some of the power was turned off, that it wasn't turned
[01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:45.390]  off.
[01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:47.950]  I'm not wedded to the idea that power lines did it, even though we have footage of power
[01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:52.590]  lines falling and causing fires and transformers blowing up.
[01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:56.390]  But clearly, something massive burned that town down.
[01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:58.550]  I'm not pooh-poohed directed energy weapons.
[01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.550]  I know they're real.
[01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.270]  One of the biggest bases of them is based in Maui.
[01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:05.350]  They could have drones go up and do it, and no humans could be involved, other than those
[01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:07.390]  that launched the attack.
[01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:14.290]  But regardless, for folks that don't know, we'll pull up a map of Lahaina.
[01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:20.870]  There in Maui, they're in what Western Maui described the roads coming in for people,
[01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:27.070]  and what has now been confirmed, that police blocked both sides of the main road, I guess
[01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:30.510]  that's Front Street, coming through the town from the west and the east.
[01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:32.030]  Is that accurate?
[01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:37.110]  Yeah, so if you look at a map, you'll see that there's basically two different highways.
[01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:41.870]  You have the bypass that comes down and dumps into the north, what about the middle
[01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:44.030]  part of Lahaina?
[01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.230]  That's called the bypass.
[01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:49.190]  They just opened that four or five years ago, and then you have the old highway, which
[01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:52.990]  is the Honopilani Highway, and then on the other side of that, to the west of that,
[01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:56.710]  you have basically the town of Lahaina.
[01:21:56.710 --> 01:22:00.390]  And you've got a number of side streets, but then you have Front Street, the world famous
[01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:04.550]  Front Street, that's sort of like the PCH, it runs right up the coast.
[01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:11.030]  So ultimately, as people were trying to get through town, go around town, they tried
[01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:15.590]  to go up the bypass, they're trying to leave town, they got turned around, the bypass
[01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:19.970]  was closed, so if you were leaving town, you just got turned right back around.
[01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:25.810]  If you tried to go south on the highway, you got turned, everyone got routed into the
[01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:31.290]  town of Lahaina, and once you got into Lahaina proper, if you tried to leave to the north
[01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:36.250]  or to the south, or any of the side streets, Ed Chaney, many different witnesses said
[01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:40.170]  that there's two police cars that would block that.
[01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:43.270]  The owners of Island Lock and Safe, they were just in my home the other day, they
[01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:48.930]  also basically testified to like everywhere you tried to leave, you just kept getting
[01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:54.130]  routed back into it under the guise of downed power lines, however, looking at some
[01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:57.690]  of this footage, you can see there was a clear path to the north, there was a clear
[01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:02.650]  path to the south, and on top of it, the cars that were coming into Lahaina,
[01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:07.210]  they didn't block the traffic like a mile or two away, preventing this, they had
[01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:12.130]  a small blockade, and they were allowing this traffic to come into Lahaina, because
[01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.770]  people were trying to get to their kids, they were trying to get to their houses,
[01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:19.250]  they're concerned, they were allowing essentially a traffic jam very close to
[01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:22.530]  the north end of Lahaina, and then on top of it, the people that were coming
[01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:26.130]  down to the south, they were getting routed into a neighborhood called
[01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:31.010]  Waihtuli, that later on burned, but they weren't turning people around to go
[01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:35.170]  back to the north, they were putting them into another neighborhood that was
[01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:39.250]  getting ready to burn, so the traffic control during this disaster is
[01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:44.410]  incomprehensible, that there could be that level of incompetence, basically
[01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:47.930]  directing people into the path of something extremely dangerous, extremely
[01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:55.450]  hot burning, and just a force of nature that we've never seen before.
[01:23:53.690 --> 01:24:03.690]  Now, we've still got about six or five minutes to break. Let's talk about something you just mentioned a few minutes ago.
[01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:12.690]  You live there on the edge of town, and where you're staying, you're staying suddenly fires out of nowhere.
[01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:18.690]  There's no power lines, there's no people right around your house, and obviously you're a very outspoken person.
[01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:26.690]  We have weird leftists showing up harassing reporters that are on The War Room with Steve Bannon.
[01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:33.690]  Other reporters are having weird anti-fatah dudes, and blacks show up. They know where they are, and they threaten them to stop covering it.
[01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:36.690]  We're going to show footage when we come back of you getting manhandled.
[01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:44.690]  There's a 12-mile exclusion zone. They're putting up big black divider fences up all around the town.
[01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:50.690]  They don't want people on record, even mainstream media, showing the damage, so something's being covered up here.
[01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:58.690]  You're there showing cars that are 100 yards from anything, even a fire, that are burned up, and that does lean towards directed energy or something.
[01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:02.690]  I can't deny it, and so maybe it's a mix of these things.
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:09.690]  But you talked about arson. Here it is, BBC, Greece wildfires, 79 people arrested for arson.
[01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:16.690]  There's high winds, it's dry. They went and caught 79 people setting fires.
[01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:20.690]  And we know environmentalists just don't block roads like Extinction Rebellion.
[01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:27.690]  They don't just cut off our pipelines. They don't just put these big derailers on trains. They've been caught everywhere.
[01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:34.690]  When they get caught, like right during the election in 2000, they caught hundreds of arsonists setting fires on the West Coast.
[01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:47.690]  And the same thing, the utilities owned by BlackRock again, on average, 98% of your utilities, or 96%, they won't trim back the trees now, but only in select areas, knowing it's going to happen.
[01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:57.690]  So here's footage of Greece, and people having to evacuate to the water, and the police have caught 79 people doing it.
[01:25:57.690 --> 01:26:05.690]  And they say in the Greece news, they say it's environmental groups doing it.
[01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:19.690]  So this is disgusting. So can you give us your view on that, and specifically go back and elaborate, we'll go to break and talk more about it, but on where you live, you've got a couple places, you're blocked out of your house right now, you're somewhere else.
[01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:26.690]  And now folks know where you are, and magically fires are popping up right around you. I mean, let's walk through that.
[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:38.690]  Yeah, it's a real mystery. Matter of fact, the most recent fire that broke out just a couple days ago, I live in an area called Kaanapali, which is right above the hotels where they're housing all the survivors.
[01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:46.690]  And ironically, FEMA and all the other agents are down in Wailea, which is a long way from here, like 45 minute drive minimum.
[01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:54.690]  So why there's a separation between the Federal Health and the Red Cross is very strange, but to answer your question, Alex, these fires have just been popping up.
[01:26:54.690 --> 01:27:06.690]  And I've got video of the one that I just shot live the other day, where the area where the fire probably started, they immediately had a D8 out there, pushing dirt over where the fire started.
[01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:12.690]  And I thought to myself, why isn't there an investigation to see what started this particular fire?
[01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:21.690]  So, yeah, it just seems very unusual how these fires started. But I think the question I want to ask the world is, what are we going to do about this, right?
[01:27:21.690 --> 01:27:25.690]  What are we going to do? We can talk about what happened and how it happened and all that stuff.
[01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:30.690]  But what are we going to do about our rights that are being violated right now? We're not allowed to take pictures.
[01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:37.690]  We're not allowed to fly drones. We're not allowed to see what's going on and or collect evidence to see if there was any kind of an accelerant.
[01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:45.690]  What is America going to do right now to stop the cover up? Because if we don't stop this one, it's going to be in your backyard next.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:51.690]  So what can we do now to find out what they've done and to stop the course of action?
[01:27:51.690 --> 01:27:57.690]  Whatever their plan is, we need we need patriots to step up. This isn't entertainment. This is a call to action to the world.
[01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:04.690]  You know, I watched you a lot in the last few weeks, but in the last few days, you did two different videos with fish.
[01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:07.690]  I forget which one it is. We've got both of them on the computer. We can play them.
[01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:12.690]  I don't know if it was you or fish. You both agreed. They said, listen, this is a model of how to burn people out everywhere.
[01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:17.690]  Well, actually, I've already been tracking that California is where they first started this decades ago,
[01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:24.690]  where areas they want to move poor people out there in wealthy areas that are about to grow to.
[01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:29.690]  They don't trim the trees. They don't trim the brush. And then it's able to burn them out.
[01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:34.690]  But they do in the wealthy areas. And so we see a repeat of the perfect conditions.
[01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:39.690]  And then that's exactly what's going on here. The left is using arson.
[01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:44.690]  It's confirmed. It's all part of their takeover on a scale of one to ten.
[01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:50.690]  Then blocking traffic's one. Then burning your house down to nine. You know, cut your pipelines off as five.
[01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:55.690]  This is a war against our industrial civilization. We need to recognize and understand it.
[01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:13.690]  But when the folks have been a man came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:19.690]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:25.690]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted. It smells amazing. And it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:31.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available at info works for dot com.
[01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:36.690]  Exclusively escape the prison planet. Light roast tastes great.
[01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:41.690]  It's the strong one. Really strong. But these are all close second and third medium roast.
[01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:47.690]  Wake of America. Whoa. That's what my go to dark roast tip of the spear tastes the best and is amazing.
[01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:52.690]  And it's still very, very strong. Gives you that path. They're all three available at info works for dot com.
[01:29:52.690 --> 01:29:58.690]  And they fund our operation. And each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen rulebook.
[01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:03.690]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength.
[01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:08.690]  And they can only be obtained through diet. They can be found in grass fed beef,
[01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:13.690]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it. And they can be found in fish,
[01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:18.690]  which are arguably the best source of Omega threes.
[01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:23.690]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:30.690]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at info or store dot com.
[01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:35.690]  Omega three fatty acids are essential for both our neurological
[01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:39.690]  and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:44.690]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.
[01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:49.690]  Get your essential omega three fatty acids from the best sources available.
[01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:57.690]  Ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil. Get some today at info or store dot com.

[01:32:26.690 --> 01:32:28.690]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:30.690]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:33.690]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:35.690]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:36.690]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:39.690]  But in this major recession going into depression
[01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:41.690]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:42.690]  I know times are tough.
[01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.690]  So thank you for your support.
[01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:47.690]  Whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos
[01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:49.690]  that you can do for free.
[01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:51.690]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:53.690]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:54.690]  please support us now.
[01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:56.690]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:57.690]  God bless you.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:07.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:24.910]  The voice the globalists want silenced.
[01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:29.950]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:32.830]  All the mainstream corporate media lies to you about what's happening now.
[01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:37.750]  We tell you the truth about what's coming next.
[01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:44.270]  And our guest is Eric West, the citizen journalist and a very successful businessman and realtor
[01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:52.390]  there in Hawaii, there in Maui, and he lives in Lahaina and is now witnessing what is unfolding
[01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:53.390]  there.
[01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:57.710]  We've got so many clips here, but man, the way they're acting suspicious, the way they're
[01:33:57.710 --> 01:34:01.870]  putting up won't give people aid or trying to keep aid out, people to bring aid by
[01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:08.270]  boats, $700 a family while the FEMA staying in thousand a night plus hotel rooms, but
[01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:12.350]  they've got money to put up black curtains around the town.
[01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:14.910]  This looks to me like a giant cover up.
[01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:18.570]  We have you being thrown out yesterday from your own town.
[01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:23.770]  We have footage of the melted cars with grass all around it, not even burned.
[01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:29.910]  We have all of this insane footage and then we have them arresting arsonists all over
[01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:35.910]  the world that are environmentalists doing this, but corporate media covering it up.
[01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:42.190]  I wish people would behave more like the tribal police at Burning Man than these
[01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:43.190]  police.
[01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:47.710]  So I think the best thing to play is Eric West who joins us.
[01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:53.150]  Eric, set this footage up we're about to play where they're trying to stop you
[01:34:53.150 --> 01:34:55.510]  from shooting any footage.
[01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:56.510]  Sure.
[01:34:57.110 --> 01:35:03.070]  So basically this is an area that's about two miles from the burn, so quite a ways.
[01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:08.250]  There was a small brush fire around this area and they have set a perimeter up around
[01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:12.590]  the burner of these tight block, New Zealand tight lock style fences, super high with
[01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:16.930]  black dust fence you can't see in, but now they have these sheriff that come up
[01:35:16.930 --> 01:35:17.930]  to you.
[01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:20.970]  If you just pull over on the side of the road for even just a few seconds and they
[01:35:20.970 --> 01:35:23.870]  come up and they tell you, Hey, you can't park here.
[01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:24.870]  You got to leave.
[01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:26.230]  No photographs, no images.
[01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:29.710]  FEMA even announced they're not going to allow any photographs or images from the
[01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:34.230]  area in respect for the dead, which, you know, everyone's been basically pulverized
[01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:35.230]  to doubt.
[01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:38.430]  I would imagine the dead, I would imagine the dead want the responsible punished.
[01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:40.310]  How dare them use the dead?
[01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:42.190]  How dare them speak for the dead?
[01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:43.690]  It's crazy.
[01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:48.350]  And the fact that the media, I've had many media outlets, Epoch news, mainstream media,
[01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:53.710]  even, you know, KITV here telling me that their media passes, they have to sneak
[01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:54.710]  in.
[01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.630]  The media is not being allowed into areas of this burn.
[01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:03.190]  Even at the very inception, people went back home with their media passes tucked between
[01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:06.750]  their legs because they couldn't get in to where they wanted to go.
[01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:11.350]  Everybody needs to land by boat and just overwhelm the quote authorities that are the
[01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:15.050]  people that are covering this up because they're the very police who worked for the
[01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:19.470]  system that blocked people in the town telling you, you can't go in massive conflict
[01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:20.470]  of interest.
[01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:21.470]  Agreed.
[01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:22.470]  Agreed.
[01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:27.070]  I just received this text when I just, during the commercial break there, and I'm just
[01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:28.070]  going to put it out there.
[01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:29.470]  I don't believe there's any accidents, right?
[01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:30.470]  I just don't believe in that.
[01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:35.510]  I believe everything is being orchestrated by forces of good as well to help us in
[01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:36.510]  this.
[01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:37.510]  But I just received a text message.
[01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:40.350]  And again, I'm just going to throw this out there, Alex, but someone just sent me
[01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:41.350]  some information.
[01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:47.510]  I'm not going to say the person's name, but he's very, very well known individual
[01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:53.870]  saying that this has something to potentially do with Space Force and is possibly an attack.
[01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:56.590]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:36:56.590 --> 01:37:04.330]  But I saw, well, we know that part of Space Force is based in mainly in Kauai, but also
[01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:05.330]  in Maui.
[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:09.590]  That's kind of a big secret that Hawaiian islands are a big giant base.
[01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:10.590]  Correct.
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:11.590]  Correct.
[01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:14.350]  And I'm not going to say it publicly on your show, but later on, I'll share with
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:17.350]  this person just texted me, but that's pretty significant development.
[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:22.270]  The first time I've heard of that concept, but he said that there will probably be military
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:27.310]  interaction or intervention at this point in time, because this could be an attack
[01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:28.310]  from somebody.
[01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.310]  I don't know who.
[01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:32.310]  Well, I mean, I haven't tried to poopoo direction energy weapons.
[01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:37.030]  I know they're real, but the footage you're showing of the trees and grass all fine and
[01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:41.670]  cars fried and that they don't want you to show that.
[01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:46.670]  That is, and we know the Chinese, admittedly, a few months ago, scanned the islands with
[01:37:46.710 --> 01:37:49.510]  a topography laser that was on the local news.
[01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:50.510]  This is pretty suspicious.
[01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:53.390]  It is very, very suspicious.
[01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:59.490]  And I think we we need to ask the government to allow for just normal media coverage
[01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:04.450]  of this, because I think the blackout of information is not is not helpful for people
[01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:06.390]  that want to know the truth of what's going on.
[01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:09.790]  So we've got to figure out who the enemy is so we can find out what their truest
[01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:11.710]  intent is that we can fight this.
[01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:12.710]  We can fight this war.
[01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:16.630]  My job is to bring you the information, because I'm one of the few guys with a star
[01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:20.190]  link and a little bit of a YouTube channel, and I'm going to show you what we're seeing
[01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:23.990]  so that you can judge what it is for yourself.
[01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:27.110]  We've asked Elon Musk weeks ago, he says he's trying to, quote, help.
[01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:29.430]  He could deliver 50 star links right now.
[01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:33.990]  He could show up, be a hero and set up a media operation there.
[01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.990]  I totally agree.
[01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.990]  I totally agree.
[01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:40.150]  I want to coordinate because are they are they still trying to blockade of the locals
[01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:43.590]  trying to bring in food and water?
[01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.590]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:49.870]  I think you can now come over from the other side and all the donations have been from
[01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:53.330]  local private groups bringing in food.
[01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:57.390]  But there's a major lack of support from FEMA and Red Cross in the normal ways.
[01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:01.230]  I know that they're paying for these hotel rooms, supposedly, but you're not seeing a
[01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:04.430]  presence from them in any significant way.
[01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:08.670]  And that's every survivor I talk to, I ask them, you know, who has been helping you?
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:12.990]  As if aid workers don't want to go to one of the most beautiful places in the world.
[01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.990]  And it's the top.
[01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.990]  Yeah, there's a cover up.
[01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:16.690]  The system doesn't want people in there.
[01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:18.750]  They're putting up black tarps around it.
[01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:22.350]  Let's go ahead and roll a few minutes of them trying to keep you from outside the
[01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:25.590]  town showing bizarrely barbecued cars.
[01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:26.990]  Yeah, we're out of here.
[01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.990]  We're out of here.
[01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.990]  OK.
[01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:31.990]  We're on our way out, sir.
[01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.990]  How's it?
[01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.990]  We're not online.
[01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.990]  No videos or no picture taken.
[01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.990]  Yeah.
[01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.990]  OK.
[01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.990]  Thanks for your service, by the way.
[01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:39.310]  OK.
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:40.310]  We're good.
[01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:41.310]  We leave right now.
[01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.310]  We parked over there.
[01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:43.310]  We were told we couldn't park down here.
[01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.310]  Yeah.
[01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:45.310]  This whole area.
[01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:46.310]  Even down there, there's no parking.
[01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:47.310]  So no media or nothing.
[01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:48.310]  Yeah.
[01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:49.310]  You ever see anything like this before?
[01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:50.310]  Not this bad.
[01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:51.310]  Yeah.
[01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:52.310]  I just opened the hood.
[01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:53.310]  You want to see under the seat?
[01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:54.310]  I mean, it's.
[01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:57.710]  So the question we're just asking is like, how could this hard car get this hot with
[01:39:57.710 --> 01:39:58.710]  grass?
[01:39:58.710 --> 01:39:59.710]  A little grass fire.
[01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:00.710]  It didn't jump.
[01:40:00.710 --> 01:40:01.710]  It didn't jump.
[01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.710]  That grass is good.
[01:40:02.710 --> 01:40:03.710]  There's even a bunch of grass down there.
[01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:04.710]  That's good.
[01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:05.710]  Look under the hood.
[01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:06.710]  How could you melt?
[01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:09.850]  This is like Star Wars kind of stuff right here.
[01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:10.850]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:11.850]  It's.
[01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:12.850]  Like this.
[01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:17.250]  But what's strange is, you know, like the windshield, the windshield melted over
[01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:18.250]  the shifting.
[01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:19.250]  Yeah.
[01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:20.250]  The linkage.
[01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:26.730]  I mean, it it was like, well, twelve hundred and twenty for aluminum, but in the back
[01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:27.730]  you can see it liquefied.
[01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.010]  So that's about fifteen hundred.
[01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:32.450]  How could that thing get hot enough from a little bit of grass?
[01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:36.210]  How could that get so hot on a little bit of grass it didn't even burn the grass
[01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:37.210]  down there?
[01:40:37.210 --> 01:40:41.530]  I mean, you can take it logically without knowing any science, look at kind of scratch
[01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.650]  your head and go fires.
[01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:47.190]  How could that melt aluminum and tires and steel braided brake lines when there's
[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:48.950]  nothing in your car?
[01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:52.150]  If you could just guess sitting here on the side of this road, I wasn't here.
[01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:53.150]  I don't know.
[01:40:53.150 --> 01:40:54.150]  We don't have to be here.
[01:40:54.150 --> 01:40:55.150]  Just look.
[01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:56.470]  You know, the thing is, I'm from even if you torch a car, I don't think you can
[01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:57.470]  melt aluminum.
[01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:01.670]  OK, but OK, so for the fire was if I said, I'll give you ten, ten grand to burn
[01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:02.670]  a car like that.
[01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:03.670]  What did you need?
[01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:07.570]  I wouldn't even take the money.
[01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:09.730]  That's that's you going Joe and me going Joe.
[01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:10.730]  No, no.
[01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:11.730]  But I'll say it.
[01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:13.890]  Say it's at a tow yard where it's a scrap car.
[01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:18.090]  Not somebody's car, but, you know, like, you know, the what's that show where
[01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:19.610]  they do?
[01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:20.610]  What's that show where they?
[01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:21.610]  That's in the.
[01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:24.290]  We're like, they do the experiments.
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:27.050]  That's called where they they test everything.
[01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:31.530]  It's the red hair guy, the red roof house, that thing's getting famous.
[01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:32.530]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:41:32.530 --> 01:41:36.710]  Where they like they reenact everything to prove it wrong or prove it right.
[01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:37.710]  Blue umbrellas.
[01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:39.270]  No, no, it's like almost like a comedy show.
[01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:40.270]  It's a red headed guy.
[01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:43.270]  I mean, I don't want to carry my gun crazy, but I feel like this is like.
[01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:44.270]  Well, that's what I meant.
[01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:45.270]  It's like the attack.
[01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:46.270]  That's the way I look at stuff.
[01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:47.990]  It doesn't make any logical sense.
[01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:52.550]  I've got scientists telling me like this breaks science as we know it.
[01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:55.190]  And this one to me, it's two guys that do the show.
[01:41:55.190 --> 01:41:56.190]  There's nothing around.
[01:41:56.190 --> 01:42:01.230]  I mean, they do like dark guns and they do it's like one house and they show like clips
[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:02.230]  on Hollywood.
[01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:04.770]  And then they prove it that it's like bullshit.
[01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:05.770]  Oh, the Mythbusters.
[01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:06.770]  Yeah, Mythbusters.
[01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:07.770]  We're going to get out of here.
[01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:08.770]  We respect you guys.
[01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:09.770]  Thank you for doing your job.
[01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:10.770]  Oh, you guys are going out?
[01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:13.770]  We love the sheriff because you guys are sworn to protect the constitution.
[01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:14.770]  So thank you.
[01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:15.770]  We're right back and forth.
[01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:16.770]  Okay.
[01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:17.770]  Okay.
[01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:18.770]  Thank you for your service, bro.
[01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:19.770]  Thank you guys.
[01:42:19.770 --> 01:42:20.770]  Thank you a lot.
[01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:21.770]  Thank you.
[01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:22.770]  All right.
[01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:23.770]  Thanks, Phillip.
[01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:24.770]  Oh yeah, that's enough.
[01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:25.770]  So they're being very diplomatic with the police, but give me a break.
[01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:26.770]  They just blocked up both sides of the road.
[01:42:26.770 --> 01:42:27.770]  This whole thing went down.
[01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:30.850]  You're miles outside town and oh, you're not allowed to show pictures.
[01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:34.550]  It's when in America, miles away from a giant crime scene where they're putting up
[01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:38.050]  black walls around it.
[01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:40.070]  I mean, this is not America.
[01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:41.070]  This is disgusting.
[01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:44.070]  I want to know who gave the orders to block the town.
[01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:46.590]  I want to know who gave the orders to leave the power on, who wouldn't let them
[01:42:46.590 --> 01:42:47.590]  have the water.
[01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:48.590]  Well, they already admitted it.
[01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:49.590]  Who didn't turn the sirens on?
[01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:51.990]  Well, the mayor admits it, the emergency manager.
[01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.990]  And then I'm sorry.
[01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:56.330]  We can be nice to police so far and I know you got to be there.
[01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:57.890]  You got to deal with them.
[01:42:57.890 --> 01:43:02.270]  But man, I got to tell you, Eric West, this is disgusting.
[01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:03.270]  It really is.
[01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:08.490]  And also we have the chief of police who is also the guy from the Vegas shooting.
[01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:11.150]  Also I think he went to the FBI Academy.
[01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:15.390]  Why is he allowed to be the coroner when that is against the rules, essentially?
[01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:16.390]  Not essentially.
[01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:22.070]  They passed the law, as you know, that you can't do that just last year.
[01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.470]  Exactly.
[01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:27.550]  Why is it that the emergency management director was off island when this happened?
[01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:30.410]  Who was his deputy and why haven't we heard from his deputy?
[01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:34.610]  My brother-in-law was the emergency management director for Douglas County for 20 years.
[01:43:34.610 --> 01:43:35.610]  He just retired.
[01:43:35.610 --> 01:43:38.170]  He goes, there's got to be a deputy that's in charge.
[01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:40.150]  Why are we not hearing from those individuals?
[01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:46.890]  Why is it that the mayor gave a press conference on Zoom at six thirty while half the town
[01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:50.610]  had already burned and he thinks everything is fine?
[01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:54.410]  Why would the mayor, how would he not know about the fire happening?
[01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:56.050]  They had that Zoom recorded.
[01:43:56.050 --> 01:43:57.210]  You can go watch it yourself.
[01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:59.350]  Well, that's my next point.
[01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:04.230]  They manhandle reporters, including yourself and others, at these press conferences where
[01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:05.230]  you say, where are the children?
[01:44:05.230 --> 01:44:06.230]  And they go, nah!
[01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:07.230]  I didn't grab you.
[01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:09.910]  I mean, they're acting beyond suspicious.
[01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.110]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:13.550]  And what did happen to the children?
[01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:14.630]  That's a very good question.
[01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:16.870]  So we have a crime against humanity here.
[01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:19.510]  And my question is, what's the world going to do about it?
[01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:26.470]  And if we don't start mobilizing as a people and sharing this information with the world,
[01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:29.890]  because mainstream media is not reporting the truth and it's important for everyone
[01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:34.850]  that's listening to the show to go and start sharing what information we are presenting
[01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:39.010]  so that we can bring awareness to this thing, so it can be tried in the world court
[01:44:39.010 --> 01:44:43.370]  essentially, because that's what it's going to take to move the needle.
[01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:44.370]  Absolutely.
[01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:46.290]  I love Laina.
[01:44:46.290 --> 01:44:47.490]  I love Mallie.
[01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:50.250]  I want to come there, but it could become a circus.
[01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:55.450]  Obviously, me trying to blend in and just get footage would be pretty obvious.
[01:44:55.450 --> 01:45:04.110]  And at the same time, we need more reporters, more journalists to go there and to infiltrate
[01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:06.790]  and to show where the power lines went down and to show.
[01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:10.550]  But as you mentioned, these fires that popped up around your house the last few days because
[01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:13.710]  you're not playing ball and that we're in Antifa that are showing up to threaten
[01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:17.830]  other reporters that will be in the middle of the woods and they have like geolocation
[01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:21.070]  like Antifa guys in black show up and start going, what are you doing here?
[01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:22.070]  Get out of here.
[01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:24.390]  I mean, I know the cut of their jib.
[01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:30.450]  I know when I see them, they're there that are catching Antifa types all over the world,
[01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:34.370]  setting fires from Canada to Greece, from California.
[01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:36.850]  They caught a few earlier this year.
[01:45:36.850 --> 01:45:38.670]  They're in Maui catching fires.
[01:45:38.670 --> 01:45:39.750]  This is what they do.
[01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.810]  They hate civilization.
[01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:42.490]  They hate the system.
[01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:44.550]  The Black Rocks, the world are also at war with it.
[01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:45.690]  They're funding them.
[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:50.330]  And I just don't think that there's any denial about what's going here as a citizen.
[01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:55.750]  Not giving your facts, but gut level, what are you and the local saying?
[01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:59.190]  Because I already know what you're saying, when I hear it from you because I've watched
[01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:03.470]  the different meetings, the emergency management meetings, the city council meetings,
[01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:04.710]  the county meetings.
[01:46:04.710 --> 01:46:07.030]  I mean, I was like, well, is it just one lady mad?
[01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:10.110]  I went and watched a few days ago, like two hours of it.
[01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:13.270]  Every person was in their face seeing through this.
[01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:18.390]  So whatever they thought they were going to get away with here and whoever ran this,
[01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:22.050]  their coverups only creating a tug of war here.
[01:46:22.050 --> 01:46:23.250]  And I think they've jumped the shark.
[01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:28.530]  So what do you, just as a citizen, as a human, as a resident of that area,
[01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:31.170]  as a citizen of Lahaina, what do you think happened?
[01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:34.010]  I don't know.
[01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.450]  I don't know what happened, but here's what I do know.
[01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:38.610]  This is a call to the world.
[01:46:38.610 --> 01:46:40.090]  This is an awakening.
[01:46:40.090 --> 01:46:45.450]  And this is an opportunity for us to bring so much awareness to the situation
[01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:50.390]  that whoever they are, whatever forces behind this, and I don't know,
[01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:54.790]  but I think the more awareness that we can bring, this is our opportunity to stop it
[01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:58.370]  and to create an awakening around the planet to help.
[01:46:58.370 --> 01:47:00.190]  Because this is an international issue.
[01:47:00.190 --> 01:47:03.590]  I've got people calling me from all these different countries, scientists.
[01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:08.590]  This is a colossal problem with the environment
[01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:10.630]  and what's going to happen with all these chemicals.
[01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:15.810]  How do we protect these people from what they're being exposed to right now?
[01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:17.730]  Normal protocols are not being met.
[01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:19.210]  So I don't know who it is.
[01:47:19.210 --> 01:47:20.210]  I don't know how it happened.
[01:47:20.210 --> 01:47:23.970]  But what I do know is with awareness and with spreading the message
[01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:26.370]  that we can possibly stop this plan
[01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:29.730]  and it can be the beginning of the end for the enemy.
[01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:32.770]  And it can be the beginning of a new awakening for our world.
[01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:34.850]  And I believe this is the siren call.
[01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:38.850]  This is a call to action for communities of people in the world,
[01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:40.870]  not just our country, not just Hawaii,
[01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:44.630]  but for everybody to start paying attention and waking up,
[01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:47.430]  which you've been trying to do for a long time.
[01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:49.350]  I believe this is the chance.
[01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:51.270]  And we do it for the children.
[01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:52.910]  We do it for the children.
[01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:54.750]  If you won't do it for the children,
[01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:59.110]  if you won't do it for Maui, what we call paradise,
[01:47:59.110 --> 01:48:02.030]  if you won't step up and defend this,
[01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:03.990]  you're not going to defend it when it comes to Kansas.
[01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.830]  You're not going to defend it
[01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:06.550]  when it comes to some small town
[01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:08.510]  in some rural place that no one cares about.
[01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:11.130]  If you won't step up and help Maui,
[01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:13.490]  if you won't do it for this place, guess what?
[01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:15.130]  They're going to take everything.
[01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:17.410]  All right.
[01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:20.730]  I asked you before you went live with us.
[01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:23.330]  I said, oh, they're trying to blockade.
[01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.170]  I looked you up.
[01:48:24.170 --> 01:48:25.210]  You're a trusted guy in the community.
[01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:26.530]  Everything about you is nice.
[01:48:26.530 --> 01:48:27.930]  So I see some big viral thing.
[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.690]  I go, well, let's look that guy's name up.
[01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:30.690]  Long history.
[01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:31.570]  Everybody loves you.
[01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:32.850]  Everybody loves Fish.
[01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:34.410]  And it turns out everything you said weeks ago
[01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.970]  turned out to be dead accurate from your perspective.
[01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:38.590]  It was worse than what you thought.
[01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:41.830]  And I said, how do I support?
[01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:44.290]  And you said, well, you know, they're attacking me.
[01:48:44.290 --> 01:48:45.130]  They're coming after me
[01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:45.950]  because I'm trying to get support
[01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:47.910]  and get media and I get support.
[01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:49.750]  And you said, I don't know how far I want to go with this
[01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:51.510]  but you know, we want to try to raise money for them
[01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:52.870]  and I'm going to get more attacked.
[01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:55.670]  Imagine good people that live there.
[01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:57.910]  You got a house, you're kicked out of it.
[01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:59.430]  You're living on the edge of town.
[01:48:59.430 --> 01:49:01.650]  The police won't even let you in.
[01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:03.590]  And then you're kind of like, well, I'm a local.
[01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:04.430]  I want to help them.
[01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:06.870]  I mean, I had to convince Fish, you know,
[01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:08.530]  who's basically homeless now
[01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:10.130]  to try to raise a little money for him.
[01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:11.530]  But yeah, we've kind of got a plan.
[01:49:11.530 --> 01:49:14.070]  We'd like to go directly.
[01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:15.770]  If good people don't raise the money
[01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:18.250]  who will know we'll deliver it all, nobody is.
[01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:22.770]  So I want to play a clip of you yesterday.
[01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:25.750]  And then what looks like, I'll be honest,
[01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:27.290]  he's not a regular fire.
[01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:29.210]  I know he can fly over and doesn't get grass
[01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:30.510]  but burns cars.
[01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:32.130]  This does not look normal.
[01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:34.850]  You know, they've got microwave weapons, not lasers
[01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:37.790]  but microwaves that will do this to cars.
[01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:39.870]  Pentagon's had it for at least 70 years.
[01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:41.950]  Yeah, they've had it right for World War II
[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:44.430]  and they had it perfected by the 90s.
[01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:46.510]  And I'll leave it at that
[01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:47.910]  because I know there's people very close to me
[01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:49.590]  that worked in those weapon systems.
[01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:50.670]  Didn't give me the classified info,
[01:49:50.670 --> 01:49:52.830]  but they just said, if you think lasers are powerful,
[01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:54.710]  you ought to see what microwaves do.
[01:49:54.710 --> 01:49:55.550]  And then after-
[01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:57.430]  Yeah, on that note, Alex,
[01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:59.150]  I had a gentleman call me yesterday.
[01:49:59.150 --> 01:50:04.150]  In 1972, he helped install a microwave unit on a KC-135.
[01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:08.890]  And he said they were flying it at 50,000 feet over Vietnam.
[01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:11.290]  And they were able to take out Jeep radars
[01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:15.930]  in a small Jeep with a microwave device in 1972.
[01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:18.410]  And he said, Eric, I had to sign all kinds of papers
[01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:21.010]  and say I wouldn't say a word until the late 80s.
[01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:23.690]  But if they were doing that in 1972,
[01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:25.330]  I mean, I'd never heard of it honestly,
[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:28.090]  but imagine what the technology can do today.
[01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:29.890]  Well, he's dead now so I can talk about it.
[01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:32.290]  But right before, he was a tough guy.
[01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:34.430]  Raymond Teague was like, ran the main mission
[01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:36.390]  for the cameras on the moon, all that.
[01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:38.030]  He was Air Force Intelligence,
[01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:40.170]  a whole bunch of tours in Vietnam.
[01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:43.030]  And he died like two weeks later.
[01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:44.110]  He used to work for me actually
[01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:45.790]  for about five, six years.
[01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:46.630]  But he would never tell me,
[01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:48.450]  he had like presidential letters on his wall
[01:50:48.450 --> 01:50:51.070]  from like, you know, Nixon and stuff.
[01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:53.270]  Cause he headed up like main mission controls,
[01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:54.870]  like one of the main bosses.
[01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:56.550]  And he said, well, my heart's going,
[01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:58.470]  I'll probably be dead in a few months.
[01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:00.070]  But I'm just gonna tell you everything.
[01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:01.330]  But he said the space program was real,
[01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:02.430]  we're not showing you everything.
[01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:05.830]  And you ought to see the stuff we had in Vietnam,
[01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:07.830]  the microwave weapons, all of it.
[01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:08.870]  And he just basically told me
[01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.390]  a whole bunch of stuff about that.
[01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:11.510]  And then I was like, okay, Raymond,
[01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:12.910]  well, I had a good hamburger, I'll see you.
[01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:15.510]  And like, I was at his funeral three weeks later.
[01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:17.030]  I wish I'd have pumped him more
[01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:18.310]  cause I'm just sitting there eating a hamburger
[01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:19.230]  and drinking a beer.
[01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:20.790]  You know, he's a really smart, funny guy.
[01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:23.230]  One of my dad's best friends,
[01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:25.190]  he and my dad used to go hunting all the time.
[01:51:25.190 --> 01:51:26.590]  I'm gonna talk like a month out of the year
[01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:27.670]  those guys hung out.
[01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:28.750]  He was also from East Texas,
[01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:29.790]  close where my dad came from.
[01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:33.690]  He told me so much stuff, basically similar things
[01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:37.090]  that he said, what you see in space is basically fake
[01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:39.130]  cause they're not showing you what they really got.
[01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:40.490]  So when I hear space lasers,
[01:51:40.490 --> 01:51:43.010]  it's easier to think, well, power lines fall down,
[01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:45.530]  which we know some did, but then I see the other footage.
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:47.010]  I know that stuff's real.
[01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:48.570]  I think, well, like you said,
[01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:51.970]  space is hard to send the main beam through
[01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:53.210]  cause it hits water vapor.
[01:51:53.210 --> 01:51:54.210]  It was like 10 feet of water
[01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:56.210]  in the first 15,000 feet of the atmosphere.
[01:51:56.210 --> 01:51:58.450]  So that laser's got to cook through that.
[01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:02.830]  But in C-130s or even in smaller aircraft,
[01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:04.990]  they've got lasers and microwaves now
[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.270]  that will blow a car up in seconds.
[01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:10.010]  You hit that car with it, the car explodes.
[01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:12.470]  The battery, everything sets on fire.
[01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:15.490]  And yeah, there's a whole lineup of them right there.
[01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:17.550]  So, and it turns out that Maui
[01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:20.830]  is the second largest base of these in the world
[01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:22.150]  or for the United States.
[01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:24.650]  So they don't need pilots to take off now.
[01:52:24.650 --> 01:52:27.390]  They've got drone operated, any aircraft.
[01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:29.490]  And so they can just give them an order, they go up.
[01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:31.130]  And I'm not saying it happened,
[01:52:31.130 --> 01:52:33.610]  but we should be looking at the FAA records and others
[01:52:33.610 --> 01:52:35.970]  or independent radar of what was in the air.
[01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:38.810]  Cause if there were some big aircraft circling
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:41.050]  right before this started,
[01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:43.530]  then that's where we need to look.
[01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:45.490]  So all these flutes know how to track Elon Musk,
[01:52:45.490 --> 01:52:46.650]  where he flies and stuff.
[01:52:46.650 --> 01:52:48.130]  Folks, let's use that same technology
[01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:49.330]  to track what was there.
[01:52:49.330 --> 01:52:53.330]  Let's play a few minutes of you with the burnout cars.
[01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.530]  Below La Jaina Luna High School
[01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:59.150]  in the neighborhood that did not, I repeat, did not burn.
[01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:00.390]  You can see all these houses
[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:03.670]  are standing around here, unburned.
[01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:05.110]  There's no burn here, okay?
[01:53:05.110 --> 01:53:09.370]  So to me, this is like something out of a space movie
[01:53:09.370 --> 01:53:11.470]  because you have this small field
[01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:13.070]  with some grass that burned, right?
[01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:15.750]  You can see where the grass burned.
[01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:18.710]  But then you have these two vehicles sitting in here
[01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:21.130]  that have melted aluminum.
[01:53:21.130 --> 01:53:22.350]  So Donovan, if you want to just take us
[01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:23.750]  through this car real quick and show us,
[01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:25.110]  I know you know a few things about cars.
[01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:26.850]  You can point out some things
[01:53:26.850 --> 01:53:28.490]  that require a very high temperature.
[01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:29.690]  By the way, we just talked to the neighbor
[01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:31.150]  who was talking to an investigator
[01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:33.290]  in La Jaina town yesterday,
[01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:35.690]  and he said the investigator told him
[01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:38.730]  the temperature's reached in excess of 3,000 degrees.
[01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:40.470]  So tell us what you got, Donovan.
[01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:44.590]  Well, we have about 300 degrees for aluminum,
[01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:46.050]  and this aluminum.
[01:53:46.050 --> 01:53:47.050]  300?
[01:53:47.050 --> 01:53:47.890]  1,300.
[01:53:47.890 --> 01:53:48.730]  1,300, okay, thank you.
[01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:51.450]  1,300, well, 1,220, but if you round it up
[01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:53.330]  because it was not only melted,
[01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:54.590]  it was liquefied to the point
[01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:57.510]  where it became a river of aluminum
[01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:58.590]  going down the dirt hill.
[01:53:58.590 --> 01:54:01.030]  So this is the aluminum rim, obviously.
[01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:02.710]  There's the tire, what's left of it,
[01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:05.470]  the steel threads or steel belts.
[01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:07.010]  And maybe combination gas tank
[01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:08.550]  if the gas tank's aluminum.
[01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:09.510]  Okay, okay.
[01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:12.110]  So you have liquefied aluminum
[01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:13.670]  running down the side of a grass fire.
[01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:18.670]  The caliper melted unless they stole it,
[01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:21.670]  but it looks like the bolts are still there.
[01:54:22.650 --> 01:54:26.050]  And then you get the belt, the steel belt of the tire,
[01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:29.050]  which is just a bunch of wire mesh laying there,
[01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:31.210]  and you have the windows that were melted,
[01:54:31.210 --> 01:54:32.090]  the back window.
[01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:34.610]  If you look at the big old,
[01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:38.350]  almost like the glass is just melted.
[01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:40.010]  Tell you what, sir, if you do a few more minutes
[01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:41.410]  with us, maybe five minutes the next hour,
[01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:42.650]  I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:43.930]  Before we get any further,
[01:54:43.930 --> 01:54:45.430]  what are the best charities to give to
[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:48.170]  that are actually getting stuff to folks?
[01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:49.890]  And I know you're stepping up to do it as well
[01:54:49.890 --> 01:54:51.310]  because people are challenging you to.
[01:54:51.850 --> 01:54:53.710]  How do we get aid to people right now?
[01:54:54.970 --> 01:54:59.770]  Well, we started a GoFundMe called lahinafirefund.com.
[01:54:59.770 --> 01:55:02.490]  It's part of our organization called Maui LFG.
[01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:05.330]  LFG stands for Let's Find the Gap,
[01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:07.630]  Let's Fill the Gap, Let's F and Go,
[01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:10.890]  because we've been mobilized to find areas of need.
[01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:12.190]  And so you can give to us.
[01:55:12.190 --> 01:55:15.290]  We are gonna give every penny back to people
[01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.730]  that are affected by this fire.
[01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:19.090]  We're gonna give it $10,000 at a time.
[01:55:19.090 --> 01:55:20.790]  We're gonna catch that on camera
[01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:23.650]  and help people with 10 grand, 10 grand, 10 grand.
[01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:27.010]  And then on top of that, we're gonna share their Venmo,
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:28.250]  their GoFundMe.
[01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:30.290]  So we're seeding them with 10 grand
[01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.530]  and then hoping that people will continue
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:33.690]  to give to them directly.
[01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:35.530]  Because the feds are sending 700 bucks
[01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:36.570]  and trying to keep everybody out
[01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:39.350]  so they don't get aid, so they can be forced to sell.
[01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:40.810]  It's very clear what's happening.
[01:55:40.810 --> 01:55:41.970]  This is so obvious.
[01:55:41.970 --> 01:55:43.330]  Thank you, thank you, Alex.
[01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:45.930]  They're choking off the people of Lahaina.
[01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:48.250]  They're hoping that they'll all leave
[01:55:48.250 --> 01:55:49.170]  and they'll have to.
[01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:51.110]  And if you wanna talk about a land grab,
[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:54.150]  the only land grab I'm seeing here is the banks, right?
[01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:56.030]  All of these properties are basically,
[01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:57.830]  most of them are mortgaged.
[01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:59.430]  So if they have to make their payments
[01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:01.550]  for the next two to three years, taxes,
[01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:02.550]  they can't afford-
[01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:04.070]  Hold on, do more time and explain this,
[01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:05.750]  but we're gonna put the URL up,
[01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:07.710]  slowly give it to everybody.
[01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:10.150]  Where do people go to give donations to go write to people
[01:56:10.150 --> 01:56:12.850]  so the locals like you can stabilize it
[01:56:12.850 --> 01:56:14.430]  and not have the globalists come in
[01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:16.830]  and the hundred billionaires, that's conservative,
[01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:18.670]  that are in the area trying to steal the land
[01:56:19.210 --> 01:56:20.850]  that drove up the prices, they're trying to force them out.
[01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:21.950]  Where do people donate?
[01:56:22.930 --> 01:56:27.930]  Lahainafirefund.com, lahainafirefund.com.
[01:56:28.330 --> 01:56:30.490]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:32.050]  How much more time can you do?
[01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:35.330]  As much time as you need, Alex.
[01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:36.290]  I got other big guests.
[01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:37.930]  Stu Peters is on top of this, he's coming up.
[01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:39.530]  Let's do 15 more minutes.
[01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:41.010]  Stu Peters is coming on.
[01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:42.850]  Folks, this is big time.
[01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:43.730]  This is obvious.
[01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:47.090]  This is choreographed destruction, choreographed.
[01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:49.310]  You don't perfectly mess up this bet.
[01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:52.110]  Okay, this was precision operated
[01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:54.550]  and I am now thinking direct energy was used
[01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:56.390]  because I had not seen what the locals had shot.
[01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:58.910]  There's no way, this is,
[01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:01.110]  and the cover-up just adds to it.
[01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:04.230]  These people are sick, but the drones can do this.
[01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:06.450]  They don't need Air Force officers to do this anymore.
[01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:08.470]  We're gonna go to break, so we'll be right back to you.
[01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:10.990]  Please remember, we're listed for this mothership
[01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.190]  that supports everybody else.
[01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:14.910]  Infowarsstore.com, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:16.450]  the strongest turmeric out there,

[01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:21.410]  was like eight months.

[01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:41.170]  Back in two minutes.
[01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:42.370]  Eric, take a break.

[01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:45.950]  Power number three straight ahead.
[01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:52.910]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:54.670]  coffee has not been available.
[01:57:54.670 --> 01:57:58.270]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:59.270]  gone down some.
[01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:02.550]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:09.230]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier
[01:58:09.230 --> 01:58:12.090]  that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:15.310]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:22.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have
[01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:23.270]  ever drank.
[01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:25.630]  It is game changing.
[01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:27.790]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:31.250]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win.

[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:53.070]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them.
[01:58:53.070 --> 01:58:57.190]  But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[01:58:57.190 --> 01:59:01.550]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to
[01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:04.270]  slay those whose ways are upright.
[01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:08.790]  But their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken.
[01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:13.230]  Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of many wicked, for the power
[01:59:13.230 --> 01:59:17.990]  of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:21.830]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care, and their inheritance will
[01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:23.110]  endure forever.
[01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:26.470]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:30.830]  In days of famine, they will have plenty, but the wicked will perish.
[01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:36.310]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed and
[01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:50.790]  they will often smoke.
[01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:55.430]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[01:59:55.430 --> 02:00:17.510]  That's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:32.310]  Imagine, a good-sized town, almost no aid being given, local aid being blocked and
[02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:37.750]  giant black fences being put up around the entire area.
[02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:43.390]  Miles away, citizens kicked out, told by police not to film.
[02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:46.390]  Hawaii never became a really free state.
[02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:48.030]  I'm sad that the US took it over.
[02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:49.790]  What happened there was wrong.
[02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:51.790]  But you go there, it's beyond the territory.
[02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:54.350]  The police do not think you have any rights.
[02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:55.350]  People are amazing.
[02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:59.350]  But I get that our guest, Eric West, was polite to him when he's two miles outside.
[02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.630]  He has a house there.
[02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:08.870]  He's filming on a hilltop and they say, you can't film the town from two miles away.
[02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:11.190]  Just like, oh, you're not supposed to question elections.
[02:01:11.190 --> 02:01:15.070]  They just did an African election, I went to cover yesterday, where they wouldn't allow
[02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:17.510]  poll watchers as much as the UN wanted.
[02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:20.790]  So they say it's not a free election.
[02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:24.530]  The essence of a cover up is a cover up.
[02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:27.030]  And this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:28.990]  Eric West, you've got to join us again soon.
[02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.990]  Get Fish on.
[02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:34.470]  I know you've been out of contact with the last day or so because he's homeless now.
[02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:38.530]  But get a hold of him as soon as possible, get him on.
[02:01:38.530 --> 02:01:42.010]  But we just want to talk to him because he's a really great guy.
[02:01:42.010 --> 02:01:43.010]  So are you.
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:44.250]  You have four minutes to break.
[02:01:44.250 --> 02:01:48.770]  What else do you want to impart to viewers and listeners?
[02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:52.530]  What I'd like to impart to viewers and listeners is, number one, I believe we need to have
[02:01:52.530 --> 02:01:58.250]  a day of mourning here in on Maui, in the world, essentially, so that we can kind
[02:01:58.250 --> 02:02:00.250]  of get a reset.
[02:02:00.250 --> 02:02:04.310]  That's a normal procedure that the people of Hawaii have not been really given the
[02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:05.530]  opportunity to do.
[02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:10.770]  They just seem to forget that hundreds, maybe thousands of people died.
[02:02:10.770 --> 02:02:11.770]  That's very, very important.
[02:02:11.770 --> 02:02:16.250]  We have to have that mourning and we have to allow these people to do what they would
[02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:17.250]  do.
[02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:18.890]  And we don't know who died.
[02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:22.370]  So you talk about what is the best dead reckoning we've got on the real death
[02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:23.370]  toll?
[02:02:23.370 --> 02:02:28.930]  I mean, I've heard that, you know, it's one hundred and change, I believe.
[02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:31.450]  And they've reduced the list to three hundred and thirty eight.
[02:02:31.450 --> 02:02:36.490]  I believe that they believe are missing, but it's very, very, very mysterious.
[02:02:36.490 --> 02:02:40.450]  And why they why they wouldn't just do a census at every neighborhood.
[02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:43.250]  They've got these people, these guardsmen that are posted.
[02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:48.530]  I have a sign in sheet and how many people I mean, we so easy, I believe, to to do that.
[02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:52.590]  But the fact that they've let they have not allowed homeowners to or business owners
[02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:54.510]  to return to their their property.
[02:02:54.510 --> 02:03:00.250]  So it's been complete communication blackout and a complete physical just like when they
[02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:03.810]  locked down all over the world where the West is in control.
[02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:08.370]  People couldn't see their loved ones while they had tubes stuck down their throats to
[02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:09.730]  kill them with ventilators.
[02:03:09.730 --> 02:03:11.170]  You couldn't see your family.
[02:03:11.170 --> 02:03:12.170]  Same story again.
[02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:14.890]  Yeah, you can't go pay your last respects.
[02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:18.890]  You can't go look for the your melted fire safe.
[02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.170]  You cannot.
[02:03:20.170 --> 02:03:23.430]  There's a complete authoritarian control happening here.
[02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:27.910]  And they just more government officials are piling in every single day and we're crying
[02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:32.210]  out to the American public, we're crying out to the world to take action.
[02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:35.770]  You know, this is not quarter armchair quarterback time.
[02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:39.230]  It's not just guys like you that have been telling the truth for years.
[02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:41.630]  It's time for people to mobilize and do something.
[02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:45.290]  This is a call to action.
[02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:46.910]  People need to spread the word with your videos.
[02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:51.870]  They need to pray for folks they need to support financially because we're next.
[02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:58.270]  This model of controlled choreographed destruction is the future and we don't stop it.
[02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:59.270]  Right.
[02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.550]  This is the canary in the cage.
[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:04.630]  If you can't see what this is, this is just not so blatantly obvious that you're asleep
[02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:06.270]  and you'll probably remain asleep.
[02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:11.110]  But for those of you that are woken have been awakened and are waking up to what's
[02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.810]  going on, it's time to take action.
[02:04:12.810 --> 02:04:15.350]  It's time to actually become a digital warrior.
[02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:17.470]  It's time to reach out to your politicians.
[02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:22.090]  It's time to do whatever it is that God calls you to do.
[02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:23.650]  This is a call to action.
[02:04:23.650 --> 02:04:27.490]  And I truly believe there's something going on here that's way bigger than we can even
[02:04:27.490 --> 02:04:28.630]  fathom.
[02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:33.550]  But it comes down to we the people and we the people need to start acting like the
[02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:36.190]  home of the free in the home of the land of the brave.
[02:04:36.190 --> 02:04:40.070]  We need to start acting like Americans and start doing something instead of just, you
[02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:41.790]  know, scrolling or whatever.
[02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:44.750]  We need to mobilize people to action.
[02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:45.750]  All right.
[02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:52.990]  Final segment with Eric West, local investigative journalist, businessman, and then Stu Peters.
[02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:59.550]  Straight ahead on Alex Jones, stay with us.
[02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:06.110]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained
[02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:07.750]  through diet.
[02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:12.670]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[02:05:12.670 --> 02:05:13.670]  it.
[02:05:13.670 --> 02:05:18.910]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega threes.
[02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:24.430]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:30.070]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at info war store
[02:05:30.070 --> 02:05:32.230]  dot com.
[02:05:32.230 --> 02:05:38.670]  Omega three fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:40.830]  our brain and our heart.
[02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:45.710]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.

[02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:10.110]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.110 --> 02:06:16.010]  All right, we got 10 minutes in this segment that I'm going to hit some other
[02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:20.110]  breaking news and bring in Stu Peters, who's always informative.
[02:06:20.110 --> 02:06:25.190]  Eric West is a business owner, lives in Lina, locked out of his house, black tarp being
[02:06:25.190 --> 02:06:27.270]  put up around the whole town.
[02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:28.470]  Massive cover up.
[02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:31.550]  I want you to have the floor to cover other angles and other issues with a little bit
[02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:34.910]  more of your direct energy weapon piece that's gone viral.
[02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:36.470]  But let me get back to the question I asked you earlier.
[02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:37.470]  You elaborated some.
[02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:41.670]  I don't want you to really go deep dive on this for a few minutes.
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.670]  One of the different jurisdictions I'm just seeing different clubs at different council
[02:06:44.670 --> 02:06:49.910]  meetings where I go to the raw footage and man, nobody's buying it from what
[02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:51.310]  I've seen.
[02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:52.750]  What are the locals saying?
[02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:54.110]  What is their consensus?
[02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:55.990]  Because I mean, I know what their consensus is.
[02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:58.750]  This is a coordinated operation.
[02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:59.830]  We were set up.
[02:06:59.830 --> 02:07:00.870]  You're not letting aid in.
[02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:02.550]  You're covering something up.
[02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.910]  Wow.
[02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:05.030]  Where are the children?
[02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:10.910]  Are the locals buying it on a scale of one to 10 or one of 100, 100 percent?
[02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:12.590]  None of them are asleep.
[02:07:12.590 --> 02:07:13.470]  They're all awake.
[02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:14.230]  Zero percent.
[02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:15.270]  Nobody's awake.
[02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:18.790]  What's the percentage right now?
[02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:20.630]  You know, that's a very good question, Alex.
[02:07:20.630 --> 02:07:25.110]  So I saw a news book the other day asking, you know, where is the outcry
[02:07:25.110 --> 02:07:28.550]  from the local Hawaiians or from the people that live here?
[02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:32.910]  Because it seems to be I think it's a situation where it's like a bomb just
[02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:33.710]  went off. Right.
[02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:39.670]  I mean, it's literally we are in survival mode and we're also devastated and they
[02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:40.550]  don't have anything.
[02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:44.550]  So imagine the majority of the people that live here, they don't have anything.
[02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:46.430]  They don't have they don't have a possession.
[02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:48.110]  So it's hard to kind of fathom.
[02:07:48.110 --> 02:07:50.310]  So I think they're mainly just shell shocked.
[02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:54.470]  But they don't really they're in they're in a state of confusion.
[02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:56.310]  They're trying to get resources.
[02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:59.630]  They're being told to go here and do this, go to this website.
[02:07:59.630 --> 02:08:01.710]  You don't have you don't have any Internet connection.
[02:08:01.710 --> 02:08:06.870]  Right. So it's like so basically nothing and you like it.
[02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:10.790]  Correct, but it's like you live in the people watching this or listening to
[02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:15.070]  this, you live in a paradigm of you have access to the necessities, you have
[02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:16.870]  access to an Internet or phone.
[02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:19.990]  These people have access to nothing and they're just displaced.
[02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:23.430]  So you're talking about they're like the Japanese after bombs were dropped on
[02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:24.630]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:08:26.070 --> 02:08:28.670]  Correct. And it's a very remote part of the island.
[02:08:28.670 --> 02:08:31.830]  So the rest of the island is that's thirty five, forty minute drive.
[02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:35.670]  They've got easy control points to let people in and out, which you can flow
[02:08:35.670 --> 02:08:40.790]  freely. No, you got you got big skyscrapers, huge hotels, malls,
[02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:46.430]  everything. This is a rural original seat of the lion roll family, a whaling town.
[02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:48.470]  This is where the blue collar folks live.
[02:08:50.190 --> 02:08:53.830]  Yeah, well, the people whose homes burned are definitely the blue collar.
[02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:58.150]  I mean, it's the lowest end of not a society, but as far as the real estate
[02:08:58.150 --> 02:09:00.950]  and all the billionaires, their houses are all green right around there.
[02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:06.230]  Yeah, with blue roofs, but there is this blue thing going on, don't quite
[02:09:06.230 --> 02:09:09.150]  understand. Matter of fact, that clip you just showed to the sheriff, the
[02:09:09.150 --> 02:09:13.070]  sheriff was showing me a clip on his phone of a car that was red in the
[02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:16.350]  middle of destruction. And the red car was perfect.
[02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:20.670]  It was his classic car and he was zooming up on the melted little bit of
[02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:24.470]  melted taillight. But why is this red car perfectly fine?
[02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:27.510]  Yes, they're saying certain colors the microwaves bounce off of.
[02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:28.830]  Is that that's what I'm hearing?
[02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:32.790]  I guess so. Yeah, but the other thing that's interesting, Alex, is we
[02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:36.550]  are less than 100 miles from Oahu, one of the biggest military
[02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:37.950]  installations in the world.
[02:09:38.150 --> 02:09:41.590]  Marine, Air Force, Army, all kinds of equipment.
[02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:43.430]  They didn't show up.
[02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:48.390]  Why is it that there has been very little interaction from such an
[02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:52.470]  amazing resource just to say we can blame the Chinese all day for
[02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:53.430]  direct energy weapons?
[02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:56.710]  And I'm not saying they aren't involved, but I would the U.S.
[02:09:56.710 --> 02:09:59.950]  government's the one that keeps testing biologicals on us and with
[02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:03.350]  the drones they've got, you could have one globalist give the order
[02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:05.390]  and send up drone aircraft and do this.
[02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:09.510]  Correct. And why is there such a minimal response?
[02:10:09.550 --> 02:10:13.390]  They had multiple Chinook helicopters here for the little three acre
[02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:17.030]  brush fires of the day with alarms, with sirens, with text messages.
[02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:18.910]  Where were they the day of the fire?
[02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:23.590]  This thing started early in the morning and burned all night long.
[02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:26.190]  And let's go back. We have the head of the water district.
[02:10:26.190 --> 02:10:29.990]  We play the video who's on the Obama Foundation saying we denied
[02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:32.910]  them water even when the fire that day they denied it.
[02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:39.630]  I think they were just trying to dip into a water reservoir.
[02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:42.310]  Talk about that for people that don't know.
[02:10:44.150 --> 02:10:46.670]  So, again, they spin everything in a way that doesn't make a
[02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:49.870]  whole lot of sense, but basically the water was shut off.
[02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:51.510]  Don't forget about water rights.
[02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:53.910]  Nothing was coming out of the spigots or the hoses.
[02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:58.350]  OK, funny burn down building and blue shirts are just fine.
[02:10:58.510 --> 02:11:00.510]  Now I'm starting to think something's going on now.
[02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:05.270]  For folks that don't know, light only hits certain things.
[02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:08.870]  So they always said like a spaceship that wants to be anti-laser or a
[02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:12.150]  continental ballistic missile with MIRV technology when it pops open about
[02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:14.830]  to launch missiles into the atmosphere, you know, launches from Russia
[02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:19.950]  over the North Pole, it's still in space, MIRV opens up, launches 24
[02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:22.910]  warheads, 12 of them are decoys, 12 are warheads, but they would
[02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:26.150]  jacket them in glass so that lasers would bounce off.
[02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:30.030]  So I know that's basic technology, but why are you in burned out
[02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:32.150]  buildings with blue shirts laying there totally fine?
[02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:39.870]  And people are showing it, see, see, look, look, look, it doesn't hurt it.
[02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:47.350]  And anybody knows this is played around with lasers, I have as well,
[02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:50.270]  just here in the office, having fun years ago with a little joke with
[02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:55.590]  Lego toys, vaporizing them with a cheap $100 laser, a black piece
[02:11:55.590 --> 02:12:00.710]  would melt immediately, but a white piece, white reflects light,
[02:12:00.710 --> 02:12:03.030]  so does baby blue, wouldn't burn.
[02:12:03.670 --> 02:12:05.830]  So show that footage again.
[02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:07.310]  Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[02:12:11.190 --> 02:12:12.830]  You want to say anything about this, Eric West?
[02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:13.470]  I know I'm ranting.
[02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:17.350]  Oh yeah, I knew less about lasers than anybody.
[02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:20.350]  So I just found those blue shirts, by the way, they're being
[02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:21.990]  returned to the owner of that store.
[02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:25.150]  I think they need to be submitted for testing, for any kind of
[02:12:25.150 --> 02:12:29.310]  accelerants, but essentially we have all kinds of weird blue things
[02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:32.550]  that didn't get burned and some blue tiled roofs and some red, some
[02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:37.230]  red things, blue fabric isn't burned by a laser, everything else
[02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:41.430]  is, white barely burns, blue won't burn, everything else burns
[02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:42.430]  because it's absorbing them.
[02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:47.910]  You also have trees that are perfectly fine next to buildings.
[02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:50.470]  And I've got so many people that have reached out to me from the
[02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:55.430]  Paradise fire, from Malibu, from the campfire, they're saying, we
[02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:57.710]  saw the exact same phenomenon.
[02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:58.950]  It's just, here's the problem.
[02:12:59.430 --> 02:13:03.110]  Nobody seems to listen or believe it seems too crazy or outlandish,
[02:13:03.150 --> 02:13:06.430]  but if you don't listen to this, it's going to be in your backyard.
[02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:08.310]  This is just the beginning.
[02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:13.430]  So we take a stand now, we draw a line in the sand now, or it's just,
[02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:14.910]  they're just going to keep being successful.
[02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:16.390]  Whoever they is, I don't know.
[02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:17.710]  And how they did it, I don't know.
[02:13:17.710 --> 02:13:21.630]  But we do know there's enough, there's enough gut feeling here.
[02:13:21.630 --> 02:13:23.510]  There's enough fishy stuff going on.
[02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:25.710]  That fish was nice enough to point out.
[02:13:25.710 --> 02:13:28.550]  And everything he said has been corroborated by other individuals
[02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:30.070]  that it's time to take action.
[02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:36.350]  Well, don't you remember, I mean, there's been so many examples
[02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:40.910]  of this, but man, the left's being caught everywhere setting fires.
[02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:44.070]  And I figure it's arsonist and them not turn the power lines off.
[02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:44.990]  I think that was part of it.
[02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:48.950]  But I think, I think they probably did use some directed energy
[02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:49.870]  from what I've seen now.
[02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:52.350]  And then they use the power lines as the fallback story.
[02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:53.470]  I think they were part of it.
[02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:56.230]  I agree.
[02:13:56.230 --> 02:13:58.430]  There's a lot of misdirection, a lot of misinformation.
[02:13:59.470 --> 02:14:01.270]  You know, it's your real estate agent.
[02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:04.110]  That's the second most expensive real estate in the world.
[02:14:04.230 --> 02:14:05.070]  Cause everybody wants it.
[02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:08.350]  What is it like thousands of dollars per square inch?
[02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:16.030]  I mean, a very old home built in the seventies, three bedroom, two bath,
[02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:19.310]  you know, cinder block construction would be, you know, eight, nine
[02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:20.510]  hundred thousand dollars.
[02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:23.950]  So the average home price on Maui is 1.2 million.
[02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:27.390]  But yeah, certainly the stuff that was burned on front street.
[02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:30.390]  I mean, my goodness, that is some of the most expensive real estate.
[02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:34.270]  And some would say that it's the best spot in all of Hawaii.
[02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:37.710]  This is where the royalty chose to vacation during the
[02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:38.590]  Hawaiian kingdom.
[02:14:38.590 --> 02:14:39.790]  This was their capital.
[02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:43.070]  You could say this is the heart of Hawaii.
[02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.950]  Wow.
[02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:48.990]  Well, if they wanted us to just buy their official story, it's not happening.
[02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:51.750]  As sad as this is for the dead, we should warn them.
[02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:54.990]  And it helps obviously there and on the way, not from the government.
[02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:57.750]  This is definitely blown up the system's face.
[02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:01.350]  I agree.
[02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:03.670]  And it's time to move the needle on the media because
[02:15:03.670 --> 02:15:05.150]  the media is not getting access.
[02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:09.990]  So all we have left is we the people, all we have left is platforms and
[02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:13.950]  sharing and you being a digital warrior, going all night long until
[02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:15.990]  your fingers bleed, do things.
[02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:17.750]  I think this is a call to action.
[02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:20.710]  This isn't just something you watch from afar and go, oh, how interesting.
[02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:25.750]  You do something, whatever it is, say a prayer and ask God, what are
[02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:27.790]  you to do because the battle is here.
[02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:30.630]  It's now it's happening and we need to mobilize.
[02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:31.950]  We can pick on Maui.
[02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:33.670]  It's this little place in the middle of nowhere.
[02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:34.470]  Guess what?
[02:15:34.630 --> 02:15:36.390]  This is United States soil.
[02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:39.830]  And if you're a patriot, it's time to do whatever it is that God
[02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:41.750]  is calling and asking you to do.
[02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:42.910]  All right.
[02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:43.390]  Powerful.
[02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:45.950]  Eric, join us again in the next few days.
[02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:48.070]  You name the time, Eric West.
[02:15:48.070 --> 02:15:49.190]  Thank you so much.

[02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:03.550]  electromagnetic 5g or the GMO crops.
[02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:07.510]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has
[02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:09.670]  authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:13.270]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:16:13.630 --> 02:16:16.830]  The allowable level, the government admits that they allow to be in your
[02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:20.870]  water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son
[02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:22.390]  into a feminized mutant.
[02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:23.350]  Look it up.

[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:24.320]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:29.320]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:32.320]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:34.320]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.320]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.320]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:43.320]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:55.320]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:02.320]  All right, Eric West is a local Lahaina resident there in Maui, Hawaii, a fellow American.
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.320]  And he's got a lot of work to do.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:05.320]  We've really held him over here.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:07.320]  He's got to get back to relief efforts.
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:12.320]  But you're talking to conservatively three or four million people right now watching.
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:14.320]  Millions will watch later.
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.320]  People are going to share this everywhere.
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.320]  They do a great job.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.320]  We salute the viewers and listeners to do that.
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:21.320]  They're really not the tail of the dog.
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:22.320]  They're the whole damn dog.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:25.320]  So the dog hunts when they decide to take action.
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:29.320]  We salute them and thank them because we're not going down without a fight here.
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:31.320]  But imagine all the people watching and listening.
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.320]  Recap the key.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:35.320]  Anything else you didn't cover.
[02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:38.320]  As if you just now joined us, this message is going out.
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:41.320]  You're in front of four million people conservatively.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.320]  Right now, what do you want to say to them?
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:46.320]  Eric West.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.320]  Here's what I have to say to the American people and people watching around the world.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:55.320]  We have a colossal event that's occurred here, an unprecedented black swan event.
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:57.320]  It's obvious that something nefarious is afoot.
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:00.320]  We don't know exactly how or why.
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.320]  But we have our theories.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:05.320]  Ultimately, your show, Alex, is about info wars.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.320]  And this is an information war.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:09.320]  The media has been kept out of this.
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.320]  We have a temporary flight restriction that's been in place since it started.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:14.320]  There's no reason.
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:15.320]  We can't fly drones.
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.320]  We cannot access.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:17.320]  We cannot take photos.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.320]  The information about this event is being withheld from the American people.
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:27.320]  And so what I'm able to provide, I had the first Starlink on the ground through my YouTube channel,
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.320]  HawaiiRealEstate.org.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.320]  I am bringing you the truth.
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:31.320]  Not the truth.
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:32.320]  I'm bringing you the information.
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:38.320]  You can interpret what you're seeing through what I'm showing on HawaiiRealEstate.org website.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.320]  Our purpose is to fill the gap.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:42.320]  We have an organization called Maui LFG.
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.320]  Let's find the gap.
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:45.320]  Let's fill the gap.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:52.320]  Let's F and go, which is let's figure out what's going on here and then fill the gap so that it doesn't happen again in the future.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:59.320]  We have so many colossal errors that occurred that killed hundreds if not thousands of people, many of them children,
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:03.320]  in the most beautiful spot on planet Earth potentially when you come to vacation.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:08.320]  So the question is if you won't take a stand for this, if you won't draw a line in the sand for this,
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:12.320]  then what will it take before they end up in your backyard?
[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:13.320]  You've got to help Maui.
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:18.320]  You've got to go to war on your phones in the digital realm to help us.
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:23.320]  The guy with the blower just showed up, of course, but you've got to help Maui.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:28.320]  You've got to help us here because this is a world issue, a world crisis,
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:31.320]  and we can't let them get away with whatever it is they're trying to do.
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:38.320]  We need to call on the world force to share what is going on and to check in and to mobilize,
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:45.320]  move, shake the white hats, the good people that will help make this situation turn around for the good
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:47.320]  so that we can find out what's going on here.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:49.320]  We're not trying to get clicks.
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:56.320]  We're trying to get a change happening in this world so that they don't take over whoever they are.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:01.320]  I just encourage everybody to pray to God, to ask for help on what to do.
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:02.320]  No, I totally agree.
[02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:06.320]  But let me just ask you, do you hear that or is that on our feed?
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:09.320]  Because it sounds like Godzilla just attacked.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:15.320]  I have to move.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.320]  I guess he's checking what's going on.
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:25.320]  Well, incredible job, Eric West.
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:27.320]  Eric, we love you.
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:31.320]  Eric, can you repeat that last question?
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.320]  No, you did a great job laying that out.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.320]  It just sounded like all hell was breaking loose.
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:38.320]  Closing 60-second comment.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.320]  Closing 60-second comment.
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:43.320]  Please go to MauiLFG.org.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.320]  Support what's going on in Maui.
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:49.320]  Register yourself as a resource on that website if you can help.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:52.320]  Besides donating money to LahinaFireFund.com
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  and digital warriors out there, patriots, citizens of the world,
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  it's important that right now you mobilize to get the word out
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:01.320]  because there's a complete ultimate media blackout
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.320]  and we just need to share what's actually going on here on Maui.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:07.320]  This is important not just for us but for you
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:10.320]  because they're coming, whoever they are, for your land next.
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:12.320]  All right, Eric West, thank you so much.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:14.320]  Please get back on the show in the next few days.
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  Give us updates. Thank you, sir.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.320]  Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:21.320]  Wow, that was beyond powerful.
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  All right, I did major preparation for today's show.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:28.320]  I probably covered five of the 30 stacks I've got.
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:29.320]  Let's not exaggerate.
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:39.320]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 stacks.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:47.320]  So I've covered five, five of 25 stacks.
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:50.320]  And Stu Peters is always loaded for bear.
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:55.320]  He's about to take over here and give us the latest on everything going down.
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:59.320]  We got Ukraine drones target Russians, civilians and psychological terror
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  with help from the West, The Economist reports.
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:06.320]  Russian appeals Ukraine soldiers to counter-offensive.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.320]  This is your last chance.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.320]  Hungarian president tells Zelensky it's time to sit down and negotiate.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.320]  So is NATO.
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:20.320]  Zelensky's willing to hold elections, but only the West pays for it.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:26.320]  We've got massive harassment of Amish in Pennsylvania and other areas.
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:30.320]  So while they give illegal aliens $10,000 a month in New York
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:35.320]  and other states, they're harassing Amish that feed themselves saying,
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:38.320]  you're not FDA approved to feed yourself milk and food.
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:40.320]  We're taking your family over.
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:41.320]  We're taking your land.
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:43.320]  It's so predatory.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.320]  Government overreach.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:49.320]  Virginia Amish farmer livelihood on the line following government raid and seizure of property.
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:53.320]  They can't have the Amish not have an autism or live until they're 90.
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:55.320]  They can't have them not living up.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:57.320]  They got to have them dead too and shut down.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:00.320]  They're too obvious that what they're doing is the answer.
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:03.320]  That's why they didn't get everybody to take the shot.
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.320]  Because if you had enough people didn't take it, you'd have a control group that wasn't sick.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.320]  Well, guess what?
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:10.320]  About 40% of us didn't take it.
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:16.320]  And almost no one's buying the next rollout of your garbage.
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  And we caught you with your pants down.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  And now California admits we're going back to COVID rollouts
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  and their official website, mass contact tracing, vaccine passports, lockdowns.
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.320]  And they're so pissed we learned about it.
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.320]  They're so pissed we're saying no.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:37.320]  Well, they're going to get more pissed as we don't follow anything they say.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.320]  They're dissolved our borders are cutting off our energy.
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:44.320]  They're attacking us at every level.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:47.320]  But Larry Fink thinks he's God.
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:49.320]  And the Rothschilds, they don't even think they're God.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:51.320]  And they're not God.
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  Because once we identify that they're the ones behind all this, it's game over.
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.320]  And I'm telling you, it's on record that BlackRock owns that power utility, 96% of it.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.320]  And it's on record everybody's waking up.
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:04.320]  And that's a microcosm.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:07.320]  You think you're going to corner the people in Lahaina?
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:11.320]  You think you're going to corner the people in Texas the last two years when you cut the power off in the winter
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:13.320]  and wouldn't let us up the power during the storms?
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.320]  You think we don't know it's you?
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  We do know it's you.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:21.320]  So you try to indict Trump until the cows come home.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.320]  You try to intimidate us.
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.320]  You try to shut me down.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.320]  You try to silence us.
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.320]  We are not going to be silenced, you blood-sucking arsonist.
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  And it didn't just left us, 79 of them caught in Greece setting the giant fires.
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  They're cultural arsonists.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.320]  They're scum from the bottom up.
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:45.320]  And just like at the Burning Man with the travel police running over those blockades that blocked the road,
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.320]  that's where we're going with you people.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:50.320]  Total resistance.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  Whoo!
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:54.320]  Stu Peters is our guest.
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:02.320]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality coffee has not been available.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:07.320]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:10.320]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:20.320]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:31.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:33.320]  It is game-changing.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:36.320]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:39.320]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:43.320]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now for Escape to Prison Planet Light Roast.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.320]  That's the strongest.

[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:54.320]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:12.320]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality gloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:14.320]  But now we've got it.
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:16.320]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:17.320]  We've got a limited shipment.
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.320]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:29.320]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal high quality gloidal silver from the best manufacturer,

[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:58.320]  The globalists are only humans.
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:00.320]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:02.320]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:14.320]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:17.320]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:20.320]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:23.320]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:27.320]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[02:31:27.320 --> 02:31:29.320]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:32.320]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.
[02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:43.320]  10% off on top of that exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:45.320]  Get it today and it funds the Infowars.
[02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:46.320]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:53.320]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:56.320]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[02:31:56.320 --> 02:32:04.320]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:06.320]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:17.320]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases into fluoresolicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:23.320]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:31.320]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:40.320]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:45.320]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:51.320]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:55.320]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:56.630 --> 02:33:05.910]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.330 --> 02:33:35.330]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:42.330]  It doesn't just block highways or derail trains or burn down food processing centers.
[02:33:42.330 --> 02:33:50.330]  They wait till the high winds come, they get their orders from Black Rock, and then they show up and they burn down your neighborhood.
[02:33:50.330 --> 02:33:58.330]  But they mess with the tribal council in Nevada and they ran them over when they refused to bring it down.
[02:33:58.330 --> 02:34:01.330]  They ran over their garbage.
[02:34:01.330 --> 02:34:06.330]  Whereas in London, England and places like Germany, they defend them and support them.
[02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:09.330]  They're all funded by the big oil companies.
[02:34:09.330 --> 02:34:12.330]  Oh, it's the oil companies actually financing the whole carbon tax.
[02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:16.330]  All right, we're going full Stu Peters right now.
[02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:21.330]  And I'll say this when I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'm the first to admit it.
[02:34:21.330 --> 02:34:33.330]  When I saw them cut the water, leave the power on, not trim the trees, turn off the sirens, curl everybody into Lahaina 20 days ago now, I said, hey, it's open and shut.
[02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:36.330]  It's Black Rock. They did it. And that was part of it.
[02:34:36.330 --> 02:34:39.330]  But now I've seen the footage of locals. Stu Peters was right.
[02:34:39.330 --> 02:34:43.330]  Green grass, trees everywhere, cars, hundreds of yards away from any fire.
[02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:45.330]  They're all melted. They're destroyed.
[02:34:45.330 --> 02:34:51.330]  And I know they've got not lasers, but microwaves that are mainly fired from planes.
[02:34:51.330 --> 02:34:54.330]  Because microwaves don't shoot through the atmosphere from space.
[02:34:54.330 --> 02:34:57.330]  There's 10 feet of water on average, up to 50,000 feet.
[02:34:57.330 --> 02:34:58.330]  Can't get through it.
[02:34:58.330 --> 02:35:02.330]  Lasers are great in space. When a missile comes up out of the atmosphere, you can shoot them there.
[02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:06.330]  Lasers in atmosphere only go 20, 30 miles.
[02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:12.330]  I've looked at the studies, but microwaves and particle beams can go further, but they're on aircraft.
[02:35:12.330 --> 02:35:18.330]  And when the globalists can take any plane, a DC-10, a 747, a 777, a Cessna,
[02:35:18.330 --> 02:35:26.330]  and they can mount, depending on the size of the aircraft, lasers that can fire and fire and fire.
[02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:32.330]  So, turns out Maui's the second largest U.S. base, other than Area 51, for these.
[02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:37.330]  And I've looked at the damage. It does look like, in some areas, directed energy weapons.
[02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:40.330]  They were going to fall back and blame their own power lines.
[02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:48.330]  So, I've got to say, Stu Peters has been at the tip of the spear on this situation.
[02:35:48.330 --> 02:35:54.330]  And there's so much more to cover with him right now.
[02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:58.330]  But, Stu Peters, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:35:58.330 --> 02:36:05.330]  Yeah, you're exactly right. This is becoming more and more obvious every day.
[02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:07.330]  These people don't just hate you.
[02:36:07.330 --> 02:36:10.330]  They have told you that they want the complete annihilation
[02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:15.330]  and the destruction of any form of constitutional republic
[02:36:15.330 --> 02:36:18.330]  or, if you want to use the stupid word, democracy.
[02:36:18.330 --> 02:36:22.330]  This is not friendly to people at Black Rock.
[02:36:22.330 --> 02:36:25.330]  This is not friendly to the one world governance,
[02:36:25.330 --> 02:36:29.330]  the less than one percenters that want the complete destruction of the nuclear family.
[02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:31.330]  They want unfettered sexual access to your children.
[02:36:31.330 --> 02:36:34.330]  They want the elite to have all of the property that they want to have.
[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:36.330]  And they will control you.
[02:36:36.330 --> 02:36:39.330]  And part of it, they are willing to murder innocent children
[02:36:39.330 --> 02:36:44.330]  who are trapped inside of their homes with no schools open,
[02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:48.330]  with no alarms or signals sounding at all.
[02:36:48.330 --> 02:36:53.330]  Keep in mind, ironically, this is the most advanced signal alarm system
[02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:55.330]  that we have in the entire country.
[02:36:55.330 --> 02:36:58.330]  This is a freaking island state.
[02:36:58.330 --> 02:37:00.330]  And so, yeah, they absolutely went in there.
[02:37:00.330 --> 02:37:03.330]  And by the way, Alex, they don't try to disguise the fact
[02:37:03.330 --> 02:37:05.330]  or even lie about the empire of lies.
[02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:06.330]  Imagine that.
[02:37:06.330 --> 02:37:09.330]  Doesn't even try to lie about the fact that they have these direct energy weapons.
[02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:10.330]  They don't try to hide it.
[02:37:10.330 --> 02:37:11.330]  They actually boast about it.
[02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:15.330]  They have articles all over the place bragging about the military technology
[02:37:15.330 --> 02:37:18.330]  that can cook children in some sand country
[02:37:18.330 --> 02:37:23.330]  after Toby Keith cheers on one of Pfizer butt slut Lindsey Graham's new wars.
[02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:25.330]  And they're doing it to us.
[02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:30.330]  So putting you in the hospital, putting you in a state of perpetual fear
[02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:33.330]  and forcing you to take your grandmother or aunt or uncle
[02:37:33.330 --> 02:37:35.330]  or little baby sister into the hospital
[02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:37.330]  because she has this little cough and a common cold.
[02:37:37.330 --> 02:37:39.330]  And the next thing you know, she's being sedated
[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:42.330]  with a cocktail of drugs that's big enough to kill a horse
[02:37:42.330 --> 02:37:44.330]  the size of Fanny Willis
[02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:47.330]  and then put you on remdesivir, poisonous drug
[02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:48.330]  that was kicked out of an African Ebola trial
[02:37:48.330 --> 02:37:51.330]  and then strap you onto a ventilator, life support,
[02:37:51.330 --> 02:37:53.330]  and kill you for cash, murder you for money
[02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:55.330]  if you don't get injected with a bioweapon
[02:37:55.330 --> 02:37:58.330]  that was unleashed by our DOD after being manufactured
[02:37:58.330 --> 02:38:00.330]  and designed right here at Fort Detrick in our country.
[02:38:00.330 --> 02:38:02.330]  If that's not enough, they have now shown you
[02:38:02.330 --> 02:38:04.330]  that they will physically go to war with you
[02:38:04.330 --> 02:38:07.330]  and nuke you and kill you for your property
[02:38:07.330 --> 02:38:09.330]  and to destroy the nuclear family
[02:38:09.330 --> 02:38:11.330]  and to destroy freedom in this country
[02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:15.330]  and to overtake this country to usher in a one world governance
[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:18.330]  so that you are 100% dependent on the agenda
[02:38:18.330 --> 02:38:20.330]  of those at BlackRock and Klaus Schwab.
[02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:22.330]  This was a military style attack.
[02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:26.330]  Our government has openly declared war on its people, period.
[02:38:27.330 --> 02:38:30.330]  Well, we saw them in California in the last 10 years
[02:38:30.330 --> 02:38:33.330]  not trim the trees around power lines in poor areas
[02:38:33.330 --> 02:38:36.330]  knowing that would cause down power lines
[02:38:36.330 --> 02:38:37.330]  so we know they did that there
[02:38:37.330 --> 02:38:39.330]  and it's a combo of all of them
[02:38:39.330 --> 02:38:41.330]  but when I look at the footage that we had reporters on
[02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:44.330]  that showed it, of 100 yards from a burned house
[02:38:44.330 --> 02:38:46.330]  the trees and grass aren't burned
[02:38:46.330 --> 02:38:48.330]  and the cars are all fried.
[02:38:49.330 --> 02:38:52.330]  That was not done by ambient heat.
[02:38:52.330 --> 02:38:55.330]  Yeah, doesn't it kind of remind you
[02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:57.330]  how eerily similar are those images
[02:38:57.330 --> 02:39:01.330]  of those ash-ridden cars as what we saw on 9-11?
[02:39:01.330 --> 02:39:04.330]  Yeah, guys, Google burnout cars
[02:39:04.330 --> 02:39:06.330]  after you show them the laser test
[02:39:06.330 --> 02:39:10.330]  and you look at it, stuff miles away from the World Trade Center
[02:39:10.330 --> 02:39:13.330]  yeah, this is one of their big jets with a laser in it
[02:39:13.330 --> 02:39:15.330]  you can fly around all day and just vaporize stuff
[02:39:15.330 --> 02:39:17.330]  the whole length of the plane is a laser
[02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:19.330]  it's a chemical laser, it can fire all day long
[02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:22.330]  and you look at 9-11, just pulverized
[02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:25.330]  just zapped cars everywhere.
[02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:29.330]  But all of the landscape, all of the beautiful landscape
[02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:32.330]  everything blue, even t-shirts
[02:39:32.330 --> 02:39:36.330]  blue t-shirts survived for those who didn't see it last hour
[02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:38.330]  try to find that guys, people weren't tuned in
[02:39:38.330 --> 02:39:41.330]  our reporter went in two houses
[02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:42.330]  burned to the ground
[02:39:42.330 --> 02:39:45.330]  and blue t-shirts are laying there totally fine.
[02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:47.330]  Totally untouched.
[02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:51.330]  Yeah, so I guess we're going to be talking to our roofer here
[02:39:51.330 --> 02:39:52.330]  about putting a blue roof
[02:39:52.330 --> 02:39:54.330]  I don't know what color Oprah would recommend
[02:39:54.330 --> 02:39:56.330]  but what shade of blue
[02:39:56.330 --> 02:39:58.330]  Well you're wearing a blue sports jacket, you're going to be fine.
[02:39:58.330 --> 02:40:02.330]  Yeah, this is the state of our country
[02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:04.330]  By the way, I've done laser tests while you've been thinking about it
[02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:07.330]  I used to joke around, we did like a Lego laser thing
[02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:09.330]  when Star Wars came out like 15 years ago again
[02:40:09.330 --> 02:40:12.330]  and Darth Vader would burn with a laser, he's black
[02:40:12.330 --> 02:40:14.330]  but if you shot something blue or white
[02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:16.330]  the laser doesn't do it.
[02:40:16.330 --> 02:40:18.330]  We've got to have a common ground
[02:40:18.330 --> 02:40:21.330]  and to talk about what you went into break
[02:40:21.330 --> 02:40:23.330]  during the last segment I was listening
[02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:25.330]  you're 100% dead on about resistance
[02:40:25.330 --> 02:40:28.330]  100% resistance against a murderous regime that wants to kill you
[02:40:28.330 --> 02:40:30.330]  they've told you that they want to kill you
[02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:32.330]  they've told you they want to bang your kids
[02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:34.330]  they're going to do it if you don't stand up and stop it
[02:40:34.330 --> 02:40:36.330]  so we have to find a common ground
[02:40:36.330 --> 02:40:38.330]  because right now we're so polarized and so divided
[02:40:38.330 --> 02:40:41.330]  as per, by the way, the very successfully run
[02:40:41.330 --> 02:40:44.330]  multiple psychological operations that are being carried out
[02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:46.330]  by our own intelligence apparatus
[02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:50.330]  which is not supposed to carry out intelligence exercises against American people
[02:40:50.330 --> 02:40:51.330]  but they absolutely are
[02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:53.330]  total lawlessness
[02:40:53.330 --> 02:40:55.330]  100% absence of the rule of law
[02:40:55.330 --> 02:40:57.330]  and so what we have to have right now is a common ground
[02:40:57.330 --> 02:40:59.330]  if people did not learn from
[02:40:59.330 --> 02:41:01.330]  scandemic 1
[02:41:01.330 --> 02:41:03.330]  this is coming back
[02:41:03.330 --> 02:41:05.330]  we warned that it would come back
[02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:07.330]  AJ's been warning it was going to come back
[02:41:07.330 --> 02:41:09.330]  we've been warning on the Stu Peters network it's going to come back
[02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:11.330]  so many other people who understand what this actually was
[02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:13.330]  have been warning that it's going to come back
[02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:15.330]  but we have this population
[02:41:15.330 --> 02:41:17.330]  of complacent and compliant
[02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:19.330]  and apathetic and weak
[02:41:19.330 --> 02:41:21.330]  and easily programmable victims
[02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:23.330]  as Americans
[02:41:23.330 --> 02:41:25.330]  in our society
[02:41:25.330 --> 02:41:27.330]  that being able to actually resist
[02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:29.330]  and what that looks like
[02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:31.330]  is going to be so heavily dependent on whether
[02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:33.330]  or not we're going to have a group of people
[02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:35.330]  who really trust what their government and their TV
[02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:37.330]  tells them to do
[02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:39.330]  or if they are going to understand
[02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:41.330]  because I think a lot of them get it, Alex
[02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:43.330]  there's no doubt that so many people
[02:41:43.330 --> 02:41:45.330]  you cannot look at what happened on January 6
[02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:47.330]  you can't look at what's happening now in Ukraine
[02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:49.330]  or what happened in Afghanistan
[02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:51.330]  or in Syria or in Iraq or in Libya
[02:41:51.330 --> 02:41:53.330]  or what's happening right now in Maui
[02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:55.330]  or what happened with the injections
[02:41:55.330 --> 02:41:57.330]  and all of these people dying suddenly
[02:41:57.330 --> 02:41:59.330]  and what happened with the military
[02:41:59.330 --> 02:42:01.330]  and Millie and the purge and transgenderism
[02:42:01.330 --> 02:42:03.330]  and the freak shows marching into your schools
[02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:05.330]  and grooming your children, nobody that is sane
[02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:07.330]  can actually step back, take a look at this
[02:42:07.330 --> 02:42:09.330]  and realize, not realize
[02:42:09.330 --> 02:42:11.330]  that they're not after us
[02:42:11.330 --> 02:42:13.330]  and so the resistance actually planning
[02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:15.330]  what that looks like
[02:42:15.330 --> 02:42:17.330]  I mean that's the steps that we need to talk about
[02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:19.330]  and let's talk about it
[02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:21.330]  let's talk about it, but you're totally right
[02:42:21.330 --> 02:42:23.330]  they couldn't do this without
[02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:25.330]  drones and robot control
[02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:27.330]  so now because all the
[02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:29.330]  heart attacks with the airline pilots and blood clots
[02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:31.330]  they're talking about going
[02:42:31.330 --> 02:42:33.330]  we're going to skip this break
[02:42:33.330 --> 02:42:35.330]  they're now talking about AI
[02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:37.330]  running all the aircraft
[02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:39.330]  and so people think, oh our military wouldn't do this to us
[02:42:39.330 --> 02:42:41.330]  they just, the biggest
[02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:43.330]  be retrofitted in hours
[02:42:43.330 --> 02:42:45.330]  to be remote controlled
[02:42:45.330 --> 02:42:47.330]  so this lets the globalists
[02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:49.330]  do this very easily
[02:42:49.330 --> 02:42:51.330]  and no one even knows because of compartmentalization
[02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:53.330]  that's why robot armies
[02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:55.330]  are so dangerous
[02:42:55.330 --> 02:42:57.330]  robot armies are extremely dangerous
[02:42:57.330 --> 02:42:59.330]  and that's what we have infesting us right now
[02:42:59.330 --> 02:43:01.330]  we've talked about the nanotechnology
[02:43:01.330 --> 02:43:03.330]  that they want to use
[02:43:03.330 --> 02:43:05.330]  Elon Musk who's revered as the savior of free speech
[02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:07.330]  wants to put a chip in your brain
[02:43:07.330 --> 02:43:09.330]  to control your thoughts, actions
[02:43:09.330 --> 02:43:11.330]  predict whether or not you're going to commit crimes
[02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:13.330]  this is exactly what you get right here
[02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:15.330]  this is what happens when the
[02:43:15.330 --> 02:43:17.330]  elite want something
[02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:19.330]  that they know that you would not willingly
[02:43:19.330 --> 02:43:21.330]  give them
[02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:23.330]  this is complete annihilation, look at those cars
[02:43:23.330 --> 02:43:25.330]  the only thing left, blue t-shirts, blue anything
[02:43:25.330 --> 02:43:27.330]  this was a targeted
[02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:29.330]  attack on Americans
[02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:31.330]  because these people who wanted
[02:43:31.330 --> 02:43:33.330]  what they had, knew that they would not willingly
[02:43:33.330 --> 02:43:35.330]  give it away
[02:43:35.330 --> 02:43:37.330]  what else won't you willingly give away?
[02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:39.330]  you won't give away autonomy, you won't give away your freedom
[02:43:39.330 --> 02:43:41.330]  you won't give away your right
[02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:43.330]  all the cars are burned but a blue car
[02:43:43.330 --> 02:43:45.330]  look
[02:43:45.330 --> 02:43:47.330]  it's a blue car not burned right there
[02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:51.330]  there it is
[02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:53.330]  you can't make it up, now I don't know if that car got there
[02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:55.330]  I could have just pulled in
[02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:57.330]  guys show the footage because I was thinking back
[02:43:57.330 --> 02:43:59.330]  like 15 years ago a new Star Wars movie came out
[02:43:59.330 --> 02:44:01.330]  go ask Rob do we shot the video
[02:44:01.330 --> 02:44:03.330]  where the studio is now
[02:44:03.330 --> 02:44:05.330]  go get our little stupid Star Wars video
[02:44:05.330 --> 02:44:07.330]  I only got like a half million views on YouTube
[02:44:07.330 --> 02:44:09.330]  but I bought a few hundred dollar
[02:44:09.330 --> 02:44:11.330]  lasers online and I said
[02:44:11.330 --> 02:44:13.330]  let's do our own Star Wars video
[02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:15.330]  so we set up all these Star Wars toys up
[02:44:15.330 --> 02:44:17.330]  and we noticed that they were white or blue
[02:44:17.330 --> 02:44:19.330]  white would burn but took a long time
[02:44:19.330 --> 02:44:21.330]  blue wouldn't burn, black or brown
[02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:23.330]  because they absorbed the laser
[02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:25.330]  would explode into flames
[02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:27.330]  and now they've got footage of
[02:44:27.330 --> 02:44:29.330]  baby blue won't burn
[02:44:29.330 --> 02:44:31.330]  but every other color burns
[02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:33.330]  just like our test, so I guess that lends credibility
[02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:35.330]  to what you're saying
[02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:37.330]  guys you showed it last hour, show that footage
[02:44:37.330 --> 02:44:39.330]  so a targeted attack from the government
[02:44:39.330 --> 02:44:41.330]  on people who want to keep their right to vote
[02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:43.330]  keep their right to have the government
[02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:45.330]  redress their grievances
[02:44:45.330 --> 02:44:47.330]  we saw what happened to that on January 6
[02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:49.330]  to take away every single individual
[02:44:49.330 --> 02:44:51.330]  liberty that you have and to take your kids
[02:44:51.330 --> 02:44:53.330]  look at this laser test
[02:44:53.330 --> 02:44:55.330]  this is what happens
[02:44:55.330 --> 02:44:57.330]  when you won't give up what they want
[02:44:57.330 --> 02:44:59.330]  and so when we're talking about
[02:44:59.330 --> 02:45:01.330]  the way to actually be
[02:45:01.330 --> 02:45:03.330]  resistant, when we're talking about
[02:45:03.330 --> 02:45:05.330]  Alex, just a few days ago
[02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:07.330]  6 million people viewed on Twitter
[02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:09.330]  I was standing in a Target parking lot
[02:45:09.330 --> 02:45:11.330]  showing two dozen spaces that have now been recreated
[02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:13.330]  where you can have contactless
[02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:15.330]  pickups and order deliveries
[02:45:15.330 --> 02:45:17.330]  in a town of 16,000 people
[02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:19.330]  where there's never more than 100 cars
[02:45:19.330 --> 02:45:21.330]  in the parking lot, what is the reason
[02:45:21.330 --> 02:45:23.330]  for that, the reason for that is because they're doing it
[02:45:23.330 --> 02:45:25.330]  corporate wide, why anybody would still shop
[02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:27.330]  at Target, I have no idea
[02:45:27.330 --> 02:45:29.330]  why anybody could sit back and look at that
[02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:31.330]  and say well no, this is just something
[02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:33.330]  and they're just repaving the parking lot
[02:45:33.330 --> 02:45:35.330]  they're catering to
[02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:37.330]  a group of people who realize
[02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:39.330]  after the unfortunate pandemic
[02:45:39.330 --> 02:45:41.330]  hit, and we lost so many millions of lives
[02:45:41.330 --> 02:45:43.330]  to COVID-19, that people
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:45.330]  realized that it's actually a whole lot more convenient
[02:45:45.330 --> 02:45:47.330]  and much more safe to be able to shop in that way
[02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:49.330]  that's not what this is
[02:45:49.330 --> 02:45:51.330]  and by the way, let me show this footage from like 15 years ago
[02:45:51.330 --> 02:45:53.330]  or whatever it was, notice
[02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:55.330]  we didn't know what was happening, we would shoot
[02:45:55.330 --> 02:45:57.330]  we should have a bunch of
[02:45:57.330 --> 02:45:59.330]  Star Wars toys and the white and blue toys
[02:45:59.330 --> 02:46:01.330]  wouldn't burn up, the dark toys would
[02:46:01.330 --> 02:46:03.330]  because they absorb it, it's very simple science
[02:46:03.330 --> 02:46:05.330]  other people are now showing this
[02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:07.330]  where baby blue won't burn
[02:46:07.330 --> 02:46:09.330]  under a laser, most lasers
[02:46:09.330 --> 02:46:11.330]  but the others will, look at this, we're shooting
[02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:13.330]  other lasers, nothing, but we shoot black
[02:46:13.330 --> 02:46:15.330]  toys, they burn up
[02:46:15.330 --> 02:46:17.330]  we shoot the white toys, they won't
[02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:19.330]  I mean, it's right there
[02:46:21.330 --> 02:46:23.330]  it was right there on Maui
[02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:25.330]  we just talked about how t-shirts
[02:46:25.330 --> 02:46:27.330]  in completely incinerated, blown away
[02:46:27.330 --> 02:46:29.330]  homes, but a blue t-shirt
[02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:31.330]  is suddenly non-flammable
[02:46:31.330 --> 02:46:33.330]  we saw
[02:46:33.330 --> 02:46:35.330]  fire rolling across pavement, when was the last time
[02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:37.330]  you saw a blacktop burning
[02:46:37.330 --> 02:46:39.330]  we saw fire out
[02:46:39.330 --> 02:46:41.330]  in the middle of the ocean
[02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:43.330]  people were standing in the ocean, I saw
[02:46:43.330 --> 02:46:45.330]  one story of a man who
[02:46:45.330 --> 02:46:47.330]  held a two year old baby because
[02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:49.330]  the baby's father was physically incapable
[02:46:49.330 --> 02:46:51.330]  of holding the baby anymore and said, would you please
[02:46:51.330 --> 02:46:53.330]  hold my baby, this guy held this baby for three
[02:46:53.330 --> 02:46:55.330]  hours while they turned around and they
[02:46:55.330 --> 02:46:57.330]  watched everything burn, nobody's coming
[02:46:57.330 --> 02:46:59.330]  for them, nobody's coming to help them
[02:46:59.330 --> 02:47:01.330]  what exactly, FEMA has been doing there
[02:47:01.330 --> 02:47:03.330]  absolutely nothing, what the coast guard
[02:47:03.330 --> 02:47:05.330]  did to help out, absolutely nothing
[02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:07.330]  the federal government isn't helping with anything
[02:47:07.330 --> 02:47:09.330]  because the federal government just perpetuated an
[02:47:09.330 --> 02:47:11.330]  actual physical style, military style
[02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:13.330]  attack on its own people
[02:47:13.330 --> 02:47:15.330]  and so
[02:47:15.330 --> 02:47:17.330]  when you have people
[02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:19.330]  I thought of this last night, I told the crew
[02:47:19.330 --> 02:47:21.330]  wait, we did a video, we wondered why
[02:47:21.330 --> 02:47:23.330]  the white and blue toys wouldn't burn
[02:47:23.330 --> 02:47:25.330]  look at it, but
[02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:27.330]  the brown toys would
[02:47:27.330 --> 02:47:29.330]  and that's it
[02:47:31.330 --> 02:47:33.330]  it's insane
[02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:37.330]  so what do you do
[02:47:37.330 --> 02:47:39.330]  with a population full of people
[02:47:39.330 --> 02:47:41.330]  where you still have three quarters of the country
[02:47:41.330 --> 02:47:43.330]  who's unwilling to accept the premise that their
[02:47:43.330 --> 02:47:45.330]  government is capable of a military style attack
[02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:47.330]  against them
[02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:49.330]  when the same government
[02:47:49.330 --> 02:47:51.330]  actually put into Fort Detrick a weapon
[02:47:51.330 --> 02:47:53.330]  of bio warfare
[02:47:53.330 --> 02:47:55.330]  when SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic sequence
[02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:57.330]  was actually made at University of North Carolina
[02:47:57.330 --> 02:47:59.330]  Chapel Hill, Ralph Baric
[02:47:59.330 --> 02:48:01.330]  these people are still walking around
[02:48:01.330 --> 02:48:03.330]  Tony Fauci is still walking around
[02:48:03.330 --> 02:48:05.330]  in retirement, enjoying himself
[02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:07.330]  after killing millions of people
[02:48:07.330 --> 02:48:09.330]  but you have these masses of people who are still willing to
[02:48:09.330 --> 02:48:11.330]  go along with this
[02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:13.330]  and are actually looking forward
[02:48:13.330 --> 02:48:15.330]  to this right here
[02:48:15.330 --> 02:48:17.330]  they're looking forward to this contactless
[02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:19.330]  shopping, they're looking forward to
[02:48:19.330 --> 02:48:21.330]  the two weeks to slow the spread
[02:48:21.330 --> 02:48:23.330]  we could just sit inside and watch Netflix
[02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:25.330]  I want to give you the floor right now
[02:48:25.330 --> 02:48:27.330]  we're going to play your target video
[02:48:27.330 --> 02:48:29.330]  because when you were on with me
[02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:31.330]  I was trying to get you on all the time
[02:48:31.330 --> 02:48:33.330]  and we got you, you thought you were coming on about your target video
[02:48:33.330 --> 02:48:35.330]  I hadn't seen it
[02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:37.330]  right after you go off the show they go
[02:48:37.330 --> 02:48:39.330]  you didn't see his video with 5 million views
[02:48:39.330 --> 02:48:41.330]  and now it's got like 20 million
[02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:43.330]  where you went to your local target
[02:48:43.330 --> 02:48:45.330]  now all over the country
[02:48:45.330 --> 02:48:47.330]  that's just a new business, no
[02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:49.330]  they're getting ready, now I have California
[02:48:49.330 --> 02:48:51.330]  admitting lockdowns are coming back
[02:48:51.330 --> 02:48:53.330]  it's all confirmed, new shots, everything
[02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:55.330]  we're going to play this clip and I'm going to give you the floor about the next COVID rollout
[02:48:55.330 --> 02:48:57.330]  and how Stu Peters
[02:48:57.330 --> 02:48:59.330]  tomorrows news today thinks how we beat it
[02:48:59.330 --> 02:49:01.330]  but here it is
[02:49:01.330 --> 02:49:03.330]  rollers, brand new construction
[02:49:03.330 --> 02:49:05.330]  at target
[02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:07.330]  what is it for?
[02:49:07.330 --> 02:49:09.330]  not one, not three, not five
[02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:11.330]  not even seven, but two dozen
[02:49:11.330 --> 02:49:13.330]  24 brand new
[02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:15.330]  drive up terminals in a town of 16,000 people
[02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:17.330]  what would be the need for that?
[02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:19.330]  I'll tell you the need for that because they're bringing it back
[02:49:19.330 --> 02:49:21.330]  they're going to bring back draconian
[02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:23.330]  lockdowns, they're going to bring back the
[02:49:23.330 --> 02:49:25.330]  torturous mask mandates in schools
[02:49:25.330 --> 02:49:27.330]  strapping your kids up with a medical device
[02:49:27.330 --> 02:49:29.330]  an oxygen inhibiting bacteria ridden
[02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:31.330]  sharia face muzzle, they're going to bring back the
[02:49:31.330 --> 02:49:33.330]  injection mandates, they're going to close down churches
[02:49:33.330 --> 02:49:35.330]  they're going to close down small businesses
[02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:37.330]  while these people stay open and the pharmacies
[02:49:37.330 --> 02:49:39.330]  expanded too, why do you think that is?
[02:49:39.330 --> 02:49:41.330]  and now California just updated this week
[02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:43.330]  their official page saying they're doing it
[02:49:43.330 --> 02:49:45.330]  so we caught them with their pants down
[02:49:45.330 --> 02:49:47.330]  thank god day one
[02:49:47.330 --> 02:49:49.330]  you helped boost our story
[02:49:49.330 --> 02:49:51.330]  two weeks ago so it went huge
[02:49:51.330 --> 02:49:53.330]  we didn't know they'd roll it out
[02:49:53.330 --> 02:49:55.330]  like that very afternoon
[02:49:55.330 --> 02:49:57.330]  but this is a big deal
[02:49:57.330 --> 02:49:59.330]  I think we've got a good chance of stopping them
[02:49:59.330 --> 02:50:01.330]  what do you think they're about to pull?
[02:50:01.330 --> 02:50:03.330]  well if you thought that
[02:50:03.330 --> 02:50:05.330]  COVID 1 was draconian
[02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:07.330]  or overreaching or unconstitutional
[02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:09.330]  or violent in nature
[02:50:09.330 --> 02:50:11.330]  or murderous in nature, what we're about to see
[02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:13.330]  is going to be the nail in the coffin
[02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:15.330]  I mean, so you see how desperate that they are
[02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:17.330]  you know, as much as we think that elections
[02:50:17.330 --> 02:50:19.330]  are fake and rigged and stolen
[02:50:19.330 --> 02:50:21.330]  we know that they are, we know that they're rigged
[02:50:21.330 --> 02:50:23.330]  we know that they're stolen, as much black pills
[02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:25.330]  as I can spit everyday about our election process
[02:50:25.330 --> 02:50:27.330]  here's what is real
[02:50:27.330 --> 02:50:29.330]  what is real is if you look at the way
[02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:31.330]  that they're targeting Donald Trump
[02:50:31.330 --> 02:50:33.330]  they're doing that because Donald Trump
[02:50:33.330 --> 02:50:35.330]  mainstreams a message, Donald Trump
[02:50:35.330 --> 02:50:37.330]  wakes up millions of people who now
[02:50:37.330 --> 02:50:39.330]  see, oh, well, the government is fake
[02:50:39.330 --> 02:50:41.330]  we don't really have a two-party representative
[02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:43.330]  system, we have a uni-party of globalists
[02:50:43.330 --> 02:50:45.330]  who are controlled by foreign
[02:50:45.330 --> 02:50:47.330]  interests and Israeli-Mossad operations
[02:50:47.330 --> 02:50:49.330]  and the central banking criminal
[02:50:49.330 --> 02:50:51.330]  Cabal and BlackRock and Vanguard
[02:50:51.330 --> 02:50:53.330]  and maybe George Soros
[02:50:53.330 --> 02:50:55.330]  and the Rothschilds
[02:50:55.330 --> 02:50:57.330]  we see this ultimate control by the
[02:50:57.330 --> 02:50:59.330]  CCP or the infiltration of our government
[02:50:59.330 --> 02:51:01.330]  at every level, and that was something that Donald
[02:51:01.330 --> 02:51:03.330]  Trump helped to mainstream
[02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:05.330]  millions of people, that's very dangerous
[02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:07.330]  that many people, hundreds of millions
[02:51:07.330 --> 02:51:09.330]  across our country, to now be
[02:51:09.330 --> 02:51:11.330]  awake or at least open to receiving the idea
[02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:13.330]  that we live under this fake illusion
[02:51:13.330 --> 02:51:15.330]  this movie of The Matrix
[02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:17.330]  which was a documentary instead of a movie
[02:51:17.330 --> 02:51:19.330]  and so when you have all these people, they have to target him
[02:51:19.330 --> 02:51:21.330]  and by extension what they're telling you is, hey, we're targeting you
[02:51:21.330 --> 02:51:23.330]  so, if you question the election
[02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:25.330]  or the veracity of it, or if you
[02:51:25.330 --> 02:51:27.330]  dispute the electors, or if you have an alternate
[02:51:27.330 --> 02:51:29.330]  slate of them, that becomes a criminal offense
[02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:31.330]  you're part of a criminal conspiracy
[02:51:31.330 --> 02:51:33.330]  if you tweet or tell people to go
[02:51:33.330 --> 02:51:35.330]  and watch election integrity hearings
[02:51:35.330 --> 02:51:37.330]  on OAN, I mean apparently that's a criminal
[02:51:37.330 --> 02:51:39.330]  conspiracy now as well, if you haven't read the indictment
[02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:41.330]  you should read the indictment, particularly the one out of Georgia
[02:51:41.330 --> 02:51:43.330]  because it's all BS
[02:51:43.330 --> 02:51:45.330]  it's beyond, they say, Trump falsely claims
[02:51:45.330 --> 02:51:47.330]  section 7, that they closed down
[02:51:47.330 --> 02:51:49.330]  the counting center in Atlanta
[02:51:49.330 --> 02:51:51.330]  and blocked the windows and kept counting
[02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:53.330]  it's all, they admit they did
[02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:55.330]  it's all on video
[02:51:55.330 --> 02:51:57.330]  that they did it
[02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:59.330]  and so, when you have
[02:51:59.330 --> 02:52:01.330]  the targeting of a man like that, by extension
[02:52:01.330 --> 02:52:03.330]  meaning that the number one enemy
[02:52:03.330 --> 02:52:05.330]  of these people is the masses
[02:52:05.330 --> 02:52:07.330]  of people who would not be okay
[02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:09.330]  with this sort of authoritarian
[02:52:09.330 --> 02:52:11.330]  totalitarian
[02:52:11.330 --> 02:52:13.330]  one world governance that's coming our way
[02:52:13.330 --> 02:52:15.330]  of course, nobody wants that
[02:52:15.330 --> 02:52:17.330]  and so all of the constructs that they have put in the way
[02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:19.330]  do you support Ukraine or do you not
[02:52:19.330 --> 02:52:21.330]  do you believe that Hunter Biden is a criminal
[02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:23.330]  or do you not, are you a racist or are you not
[02:52:23.330 --> 02:52:25.330]  are you a right wing extremist or are you a
[02:52:25.330 --> 02:52:27.330]  liberal left wing freedom lover
[02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:29.330]  you know, I mean, all of the constructs
[02:52:29.330 --> 02:52:31.330]  that they have put up in the place
[02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:33.330]  to run these psychological operations to divide
[02:52:33.330 --> 02:52:35.330]  and conquer are absolutely happening
[02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:37.330]  and so now what you have is people that are
[02:52:37.330 --> 02:52:39.330]  so set in their ways
[02:52:39.330 --> 02:52:41.330]  people that are so in love
[02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:43.330]  with the nanny state idea of
[02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:45.330]  government control to feel safe under a
[02:52:45.330 --> 02:52:47.330]  security blanket of protection that's provided by
[02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:49.330]  the government at the cost of the taxpayer
[02:52:49.330 --> 02:52:51.330]  you have literally this group
[02:52:51.330 --> 02:52:53.330]  of people who really believes
[02:52:53.330 --> 02:52:55.330]  that what Donald Trump did and by extension
[02:52:55.330 --> 02:52:57.330]  everything that we do
[02:52:57.330 --> 02:52:59.330]  by questioning the official narrative should be
[02:52:59.330 --> 02:53:01.330]  deemed a criminal offense and that means
[02:53:01.330 --> 02:53:03.330]  arresting people like Alex Jones
[02:53:03.330 --> 02:53:05.330]  not just suing you or taking you off the air
[02:53:05.330 --> 02:53:07.330]  no, that means coming after you and arresting you
[02:53:07.330 --> 02:53:09.330]  that means arresting people like me
[02:53:09.330 --> 02:53:11.330]  who want to, weird concept here
[02:53:11.330 --> 02:53:13.330]  uphold the rule of law
[02:53:13.330 --> 02:53:15.330]  and so when you go to Las Vegas
[02:53:15.330 --> 02:53:17.330]  by the way, met Owen Schroyer there and Rob
[02:53:17.330 --> 02:53:19.330]  and a bunch of other people at your network, awesome people
[02:53:19.330 --> 02:53:21.330]  when you go to an event like this in Vegas
[02:53:21.330 --> 02:53:23.330]  and you stand on a stage and you give a speech
[02:53:23.330 --> 02:53:25.330]  about extreme accountability
[02:53:25.330 --> 02:53:27.330]  which are the measures that we really need to be mainstreaming
[02:53:27.330 --> 02:53:29.330]  and talking about right now because
[02:53:29.330 --> 02:53:31.330]  we're not talking about trying Hunter Biden
[02:53:31.330 --> 02:53:33.330]  for some gun offense or tax evasion
[02:53:33.330 --> 02:53:35.330]  we're talking about trying him for what he is, a treasonous traitor
[02:53:35.330 --> 02:53:37.330]  and what does that mean
[02:53:37.330 --> 02:53:39.330]  what does that, why do we still allow
[02:53:39.330 --> 02:53:41.330]  these people to run around, why haven't there been
[02:53:41.330 --> 02:53:43.330]  hundreds of millions of people that have gathered up and said
[02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:45.330]  I don't care what political ideology you are
[02:53:45.330 --> 02:53:47.330]  this doesn't sound right for the future of my children
[02:53:47.330 --> 02:53:49.330]  and let's expand on that
[02:53:49.330 --> 02:53:51.330]  we are winning globally
[02:53:51.330 --> 02:53:53.330]  the Globalist Stone documents come out
[02:53:54.330 --> 02:53:56.330]  so imagine the Globalist
[02:53:56.330 --> 02:53:58.330]  ok, they're in control of the executive branches
[02:53:58.330 --> 02:54:00.330]  they can devalue your currency, have inflation
[02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:02.330]  they can dissolve borders
[02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:04.330]  and send in giant third world hordes
[02:54:04.330 --> 02:54:06.330]  they can promote pedophilia
[02:54:06.330 --> 02:54:08.330]  destroy the family
[02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:10.330]  they can start war with Russia
[02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:12.330]  they can use drone weapons
[02:54:12.330 --> 02:54:14.330]  with lasers
[02:54:14.330 --> 02:54:16.330]  they can not turn the power off during a hurricane
[02:54:16.330 --> 02:54:18.330]  any button they've got
[02:54:18.330 --> 02:54:20.330]  to distract us and divert us
[02:54:20.330 --> 02:54:22.330]  they're doing it
[02:54:22.330 --> 02:54:24.330]  the end of their giant bubbles coming
[02:54:24.330 --> 02:54:26.330]  and they want to bring in their new system
[02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:28.330]  of ESGs
[02:54:28.330 --> 02:54:30.330]  and social credit scores
[02:54:30.330 --> 02:54:32.330]  so that's why they're throwing
[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:34.330]  everything they've got
[02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:36.330]  in asymmetrical fifth generational warfare
[02:54:36.330 --> 02:54:38.330]  and there's no doubt
[02:54:38.330 --> 02:54:40.330]  and I'm not apologizing
[02:54:40.330 --> 02:54:42.330]  because I'm admitting when I'm wrong
[02:54:42.330 --> 02:54:44.330]  I looked at it, they didn't cut the trees
[02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:46.330]  they left the power on, they cut the water off
[02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:48.330]  very clear way to start the fire
[02:54:48.330 --> 02:54:50.330]  but it wasn't enough
[02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:53.330]  I talked to locals, still setting fires
[02:54:53.330 --> 02:54:55.330]  and they caught 79 of them in Greece
[02:54:55.330 --> 02:54:57.330]  and they catch them in California in 2000
[02:54:57.330 --> 02:54:59.330]  and the media wouldn't cover it
[02:54:59.330 --> 02:55:01.330]  we know arsonists are their front line
[02:55:01.330 --> 02:55:03.330]  not trimming the brush is their front line
[02:55:03.330 --> 02:55:05.330]  but that's only setting the stage
[02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:07.330]  then they come in
[02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:09.330]  cause I saw the footage
[02:55:09.330 --> 02:55:11.330]  and I've seen it from a bunch of reporters
[02:55:11.330 --> 02:55:13.330]  cars in the middle of green fields
[02:55:13.330 --> 02:55:15.330]  hundreds of yards from flame
[02:55:15.330 --> 02:55:17.330]  burned
[02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:19.330]  microwave lasers
[02:55:19.330 --> 02:55:21.330]  it's microwaves, period
[02:55:21.330 --> 02:55:23.330]  they did it
[02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:25.330]  and now we gotta ask who did it
[02:55:25.330 --> 02:55:27.330]  it shows how desperate they are
[02:55:27.330 --> 02:55:29.330]  and God knows, cause again
[02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:31.330]  once they convert things over to nothing but drones
[02:55:31.330 --> 02:55:33.330]  then no one even knows where it's coming from
[02:55:33.330 --> 02:55:35.330]  sorry, I'm ranting
[02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:37.330]  but man
[02:55:37.330 --> 02:55:39.330]  no, everything you said is absolutely right
[02:55:39.330 --> 02:55:41.330]  and so
[02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:43.330]  when you have them unleashing actual lasers
[02:55:43.330 --> 02:55:45.330]  on Americans and destroying their homes
[02:55:45.330 --> 02:55:47.330]  and murdering children
[02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:49.330]  I mean, that's
[02:55:49.330 --> 02:55:51.330]  that's what happened here, they murdered children
[02:55:51.330 --> 02:55:53.330]  stuck in their homes, when they're willing to do that
[02:55:53.330 --> 02:55:55.330]  and all of the other aforementioned things
[02:55:55.330 --> 02:55:57.330]  that you were talking about that they can unleash
[02:55:57.330 --> 02:55:59.330]  but they also cater to
[02:55:59.330 --> 02:56:01.330]  those that are waking up by giving them
[02:56:01.330 --> 02:56:03.330]  some sort of a reprieve
[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:05.330]  and something to believe in
[02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:07.330]  Toby Keith, we'll put a boot in your ass
[02:56:07.330 --> 02:56:09.330]  it's the American way
[02:56:09.330 --> 02:56:11.330]  let's go support the war
[02:56:11.330 --> 02:56:13.330]  you know, yeah, let's blow up that
[02:56:13.330 --> 02:56:15.330]  try that in a small
[02:56:15.330 --> 02:56:17.330]  try that in a small town
[02:56:17.330 --> 02:56:19.330]  yeah, we'll get Black Rock
[02:56:19.330 --> 02:56:21.330]  they left the power on
[02:56:21.330 --> 02:56:23.330]  try that in a small town
[02:56:23.330 --> 02:56:25.330]  yeah, they didn't turn the power off
[02:56:25.330 --> 02:56:27.330]  that's why I did it, that's when I started questioning
[02:56:27.330 --> 02:56:29.330]  well maybe I'm wrong
[02:56:29.330 --> 02:56:31.330]  Oliver Anthony, the rich men north of
[02:56:31.330 --> 02:56:33.330]  Richmond, right?
[02:56:33.330 --> 02:56:35.330]  he turns out to be a total leftist
[02:56:35.330 --> 02:56:37.330]  total leftist, total fraud, fake accent
[02:56:37.330 --> 02:56:39.330]  major psy-op, part of a deep state operation
[02:56:39.330 --> 02:56:41.330]  he's always in an old truck leaning back
[02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:43.330]  I knew he was fake
[02:56:43.330 --> 02:56:45.330]  four days ago when I saw him in a truck doing a fake accent
[02:56:45.330 --> 02:56:47.330]  yeah, I don't like you conservatives
[02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:49.330]  I'm a good old boy
[02:56:49.330 --> 02:56:51.330]  you know what has to happen
[02:56:51.330 --> 02:56:53.330]  is what has to happen
[02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:55.330]  is that when
[02:56:55.330 --> 02:56:57.330]  even a small percentage, just single millions
[02:56:57.330 --> 02:56:59.330]  of people realize
[02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:01.330]  what happened to them through COVID and at Maui
[02:57:01.330 --> 02:57:03.330]  and at 9-11 and Afghanistan
[02:57:03.330 --> 02:57:05.330]  and what's happening in Ukraine and what's happening in your children's schools
[02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:07.330]  is that they tell these people
[02:57:07.330 --> 02:57:09.330]  and they mean it when they say
[02:57:09.330 --> 02:57:11.330]  when hundreds of millions or even billions
[02:57:11.330 --> 02:57:13.330]  of those injected with the American DoD
[02:57:13.330 --> 02:57:15.330]  made bioweapon across this planet
[02:57:15.330 --> 02:57:17.330]  realize what has happened to them
[02:57:17.330 --> 02:57:19.330]  that there absolutely will be
[02:57:19.330 --> 02:57:21.330]  no safe place
[02:57:21.330 --> 02:57:23.330]  for the people who did this to hide
[02:57:23.330 --> 02:57:25.330]  and they have to mean it when they say it
[02:57:25.330 --> 02:57:27.330]  I know you gotta go

[02:58:47.330 --> 02:58:49.330]  the wicked plot against the righteous
[02:58:49.330 --> 02:58:51.330]  and gnash their teeth at them
[02:58:51.330 --> 02:58:53.330]  but the Lord laughs at the wicked
[02:58:53.330 --> 02:58:55.330]  for he knows their day is coming
[02:58:55.330 --> 02:58:57.330]  the wicked draw the sword
[02:58:57.330 --> 02:58:59.330]  and bend the bow
[02:58:59.330 --> 02:59:01.330]  to bring down the poor and needy
[02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:03.330]  slay those whose ways are upright
[02:59:03.330 --> 02:59:05.330]  but their swords will pierce their own hearts
[02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:07.330]  and their bows will be broken
[02:59:07.330 --> 02:59:09.330]  better the little that have righteousness
[02:59:09.330 --> 02:59:11.330]  than the wealth of many wicked
[02:59:11.330 --> 02:59:13.330]  for the power of the wicked will be broken
[02:59:13.330 --> 02:59:15.330]  but the Lord upholds the righteous
[02:59:15.330 --> 02:59:17.330]  the blameless spend their days
[02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:19.330]  under the Lord's care
[02:59:19.330 --> 02:59:21.330]  and their inheritance will endure forever
[02:59:21.330 --> 02:59:23.330]  in times of disaster
[02:59:23.330 --> 02:59:25.330]  they will not wither
[02:59:25.330 --> 02:59:27.330]  in days of famine they will have plenty
[02:59:27.330 --> 02:59:29.330]  but the wicked will perish
[02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:31.330]  though the Lord's enemies
[02:59:31.330 --> 02:59:33.330]  are like the flowers in the field
[02:59:33.330 --> 02:59:35.330]  they will be consumed
[02:59:35.330 --> 02:59:37.330]  and they will golf in smoke
[02:59:49.330 --> 02:59:51.330]  leading a frontal assault
[02:59:51.330 --> 02:59:53.330]  on the lies of the new world order
[02:59:53.330 --> 02:59:55.330]  it's Alex Jones
[03:00:01.330 --> 03:00:03.330]  Alex Jones
[03:00:07.330 --> 03:00:09.330]  You know there's a popular meme
[03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:11.330]  Alex Jones is always right
[03:00:11.330 --> 03:00:13.330]  or Alex Jones is right
[03:00:13.330 --> 03:00:15.330]  and that's not true
[03:00:15.330 --> 03:00:17.330]  I'm right about 95% of the time
[03:00:17.330 --> 03:00:19.330]  I'm a little too cautious sometimes
[03:00:19.330 --> 03:00:21.330]  but now that I'm a big directed energy guy
[03:00:21.330 --> 03:00:23.330]  I've studied forever, covered for 29 years on air
[03:00:23.330 --> 03:00:25.330]  but I knew the power lines fell
[03:00:25.330 --> 03:00:27.330]  I knew they cut the water off
[03:00:27.330 --> 03:00:29.330]  and I saw the burning power lines
[03:00:29.330 --> 03:00:31.330]  and that's part of it
[03:00:31.330 --> 03:00:33.330]  but I've seen the footage
[03:00:33.330 --> 03:00:35.330]  100 yards for any flame, green grass trees
[03:00:35.330 --> 03:00:37.330]  cars vaporized
[03:00:37.330 --> 03:00:39.330]  and then a blue car is sitting there fine
[03:00:39.330 --> 03:00:41.330]  and then I was like wait a minute
[03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:43.330]  I told the crew today, I said
[03:00:43.330 --> 03:00:45.330]  search engine blue bounces lasers
[03:00:45.330 --> 03:00:47.330]  and sure as hell we found it
[03:00:47.330 --> 03:00:49.330]  so Stu in the 5 minutes we've got left
[03:00:49.330 --> 03:00:51.330]  I'm on your show
[03:00:51.330 --> 03:00:53.330]  6 p.m. tomorrow
[03:00:53.330 --> 03:00:55.330]  people can find you at StuPeters.com
[03:00:55.330 --> 03:00:57.330]  Real StuPeters on Twitter
[03:00:57.330 --> 03:00:59.330]  the video you put out a few days ago
[03:00:59.330 --> 03:01:01.330]  the Chinese video
[03:01:01.330 --> 03:01:03.330]  of them landing on Mars
[03:01:03.330 --> 03:01:05.330]  it looks like bad graphics from the 1990s
[03:01:05.330 --> 03:01:07.330]  in a cheap video game
[03:01:07.330 --> 03:01:09.330]  and so yeah
[03:01:09.330 --> 03:01:11.330]  we're going to cover it all
[03:01:11.330 --> 03:01:13.330]  the government's gone full fake
[03:01:13.330 --> 03:01:15.330]  and the 4 minutes we have left
[03:01:15.330 --> 03:01:17.330]  other key points you want to add
[03:01:17.330 --> 03:01:19.330]  yeah look at this
[03:01:19.330 --> 03:01:21.330]  I mean here's the landing
[03:01:21.330 --> 03:01:23.330]  it almost looks as bad as our moon landing
[03:01:23.330 --> 03:01:25.330]  which of course we've lost the technology for
[03:01:25.330 --> 03:01:27.330]  to keep you inside of your
[03:01:27.330 --> 03:01:29.330]  virtual or digital pod
[03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:31.330]  before they put you into your physical pod
[03:01:31.330 --> 03:01:33.330]  to keep you in your virtual or digital prison camp
[03:01:33.330 --> 03:01:35.330]  or your digital
[03:01:35.330 --> 03:01:37.330]  or virtual gulag before they throw you
[03:01:37.330 --> 03:01:39.330]  into the physical hard labor prisons
[03:01:39.330 --> 03:01:41.330]  that they have for you should you decide
[03:01:41.330 --> 03:01:43.330]  this is like a 1960s bad
[03:01:43.330 --> 03:01:45.330]  B movie
[03:01:45.330 --> 03:01:47.330]  I've seen better graphics on
[03:01:47.330 --> 03:01:49.330]  games of Pacman at the
[03:01:49.330 --> 03:01:51.330]  old greasy spoon bar and grill
[03:01:51.330 --> 03:01:53.330]  when I was 9 years old
[03:01:53.330 --> 03:01:55.330]  it's horrendous to think that
[03:01:55.330 --> 03:01:57.330]  these people believe that we are this stupid
[03:01:57.330 --> 03:01:59.330]  that we'll defend this but yet
[03:01:59.330 --> 03:02:01.330]  there really is a portion of our population
[03:02:01.330 --> 03:02:03.330]  that is that stupid
[03:02:03.330 --> 03:02:05.330]  if you go right now and you search
[03:02:05.330 --> 03:02:07.330]  Stu Peters and click on the news results
[03:02:07.330 --> 03:02:09.330]  you'll see Rolling Stone and USA Today with big articles
[03:02:09.330 --> 03:02:11.330]  about how I knocked this Indian
[03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:13.330]  moon landing, well of course I did
[03:02:13.330 --> 03:02:15.330]  and then they try to legitimize it
[03:02:15.330 --> 03:02:17.330]  by calling me names, look
[03:02:17.330 --> 03:02:19.330]  here's the deal, we mentioned the direct energy weapons
[03:02:19.330 --> 03:02:21.330]  and whether it was lasers or microwaves
[03:02:21.330 --> 03:02:23.330]  frequencies
[03:02:23.330 --> 03:02:25.330]  we know that frequencies are extremely
[03:02:25.330 --> 03:02:27.330]  important, what's a recent phenomenon
[03:02:27.330 --> 03:02:29.330]  in our country and probably
[03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:31.330]  across the planet right now, magnetized
[03:02:31.330 --> 03:02:33.330]  meat, viral videos
[03:02:33.330 --> 03:02:35.330]  of people going into the supermarkets and sticking
[03:02:35.330 --> 03:02:37.330]  magnetic objects to meat
[03:02:37.330 --> 03:02:39.330]  excuse me, your beef and your pork and your chicken
[03:02:39.330 --> 03:02:41.330]  is not supposed to be magnetic
[03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:43.330]  there's no metal inside of those things until now
[03:02:43.330 --> 03:02:45.330]  people are not supposed to be able to stick
[03:02:45.330 --> 03:02:47.330]  magnetic things to their head and their foreheads
[03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:49.330]  and this isn't just in vaccinated people
[03:02:49.330 --> 03:02:51.330]  who have been inoculated with this weapon of biowarfare
[03:02:51.330 --> 03:02:53.330]  but shedding is real, Pfizer admitted
[03:02:53.330 --> 03:02:55.330]  it in their own documents, people
[03:02:55.330 --> 03:02:57.330]  who have worked their asses off to completely
[03:02:57.330 --> 03:02:59.330]  avoid being injected with this and to keep their
[03:02:59.330 --> 03:03:01.330]  children safe, people who lost their jobs
[03:03:01.330 --> 03:03:03.330]  didn't get the promotion that they wanted, people
[03:03:03.330 --> 03:03:05.330]  who were kicked out of the military and sacrificed
[03:03:05.330 --> 03:03:07.330]  everything to avoid this are now at risk
[03:03:07.330 --> 03:03:09.330]  and they are magnetized as well, why?
[03:03:09.330 --> 03:03:11.330]  Well we find among other things
[03:03:11.330 --> 03:03:13.330]  a whole lot of other things, graphene
[03:03:13.330 --> 03:03:15.330]  oxide, lipid nanoparticles
[03:03:15.330 --> 03:03:17.330]  and dangerous heavy metals
[03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:19.330]  combined with all the other poisons
[03:03:19.330 --> 03:03:21.330]  and these shits
[03:03:21.330 --> 03:03:23.330]  are existing in people's blood streams now
[03:03:23.330 --> 03:03:25.330]  and so if all of us
[03:03:25.330 --> 03:03:27.330]  are magnetic or magnetized in some way
[03:03:27.330 --> 03:03:29.330]  if you're going to the graveyard
[03:03:29.330 --> 03:03:31.330]  and you can on your bluetooth pick up frequencies
[03:03:31.330 --> 03:03:33.330]  of people who have been recently buried
[03:03:33.330 --> 03:03:35.330]  that's not normal, don't try to gaslight
[03:03:35.330 --> 03:03:37.330]  me, that's not normal, if people
[03:03:37.330 --> 03:03:39.330]  really have these heavy metals inside of them
[03:03:39.330 --> 03:03:41.330]  that can communicate with my iPhone
[03:03:41.330 --> 03:03:43.330]  or with your Samsung
[03:03:43.330 --> 03:03:45.330]  then of course they can
[03:03:45.330 --> 03:03:47.330]  communicate with microwaves and frequencies
[03:03:47.330 --> 03:03:49.330]  and or lasers, direct energy
[03:03:49.330 --> 03:03:51.330]  weapons, what about 5G
[03:03:51.330 --> 03:03:53.330]  and the implementation of 5G, why did it all
[03:03:53.330 --> 03:03:55.330]  roll out in silent in the quiet without anybody
[03:03:55.330 --> 03:03:57.330]  knowing about it during the Covid lockdown?
[03:03:57.330 --> 03:03:59.330]  We've had engineers come out years ago that they found in 5G towers in England
[03:03:59.330 --> 03:04:01.330]  confirmed transistor pointed
[03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:03.330]  directed energy particle
[03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:05.330]  beams in them to zap certain cars
[03:04:05.330 --> 03:04:07.330]  they wanted, so you drive by, you get hit
[03:04:07.330 --> 03:04:09.330]  and don't feel good, die of cancer six months later
[03:04:09.330 --> 03:04:11.330]  Yeah, and so all of a
[03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:13.330]  sudden you're going to have people walking down the street and just
[03:04:13.330 --> 03:04:15.330]  boom, unplugged from the matrix, 5G
[03:04:15.330 --> 03:04:17.330]  we got Alex Jones' number right here
[03:04:17.330 --> 03:04:19.330]  let's pull him up, boom, done
[03:04:19.330 --> 03:04:21.330]  you're gone, this is the future
[03:04:21.330 --> 03:04:23.330]  if we don't resist, I'm talking full resistance
[03:04:23.330 --> 03:04:25.330]  and full accountability, I'm not talking about
[03:04:25.330 --> 03:04:27.330]  some half hearted January 6
[03:04:27.330 --> 03:04:29.330]  and when I'm back on the show
[03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:31.330]  and we're talking about space and when you come on my show
[03:04:31.330 --> 03:04:33.330]  by the way, Alex Jones live on the Stu Peters show tomorrow
[03:04:33.330 --> 03:04:35.330]  6pm Eastern, don't miss it, stupeters.com
[03:04:35.330 --> 03:04:37.330]  we're going to talk about what real extreme
[03:04:37.330 --> 03:04:39.330]  accountability looks like and how to affect it
[03:04:39.330 --> 03:04:41.330]  I can't wait, can't wait, well brother you're right about
[03:04:41.330 --> 03:04:43.330]  the direct energy weapons, they did the powerline thing too
[03:04:43.330 --> 03:04:45.330]  we're both right, but great job
[03:04:45.330 --> 03:04:47.330]  and I mean, burned out buildings
[03:04:47.330 --> 03:04:49.330]  blue shirts just laying there
[03:04:49.330 --> 03:04:51.330]  and it's everywhere, I mean this is insane
[03:04:51.330 --> 03:04:53.330]  we'll be right back, thank you Stu Peters

[03:06:05.330 --> 03:06:07.330]  so you are obviously a person of color
[03:06:07.330 --> 03:06:09.330]  like we are, and we're supposed to not
[03:06:09.330 --> 03:06:11.330]  be Trump supporters, so what is it about Trump
[03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:13.330]  that... You know what, I'm going to tell you something right now
[03:06:13.330 --> 03:06:15.330]  I was talking to my husband about it earlier
[03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:17.330]  and when I really started educating myself
[03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:19.330]  and informing myself on Donald Trump
[03:06:19.330 --> 03:06:21.330]  one thing that I'm passionate
[03:06:21.330 --> 03:06:23.330]  about is human trafficking
[03:06:23.330 --> 03:06:25.330]  that especially of children
[03:06:25.330 --> 03:06:27.330]  and when I really started digging into it
[03:06:27.330 --> 03:06:29.330]  I saw that Trump also is a huge supporter
[03:06:29.330 --> 03:06:31.330]  he donated recently $35 million
[03:06:31.330 --> 03:06:33.330]  to support
[03:06:33.330 --> 03:06:35.330]  human traffic survivors
[03:06:35.330 --> 03:06:37.330]  that really struck a chord with my heart
[03:06:37.330 --> 03:06:39.330]  and so when I started really looking into him
[03:06:39.330 --> 03:06:41.330]  I started, I'm about action
[03:06:41.330 --> 03:06:43.330]  I'm not about words
[03:06:43.330 --> 03:06:45.330]  I like the fact that he says what's on his mind
[03:06:45.330 --> 03:06:47.330]  I like the fact that he doesn't say
[03:06:47.330 --> 03:06:49.330]  what he thinks people want to hear from him
[03:06:49.330 --> 03:06:51.330]  and to me
[03:06:51.330 --> 03:06:53.330]  I know everything that he's done for the black community
[03:06:53.330 --> 03:06:55.330]  and I stand behind him
[03:06:55.330 --> 03:06:57.330]  100%, I'm not only a Trump supporter
[03:06:57.330 --> 03:06:59.330]  I am a Trump lover
[03:06:59.330 --> 03:07:01.330]  and for the longest time I've been afraid
[03:07:01.330 --> 03:07:03.330]  to come out and say that
[03:07:03.330 --> 03:07:05.330]  because I didn't want to lose
[03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:07.330]  my blackness or my black friends or whatever
[03:07:07.330 --> 03:07:09.330]  remember what Joe Biden said
[03:07:09.330 --> 03:07:11.330]  if you vote for Trump, you ain't black
[03:07:11.330 --> 03:07:13.330]  so if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump
[03:07:13.330 --> 03:07:15.330]  then you ain't black
[03:07:15.330 --> 03:07:17.330]  that's what he said
[03:07:17.330 --> 03:07:19.330]  that's what he said
[03:07:19.330 --> 03:07:21.330]  on March 20, 2003
[03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:23.330]  the United States invaded Iraq
[03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:25.330]  exactly one year before the invasion
[03:07:25.330 --> 03:07:27.330]  Alex Jones predicted it
[03:07:27.330 --> 03:07:29.330]  now everybody's going
[03:07:29.330 --> 03:07:31.330]  wow, it really was the Iraqis
[03:07:31.330 --> 03:07:33.330]  that's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq
[03:07:33.330 --> 03:07:35.330]  what a beautiful setup
[03:08:01.330 --> 03:08:23.330]  when castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor
[03:08:23.330 --> 03:08:25.330]  there came an unforeseen darkness
[03:08:25.330 --> 03:08:27.330]  amidst this impending doom
[03:08:27.330 --> 03:08:29.330]  stood a knight called Alex Jones
[03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:31.330]  a brave and outspoken herald
[03:08:31.330 --> 03:08:33.330]  known as the Truth Sayer
[03:08:33.330 --> 03:08:35.330]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone
[03:08:35.330 --> 03:08:37.330]  in his most desperate hour
[03:08:37.330 --> 03:08:39.330]  in the battle against evil
[03:08:39.330 --> 03:08:41.330]  a radiant light descended from the heavens
[03:08:41.330 --> 03:08:43.330]  God in all his glory
[03:08:43.330 --> 03:08:45.330]  and his legion of angels stood by Alex's side
[03:08:45.330 --> 03:08:47.330]  the battle raged on
[03:08:47.330 --> 03:08:49.330]  but with every blow
[03:08:49.330 --> 03:08:51.330]  Alex Jones conviction grew stronger
[03:08:51.330 --> 03:08:53.330]  with every truth he proclaimed
[03:08:53.330 --> 03:08:55.330]  the demonic forces faltered
[03:08:55.330 --> 03:08:57.330]  when the enemy was vanquished
[03:08:57.330 --> 03:08:59.330]  Alex Jones swore a solemn oath
[03:08:59.330 --> 03:09:01.330]  that should the realm need him again
[03:09:01.330 --> 03:09:03.330]  he would return
[03:09:03.330 --> 03:09:05.330]  and now it's Alex Jones
[03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:07.330]  leading a full frontal assault
[03:09:07.330 --> 03:09:09.330]  on the Satanic New World Order

[03:09:59.330 --> 03:10:01.330]  The Communist Chinese have taken control
[03:10:01.330 --> 03:10:03.330]  of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure
[03:10:03.330 --> 03:10:05.330]  The Communist Chinese have taken control
[03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:07.330]  of Hollywood
[03:10:07.330 --> 03:10:09.330]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities
[03:10:09.330 --> 03:10:11.330]  This is all confirmed, this is not a drill
[03:10:11.330 --> 03:10:13.330]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely
[03:10:13.330 --> 03:10:15.330]  run by the Communist Chinese government
[03:10:15.330 --> 03:10:17.330]  They've officially become state run

[03:10:19.330 --> 03:10:21.330]  Google is now making the transition
[03:10:21.330 --> 03:10:23.330]  and announcing a merger
[03:10:23.330 --> 03:10:25.330]  They are now beta testing using me
[03:10:25.330 --> 03:10:27.330]  as the straw man, a demonized version
[03:10:27.330 --> 03:10:29.330]  of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening
[03:10:29.330 --> 03:10:31.330]  This is not like the other probes
[03:10:31.330 --> 03:10:33.330]  before that were meant to get you used to probes
[03:10:33.330 --> 03:10:35.330]  and censorship, thinking you would adapt
[03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:37.330]  to censorship by just putting up with it
[03:10:37.330 --> 03:10:39.330]  Now this attack is thousands
[03:10:39.330 --> 03:10:41.330]  and thousands and thousands of times
[03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:43.330]  the magnitude of all previous attacks
[03:10:43.330 --> 03:10:45.330]  This is a titrated dose
[03:10:45.330 --> 03:10:47.330]  reverse psychological warfare
[03:10:47.330 --> 03:10:49.330]  operation using adapt and overcome
[03:10:49.330 --> 03:10:51.330]  subversion paradigm manipulation
[03:10:51.330 --> 03:10:53.330]  In layman's terms
[03:10:53.330 --> 03:10:55.330]  they are manipulating the fact that we adapt
[03:10:55.330 --> 03:10:57.330]  to being oppressed. We adapt to being
[03:10:57.330 --> 03:10:59.330]  pressed with the low dosages of
[03:10:59.330 --> 03:11:01.330]  oppression. Now when the megaton
[03:11:01.330 --> 03:11:03.330]  hits us of the total takeover
[03:11:03.330 --> 03:11:05.330]  we try to adapt to the poison
[03:11:05.330 --> 03:11:07.330]  infusion instead of not knowing
[03:11:07.330 --> 03:11:09.330]  it's a lethal dose if we accept
[03:11:09.330 --> 03:11:11.330]  the dose. Total internet
[03:11:11.330 --> 03:11:13.330]  of things integration, global social

[03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:17.330]  It is the virtual reality AI
[03:11:17.330 --> 03:11:19.330]  weapon system now attacking
[03:11:19.330 --> 03:11:21.330]  the United States with traitors inside
[03:11:21.330 --> 03:11:23.330]  the major security agencies blocking
[03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:25.330]  Trump's resistance of the program
[03:11:25.330 --> 03:11:27.330]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[03:11:27.330 --> 03:11:29.330]  of the chai comm slash big tech
[03:11:29.330 --> 03:11:31.330]  banging combine emergency situation
[03:11:31.330 --> 03:11:33.330]  I have been chosen for destruction because
[03:11:33.330 --> 03:11:35.330]  I brought you this information and have been
[03:11:35.330 --> 03:11:37.330]  battering ramming it out as much as I can
[03:11:37.330 --> 03:11:39.330]  They want to double use me
[03:11:39.330 --> 03:11:41.330]  as they always do in any complex
[03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:43.330]  system of mathematical deception
[03:11:43.330 --> 03:11:45.330]  where every angle of my good
[03:11:45.330 --> 03:11:47.330]  is turned against us so they take what
[03:11:47.330 --> 03:11:49.330]  I've said, being sincere, build me
[03:11:49.330 --> 03:11:51.330]  into an insincere person in the straw
[03:11:51.330 --> 03:11:53.330]  man, a person that cares about life
[03:11:53.330 --> 03:11:55.330]  and children and is against these wars
[03:11:55.330 --> 03:11:57.330]  and so they make me a herder of children
[03:11:57.330 --> 03:11:59.330]  and then they build me into this lie
[03:11:59.330 --> 03:12:01.330]  to then set the distraction while they're actually
[03:12:01.330 --> 03:12:03.330]  censoring all of you to make a
[03:12:03.330 --> 03:12:05.330]  debate about Alex Jones
[03:12:05.330 --> 03:12:07.330]  so even if I didn't sell out to them
[03:12:07.330 --> 03:12:09.330]  they'd now use me as an archetype to
[03:12:09.330 --> 03:12:11.330]  serve them by being the
[03:12:11.330 --> 03:12:13.330]  main distraction. I have now been
[03:12:13.330 --> 03:12:15.330]  captured by the enemy in the
[03:12:15.330 --> 03:12:17.330]  transformation warfare fulcrum and is being
[03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:19.330]  used against you. Only your full understanding
[03:12:19.330 --> 03:12:21.330]  of this will break you
[03:12:21.330 --> 03:12:23.330]  free from this paradigm
[03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:25.330]  I have given you the transmission
[03:12:25.330 --> 03:12:27.330]  now break free!
[03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:31.330]  I have sworn upon the
[03:12:31.330 --> 03:12:33.330]  altar of God eternal
[03:12:33.330 --> 03:12:35.330]  hostility against every
[03:12:35.330 --> 03:12:37.330]  form of tyranny over the mind
[03:12:37.330 --> 03:12:39.330]  of man
[03:12:39.330 --> 03:12:41.330]  Thomas Jefferson
[03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:43.330]  If you are receiving this
[03:12:43.330 --> 03:12:45.330]  transmission, you are the resistance
[03:12:55.330 --> 03:12:57.330]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[03:12:57.330 --> 03:12:59.330]  in the info war and say
[03:12:59.330 --> 03:13:01.330]  I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this
[03:13:01.330 --> 03:13:03.330]  but you wanna fight? You better believe
[03:13:03.330 --> 03:13:05.330]  you got one!
[03:13:07.330 --> 03:13:09.330]  From the front lines of the information
[03:13:09.330 --> 03:13:11.330]  war, it's Alex
[03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:13.330]  Jones
[03:13:31.330 --> 03:13:33.330]  Well she called me about
[03:13:33.330 --> 03:13:35.330]  a month ago
[03:13:35.330 --> 03:13:37.330]  and she called me about three weeks ago
[03:13:37.330 --> 03:13:39.330]  and I was so busy I didn't call her back
[03:13:39.330 --> 03:13:41.330]  Medical doctor, fellow Texan, great patriot
[03:13:41.330 --> 03:13:43.330]  She said, Alex, they're bringing the
[03:13:43.330 --> 03:13:45.330]  COVID restrictions back
[03:13:45.330 --> 03:13:47.330]  And then over two weeks
[03:13:47.330 --> 03:13:49.330]  ago when I got a call from a big whistle blower
[03:13:49.330 --> 03:13:51.330]  TSA, he told me
[03:13:51.330 --> 03:13:53.330]  it was coming back and he gave me the evidence
[03:13:53.330 --> 03:13:55.330]  Now it's been announced
[03:13:55.330 --> 03:13:57.330]  And so she's here to talk about it, but
[03:13:57.330 --> 03:13:59.330]  there's a lie out there
[03:13:59.330 --> 03:14:01.330]  And I love Senator Paul
[03:14:01.330 --> 03:14:03.330]  I don't think he's lying, but he says, oh there's no threat from
[03:14:03.330 --> 03:14:05.330]  COVID, there's nothing happening, they're just
[03:14:05.330 --> 03:14:07.330]  selling this to sell the new vaccine
[03:14:07.330 --> 03:14:09.330]  Yeah, the vaccine's not the answer, but there is
[03:14:09.330 --> 03:14:11.330]  record sickness
[03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:13.330]  There is hospitals being overwhelmed
[03:14:13.330 --> 03:14:15.330]  And there's a lot of reasons it's happening
[03:14:15.330 --> 03:14:17.330]  because these vaccines have destroyed immune systems
[03:14:17.330 --> 03:14:19.330]  and most of the folks in hospitals
[03:14:19.330 --> 03:14:21.330]  have taken the shots
[03:14:21.330 --> 03:14:23.330]  But people need to get prepared, they need to get ready
[03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:25.330]  Dr. Stella Emanuel
[03:14:25.330 --> 03:14:27.330]  is an MD, a successful physician
[03:14:27.330 --> 03:14:29.330]  with an active practice in Houston
[03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:31.330]  as well as the founder of
[03:14:31.330 --> 03:14:33.330]  Firepower Ministries in Katy, Texas
[03:14:33.330 --> 03:14:35.330]  She devotes her life and resources
[03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:37.330]  to teaching believers everywhere
[03:14:37.330 --> 03:14:39.330]  to identify the sources of spiritual weakness
[03:14:39.330 --> 03:14:41.330]  deception and defeat
[03:14:41.330 --> 03:14:43.330]  to learn strategies of warfare to enable them to get
[03:14:43.330 --> 03:14:45.330]  and maintain their freedom
[03:14:45.330 --> 03:14:47.330]  Dr. StellaMD.com
[03:14:47.330 --> 03:14:49.330]  So I asked her to come back
[03:14:49.330 --> 03:14:51.330]  from South Texas to Central Texas today
[03:14:51.330 --> 03:14:53.330]  to cover
[03:14:53.330 --> 03:14:55.330]  the developments. California admits
[03:14:55.330 --> 03:14:57.330]  on their own site, we covered it the first hour
[03:14:57.330 --> 03:14:59.330]  They're bringing back
[03:14:59.330 --> 03:15:01.330]  all the COVID protocols
[03:15:01.330 --> 03:15:03.330]  Yes
[03:15:03.330 --> 03:15:05.330]  Universities
[03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:07.330]  Public schools everywhere
[03:15:07.330 --> 03:15:09.330]  Colleges are saying you got to take the shot
[03:15:09.330 --> 03:15:11.330]  They announced days ago
[03:15:11.330 --> 03:15:13.330]  what I told you from my source
[03:15:13.330 --> 03:15:15.330]  That on the 15th of September
[03:15:15.330 --> 03:15:17.330]  They're bringing out the new shot
[03:15:17.330 --> 03:15:19.330]  And that's what the border patrol and
[03:15:19.330 --> 03:15:21.330]  TSA told me
[03:15:21.330 --> 03:15:23.330]  They nailed the date because they were there
[03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:25.330]  People say, how'd you nail it?
[03:15:25.330 --> 03:15:27.330]  They tell the feds a few days before
[03:15:27.330 --> 03:15:29.330]  They tell us
[03:15:29.330 --> 03:15:31.330]  And so I think we caught them with their pants down
[03:15:31.330 --> 03:15:33.330]  We haven't seen victory yet, far from it
[03:15:33.330 --> 03:15:35.330]  But it's an example of how if we're aware
[03:15:35.330 --> 03:15:37.330]  of things, as they roll them out
[03:15:37.330 --> 03:15:39.330]  and say no up front
[03:15:39.330 --> 03:15:41.330]  It gives us tremendous power
[03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:43.330]  So Dr. Stella Emmanuel, our listeners love you
[03:15:43.330 --> 03:15:45.330]  I love you
[03:15:45.330 --> 03:15:47.330]  Your big press conferences with Trump
[03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:49.330]  and the Congress and everything
[03:15:49.330 --> 03:15:51.330]  You got targeted, but you've been
[03:15:51.330 --> 03:15:53.330]  vindicated and proven right
[03:15:53.330 --> 03:15:55.330]  So going through this now
[03:15:55.330 --> 03:15:57.330]  With what you're seeing as a doctor in Houston
[03:15:57.330 --> 03:15:59.330]  and treating patients all over the world
[03:15:59.330 --> 03:16:01.330]  And with now, you were here a week ago
[03:16:01.330 --> 03:16:03.330]  Seems like 100 years ago
[03:16:03.330 --> 03:16:05.330]  So much, they've confirmed they're
[03:16:05.330 --> 03:16:07.330]  doing it, but at the same time
[03:16:07.330 --> 03:16:09.330]  trying to deny it, what's happening?
[03:16:09.330 --> 03:16:11.330]  I sent out a tweet
[03:16:11.330 --> 03:16:13.330]  July 30th and said that
[03:16:13.330 --> 03:16:15.330]  COVID is back, I don't know why
[03:16:15.330 --> 03:16:17.330]  Because it's not supposed to be
[03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:19.330]  RNA virus is actually not supposed to be something
[03:16:19.330 --> 03:16:21.330]  Give us your Twitter, we're going to put that up
[03:16:21.330 --> 03:16:23.330]  RNA viruses are not supposed to be something
[03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:25.330]  Or viruses, they're not supposed to happen in the summer
[03:16:25.330 --> 03:16:27.330]  It's usually flu,
[03:16:27.330 --> 03:16:29.330]  RSV and other stuff
[03:16:29.330 --> 03:16:31.330]  And give us your Twitter, we're going to pull it up again
[03:16:31.330 --> 03:16:33.330]  I'm interrupting
[03:16:33.330 --> 03:16:35.330]  So I sent out a tweet
[03:16:35.330 --> 03:16:37.330]  and said COVID is back, we don't know why
[03:16:37.330 --> 03:16:39.330]  People will be prepared
[03:16:39.330 --> 03:16:41.330]  And you were the first to call me before even the whistle blower
[03:16:41.330 --> 03:16:43.330]  Yes, so when I sent it out, everybody's like
[03:16:43.330 --> 03:16:45.330]  Oh don't be fear mongering, it's not going to work
[03:16:45.330 --> 03:16:47.330]  It's not happening, I said for real
[03:16:47.330 --> 03:16:49.330]  COVID is back, we're seeing more
[03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:51.330]  patients that are sick
[03:16:51.330 --> 03:16:53.330]  It's not as bad as it was in the days of
[03:16:53.330 --> 03:16:55.330]  Delta, but we're seeing more patients that are sick
[03:16:55.330 --> 03:16:57.330]  And Alex was seeing a lot of patients
[03:16:57.330 --> 03:16:59.330]  that are vaccinated that are sick
[03:16:59.330 --> 03:17:01.330]  And our vaccinated patients, they are getting COVID
[03:17:01.330 --> 03:17:03.330]  2, 3, 4 times
[03:17:03.330 --> 03:17:05.330]  One of the number shows, I've had top scientists
[03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:07.330]  on like McCullough and others
[03:17:07.330 --> 03:17:09.330]  Mercola, Mucola, they're saying
[03:17:09.330 --> 03:17:11.330]  the numbers show almost everybody that's really sick is
[03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:13.330]  vaccinated Yes, I don't see patients
[03:17:13.330 --> 03:17:15.330]  in the hospital
[03:17:15.330 --> 03:17:17.330]  Right now, by God's grace, people are sensitive
[03:17:17.330 --> 03:17:19.330]  enough to come to us when they get sick immediately
[03:17:19.330 --> 03:17:21.330]  So we're seeing our patients
[03:17:21.330 --> 03:17:23.330]  and treating them, so we're not really dealing with
[03:17:23.330 --> 03:17:25.330]  And there's what you said right there
[03:17:25.330 --> 03:17:27.330]  I know doctors
[03:17:27.330 --> 03:17:29.330]  out there that are actually seeing patients in the hospital
[03:17:29.330 --> 03:17:31.330]  and they're seeing increase
[03:17:31.330 --> 03:17:33.330]  I've had people run to me to come get their family members
[03:17:33.330 --> 03:17:35.330]  out of the hospital, a lady came to me to get the mother
[03:17:35.330 --> 03:17:37.330]  out of the hospital, I couldn't, that is why
[03:17:37.330 --> 03:17:39.330]  I tell people to be prepared up front, don't wait till you're in the hospital
[03:17:39.330 --> 03:17:41.330]  because I can't come get you out of the hospital
[03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:43.330]  And she went to the hospital for a procedure
[03:17:43.330 --> 03:17:45.330]  got COVID, ended up getting intubated
[03:17:45.330 --> 03:17:47.330]  given her and they're severe and killed
[03:17:47.330 --> 03:17:49.330]  And Alex, the sad part is that they have
[03:17:49.330 --> 03:17:51.330]  not stopped the protocols
[03:17:51.330 --> 03:17:53.330]  in the hospitals
[03:17:53.330 --> 03:17:55.330]  After three years
[03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:57.330]  after many studies have come out to say
[03:17:57.330 --> 03:17:59.330]  Hydroxychloroquine and Evomectin works
[03:17:59.330 --> 03:18:01.330]  The protocol in the hospital is to
[03:18:01.330 --> 03:18:03.330]  bring the patient in, give them
[03:18:03.330 --> 03:18:05.330]  random severe, maybe made us alarm
[03:18:05.330 --> 03:18:07.330]  to kind of calm them down, intubate them
[03:18:07.330 --> 03:18:09.330]  and they die
[03:18:09.330 --> 03:18:11.330]  And let's talk about real world
[03:18:11.330 --> 03:18:13.330]  I got tested four days ago
[03:18:13.330 --> 03:18:15.330]  by two different testing facilities, they said
[03:18:15.330 --> 03:18:17.330]  you don't have COVID, but I'm tough
[03:18:17.330 --> 03:18:19.330]  I only get sick every five years
[03:18:19.330 --> 03:18:21.330]  I got COVID two years ago, I know what it feels like
[03:18:21.330 --> 03:18:23.330]  You were here last week, you said, hey, I think you're getting sick
[03:18:23.330 --> 03:18:25.330]  You need to go on this stuff now
[03:18:25.330 --> 03:18:27.330]  And I didn't
[03:18:27.330 --> 03:18:29.330]  But then the medicine you gave Daria, I went ahead and started
[03:18:29.330 --> 03:18:31.330]  taking it two days ago, and I'm 90% better
[03:18:31.330 --> 03:18:33.330]  The steroid inhalables
[03:18:33.330 --> 03:18:35.330]  the Evomectin, all of it
[03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:37.330]  But that's what we're hearing
[03:18:37.330 --> 03:18:39.330]  is it's not testing as COVID
[03:18:39.330 --> 03:18:41.330]  but it's COVID symptoms, what's happening?
[03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:43.330]  We've never really treated patients by testing
[03:18:43.330 --> 03:18:45.330]  because, you know, the tests, you know
[03:18:45.330 --> 03:18:47.330]  the PCR test doesn't mean anything
[03:18:47.330 --> 03:18:49.330]  They've tested papayas and they were positive
[03:18:49.330 --> 03:18:51.330]  So the PCR test doesn't mean anything
[03:18:51.330 --> 03:18:53.330]  So we don't really...
[03:18:53.330 --> 03:18:55.330]  The Tanzanian president tested it in like goats and papayas
[03:18:55.330 --> 03:18:57.330]  Yes, yeah, so we don't use testing
[03:18:57.330 --> 03:18:59.330]  to treat patients
[03:18:59.330 --> 03:19:01.330]  I tell people right now that at this time
[03:19:01.330 --> 03:19:03.330]  with what's going on right now
[03:19:03.330 --> 03:19:05.330]  we don't know what is being released
[03:19:05.330 --> 03:19:07.330]  They can call it another crazy variant
[03:19:07.330 --> 03:19:09.330]  But all I know is that when you start having these symptoms
[03:19:09.330 --> 03:19:11.330]  cold symptoms, don't play with it
[03:19:11.330 --> 03:19:13.330]  don't ignore it
[03:19:13.330 --> 03:19:15.330]  Hydroxychloroquine and Evomectin, they are very safe medications
[03:19:15.330 --> 03:19:17.330]  upfront, make sure that you are treated
[03:19:17.330 --> 03:19:19.330]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:19:19.330 --> 03:19:21.330]  They told people from Australia, the US
[03:19:21.330 --> 03:19:23.330]  don't give treatment
[03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:25.330]  send them home, but if you get treatment early
[03:19:25.330 --> 03:19:27.330]  you're fine
[03:19:27.330 --> 03:19:29.330]  COVID is treated early because the initial
[03:19:29.330 --> 03:19:31.330]  part of COVID is a viral illness
[03:19:31.330 --> 03:19:33.330]  with steroids and good support
[03:19:33.330 --> 03:19:35.330]  and maybe good immune support
[03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:37.330]  and IV fluids and you know
[03:19:37.330 --> 03:19:39.330]  and non-specific antivirals
[03:19:39.330 --> 03:19:41.330]  like Hydroxychloroquine and Evomectin
[03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:43.330]  will help, but the second part
[03:19:43.330 --> 03:19:45.330]  of the COVID disease is actually
[03:19:45.330 --> 03:19:47.330]  a more systemic disease
[03:19:47.330 --> 03:19:49.330]  that's where
[03:19:49.330 --> 03:19:51.330]  it starts shutting down your systems
[03:19:51.330 --> 03:19:53.330]  and you end up with pneumonia
[03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:55.330]  And this is just like HIV that found you, we now rolled out
[03:19:55.330 --> 03:19:57.330]  They blocked the real treatments, gave them AZT to kill them
[03:19:57.330 --> 03:19:59.330]  So it's the same story
[03:19:59.330 --> 03:20:01.330]  Because the elite always gives themselves
[03:20:01.330 --> 03:20:03.330]  a way out
[03:20:03.330 --> 03:20:05.330]  So if you wait into the second phase of
[03:20:05.330 --> 03:20:07.330]  COVID, even if you survive it
[03:20:07.330 --> 03:20:09.330]  that is when people start having
[03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:11.330]  COVID lung symptoms
[03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:13.330]  and because they've allowed
[03:20:13.330 --> 03:20:15.330]  the virus and the inflammation
[03:20:15.330 --> 03:20:17.330]  to affect a lot of their system
[03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:19.330]  they've allowed the spike button to really
[03:20:19.330 --> 03:20:21.330]  eat through their system, so that's why I tell people
[03:20:21.330 --> 03:20:23.330]  even young people will not die
[03:20:23.330 --> 03:20:25.330]  from COVID, but it's better for them to treat it
[03:20:25.330 --> 03:20:27.330]  Here's a real world take on it
[03:20:27.330 --> 03:20:29.330]  Everything you taught me and others
[03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:31.330]  three years ago
[03:20:31.330 --> 03:20:33.330]  my dad's 72 years old, smartest guy I ever knew
[03:20:33.330 --> 03:20:35.330]  got COVID, almost killed him
[03:20:35.330 --> 03:20:37.330]  and then he was getting senile, acting weird
[03:20:37.330 --> 03:20:39.330]  three, four months ago
[03:20:39.330 --> 03:20:41.330]  People said it's long COVID, I got him in to see
[03:20:41.330 --> 03:20:43.330]  my big top medical doctor
[03:20:43.330 --> 03:20:45.330]  all over Texas, he follows everything you're saying
[03:20:45.330 --> 03:20:47.330]  They put my dad on
[03:20:47.330 --> 03:20:49.330]  the very same stuff you're talking about
[03:20:49.330 --> 03:20:51.330]  and he's back to
[03:20:51.330 --> 03:20:53.330]  normal, he got better
[03:20:53.330 --> 03:20:55.330]  So this thing stays in you
[03:20:55.330 --> 03:20:57.330]  Yes, and I tell people
[03:20:57.330 --> 03:20:59.330]  that I've had COVID and I agree
[03:20:59.330 --> 03:21:01.330]  We have something that we developed for COVID lung
[03:21:01.330 --> 03:21:03.330]  because we know that
[03:21:03.330 --> 03:21:05.330]  the inflammation in the system is like
[03:21:05.330 --> 03:21:07.330]  it's a hyper metabolic
[03:21:07.330 --> 03:21:09.330]  state, so that's why we tell people
[03:21:09.330 --> 03:21:11.330]  COVID is better treated early
[03:21:11.330 --> 03:21:13.330]  and don't wait till you get to the hyper metabolic
[03:21:13.330 --> 03:21:15.330]  state that messes up
[03:21:15.330 --> 03:21:17.330]  your organs and then maybe
[03:21:17.330 --> 03:21:19.330]  Don't wait till it colonizes you
[03:21:19.330 --> 03:21:21.330]  Yes, don't wait to that state
[03:21:21.330 --> 03:21:23.330]  But for those that have been colonized, what do you do?
[03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:25.330]  If you go on our website, we have different things
[03:21:25.330 --> 03:21:27.330]  So if you have long COVID, what do you do?
[03:21:27.330 --> 03:21:29.330]  Yes, we have detox
[03:21:29.330 --> 03:21:31.330]  Long COVID means it's colonized
[03:21:31.330 --> 03:21:33.330]  Yes, we have detox
[03:21:33.330 --> 03:21:35.330]  We have something we did call
[03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:37.330]  that we help people with long COVID and everything
[03:21:37.330 --> 03:21:39.330]  and some people get relief, especially
[03:21:39.330 --> 03:21:41.330]  with brain fog and fatigue and everything
[03:21:41.330 --> 03:21:43.330]  So you've taken our COVID light
[03:21:43.330 --> 03:21:45.330]  I hope that everybody loves it
[03:21:45.330 --> 03:21:47.330]  We put together that supplement for
[03:21:47.330 --> 03:21:49.330]  COVID lung symptoms
[03:21:49.330 --> 03:21:51.330]  It has propaganda, ginseng, coq10
[03:21:51.330 --> 03:21:53.330]  It has
[03:21:53.330 --> 03:21:55.330]  resveratrol that helps with DNA
[03:21:55.330 --> 03:21:57.330]  repair
[03:21:57.330 --> 03:21:59.330]  And we're going to talk about all that next segment
[03:21:59.330 --> 03:22:01.330]  So it helps to repair you after you've gone through the system
[03:22:01.330 --> 03:22:03.330]  And we're going to spend the next 30 minutes
[03:22:03.330 --> 03:22:05.330]  Only on preparedness and getting better
[03:22:05.330 --> 03:22:07.330]  But just as a doctor, as a mother
[03:22:07.330 --> 03:22:09.330]  You've got your awesome son here right now
[03:22:09.330 --> 03:22:11.330]  As a citizen
[03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:13.330]  watching this happen, what do you think they're up to?
[03:22:15.330 --> 03:22:17.330]  Alex, I wish I could just pinpoint my hand on
[03:22:17.330 --> 03:22:19.330]  exactly what they think. I do think that
[03:22:19.330 --> 03:22:21.330]  they want to bring back COVID for two reasons
[03:22:21.330 --> 03:22:23.330]  Of course, the election is coming
[03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:25.330]  So mailing ballots would be a great idea
[03:22:25.330 --> 03:22:27.330]  if everybody's locked up in their houses
[03:22:27.330 --> 03:22:29.330]  And then the second thing they want to do
[03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:31.330]  is crash the economy
[03:22:31.330 --> 03:22:33.330]  Our nation already has their CBDC
[03:22:33.330 --> 03:22:35.330]  They want to crash the economy
[03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:37.330]  And then when people are desperate
[03:22:37.330 --> 03:22:39.330]  and don't have anywhere to go
[03:22:39.330 --> 03:22:41.330]  They will introduce universal basic income
[03:22:41.330 --> 03:22:43.330]  or send out checks
[03:22:43.330 --> 03:22:45.330]  And then they will tell you to take these checks in CBDC
[03:22:45.330 --> 03:22:47.330]  Which will start out like an app on your phone
[03:22:47.330 --> 03:22:49.330]  And will eventually be a little grain of rice
[03:22:49.330 --> 03:22:51.330]  in your skin that I believe is the mark of the beast
[03:22:51.330 --> 03:22:53.330]  So this whole thing is about crashing the economy
[03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:55.330]  And that's what California says, it's the same stuff
[03:22:55.330 --> 03:22:57.330]  Yes
[03:22:57.330 --> 03:22:59.330]  So we're working towards
[03:22:59.330 --> 03:23:01.330]  They are working towards getting
[03:23:01.330 --> 03:23:03.330]  the mark of the beast
[03:23:03.330 --> 03:23:05.330]  or what they call it, their CBDC
[03:23:05.330 --> 03:23:07.330]  into everybody's hand
[03:23:07.330 --> 03:23:09.330]  The system is there already
[03:23:09.330 --> 03:23:11.330]  They just have to crash the economy
[03:23:11.330 --> 03:23:13.330]  Then when people are suffering and there's no food
[03:23:13.330 --> 03:23:15.330]  Of course, you heard about farming
[03:23:15.330 --> 03:23:17.330]  They blame the collapse on the COVID
[03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:19.330]  Yes, they'll blame it on COVID
[03:23:19.330 --> 03:23:21.330]  They'll blame it on climate change
[03:23:21.330 --> 03:23:23.330]  You hear a lot of billionaires right now talking about universal basic income
[03:23:23.330 --> 03:23:25.330]  Oh, the fire was caused
[03:23:25.330 --> 03:23:27.330]  Oh, the virus was caused
[03:23:27.330 --> 03:23:29.330]  So at the end of the day
[03:23:29.330 --> 03:23:31.330]  They want to put
[03:23:31.330 --> 03:23:33.330]  They want a little chip under your skin
[03:23:33.330 --> 03:23:35.330]  Where it's going to have everything
[03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:37.330]  The Bible talks about it in Revelation 13 verse 16 to 18
[03:23:37.330 --> 03:23:39.330]  That nobody will be able to buy or sell without it
[03:23:39.330 --> 03:23:41.330]  They want 15 minute cities
[03:23:41.330 --> 03:23:43.330]  They want to lock off
[03:23:43.330 --> 03:23:45.330]  Because they're going to shut down the economy
[03:23:45.330 --> 03:23:47.330]  In their own words, to get control
[03:23:47.330 --> 03:23:49.330]  But they know we'll create a new economy
[03:23:49.330 --> 03:23:51.330]  A black market
[03:23:51.330 --> 03:23:53.330]  So it's all about shutting that down
[03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:55.330]  Yes, so this whole thing about COVID
[03:23:55.330 --> 03:23:57.330]  Is that the election is part of their plan
[03:23:57.330 --> 03:23:59.330]  But the bigger plan
[03:23:59.330 --> 03:24:01.330]  And it's not just happening here
[03:24:01.330 --> 03:24:03.330]  Look at what's happening in Nigeria
[03:24:03.330 --> 03:24:05.330]  They're practically destroying Nigeria's economy
[03:24:05.330 --> 03:24:07.330]  That's right, Nigeria was picked as the test
[03:24:07.330 --> 03:24:09.330]  Yes, it was picked as the test
[03:24:09.330 --> 03:24:11.330]  And I screamed and screamed to my friends in Nigeria
[03:24:11.330 --> 03:24:13.330]  I went to medical school
[03:24:13.330 --> 03:24:15.330]  They have a lot of friends there
[03:24:15.330 --> 03:24:17.330]  I screamed to them and said, get prepared
[03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:19.330]  Get food
[03:24:19.330 --> 03:24:21.330]  Start farming and everything
[03:24:21.330 --> 03:24:23.330]  You won't believe what they're doing in Nigeria, Alex
[03:24:24.330 --> 03:24:26.330]  They started a few years ago and they told Nigerians
[03:24:26.330 --> 03:24:28.330]  To come and turn in their phones
[03:24:28.330 --> 03:24:30.330]  They had to register their phones
[03:24:30.330 --> 03:24:32.330]  So all Nigerians had to register their phones
[03:24:32.330 --> 03:24:34.330]  Or else it would be cut down
[03:24:34.330 --> 03:24:36.330]  Last year, they got up about November, December
[03:24:36.330 --> 03:24:38.330]  And they said, everybody should bring in the old Naira notes
[03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:40.330]  They'll give them new Naira notes
[03:24:40.330 --> 03:24:42.330]  They swept trillions of Naira out of the system
[03:24:42.330 --> 03:24:44.330]  Because Nigeria is a place where people do business by cash
[03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:46.330]  They swept this out
[03:24:46.330 --> 03:24:48.330]  And then they refused to give people their Naira notes back
[03:24:48.330 --> 03:24:50.330]  So all parents had to now start figuring out
[03:24:50.330 --> 03:24:52.330]  How to transmit money electronically
[03:24:52.330 --> 03:24:54.330]  Again, the same globalists are running that program
[03:24:54.330 --> 03:24:56.330]  Not only that
[03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:58.330]  Even the UN admits Nigeria is the test
[03:24:58.330 --> 03:25:00.330]  So what was the Asian country
[03:25:00.330 --> 03:25:02.330]  They got to go to carbon neutral
[03:25:02.330 --> 03:25:04.330]  Five years ago, now they collapsed
[03:25:04.330 --> 03:25:06.330]  I think it was
[03:25:06.330 --> 03:25:08.330]  Sri Lanka
[03:25:08.330 --> 03:25:10.330]  Show the Sri Lanka riots
[03:25:10.330 --> 03:25:12.330]  They know exactly what you're doing
[03:25:12.330 --> 03:25:14.330]  So you know what else they did in Nigeria
[03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:16.330]  They ran an election
[03:25:16.330 --> 03:25:18.330]  And of course they installed a globalist
[03:25:18.330 --> 03:25:20.330]  The guy that won the election in Nigeria
[03:25:20.330 --> 03:25:22.330]  Installed a globalist
[03:25:22.330 --> 03:25:24.330]  The minute they installed Tinubu
[03:25:24.330 --> 03:25:26.330]  Bill Gates was back there
[03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:28.330]  Their health secretary
[03:25:28.330 --> 03:25:30.330]  Is one lady that used to work for the United Nations
[03:25:30.330 --> 03:25:32.330]  A globalist
[03:25:32.330 --> 03:25:34.330]  And now in Nigeria
[03:25:34.330 --> 03:25:36.330]  Come July 1
[03:25:36.330 --> 03:25:38.330]  They suspended the Naira
[03:25:38.330 --> 03:25:40.330]  And just said, okay, let the Naira free float
[03:25:40.330 --> 03:25:42.330]  So the Naira has lost about twice of its value
[03:25:42.330 --> 03:25:44.330]  Not only that
[03:25:44.330 --> 03:25:46.330]  They took away subsidies for gasoline
[03:25:46.330 --> 03:25:48.330]  Took away subsidies for diesel
[03:25:48.330 --> 03:25:50.330]  So that's the angrier world
[03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:52.330]  So the globalists think they're going to cut our resources off
[03:25:52.330 --> 03:25:54.330]  To make us mad
[03:25:54.330 --> 03:25:56.330]  But if we know it's them, we get mad at them
[03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:58.330]  Instead of ourselves
[03:25:58.330 --> 03:26:00.330]  How do we stop this?
[03:26:00.330 --> 03:26:02.330]  The first way that people need to do this
[03:26:02.330 --> 03:26:04.330]  Is learn to be self-sufficient
[03:26:04.330 --> 03:26:06.330]  Like I told people in Nigeria
[03:26:06.330 --> 03:26:08.330]  Start farming, get food
[03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:10.330]  Start farming and don't let these people take over
[03:26:10.330 --> 03:26:12.330]  If you start farming and you get food
[03:26:12.330 --> 03:26:14.330]  Because Nigeria has such fertile land
[03:26:14.330 --> 03:26:16.330]  But most people don't farm
[03:26:16.330 --> 03:26:18.330]  People don't comply
[03:26:18.330 --> 03:26:20.330]  I saw in a vision, Alex
[03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:22.330]  People lining up in Nigeria to go take the digital currency
[03:26:22.330 --> 03:26:24.330]  I saw people lining up in Europe to go take it
[03:26:24.330 --> 03:26:26.330]  So I know this thing is coming
[03:26:26.330 --> 03:26:28.330]  So people have to be ready
[03:26:28.330 --> 03:26:30.330]  Because they want to crush your economy
[03:26:30.330 --> 03:26:32.330]  And then when you have nowhere else to turn
[03:26:32.330 --> 03:26:34.330]  You don't have food, you don't have anything and you're suffering
[03:26:34.330 --> 03:26:36.330]  And then they will come as the savior
[03:26:36.330 --> 03:26:38.330]  And tell you, okay, you get locked up in this 15 minute city
[03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:40.330]  Look at what happened in Ohio
[03:26:40.330 --> 03:26:42.330]  They said people that were involved in that spill
[03:26:42.330 --> 03:26:44.330]  They are now telling them to move to Cincinnati
[03:26:44.330 --> 03:26:46.330]  Look at what happened in Maui
[03:26:46.330 --> 03:26:48.330]  They are trying to burn down the place that they can create
[03:26:48.330 --> 03:26:50.330]  These people are demons
[03:26:50.330 --> 03:26:52.330]  They want to destroy humanity
[03:26:52.330 --> 03:26:54.330]  And those they don't kill, they want to control
[03:26:54.330 --> 03:26:56.330]  And for those that don't get it, look at history
[03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:58.330]  If you have good times, then evil takes over
[03:26:58.330 --> 03:27:00.330]  And it happens
[03:27:00.330 --> 03:27:02.330]  This happens
[03:27:02.330 --> 03:27:04.330]  And it resets
[03:27:04.330 --> 03:27:06.330]  You know what, it resets, Alex
[03:27:06.330 --> 03:27:08.330]  People think that clouds show up
[03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:10.330]  You've all known them demons
[03:27:10.330 --> 03:27:12.330]  They think that they're going to run this great reset
[03:27:12.330 --> 03:27:14.330]  From the Bible all the way to the end of Revelation
[03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:16.330]  The great reset is going to be done by God
[03:27:16.330 --> 03:27:18.330]  God is going to come, take the church out of here
[03:27:18.330 --> 03:27:20.330]  The Rapture, destroy this system
[03:27:20.330 --> 03:27:22.330]  And remodel it
[03:27:22.330 --> 03:27:24.330]  So they know where their end is
[03:27:24.330 --> 03:27:26.330]  But right now they want to destroy as many human beings as possible
[03:27:26.330 --> 03:27:28.330]  Before God comes for them
[03:27:28.330 --> 03:27:30.330]  There will be a great reset
[03:27:30.330 --> 03:27:32.330]  It will be done by God, not by the devil
[03:27:32.330 --> 03:27:34.330]  Now you're right, so they're playing God
[03:27:34.330 --> 03:27:36.330]  Yes
[03:27:36.330 --> 03:27:38.330]  Elon Musk wants to put Neural Links in our head
[03:27:38.330 --> 03:27:40.330]  Yuval Noah says that
[03:27:40.330 --> 03:27:42.330]  They want
[03:27:42.330 --> 03:27:44.330]  Surveyors to go under our skin
[03:27:44.330 --> 03:27:46.330]  They want that human beings are hackable animals
[03:27:46.330 --> 03:27:48.330]  And they can hack the software of life
[03:27:48.330 --> 03:27:50.330]  And introduce a code in your brain
[03:27:50.330 --> 03:27:52.330]  That clouds show up, says that
[03:27:52.330 --> 03:27:54.330]  There's not going to be fair elections anymore
[03:27:54.330 --> 03:27:56.330]  Because what is the point where they can just program the elections
[03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:58.330]  You know what I'm saying
[03:27:58.330 --> 03:28:00.330]  These people are not hiding this stuff anymore
[03:28:00.330 --> 03:28:02.330]  Bill Gates says that they can kill
[03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:04.330]  10-15% of the population by good vaccines
[03:28:04.330 --> 03:28:06.330]  They are not hiding it
[03:28:06.330 --> 03:28:08.330]  That's crazy, they have a metaphysical rule
[03:28:08.330 --> 03:28:10.330]  They've got to tell us what they're going to do before they do it
[03:28:10.330 --> 03:28:12.330]  By the way, Joe Rogan just sent me a really powerful video
[03:28:12.330 --> 03:28:14.330]  He's watching right now
[03:28:14.330 --> 03:28:16.330]  I just sent a video, we're going to play that coming out of break
[03:28:16.330 --> 03:28:18.330]  That Joe Rogan just sent me dealing with Joe Biden
[03:28:18.330 --> 03:28:20.330]  I want to talk about Trump, I want to talk about the world
[03:28:20.330 --> 03:28:22.330]  I want to talk about Christ
[03:28:22.330 --> 03:28:24.330]  With everything, with Dr. Stella Emanuel
[03:28:24.330 --> 03:28:26.330]  An incredible lady
[03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:28.330]  Everybody needs to go to her website and mark it down
[03:28:28.330 --> 03:28:30.330]  For telemedicine, for great supplements
[03:28:30.330 --> 03:28:32.330]  For everything, and she's the sponsor of the show
[03:28:32.330 --> 03:28:34.330]  She's an amazing lady
[03:28:34.330 --> 03:28:36.330]  Top rated products
[03:28:36.330 --> 03:28:38.330]  For everything the globalists hit us with
[03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:40.330]  God through Mother Nature
[03:28:40.330 --> 03:28:42.330]  Has given us the answer
[03:28:42.330 --> 03:28:44.330]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil
[03:28:44.330 --> 03:28:46.330]  Full spectrum of CBD oil
[03:28:46.330 --> 03:28:48.330]  The incredible thing about CBD oil
[03:28:48.330 --> 03:28:50.330]  The incredible thing about CBD oil
[03:28:50.330 --> 03:28:52.330]  The incredible thing about CBD oil
[03:28:52.330 --> 03:28:54.330]  The incredible thing about CBD oil
[03:28:54.330 --> 03:28:56.330]  About CBD oil

[03:30:06.330 --> 03:30:08.330]  And the quality was starting to go down
[03:30:08.330 --> 03:30:10.330]  I turned out so many other producers

[03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:04.330]  It's Alex Jones
[03:33:10.330 --> 03:33:12.330]  Rallying patriots worldwide
[03:33:12.330 --> 03:33:14.330]  In defense of
[03:33:14.330 --> 03:33:16.330]  It's Alex Jones
[03:33:16.330 --> 03:33:18.330]  Alex Jones
[03:33:20.330 --> 03:33:22.330]  Joe just sent me this clip
[03:33:22.330 --> 03:33:24.330]  We should bring up what's happening with Trump right now
[03:33:24.330 --> 03:33:26.330]  With Dr. Stella Emanuel
[03:33:28.330 --> 03:33:30.330]  You serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company
[03:33:30.330 --> 03:33:32.330]  Facing serious corruption charges
[03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:34.330]  You were the vice president
[03:33:34.330 --> 03:33:36.330]  Running point on Ukraine
[03:33:36.330 --> 03:33:38.330]  The average Joe hears that
[03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:40.330]  And says that sounds fishy
[03:33:40.330 --> 03:33:42.330]  What's your understanding of what your son was doing
[03:33:42.330 --> 03:33:44.330]  For an extraordinary amount of money?
[03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:46.330]  I don't know what he was doing
[03:33:46.330 --> 03:33:48.330]  I know he was on the board
[03:33:48.330 --> 03:33:50.330]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board
[03:33:50.330 --> 03:33:52.330]  And that was it
[03:33:52.330 --> 03:33:54.330]  Well you've had a lot of time
[03:33:54.330 --> 03:33:56.330]  Isn't this something you want to get to the bottom of?
[03:33:56.330 --> 03:33:58.330]  No, because I trust my son
[03:33:58.330 --> 03:34:00.330]  But that doesn't pass the smell test
[03:34:00.330 --> 03:34:02.330]  Like when you're vice president
[03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:04.330]  Isn't there a higher standard?
[03:34:04.330 --> 03:34:06.330]  Don't you need to know what's happening with your family?
[03:34:06.330 --> 03:34:08.330]  Don't you need to put down some guardrails?
[03:34:08.330 --> 03:34:10.330]  Unless there was something that was
[03:34:10.330 --> 03:34:12.330]  There was something on his face that was wrong
[03:34:12.330 --> 03:34:14.330]  Look, if you want to talk about problems
[03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:16.330]  You know, let's talk about Trump's family
[03:34:16.330 --> 03:34:18.330]  I mean, come on
[03:34:18.330 --> 03:34:20.330]  This is
[03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:22.330]  These guys are amazing
[03:34:22.330 --> 03:34:24.330]  So you think that everything that happened
[03:34:24.330 --> 03:34:26.330]  Was kosher?
[03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:28.330]  You know there's not one single bit of evidence
[03:34:28.330 --> 03:34:30.330]  Not one little tiny bit
[03:34:30.330 --> 03:34:32.330]  To suggest anything done was wrong
[03:34:32.330 --> 03:34:34.330]  You know that
[03:34:34.330 --> 03:34:36.330]  But you keep asking me these questions
[03:34:36.330 --> 03:34:38.330]  It's okay
[03:34:38.330 --> 03:34:40.330]  You're doing what you have to do
[03:34:40.330 --> 03:34:42.330]  But I'm not worried about it
[03:34:42.330 --> 03:34:44.330]  Look, the American public knows me
[03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:46.330]  Last one on this
[03:34:46.330 --> 03:34:48.330]  So you're elected
[03:34:48.330 --> 03:34:50.330]  You're in office
[03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:52.330]  What guardrails would you have
[03:34:52.330 --> 03:34:54.330]  To be sure that your son
[03:34:54.330 --> 03:34:56.330]  Your brother Jimmy
[03:34:56.330 --> 03:34:58.330]  Doesn't do anything to trade
[03:35:00.330 --> 03:35:02.330]  That was during the campaign
[03:35:02.330 --> 03:35:04.330]  They stole the election
[03:35:04.330 --> 03:35:06.330]  Now it's all confirmed
[03:35:06.330 --> 03:35:08.330]  Chinese communist agents
[03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:10.330]  This is our guest
[03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:12.330]  Now let's talk about people getting ready
[03:35:12.330 --> 03:35:14.330]  And I can't illustrate this any easier
[03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:16.330]  Than the fact that I tested negative
[03:35:16.330 --> 03:35:18.330]  For COVID twice this week
[03:35:18.330 --> 03:35:20.330]  You were here last week when I was first starting to get sick
[03:35:20.330 --> 03:35:22.330]  I hardly ever get sick
[03:35:22.330 --> 03:35:24.330]  I know what COVID feels like
[03:35:24.330 --> 03:35:26.330]  Can't breathe
[03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:28.330]  It's a different type of deal
[03:35:28.330 --> 03:35:30.330]  I believe that I have one of these new variants
[03:35:30.330 --> 03:35:32.330]  Things that are going on
[03:35:32.330 --> 03:35:34.330]  We see the hospitals all of it
[03:35:34.330 --> 03:35:36.330]  There's definitely something going on
[03:35:36.330 --> 03:35:38.330]  What's the other one?
[03:35:38.330 --> 03:35:40.330]  And it knocked it all out
[03:35:40.330 --> 03:35:42.330]  Last week you're here like
[03:35:42.330 --> 03:35:44.330]  Let me help you
[03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:46.330]  I'm like no I'm fine
[03:35:46.330 --> 03:35:48.330]  Then a few days ago I'm like
[03:35:48.330 --> 03:35:50.330]  Give it to me instantly better
[03:35:50.330 --> 03:35:52.330]  Took it last night
[03:35:52.330 --> 03:35:54.330]  I could not do the show yesterday
[03:35:54.330 --> 03:35:56.330]  I'm like 95% better today
[03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:58.330]  This is so no brainer
[03:35:58.330 --> 03:36:00.330]  They're not going to give people this at the hospitals
[03:36:00.330 --> 03:36:02.330]  Most of them
[03:36:02.330 --> 03:36:04.330]  They're not going to tell the people
[03:36:04.330 --> 03:36:06.330]  The telemedicine system you've got
[03:36:06.330 --> 03:36:08.330]  They're ready to help people
[03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:10.330]  Not once they start getting sick
[03:36:10.330 --> 03:36:12.330]  And get sent away from the hospital
[03:36:12.330 --> 03:36:14.330]  To get sick and come back and put on a ventilator
[03:36:14.330 --> 03:36:16.330]  But to get stockpiled beforehand
[03:36:16.330 --> 03:36:18.330]  So now I'm going to ask you
[03:36:18.330 --> 03:36:20.330]  To talk about how people go to
[03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:22.330]  DrStellaMD.com

[03:36:33.330 --> 03:36:35.330]  Let's talk about the telemedicine first
[03:36:35.330 --> 03:36:37.330]  Because that's the most important part
[03:36:37.330 --> 03:36:39.330]  During Delta we were having
[03:36:39.330 --> 03:36:41.330]  We're seeing 700-800 patients a day
[03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:43.330]  Calling prescriptions to pharmacies
[03:36:43.330 --> 03:36:45.330]  Pharmacists we just cancelled the script
[03:36:45.330 --> 03:36:47.330]  And then we're going from 3-4 pharmacies
[03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:49.330]  To just get prescriptions to people
[03:36:49.330 --> 03:36:51.330]  And we're going through a lot
[03:36:51.330 --> 03:36:53.330]  In fact I think I came on Alex show
[03:36:53.330 --> 03:36:55.330]  At that time and we called and we said
[03:36:55.330 --> 03:36:57.330]  Get patients out there
[03:36:57.330 --> 03:36:59.330]  And we called
[03:36:59.330 --> 03:37:01.330]  Like I said mom and pop pharmacies
[03:37:01.330 --> 03:37:03.330]  From all over the country
[03:37:03.330 --> 03:37:05.330]  And this mom and pop pharmacies
[03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:07.330]  They came on and they joined our team
[03:37:07.330 --> 03:37:09.330]  And we created a team
[03:37:09.330 --> 03:37:11.330]  With mom and pop pharmacies all over the country
[03:37:11.330 --> 03:37:13.330]  That would ship these medications
[03:37:13.330 --> 03:37:15.330]  Directly to your house
[03:37:15.330 --> 03:37:17.330]  So what you really do is
[03:37:17.330 --> 03:37:19.330]  You go on DrStellaMD.com
[03:37:19.330 --> 03:37:21.330]  You do a telemedicine appointment
[03:37:21.330 --> 03:37:23.330]  You fill all your medical information
[03:37:23.330 --> 03:37:25.330]  We review it
[03:37:25.330 --> 03:37:27.330]  Our nurses call you
[03:37:27.330 --> 03:37:29.330]  We review all your information
[03:37:29.330 --> 03:37:31.330]  We type the medication according to your medical history
[03:37:31.330 --> 03:37:33.330]  According to your weight
[03:37:33.330 --> 03:37:35.330]  According to other medications that you're taking
[03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:37.330]  And then we ship it to you
[03:37:37.330 --> 03:37:39.330]  And then you take it and you keep it in your medicine cabinet
[03:37:39.330 --> 03:37:41.330]  We have a package we've put together called
[03:37:41.330 --> 03:37:43.330]  CoviCare Complete
[03:37:43.330 --> 03:37:45.330]  It has
[03:37:45.330 --> 03:37:47.330]  Hydroxychloroquine
[03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:49.330]  It has Ivermectin
[03:37:49.330 --> 03:37:51.330]  It has Budesonite
[03:37:51.330 --> 03:37:53.330]  And it has this cute little nebulizer that we created
[03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:55.330]  That you can actually just charge it with your power bank
[03:37:55.330 --> 03:37:57.330]  So you get the nebulizer
[03:37:57.330 --> 03:37:59.330]  It gives you Z-Pak
[03:37:59.330 --> 03:38:01.330]  And then you get the steroids that you need
[03:38:01.330 --> 03:38:03.330]  So you have everything that you need if you get sick
[03:38:03.330 --> 03:38:05.330]  And then when we give that to you
[03:38:05.330 --> 03:38:07.330]  If you get sick you can call us
[03:38:07.330 --> 03:38:09.330]  And we can direct you if you need direction
[03:38:09.330 --> 03:38:11.330]  But everything is done and given you with direction
[03:38:11.330 --> 03:38:13.330]  So you keep it in your medicine cabinet
[03:38:13.330 --> 03:38:15.330]  So that when you get sick
[03:38:15.330 --> 03:38:17.330]  By the time you get sick and you call us
[03:38:17.330 --> 03:38:19.330]  And you take three days to ship to you
[03:38:19.330 --> 03:38:21.330]  You're sick and you're scared and you're terrified
[03:38:21.330 --> 03:38:23.330]  So I tell people that please
[03:38:23.330 --> 03:38:25.330]  I am screaming from the rooftop
[03:38:25.330 --> 03:38:27.330]  Get Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin
[03:38:27.330 --> 03:38:29.330]  In your medicine cabinet right now
[03:38:29.330 --> 03:38:31.330]  Some people just get Ivermectin
[03:38:31.330 --> 03:38:33.330]  Some people just get Hydroxychloroquine
[03:38:33.330 --> 03:38:35.330]  Some people get the whole CoviCare Complete pack
[03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:37.330]  But while we can help you
[03:38:37.330 --> 03:38:39.330]  While you're still alive
[03:38:39.330 --> 03:38:41.330]  And strong and can do it
[03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:43.330]  Do it now
[03:38:43.330 --> 03:38:45.330]  Now, today
[03:38:45.330 --> 03:38:47.330]  Get in your medicine
[03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:49.330]  Before they decide to shut down
[03:38:49.330 --> 03:38:51.330]  The internet or something
[03:38:51.330 --> 03:38:53.330]  The way we work, Alex
[03:38:53.330 --> 03:38:55.330]  Everything we do is legal
[03:38:55.330 --> 03:38:57.330]  Our licensing and everything is very great
[03:38:57.330 --> 03:38:59.330]  It's very legal
[03:38:59.330 --> 03:39:01.330]  So we have to go through everything that we need
[03:39:01.330 --> 03:39:03.330]  To make sure that we're getting everything done
[03:39:03.330 --> 03:39:05.330]  For you properly
[03:39:05.330 --> 03:39:07.330]  We go through your medical record
[03:39:07.330 --> 03:39:09.330]  We take a review
[03:39:09.330 --> 03:39:11.330]  So everything is done fine
[03:39:11.330 --> 03:39:13.330]  And we can see patients
[03:39:13.330 --> 03:39:15.330]  We have doctors that can see patients in all 50 states
[03:39:15.330 --> 03:39:17.330]  And pharmacists that can ship to you in all 50 states
[03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:19.330]  So that's why I'm saying America please
[03:39:19.330 --> 03:39:21.330]  Just listen to me
[03:39:21.330 --> 03:39:23.330]  People call me all the time crying because
[03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:25.330]  Somebody's in the hospital and you don't know what to do
[03:39:25.330 --> 03:39:27.330]  People come to us when they're already too sick
[03:39:27.330 --> 03:39:29.330]  And you're coughing
[03:39:29.330 --> 03:39:31.330]  And you're going through this
[03:39:31.330 --> 03:39:33.330]  And then at the end of the day you might end up with
[03:39:33.330 --> 03:39:35.330]  Covid lung symptoms
[03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:37.330]  And we saw what Fauci and them did
[03:39:37.330 --> 03:39:39.330]  Trying to block the therapeutics
[03:39:39.330 --> 03:39:41.330]  Because they can't have the panic if we're prepared
[03:39:41.330 --> 03:39:43.330]  And God gave us the compounds
[03:39:43.330 --> 03:39:45.330]  Yes, Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin
[03:39:45.330 --> 03:39:47.330]  Have been around for years
[03:39:47.330 --> 03:39:49.330]  They are safe medications
[03:39:49.330 --> 03:39:51.330]  They are over the counter in many countries
[03:39:51.330 --> 03:39:53.330]  It's only in this country where you
[03:39:53.330 --> 03:39:55.330]  Talk about that
[03:39:55.330 --> 03:39:57.330]  I'll bring this up because you're from Africa
[03:39:57.330 --> 03:39:59.330]  6% of Africa took the shot
[03:39:59.330 --> 03:40:01.330]  That's a global UN poll
[03:40:01.330 --> 03:40:03.330]  They had the lowest Covid rate
[03:40:03.330 --> 03:40:05.330]  Of the world
[03:40:05.330 --> 03:40:07.330]  Less than 1%
[03:40:07.330 --> 03:40:09.330]  Because the Africans already knew about these drugs
[03:40:09.330 --> 03:40:11.330]  Yes, listen
[03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:13.330]  Malaria
[03:40:13.330 --> 03:40:15.330]  Most places that are malaria endemic
[03:40:15.330 --> 03:40:17.330]  Do not get Covid like that
[03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:19.330]  When I went to Wuhan, China
[03:40:19.330 --> 03:40:21.330]  I was going all over the world
[03:40:21.330 --> 03:40:23.330]  It seeded into Nigeria at the same time
[03:40:23.330 --> 03:40:25.330]  You cannot search that distance
[03:40:25.330 --> 03:40:27.330]  In the slums of Ajaigunde
[03:40:27.330 --> 03:40:29.330]  But when Covid got into Nigeria
[03:40:29.330 --> 03:40:31.330]  People were leaving Wuhan to Nigeria
[03:40:31.330 --> 03:40:33.330]  They were forced to take anti-malarias
[03:40:33.330 --> 03:40:35.330]  And it knocked the Covid out of their system
[03:40:35.330 --> 03:40:37.330]  And even when people got Covid
[03:40:37.330 --> 03:40:39.330]  Back home, Hydroxychloroquine
[03:40:39.330 --> 03:40:41.330]  Chloroquine, Camorquine, Mefloquine
[03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:43.330]  They're all over the counter
[03:40:43.330 --> 03:40:45.330]  So when people get Malaria
[03:40:45.330 --> 03:40:47.330]  It's treated for Malaria
[03:40:47.330 --> 03:40:49.330]  And when they're treated for Malaria
[03:40:49.330 --> 03:40:51.330]  It knocks out the Covid
[03:40:51.330 --> 03:40:53.330]  So it's not just Hydroxychloroquine that treats Covid
[03:40:53.330 --> 03:40:55.330]  It's most of the quinolones
[03:40:55.330 --> 03:40:57.330]  Like Mefloquine, Flavoquine, Camorquine
[03:40:57.330 --> 03:40:59.330]  They're all quinine, they all work
[03:40:59.330 --> 03:41:01.330]  Some of them have more side effects
[03:41:01.330 --> 03:41:03.330]  What do they do? What's the active thing?
[03:41:03.330 --> 03:41:05.330]  It's the quinine
[03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:07.330]  The old days, the British knew to give their sailors limes
[03:41:07.330 --> 03:41:09.330]  They wouldn't get scurvy
[03:41:09.330 --> 03:41:11.330]  And they knew to put in their gin
[03:41:11.330 --> 03:41:13.330]  The quinine
[03:41:13.330 --> 03:41:15.330]  That's how the British beat everybody
[03:41:15.330 --> 03:41:17.330]  Because nobody else had it
[03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:19.330]  Explain that to people that don't know
[03:41:19.330 --> 03:41:21.330]  You know, quinine is a little more toxic
[03:41:21.330 --> 03:41:23.330]  Than Mefloquine
[03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:25.330]  Which is a little more toxic
[03:41:25.330 --> 03:41:27.330]  But Hydroxychloroquine is
[03:41:27.330 --> 03:41:29.330]  Like one of the safest versions
[03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:31.330]  So even if you don't have access to doctors
[03:41:31.330 --> 03:41:33.330]  Go get classic
[03:41:33.330 --> 03:41:35.330]  Gentani
[03:41:35.330 --> 03:41:37.330]  Yeah, I guess
[03:41:37.330 --> 03:41:39.330]  But I can't say that
[03:41:39.330 --> 03:41:41.330]  You're a doctor, but it's the low end
[03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:43.330]  There are people that survived COVID
[03:41:43.330 --> 03:41:45.330]  Just taking, you know, tonic water
[03:41:45.330 --> 03:41:47.330]  You know, so
[03:41:47.330 --> 03:41:49.330]  But I'm just saying to people that
[03:41:49.330 --> 03:41:51.330]  This stuff, you know
[03:41:51.330 --> 03:41:53.330]  That's why you call it a tonic
[03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:55.330]  The old age doctors gave you a tonic
[03:41:55.330 --> 03:41:57.330]  What made me start using Hydroxychloroquine
[03:41:57.330 --> 03:41:59.330]  Alex, it was an article that was published
[03:41:59.330 --> 03:42:01.330]  Under Anthony Fauci
[03:42:01.330 --> 03:42:03.330]  You can go Google this
[03:42:03.330 --> 03:42:05.330]  In 2005, that said Cloroquine is a potent
[03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:07.330]  Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1
[03:42:07.330 --> 03:42:09.330]  So that is where
[03:42:09.330 --> 03:42:11.330]  Right there, what is in a tonic water
[03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:13.330]  It's Quinine
[03:42:13.330 --> 03:42:15.330]  What does Quinine do?
[03:42:15.330 --> 03:42:17.330]  Quinine comes from the back of a tree
[03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:19.330]  That is where all these
[03:42:19.330 --> 03:42:21.330]  Quinolones are made from
[03:42:21.330 --> 03:42:23.330]  They are all derivatives of Quinine
[03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:25.330]  So the British just knew what worked to keep their troops
[03:42:25.330 --> 03:42:27.330]  Operating in the jungle
[03:42:27.330 --> 03:42:29.330]  Yes, and a lot of
[03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:31.330]  Back home, people make teas out of this
[03:42:31.330 --> 03:42:33.330]  You know, sometimes they make
[03:42:33.330 --> 03:42:35.330]  If you go on our website, right now we're putting together
[03:42:35.330 --> 03:42:37.330]  What we call medicinal herbs
[03:42:37.330 --> 03:42:39.330]  Like corn grass and
[03:42:39.330 --> 03:42:41.330]  Moringa and all those things
[03:42:41.330 --> 03:42:43.330]  So they have
[03:42:43.330 --> 03:42:45.330]  When we're growing up, if you got sick
[03:42:45.330 --> 03:42:47.330]  They had like
[03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:49.330]  Boiled all these herbs
[03:42:49.330 --> 03:42:51.330]  And then they covered you with it
[03:42:51.330 --> 03:42:53.330]  And you just breathe in all these herbs
[03:42:53.330 --> 03:42:55.330]  And that was done in America
[03:42:55.330 --> 03:42:57.330]  Even back in the time of my grandmothers
[03:42:57.330 --> 03:42:59.330]  They would just cover you with herbs
[03:42:59.330 --> 03:43:01.330]  Yes, and you just boil this
[03:43:01.330 --> 03:43:03.330]  And you breathe it
[03:43:03.330 --> 03:43:05.330]  So that is why COVID didn't really sit into Africa
[03:43:05.330 --> 03:43:07.330]  When you get fevers
[03:43:07.330 --> 03:43:09.330]  Well since you're a medical doctor
[03:43:09.330 --> 03:43:11.330]  Also like a shaman, you know all this stuff
[03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:13.330]  My father
[03:43:13.330 --> 03:43:15.330]  First born of my grandmother
[03:43:15.330 --> 03:43:17.330]  Was super sickly because they kept
[03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:19.330]  Him so clean and everything
[03:43:19.330 --> 03:43:21.330]  And his black nanny
[03:43:21.330 --> 03:43:23.330]  Said you need Hindu tea
[03:43:23.330 --> 03:43:25.330]  Which I guess was boiled chicken poop
[03:43:25.330 --> 03:43:27.330]  And she gave it to him one time
[03:43:27.330 --> 03:43:29.330]  At two, he was never sick again
[03:43:29.330 --> 03:43:31.330]  And I guess that had antibodies or something in it
[03:43:31.330 --> 03:43:33.330]  Have you ever heard of that?
[03:43:34.330 --> 03:43:36.330]  I'm just saying there's a lot of secret stuff
[03:43:36.330 --> 03:43:38.330]  Yes, I know that because
[03:43:38.330 --> 03:43:40.330]  I had a meeting with one of the
[03:43:40.330 --> 03:43:42.330]  Doctors in naturopathic doctors
[03:43:42.330 --> 03:43:44.330]  Because in fact she's the one that produced
[03:43:44.330 --> 03:43:46.330]  What we call pox defense
[03:43:46.330 --> 03:43:48.330]  And pox defense, we got it from
[03:43:48.330 --> 03:43:51.330]  We found it, we actually found it on the NIH website
[03:43:51.330 --> 03:43:53.330]  During the times of small pox
[03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:55.330]  How they had this
[03:43:55.330 --> 03:43:57.330]  Plant, you know, pitcher plant
[03:43:57.330 --> 03:43:59.330]  That they used, the Indians used
[03:43:59.330 --> 03:44:01.330]  For small pox and they got healed
[03:44:02.330 --> 03:44:04.330]  That's how we put together pox defense
[03:44:04.330 --> 03:44:06.330]  This is something you can buy over the counter
[03:44:06.330 --> 03:44:08.330]  So we put these things together
[03:44:08.330 --> 03:44:10.330]  Alex, I have gone past
[03:44:10.330 --> 03:44:12.330]  Just doing medicine
[03:44:12.330 --> 03:44:14.330]  Like a doctor treating disease
[03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:16.330]  To like realizing that
[03:44:16.330 --> 03:44:18.330]  You have to get people healthy
[03:44:18.330 --> 03:44:20.330]  Like you see, I tell people right now
[03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:22.330]  One of the biggest things that you should do
[03:44:22.330 --> 03:44:24.330]  Apart from getting hydroxychloroquine
[03:44:24.330 --> 03:44:26.330]  Ever Mectin in your medicine cabinet
[03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:28.330]  Is to get vitamin C, D, zinc
[03:44:28.330 --> 03:44:30.330]  I was about to say, so what do you get
[03:44:30.330 --> 03:44:32.330]  When you're getting sick, that's telemedicine
[03:44:32.330 --> 03:44:34.330]  But what do you get to prevent it up front and be healthy?
[03:44:34.330 --> 03:44:36.330]  I would, this is, you know
[03:44:36.330 --> 03:44:38.330]  This thing called Covivites
[03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:40.330]  It has vitamin C, D, zinc and quasitin
[03:44:40.330 --> 03:44:42.330]  We have a lot of supplements
[03:44:42.330 --> 03:44:44.330]  Vitamin C, D, zinc and quasitin
[03:44:44.330 --> 03:44:46.330]  Zinc is a potent antiviral
[03:44:46.330 --> 03:44:48.330]  I tell people don't take more than
[03:44:48.330 --> 03:44:50.330]  Maybe 30 to 50 milligrams of it
[03:44:50.330 --> 03:44:52.330]  So people need to go to DrCellMD.com
[03:44:52.330 --> 03:44:54.330]  There's also a great sponsor
[03:44:54.330 --> 03:44:56.330]  And what do they get to boost their immune system
[03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:58.330]  While they're all healthy?
[03:44:59.330 --> 03:45:00.330]  We have all kinds of packages
[03:45:00.330 --> 03:45:02.330]  Like see, Covivites is a big one
[03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:04.330]  The Covita spray, this little spray
[03:45:04.330 --> 03:45:06.330]  Has quasitin, it has vitamin D
[03:45:06.330 --> 03:45:08.330]  It has neem in it
[03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:10.330]  So it helps with allergies
[03:45:10.330 --> 03:45:12.330]  I was about to say, because Dr. McColl and others have said
[03:45:12.330 --> 03:45:14.330]  In most cases, just an inhalable spray
[03:45:14.330 --> 03:45:16.330]  Stops it up front
[03:45:16.330 --> 03:45:18.330]  This spray, we went to Reawaken America
[03:45:18.330 --> 03:45:20.330]  I know how dusty Las Vegas is
[03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:22.330]  Everybody was just coughing dusty
[03:45:22.330 --> 03:45:24.330]  We just came, just sprayed it
[03:45:24.330 --> 03:45:26.330]  Within like 5 minutes, you just feel like
[03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:28.330]  It just dissolves out of your system
[03:45:28.330 --> 03:45:30.330]  So there are many medicinal things that we can do
[03:45:30.330 --> 03:45:32.330]  That is not big pharma medicine
[03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:34.330]  I'm not knocking big pharma medicine
[03:45:34.330 --> 03:45:36.330]  I'm a physician, you know what I'm saying?
[03:45:36.330 --> 03:45:38.330]  I know Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin works
[03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:40.330]  But if you can take vitamin C, D, zinc and quasitin
[03:45:40.330 --> 03:45:42.330]  Build your immunity
[03:45:42.330 --> 03:45:44.330]  Elderberry, milk, T-cell, all this stuff
[03:45:44.330 --> 03:45:46.330]  Build your immunity before you get sick
[03:45:46.330 --> 03:45:48.330]  The reason why a lot of people get colds in the winter
[03:45:48.330 --> 03:45:50.330]  Is because of low vitamin D
[03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:52.330]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:45:52.330 --> 03:45:54.330]  Vitamin C helps with colds and membranes
[03:45:54.330 --> 03:45:56.330]  Zinc is a very potent antiviral
[03:45:56.330 --> 03:45:58.330]  But zinc cannot enter into your cell
[03:45:58.330 --> 03:46:00.330]  That's where you need quasitin
[03:46:00.330 --> 03:46:02.330]  So when we put zinc and quasitin
[03:46:02.330 --> 03:46:04.330]  And vitamin D together
[03:46:04.330 --> 03:46:06.330]  You have a combination that can keep you healthy
[03:46:06.330 --> 03:46:08.330]  We have it in Covivites
[03:46:08.330 --> 03:46:10.330]  One pill, you can take it
[03:46:10.330 --> 03:46:12.330]  You have vitamin C, D, zinc and quasitin
[03:46:12.330 --> 03:46:14.330]  You can buy it over the counter
[03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:16.330]  But if you go on our website
[03:46:16.330 --> 03:46:18.330]  You can get it in Covivites
[03:46:18.330 --> 03:46:20.330]  They take it daily
[03:46:20.330 --> 03:46:22.330]  We also have NAC, N-acetylcysteine
[03:46:22.330 --> 03:46:24.330]  So we have all these things we've built
[03:46:24.330 --> 03:46:26.330]  We've spent the past three years
[03:46:26.330 --> 03:46:28.330]  Developing stuff to help people stay healthy
[03:46:28.330 --> 03:46:30.330]  And then of course, you make a telehealth appointment
[03:46:30.330 --> 03:46:32.330]  Put your medicine in your medicine cabinet
[03:46:32.330 --> 03:46:34.330]  And you know that if something crazy happens
[03:46:34.330 --> 03:46:36.330]  While you fight, you can stand
[03:46:36.330 --> 03:46:38.330]  Because I don't want people to fight
[03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:40.330]  And then they can't breathe
[03:46:40.330 --> 03:46:42.330]  Use promo code ALEX
[03:46:42.330 --> 03:46:44.330]  You get a discount
[03:46:44.330 --> 03:46:46.330]  It depends, 5% to 10% depends
[03:46:46.330 --> 03:46:48.330]  Well they're great products
[03:46:48.330 --> 03:46:50.330]  And everybody loves them here
[03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:52.330]  Politically though, watching this
[03:46:52.330 --> 03:46:54.330]  Why would they attempt another lockdown
[03:46:54.330 --> 03:46:56.330]  Which they now confirm they're doing
[03:46:56.330 --> 03:46:58.330]  Two reasons
[03:46:58.330 --> 03:47:00.330]  One, they want to do mailing ballots
[03:47:00.330 --> 03:47:02.330]  For the next election
[03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:04.330]  Number two, they want to crash the economy
[03:47:04.330 --> 03:47:06.330]  So that they can bring universal basic income
[03:47:06.330 --> 03:47:08.330]  And make us take it in CBDC
[03:47:08.330 --> 03:47:10.330]  Or the mark of the beast
[03:47:10.330 --> 03:47:12.330]  That's what's going on, period
[03:47:12.330 --> 03:47:14.330]  They want everybody digitalized by 2020
[03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:16.330]  United Nations is talking about
[03:47:16.330 --> 03:47:18.330]  A digital compact
[03:47:18.330 --> 03:47:20.330]  And they're going to use the fear of disease
[03:47:20.330 --> 03:47:22.330]  Digitalized by 2020
[03:47:22.330 --> 03:47:24.330]  Yes, so if they destroy the economy
[03:47:24.330 --> 03:47:26.330]  Do you know how many people if they say
[03:47:26.330 --> 03:47:28.330]  Great, come and get $2,000 right now
[03:47:28.330 --> 03:47:30.330]  You don't have to work
[03:47:30.330 --> 03:47:32.330]  Many people will succumb and say
[03:47:32.330 --> 03:47:34.330]  Okay God, inject it in my body
[03:47:34.330 --> 03:47:36.330]  People are already injecting into their body
[03:47:36.330 --> 03:47:38.330]  For just convenience
[03:47:38.330 --> 03:47:40.330]  And that is the bottom line
[03:47:40.330 --> 03:47:42.330]  Where this thing is going
[03:47:42.330 --> 03:47:44.330]  This thing is going to a time when
[03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:46.330]  There will be a digital dictatorship
[03:47:46.330 --> 03:47:48.330]  As the Bible says in Revelation 13, 16
[03:47:48.330 --> 03:47:50.330]  So they are working towards it
[03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:52.330]  And the only way that they will succeed
[03:47:52.330 --> 03:47:54.330]  Is if we follow them
[03:47:54.330 --> 03:47:56.330]  But if you resist, they cannot force
[03:47:56.330 --> 03:47:58.330]  Look at how much resistance
[03:47:58.330 --> 03:48:00.330]  Stop them from all the masks and lockdowns
[03:48:00.330 --> 03:48:02.330]  Look at how we exposed it two weeks ago
[03:48:02.330 --> 03:48:04.330]  So I'm going to tell the truth here
[03:48:04.330 --> 03:48:06.330]  And I thought why I haven't told these stories
[03:48:06.330 --> 03:48:08.330]  It's not because I'm ashamed of it
[03:48:08.330 --> 03:48:10.330]  But I don't want to look arrogant
[03:48:10.330 --> 03:48:12.330]  Or powerful
[03:48:12.330 --> 03:48:14.330]  And I'm serious when I say that
[03:48:14.330 --> 03:48:16.330]  I've had visions as well
[03:48:16.330 --> 03:48:18.330]  And I've had visions of the World Trade Center
[03:48:18.330 --> 03:48:20.330]  Is blowing up
[03:48:20.330 --> 03:48:22.330]  And I'm on record saying they're going to blow them up
[03:48:22.330 --> 03:48:24.330]  And they blame it on bin Laden and all that
[03:48:24.330 --> 03:48:26.330]  I say bin Laden is good, that's my vision
[03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:28.330]  And I've said it months before it happened
[03:48:28.330 --> 03:48:30.330]  It's on record
[03:48:30.330 --> 03:48:32.330]  But I've also had visions in the last four or five years
[03:48:32.330 --> 03:48:34.330]  Before the start of lockdowns
[03:48:34.330 --> 03:48:36.330]  And forced injections
[03:48:36.330 --> 03:48:38.330]  And troops on the street
[03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:40.330]  And the power going off
[03:48:40.330 --> 03:48:42.330]  And you wake up in these dreams that are incredible
[03:48:42.330 --> 03:48:44.330]  You just go take a pee and drink a cup of coffee
[03:48:44.330 --> 03:48:46.330]  You can't remember it
[03:48:46.330 --> 03:48:48.330]  Usually I record them because mine have been
[03:48:48.330 --> 03:48:50.330]  I saw it from way back
[03:48:50.330 --> 03:48:52.330]  Do you get your visions and dreams or what?
[03:48:52.330 --> 03:48:54.330]  I get them in dreams and visions
[03:48:54.330 --> 03:48:56.330]  Sometimes when I'm praying I'm in really deep prayer
[03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:58.330]  I see visions passing
[03:48:58.330 --> 03:49:00.330]  Exactly, my problem is then I can't remember them
[03:49:00.330 --> 03:49:02.330]  So how do you remember them?
[03:49:02.330 --> 03:49:04.330]  I record them, I record them on my phone
[03:49:04.330 --> 03:49:06.330]  I'm going to give you the floor right now
[03:49:06.330 --> 03:49:08.330]  You're going to host the next five minutes
[03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:10.330]  I'm not going to interrupt you
[03:49:10.330 --> 03:49:12.330]  These are gifts from God, they're real
[03:49:12.330 --> 03:49:14.330]  Folks, on my children, this is real
[03:49:14.330 --> 03:49:16.330]  Everybody has it for yourself
[03:49:16.330 --> 03:49:18.330]  The great part is the visions are increasing for everybody
[03:49:18.330 --> 03:49:20.330]  But evil people are getting satanic visions
[03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:22.330]  They're getting burned buildings down
[03:49:22.330 --> 03:49:24.330]  Rape children
[03:49:24.330 --> 03:49:26.330]  Attack things, lie
[03:49:26.330 --> 03:49:28.330]  They're getting their vision
[03:49:28.330 --> 03:49:30.330]  What vision are you getting, Dr. Stella Emmanuel?
[03:49:30.330 --> 03:49:32.330]  God is talking to people, Alex
[03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:34.330]  I remember in 2016 when the Lord showed me this whole pandemic
[03:49:34.330 --> 03:49:36.330]  I saw there was a fork
[03:49:36.330 --> 03:49:38.330]  Going all over the nation
[03:49:38.330 --> 03:49:40.330]  And people were coughing and coughing
[03:49:40.330 --> 03:49:42.330]  And just having respiratory symptoms
[03:49:42.330 --> 03:49:44.330]  And I was asking people, what do we do?
[03:49:44.330 --> 03:49:46.330]  And the Lord is like, we need to pray
[03:49:46.330 --> 03:49:48.330]  People need to cry out to God
[03:49:48.330 --> 03:49:50.330]  We've had, in 2011
[03:49:50.330 --> 03:49:52.330]  We did a 100 day prayer program
[03:49:52.330 --> 03:49:54.330]  We prayed round the clock
[03:49:54.330 --> 03:49:56.330]  And the Lord showed me that there were people among us that are not human
[03:49:56.330 --> 03:49:58.330]  People that are among us that way
[03:49:58.330 --> 03:50:00.330]  And they told me that
[03:50:00.330 --> 03:50:02.330]  That it was not their time
[03:50:02.330 --> 03:50:04.330]  And when is their time they were going to take over
[03:50:04.330 --> 03:50:06.330]  And so as you keep having this vision
[03:50:06.330 --> 03:50:08.330]  You start praying and crying out to God
[03:50:08.330 --> 03:50:10.330]  I said, God, what's going to happen to our generation?
[03:50:10.330 --> 03:50:12.330]  And right now, that is why
[03:50:12.330 --> 03:50:14.330]  When all these things started happening
[03:50:14.330 --> 03:50:16.330]  I said, oh God, these are the things that the Lord has been showing me
[03:50:16.330 --> 03:50:18.330]  But I remember in 2020 in March
[03:50:18.330 --> 03:50:20.330]  When this whole thing started
[03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:22.330]  I did a video about this, it's on my YouTube channel
[03:50:22.330 --> 03:50:24.330]  You've got my YouTube channel, it's right there
[03:50:24.330 --> 03:50:26.330]  I did it, I think it was March 15, 2020
[03:50:26.330 --> 03:50:28.330]  And when all this started
[03:50:28.330 --> 03:50:30.330]  And I went to the Lord praying, I said, God, what is going on?
[03:50:30.330 --> 03:50:32.330]  What's going on with our world?
[03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:34.330]  And I had this really strange dream
[03:50:34.330 --> 03:50:36.330]  I saw like, there was like satellites
[03:50:36.330 --> 03:50:38.330]  Or some, they were like rays
[03:50:38.330 --> 03:50:40.330]  Being released on the earth
[03:50:40.330 --> 03:50:42.330]  And these rays were hitting people
[03:50:42.330 --> 03:50:44.330]  And many people were dying
[03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:46.330]  By then, nobody had died
[03:50:46.330 --> 03:50:48.330]  And I called, I said, we should pray
[03:50:48.330 --> 03:50:50.330]  I called for a million people to get together and pray
[03:50:50.330 --> 03:50:52.330]  Because we didn't know what was going to happen
[03:50:52.330 --> 03:50:54.330]  Or what was going to come
[03:50:54.330 --> 03:50:56.330]  And I was calling, I said, people need to pray
[03:50:56.330 --> 03:50:58.330]  Because evil is coming on the world
[03:50:58.330 --> 03:51:00.330]  And this was before anybody died
[03:51:00.330 --> 03:51:02.330]  And of course, our generation right now
[03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:04.330]  And the vision that the Lord showed me
[03:51:04.330 --> 03:51:06.330]  Came to pass, you know, people died
[03:51:06.330 --> 03:51:08.330]  And I still believe that
[03:51:08.330 --> 03:51:10.330]  What I saw, this contraption
[03:51:10.330 --> 03:51:12.330]  That I saw in the heavenlies that was
[03:51:12.330 --> 03:51:14.330]  Reducing rays upon humanity
[03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:16.330]  I now think it has something to do
[03:51:16.330 --> 03:51:18.330]  Maybe 5G or some of these
[03:51:18.330 --> 03:51:20.330]  Directed weapons that are coming on the earth
[03:51:20.330 --> 03:51:22.330]  And I don't think that these globalists
[03:51:22.330 --> 03:51:24.330]  Have stopped
[03:51:24.330 --> 03:51:26.330]  I want everybody listening to me to know that
[03:51:26.330 --> 03:51:28.330]  We're like in the end times
[03:51:28.330 --> 03:51:30.330]  So you need to be prepared physically
[03:51:30.330 --> 03:51:32.330]  Why do you need to be prepared spiritually?
[03:51:32.330 --> 03:51:34.330]  They're going to release weapons
[03:51:34.330 --> 03:51:36.330]  If you read Revelation 6
[03:51:36.330 --> 03:51:38.330]  As the seals are being opened
[03:51:38.330 --> 03:51:40.330]  Seal number 1 that is opened in Revelation 6
[03:51:40.330 --> 03:51:42.330]  Verse 1 to 3
[03:51:42.330 --> 03:51:44.330]  Is actually
[03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:46.330]  The conqueror is released all over the world
[03:51:46.330 --> 03:51:48.330]  And I believe
[03:51:48.330 --> 03:51:50.330]  This seal was opened in 2020
[03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:52.330]  And the conqueror was released to conquer
[03:51:52.330 --> 03:51:54.330]  The whole world
[03:51:54.330 --> 03:51:56.330]  It was given two things
[03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:58.330]  It was given a crown
[03:51:58.330 --> 03:52:00.330]  They say a crown and a bow
[03:52:00.330 --> 03:52:02.330]  And actually
[03:52:02.330 --> 03:52:04.330]  Some versions call it a poisonous dart
[03:52:04.330 --> 03:52:06.330]  I do believe that the crown
[03:52:06.330 --> 03:52:08.330]  Is corona, corona actually means crown
[03:52:08.330 --> 03:52:10.330]  And the poisonous dart or the bow
[03:52:10.330 --> 03:52:12.330]  Was the jab
[03:52:12.330 --> 03:52:14.330]  These are the two things that the devil was given
[03:52:14.330 --> 03:52:16.330]  To conquer the whole world
[03:52:16.330 --> 03:52:18.330]  And I do believe this seal was opened in 2020
[03:52:18.330 --> 03:52:20.330]  And I want everybody to realize that
[03:52:20.330 --> 03:52:22.330]  It's the Lord Jesus that was opening the seals
[03:52:22.330 --> 03:52:24.330]  Why would the Lord open seals and release calamity on the world?
[03:52:24.330 --> 03:52:26.330]  Because our iniquity is full
[03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:28.330]  The world right now is full
[03:52:28.330 --> 03:52:30.330]  The iniquity is full
[03:52:30.330 --> 03:52:32.330]  There is a lot of depravity in the world
[03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:34.330]  And the world is due for judgment
[03:52:34.330 --> 03:52:36.330]  If God does not judge our world
[03:52:36.330 --> 03:52:38.330]  Then He has to answer to Sodom and Gomorrah
[03:52:38.330 --> 03:52:40.330]  And we that are the righteous people
[03:52:40.330 --> 03:52:42.330]  Are the ones that are holding the hands of God
[03:52:42.330 --> 03:52:44.330]  Holding the hands of judgment
[03:52:44.330 --> 03:52:46.330]  Over the nations
[03:52:46.330 --> 03:52:48.330]  That is why it's so important
[03:52:48.330 --> 03:52:50.330]  That we pray and fast
[03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:52.330]  And stand before God for our nation
[03:52:52.330 --> 03:52:54.330]  Stand before God for our families
[03:52:54.330 --> 03:52:56.330]  When an event called the rapture is going to happen
[03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:58.330]  When the Lord is going to come and take the church out
[03:52:58.330 --> 03:53:00.330]  So that they can destroy these demons
[03:53:00.330 --> 03:53:02.330]  God is going to settle this
[03:53:02.330 --> 03:53:04.330]  So you have to make sure that your life is right
[03:53:04.330 --> 03:53:06.330]  You believe in Jesus
[03:53:06.330 --> 03:53:08.330]  Your life is right with Christ
[03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:10.330]  And make sure that when the Lord comes
[03:53:10.330 --> 03:53:12.330]  He takes you out
[03:53:12.330 --> 03:53:14.330]  And then these demons will be destroyed
[03:53:14.330 --> 03:53:16.330]  After these demons are destroyed
[03:53:16.330 --> 03:53:18.330]  God is going to come back and remodel this world
[03:53:18.330 --> 03:53:20.330]  And will live happily ever after on this earth
[03:53:20.330 --> 03:53:22.330]  But between now and then
[03:53:22.330 --> 03:53:24.330]  Make a little bit of starvation
[03:53:24.330 --> 03:53:26.330]  Prepare food, stock up water
[03:53:26.330 --> 03:53:28.330]  Be prepared to stand
[03:53:28.330 --> 03:53:30.330]  Live your life right with God
[03:53:30.330 --> 03:53:32.330]  Make sure that you're taking supplements
[03:53:32.330 --> 03:53:34.330]  Make sure that you have charcoal, grill, guns and ammo
[03:53:34.330 --> 03:53:36.330]  Whatever it is that it will take
[03:53:36.330 --> 03:53:38.330]  For you to protect you and your family
[03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:40.330]  And you've done that yourself
[03:53:40.330 --> 03:53:42.330]  You've moved out of the country
[03:53:42.330 --> 03:53:44.330]  I have two ranches actually
[03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:46.330]  A personal one and the one that we use for other things
[03:53:46.330 --> 03:53:48.330]  But it's incredible
[03:53:48.330 --> 03:53:50.330]  You can see evils out in the open
[03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:52.330]  As the main move is happening
[03:53:52.330 --> 03:53:56.330]  The devil is actually just out in the open you know
[03:53:56.330 --> 03:53:58.330]  You know Alex this whole issue about
[03:53:58.330 --> 03:54:00.330]  You know hairy stinky men
[03:54:00.330 --> 03:54:02.330]  Dressed up like demons
[03:54:02.330 --> 03:54:04.330]  Dancing with their tutus in front of children
[03:54:04.330 --> 03:54:06.330]  It is not harmless
[03:54:06.330 --> 03:54:08.330]  That is how they introduce
[03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:10.330]  The satanic ritual
[03:54:10.330 --> 03:54:12.330]  Yes it's a ritual
[03:54:12.330 --> 03:54:14.330]  They introduce these demons into these children at this age
[03:54:14.330 --> 03:54:16.330]  And then by the time they are 8 or 9
[03:54:16.330 --> 03:54:18.330]  They are now dead or they don't know what they are
[03:54:18.330 --> 03:54:20.330]  Yes so they are grooming them
[03:54:20.330 --> 03:54:22.330]  Not just physically but spiritually
[03:54:22.330 --> 03:54:24.330]  Introducing demonic spirits
[03:54:24.330 --> 03:54:26.330]  And by the way they go to city councils and say we're here to groom your children
[03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:28.330]  Yes
[03:54:28.330 --> 03:54:30.330]  Coming for your children yes
[03:54:30.330 --> 03:54:32.330]  So parents have to be very careful
[03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:34.330]  Teach your children, train them
[03:54:34.330 --> 03:54:36.330]  Right now in California they want you to
[03:54:36.330 --> 03:54:38.330]  Talk about sex with minors
[03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:40.330]  You need to teach your children
[03:54:40.330 --> 03:54:42.330]  That way in an evil time
[03:54:42.330 --> 03:54:44.330]  So you don't go to school and they mock them
[03:54:44.330 --> 03:54:46.330]  Without telling you
[03:54:46.330 --> 03:54:48.330]  The teacher teach them something crazy
[03:54:48.330 --> 03:54:50.330]  In fact I would say get your children out of school
[03:54:50.330 --> 03:54:52.330]  Do home schooling
[03:54:52.330 --> 03:54:54.330]  Do home schooling yes
[03:54:54.330 --> 03:54:56.330]  Nothing matters but our souls and protecting our children
[03:54:56.330 --> 03:54:58.330]  People need to get ready with the telemedicine
[03:54:58.330 --> 03:55:00.330]  And get pre-stocked

[03:57:04.330 --> 03:57:06.330]  Be prepared, that's all I'm saying
[03:57:06.330 --> 03:57:08.330]  Be mutually prepared, if you're physically prepared
[03:57:08.330 --> 03:57:10.330]  Like I said, it is the paranoid
[03:57:10.330 --> 03:57:12.330]  That will survive in this time
[03:57:12.330 --> 03:57:14.330]  And if you're paranoid like me
[03:57:14.330 --> 03:57:16.330]  You have everything from food, from water
