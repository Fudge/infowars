[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that
[00:12.000 --> 00:23.880]  says fool me once, shame on you, it fooled me we can't get fooled again.
[00:23.880 --> 00:32.480]  In 2010 Forbes magazine accurately reported on the WHO's fraudulent response to the swine flu.
[00:32.480 --> 00:37.560]  The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe declared the false pandemic is one
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.920]  of the greatest medicine scandals of the century.
[00:40.920 --> 00:48.240]  By their own rules, a pandemic requires simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers
[00:48.240 --> 00:50.520]  of deaths and illness.
[00:50.520 --> 01:00.520]  In 11 weeks into the outbreak, only 144 people died worldwide and the WHO declared a pandemic.
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.280]  Just one month before, they changed the rules.
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.040]  You could now have a pandemic with zero deaths.
[01:08.040 --> 01:12.320]  And when questioned, they claimed the old rule never existed.
[01:12.320 --> 01:19.440]  Now there is some confusion here and I hope to clarify, having severe death has never
[01:19.440 --> 01:22.640]  been part of the WHO pandemic.
[01:22.640 --> 01:29.680]  The WHO director, Dr. Margaret Chan, then went on to push left wing politics.
[01:29.680 --> 01:35.240]  The redistribution of wealth for equity and social justice and claimed that a welfare
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.760]  state is the savior of globalism.
[01:38.760 --> 01:44.520]  Over 18 billion dollars was misallocated on this fake pandemic.
[01:44.520 --> 01:51.600]  In 2005, Dr. Peter Doshi published a paper entitled, Are U.S. Flu Death Figures More
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.200]  PR Than Science, Drawing Upon Data from the CDC.
[01:57.200 --> 02:03.920]  The CDC bundles together influenza and pneumonia and counts them together, which is strange
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.840]  because according to their own data, there are far more deaths caused by pneumonia than
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.000]  the flu.
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.920]  For example, out of the 62,000 pneumonia and influenza deaths from 2001, only 18 cases
[02:17.920 --> 02:23.680]  were lab confirmed influenza, 0.03 percent.
[02:23.680 --> 02:31.560]  From 1979 to 2002, there were an average of 58 influenza deaths per year.
[02:31.560 --> 02:39.560]  In 2004, CDC director Glenn Nowak gave a presentation wherein he called upon the media to state
[02:39.560 --> 02:46.880]  concern and alarm, predict dire outcomes, and urge influenza vaccination.
[02:46.880 --> 02:53.320]  The Flu Protection Act of 2005 required the secretary of health and human services to
[02:53.320 --> 03:00.600]  conduct public influenza awareness campaigns, preceding every flu season.
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.680]  Sales of the flu vaccine began skyrocketing, bringing in billions of dollars to the manufacturers,
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.680]  all for something that kills, on average, less than 100 people a year.
[03:13.680 --> 03:20.560]  In 2007, The New York Times published an article entitled, Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic
[03:20.560 --> 03:22.160]  That Wasn't.
[03:22.160 --> 03:29.280]  It explains how the same PCR tests being used now for COVID-19 misdiagnosed over 100 healthcare
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.560]  workers in New Hampshire and rang the bell for a whooping cough epidemic that turned
[03:34.560 --> 03:37.640]  out to just be the common cold.
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.520]  The PCR tests were never meant to detect a specific virus, and yet they are being used
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.080]  today to detect COVID-19.
[03:47.080 --> 03:54.960]  The CDC even admits that the PCR test will detect any viral infection as COVID-19, including
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.040]  the common cold.
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.960]  The current data from the CDC on COVID-19 shows the same fakery that we have seen so
[04:02.960 --> 04:04.600]  far.
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.920]  Just as the CDC falsely counted pneumonia deaths as influenza deaths in the past, they are
[04:10.920 --> 04:16.480]  now counting both pneumonia and influenza as COVID-19.
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.600]  You can see it clearly in the CDC's own data.
[04:20.600 --> 04:25.960]  Beginning in the end of March, right after the shutdown began in the US, pneumonia and
[04:25.960 --> 04:32.560]  influenza deaths dropped to zero, just as COVID deaths began to surge.
[04:32.560 --> 04:35.720]  COVID-19 is a quantifiable hoax.
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.920]  After years of unchecked big pharma fraud, we are witnessing their greatest swindle yet,
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.840]  and the amount of people wearing the mask only illustrates how effective their scam
[04:46.840 --> 04:48.340]  is.
[04:48.340 --> 04:53.480]  Will the mask wearers take the experimental vaccine for fear of what amounts to be the
[04:53.480 --> 04:55.840]  common cold?
[04:55.840 --> 05:00.400]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[05:00.400 --> 05:03.720]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert.
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.600]  As of taping this alert, we are 82 days out from the election.
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.600]  As many of you know in the last year, I've pointed out statements out of the Council
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.800]  on Foreign Relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win
[05:15.800 --> 05:16.800]  in a landslide.
[05:16.800 --> 05:22.520]  So, their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal
[05:22.520 --> 05:23.520]  it.
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.020]  Then, they are openly now war-gaining.
[05:25.020 --> 05:30.680]  This is in the New York Times, having Democrat states and cities secede from the Union, just
[05:30.680 --> 05:35.240]  like they've ignored Trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[05:35.240 --> 05:37.600]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.360]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in D.C.
[05:41.360 --> 05:48.240]  They said in another city, Pelosi has said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[05:48.240 --> 05:51.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[05:51.840 --> 05:54.040]  This is their public criminal plan.
[05:54.040 --> 05:57.560]  We should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[05:57.560 --> 06:25.880]  the office to expose his criminal activity.
[06:25.880 --> 06:31.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, August 12th, the year is 2020, we're 82 days out
[06:31.560 --> 06:32.560]  from the election.
[06:32.560 --> 06:37.080]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we come to you again with grave information.
[06:37.080 --> 06:43.840]  I'm not going to scare you, but in the belief that if you are given the information, you'll
[06:43.840 --> 06:48.120]  be able to raise the alarm, you'll be able to take action, and we'll be able to overcome
[06:48.120 --> 06:50.560]  what the establishment has now openly announced.
[06:50.560 --> 06:56.000]  We've looked at all the pieces and all the statements out of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.600]  out of the Soros Crime Syndicate, out of Hillary's mouth, out of Obama's mouth, and out of their
[07:00.600 --> 07:05.040]  Surrogate's mouths, and I've read what the Council on Foreign Relations has said and
[07:05.040 --> 07:09.520]  the Financial Times of London and the Economist owned by the Rothschilds, and I've watched
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.640]  the Defense Department briefings with the different political wonks.
[07:14.640 --> 07:19.720]  And they've been 100% clear that they plan to contest the election.
[07:19.720 --> 07:21.720]  They believe they're going to lose in a landslide.
[07:21.720 --> 07:23.640]  There's a massive political realignment.
[07:23.640 --> 07:25.840]  The censorship has only pissed people off.
[07:25.840 --> 07:30.520]  No matter how many mail-in ballots they have or how much fraud, there's about to be a giant
[07:30.520 --> 07:31.720]  landslide.
[07:31.720 --> 07:38.240]  And top analysts, top professors, top political scientists who've been dead on picking the
[07:38.240 --> 07:40.760]  last five, six elections are all unanimous.
[07:40.760 --> 07:46.160]  Trump is going to win in a huge landslide.
[07:46.160 --> 07:54.200]  And I see Limbaugh and Hannity and other talk show hosts and even folks that are here on
[07:54.200 --> 07:58.640]  InfoWars Network who are great people going, oh, look at Kamala Harris.
[07:58.640 --> 08:00.400]  She is absolutely reviled.
[08:00.400 --> 08:04.840]  She was polling at 1% when they tried to make her the frontrunner during the Democrat primaries.
[08:04.840 --> 08:08.960]  The woman has more baggage than the belly of a 747.
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.280]  Boy, I tell you, this is really hurting their progressive base.
[08:14.280 --> 08:19.120]  These are saying they're going to vote for Trump now.
[08:19.120 --> 08:23.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, they know they're going to lose.
[08:23.040 --> 08:27.600]  The strategy is to contest the election and have a woman they can claim as part black
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.680]  so that any criticism of her they can say is racist.
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.000]  And so they can then stir up civil war and race war in this country that they've already
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.680]  primed and ignited.
[08:40.680 --> 08:44.240]  And then they're going to have all the blue states secede claiming, oh, we're going with
[08:44.240 --> 08:49.720]  the popular vote against the electoral college, and then they're going to call the military
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.960]  by holding the country hostage and the stock market hostage to remove President Trump.
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.400]  And Nancy Pelosi said this a month ago.
[08:59.400 --> 09:02.000]  It was in the documents a year ago.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.160]  You could see the preparation.
[09:03.160 --> 09:09.480]  I said during the Democratic primaries last year that it would be Kamala Harris because
[09:09.480 --> 09:16.240]  Jeff Zucker and Jeff Bezos and all of the big Silicon Valley gang and the chai comms
[09:16.240 --> 09:23.960]  want her because she will do whatever they tell her to do, just like Joe Biden.
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.320]  So it's no longer, oh, info wars exactly predicted this over a year ago.
[09:28.320 --> 09:29.320]  We didn't predict it.
[09:29.320 --> 09:33.360]  They were all admitting that this was one of their main plans and we didn't know they
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.360]  go with that plan.
[09:34.360 --> 09:35.920]  They've got a couple others.
[09:35.920 --> 09:39.960]  She said bio attack to lock things down, economic collapse, a big new war.
[09:39.960 --> 09:42.320]  Looks like they're going with all of them.
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.680]  They're playing every card they got.
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.520]  But the contesting the election and then trying to drive Trump from power and surrounding
[09:51.520 --> 09:58.680]  the White House, that's something that I've been saying for two and a half years every
[09:58.680 --> 09:59.680]  day.
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.080]  And if you remember the video that got me banned on Twitter, Lester Holt, everybody got
[10:04.080 --> 10:12.160]  up on TV with the head of Twitter and said, you know, Jones threatened to use battle rifles
[10:12.160 --> 10:13.160]  to come kill the media.
[10:13.160 --> 10:14.160]  They never showed a clip.
[10:14.160 --> 10:15.160]  I didn't say it.
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.000]  I said after they overthrow Trump with a fake race war and by surrounding the White House
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.320]  and by threatening members of Congress at their homes, if the military goes with them,
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.680]  next they're going to come to conservative leaders, houses and talk radio host houses
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.440]  and Fox News people houses.
[10:33.440 --> 10:37.360]  And that scared them so much because I was saying word for word, what their real battle
[10:37.360 --> 10:38.520]  plans were.
[10:38.520 --> 10:45.840]  So the first clip I want to play is from a couple years ago from the video that got
[10:45.840 --> 10:47.200]  me finally banned off of Twitter.
[10:47.200 --> 10:56.720]  Remember it was the last holdout, AJ predicts Civil War 2018.
[10:56.720 --> 10:59.000]  Here it is.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.800]  They are taking over the US.
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.800]  They are creating the racial division.
[11:02.800 --> 11:04.720]  They are creating the sexual division.
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.360]  They are creating all of the admitted crises in this country in their own admissions in
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.360]  WikiLeaks.
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.520]  And they're horrified to see the economy coming back and all these good things happening.
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.880]  So they're going to throw their full force against America in an attempt to encircle
[11:20.880 --> 11:27.080]  Congress with a million people and then to begin violent actions to run the patriots
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.120]  in DC out of the swamp so they can reestablish it.
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.280]  They believe that they're cornered.
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.400]  They know humanity is waking up and so they're going to launch their full assault of violence
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.640]  and intimidation and terrorist attacks, I believe, in this country.
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.680]  They've got all the Democratic Party talking heads saying, attack Trump supporters, bully
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.920]  him, kick him out of restaurants and when you see the weak-minded people, they've got
[11:52.920 --> 11:55.520]  lined up to support them and to chant.
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.120]  They're all professors or government workers or little scared leftists that bought into
[12:00.120 --> 12:04.600]  the fact that they were on the winning team and they were the cool group and they ran
[12:04.600 --> 12:10.440]  everything and they were going to teach flyover country and Christians and veterans and everybody.
[12:10.440 --> 12:11.960]  They were the ruling class.
[12:11.960 --> 12:15.200]  These people don't believe the dream of human empowerment.
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.080]  They believe in China and its enslavement of their own population.
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.720]  They believe in authoritarianism.
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.880]  They believe if they go kiss the ass of the globalists, they are in power.
[12:24.880 --> 12:31.200]  So that really scared them because it was dead on.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.760]  So here's CNN last night.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.880]  It's up on infowars.com.
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.400]  Joe Biden made the pic that maximized his chances of continuing to make the race a straight
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.440]  referendum on Trump while also selecting someone whose resume suggests being ready to step
[12:45.440 --> 12:52.200]  in even when Biden decides to step aside and the article is up on infowars.com.
[12:52.200 --> 12:54.480]  He's always been a placeholder.
[12:54.480 --> 13:02.000]  They want someone who is weak so they can put in whoever they want later.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.360]  That's why Nancy Pelosi says I will contest the election one way or the other.
[13:05.360 --> 13:07.000]  He will be out of there.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.360]  Even if he won't leave the White House, we will have our own inauguration and seat our
[13:10.360 --> 13:12.200]  president Joe Biden.
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.200]  She said one way or the other, we will contest it.
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.280]  We will have the state secede and we will put in Joe Biden and I just played that clip
[13:19.280 --> 13:21.160]  probably 20 times saying, do you see this?
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.480]  And now we learn they war-gamed it, the Democratic Party, John Podesta with the New York Times
[13:25.480 --> 13:28.640]  there officially.
[13:28.640 --> 13:30.080]  So they're not going to do this.
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.880]  They're already in process with the programming and the brainwashing and all of it right now.
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.720]  And that's why I tune in to talk radio and everybody's like, wow, Kamala Harris, everybody
[13:42.720 --> 13:44.320]  hates her.
[13:44.320 --> 13:47.840]  Trump's going to get in for sure now and oh, the guy that predicted Trump would win,
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.800]  the statistician, the professor says he's even, you know, more of a winner now and we've
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.840]  got all those graphs and the odds are even better for Trump now.
[13:55.840 --> 13:56.840]  Absolutely.
[13:56.840 --> 13:58.080]  It's a landslide.
[13:58.080 --> 14:03.000]  And if they can't get over that landslide with massive electronic voter fraud, election
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.440]  fraud, mail-in ballots, people voting the names of dead people, they are going to do
[14:08.440 --> 14:10.280]  the next best thing.
[14:10.280 --> 14:13.400]  And they're going to say, we won the popular vote in these blue states.
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.160]  They're going to massively pack the ballots with.
[14:16.160 --> 14:18.240]  You know, they're going to get the popular vote.
[14:18.240 --> 14:21.920]  Even there's a landslide there because they stopped the ballots in blue states.
[14:21.920 --> 14:24.880]  They're going to say, see, you're illegitimate, we, the people demand it.
[14:24.880 --> 14:30.200]  And then burn down the cities, attack the stock market so they think the average American
[14:30.200 --> 14:32.520]  will roll over and go along with it.
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.840]  Meanwhile, I saw a Washington Post article, Trump was insane.
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.360]  They didn't send a mail-in ballot to a dead cat or a dead dog.
[14:41.360 --> 14:42.720]  And of course they did.
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.760]  They're just sending them to any name they can scrape to any address.
[14:46.760 --> 14:47.760]  This is it.
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.520]  The next 82 days, all the cards on the table, we're in the middle of a new World Order lock
[14:52.520 --> 14:53.520]  down.
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.680]  It's all a fraud.
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.000]  They're starting the race war.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.440]  It's all coming to a head.
[14:57.440 --> 15:01.840]  And that's why you're meant to stay indoors in the political season.
[15:01.840 --> 15:03.720]  Don't go to the Trump rallies.
[15:03.720 --> 15:05.840]  Don't go out with your signs supporting America.
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.240]  Don't go out and support your local government, which the globalists already control but are
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.360]  fully trying to overthrow.
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.040]  You just sit there in your house while they take over.
[15:15.040 --> 15:16.040]  No.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.040]  Go to the stores.
[15:17.040 --> 15:18.040]  Don't wear the mask.
[15:18.040 --> 15:19.040]  Hand out flyers.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.040]  Educate people.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.880]  March on the streets.
[15:21.880 --> 15:23.240]  Go bullhorn the city councils.
[15:23.240 --> 15:26.800]  They've locked down all the governments so you can't have that speech.
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.200]  So you can't be seen so they can gaslight everybody and tell you that, oh, the lockdown
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.480]  continues because of a bad strain of COVID and thousands dying a day.
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.480]  And Trump's been driven out because, you know, he tried to steal the election.
[15:39.480 --> 15:43.880]  That's when they put you in this otherworldly bizarre atmosphere, thinking you'll accept
[15:43.880 --> 15:47.720]  the new normal is abnormal, seeing tyranny, but we're not going to let it happen.
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.720]  We're still on air.
[15:48.720 --> 15:49.720]  We're still fighting back.
[15:49.720 --> 15:53.240]  They may have censored everybody, including the president off Twitter, but we're still
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.800]  here at Band-Aid video and on local radio stations.
[15:55.800 --> 15:57.560]  So use those outlets now.
[15:57.560 --> 15:58.560]  You are Paul Revere.
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.000]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.320]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.800]  and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.520]  They are openly work ending this at the highest levels of democratic party.
[16:17.520 --> 16:22.000]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  Trump is going.
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.440]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging
[16:28.440 --> 16:29.960]  that will be called a racist.
[16:29.960 --> 16:32.480]  They will then trigger race, riots and violence.
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.600]  They've already beta tested around the country.
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.320]  We are not living in normal times.
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.680]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.760]  they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era.
[16:45.760 --> 16:46.760]  We are.
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.080]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on
[16:50.080 --> 16:52.880]  America is being exposed and removed.
[16:52.880 --> 16:56.440]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[16:56.440 --> 16:59.040]  Spread the word now, Paul Revere.
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.800]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[17:03.800 --> 17:09.080]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar
[17:09.080 --> 17:13.600]  and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[17:13.600 --> 17:17.400]  They are openly work ending this at the highest levels of democratic party.
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.800]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[17:21.800 --> 17:22.800]  Trump is going.
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.240]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.760]  that will be called a racist.
[17:29.760 --> 17:32.280]  They will then trigger race, riots and violence.
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.400]  They've already beta tested around the country.
[17:35.400 --> 17:38.080]  We are not living in normal times.
[17:38.080 --> 17:41.480]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because
[17:41.480 --> 17:45.520]  they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era.
[17:45.520 --> 17:46.520]  We are.
[17:46.520 --> 17:49.840]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on
[17:49.840 --> 17:52.640]  America is being exposed and removed.
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.400]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.880]  Spread the word now, Paul Revere.
[18:01.880 --> 18:28.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show 82 days, 82 days, the destiny on the back on
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.320]  your host Alex Jones.
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.520]  So we've seen Moody's and Barron's and the big bond rating companies come out in the
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.560]  last few months and say the election will be contested.
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.280]  The Democrats say they will contest it because of the COVID lockdown and the things they're
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.680]  doing in blue states and because they're violating all these state and federal laws.
[18:51.680 --> 18:53.840]  Then Republicans are going to have to contest it.
[18:53.840 --> 19:00.080]  That's what the big rating agencies have properly said Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan came out and
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.640]  said that we won't know for weeks.
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.480]  Trump says, wow, we might have to postpone it till you stop the legal stuff.
[19:08.480 --> 19:10.720]  They go, oh, no, you know the power to do that.
[19:10.720 --> 19:18.400]  We're going ahead and we're just going to say that we've won and secede and declare
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.000]  the popular vote and see what the military does.
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.840]  That's a quote from John Podesta, New York Times, and then their wargaming and propagandizing
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.280]  it and gal lighting, preparing the ground everywhere like this is their main push.
[19:34.280 --> 19:35.280]  It was Russiagate.
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.280]  It was Ukraine.
[19:36.280 --> 19:38.280]  It was all the Trumps are racist.
[19:38.280 --> 19:40.640]  Now they're moving to, he's a dictator.
[19:40.640 --> 19:42.000]  He won't leave.
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.600]  If he doesn't let us steal the election, if he challenges anything, well, then we're going
[19:47.600 --> 19:54.680]  to burn down every government building in the country.
[19:54.680 --> 20:00.640]  Well now the head of the Federal Elections Commission, Ellen Windrub, has come out and
[20:00.640 --> 20:06.640]  said substantial chance of justice happening and the Democrats are like, you bet we're
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.520]  contesting it.
[20:08.520 --> 20:12.520]  We know there's a landslide, but again, we're allowed to contest.
[20:12.520 --> 20:16.200]  You can't contest our contesting.
[20:16.200 --> 20:17.200]  That's the pre-programming.
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.680]  What they say Trump is going to do, they're already doing.
[20:21.680 --> 20:23.760]  And again, I tune in to talk radio.
[20:23.760 --> 20:27.880]  They have no idea this is even going on.
[20:27.880 --> 20:30.680]  And I don't want to be the guy here warning everybody.
[20:30.680 --> 20:34.120]  I don't want to be the guy here right about all this first.
[20:34.120 --> 20:35.960]  I don't want to see the whole country sucker punch.
[20:35.960 --> 20:40.840]  This is so obvious, but see, for a mainline Republican to say they're going to try to
[20:40.840 --> 20:45.040]  secede and they're going to try to have a race war and that they're going to feel that
[20:45.040 --> 20:47.320]  sounds too radical to people.
[20:47.320 --> 20:48.920]  Well they are radical.
[20:48.920 --> 20:53.320]  It's what they're doing.
[20:53.320 --> 20:55.600]  And so it is what it is.
[20:55.600 --> 20:59.680]  So let's be adults about this and open the phones up.
[20:59.680 --> 21:02.720]  Starting next segment, I'll get the number out on this one issue.
[21:02.720 --> 21:03.720]  What do we do about this?
[21:03.720 --> 21:08.360]  We can celebrate how she's a terrible candidate and how 1% of Democrats liked her in polls
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.040]  and how she's a total flip-flopper and how she set out outrageously criminal things.
[21:13.040 --> 21:15.920]  How she hates Christians and wants to ban all the guns.
[21:15.920 --> 21:19.520]  And I could play those clips where she says, I agree with Beto O'Rourke, we're going to
[21:19.520 --> 21:20.520]  ban all semi-autos.
[21:20.520 --> 21:22.120]  I'm going to sign an executive order.
[21:22.120 --> 21:26.920]  We can show you quotes where she says, we're going to hunt down Trump supporters and make
[21:26.920 --> 21:29.240]  them all pay for ever-electing Trump.
[21:29.240 --> 21:34.120]  That's another talking point for the Democrats, MSNBC seeing it as we're going to leave no
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.120]  stone unturned.
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.560]  We're going to burn down the populist movement that did this.
[21:38.560 --> 21:43.160]  But what do you think they did ship in our jobs overseas and trying to brainwash our
[21:43.160 --> 21:47.640]  kids with pedophiles and trying to abort our children, trying to break up our families?
[21:47.640 --> 21:52.960]  This is what they're always up to, but now it's out in the open.
[21:52.960 --> 21:57.320]  And so we can look at all the fake laughing and the emptiness of these monsters and think
[21:57.320 --> 21:59.880]  she's easy to be.
[21:59.880 --> 22:04.520]  They don't care if 80% of black voters hate her.
[22:04.520 --> 22:06.920]  They don't care if she pulled it 1% with Democrats.
[22:06.920 --> 22:09.760]  They don't care if she was for minimum sentences for black people.
[22:09.760 --> 22:11.200]  They don't care.
[22:11.200 --> 22:15.640]  They don't care because they're going to contest the election.
[22:15.640 --> 22:21.280]  They're going to try to install her and then Joe Biden will step aside within three months
[22:21.280 --> 22:24.680]  of being inaugurated.
[22:24.680 --> 22:28.680]  And then the whole sexual division between men and women and black and white, all of
[22:28.680 --> 22:29.800]  it will be perfect.
[22:29.800 --> 22:32.600]  She's the perfect wedge, Obama 2.0.
[22:32.600 --> 22:37.760]  And the Quentons, the Obamas are running the whole show, they're headlining at the DNC,
[22:37.760 --> 22:43.640]  these demonic child trafficking mummies, Oprah Winfrey is going to be there, another
[22:43.640 --> 22:51.800]  all evidence points towards child trafficker, John, a God running operations, Africa, orphanages,
[22:51.800 --> 22:56.560]  little girls, Hillary and the missing kids in Haiti, AP investigation confirming child
[22:56.560 --> 22:57.960]  trafficking by the thousands.
[22:57.960 --> 23:00.240]  I mean, these are stone cold killers.
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.520]  They're already censored and everybody.
[23:02.520 --> 23:04.960]  They control most of the Justice Department.
[23:04.960 --> 23:10.120]  Everybody better understand they're making their move because they know if Trump gets
[23:10.120 --> 23:12.280]  back in, it will be comeuppance.
[23:12.280 --> 23:13.280]  It will be vengeance.
[23:13.280 --> 23:15.040]  It will be their whole system dismantled.
[23:15.040 --> 23:17.920]  So they're cornered rats and they're going to contest it.
[23:17.920 --> 23:19.640]  So what are we, the American people going to do?
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.600]  What does Trump need to do?
[23:23.600 --> 23:29.720]  Here from the head of the Federal Elections Commission.
[23:29.720 --> 23:34.280]  Now, when Trump says this, he's evil, but here she is saying it.
[23:34.280 --> 23:39.600]  Let me just tell everybody we're all going to need to take a deep breath and be patient
[23:39.600 --> 23:45.600]  this year because, you know, there's a substantial chance we are not going to know on election
[23:45.600 --> 23:51.640]  night what the results are, possibly for the presidency, but maybe for many other races
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.760]  that are important to people.
[23:53.760 --> 24:00.200]  And that's okay if it takes a little bit longer to count all the votes accurately.
[24:00.200 --> 24:04.600]  That's what we need to do in order to ensure that everyone's vote counts.
[24:04.600 --> 24:09.160]  Oh, the bureaucracy is making its move.
[24:09.160 --> 24:10.600]  The big corporations are making their move.
[24:10.600 --> 24:14.920]  We've already seen the unified fraud with COVID using fake numbers of dead that died
[24:14.920 --> 24:15.920]  of other things.
[24:15.920 --> 24:22.160]  Saying 2.5 million would die when it's 160,000, lying with false positive tests.
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.280]  But the fine prince says, oh, have you had a bacterial infection?
[24:25.280 --> 24:28.800]  Well, last 10 years, well, I'm sorry, it shows you have COVID.
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.800]  They don't care.
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.120]  They're making their move because they never get in trouble for what they've done.
[24:34.120 --> 24:38.360]  So people are like, oh, Kamala Harris says she'll sign executive order and make everybody
[24:38.360 --> 24:42.240]  turn in all semi-automatic shotguns, handguns, and rifles.
[24:42.240 --> 24:44.400]  Well, she'll never get elected.
[24:44.400 --> 24:45.400]  Oh, really?
[24:45.400 --> 24:47.800]  They're going to contest the election.
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.120]  They're going to have the blue states secede and then China and the globalists have won
[24:51.120 --> 24:55.120]  right there because it'll send the stock market down and break the country into, even if we're
[24:55.120 --> 25:00.600]  able to remove the Democrats and stop them and defeat them, they will still be destroying
[25:00.600 --> 25:03.000]  the nation in the process.
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.360]  And so what will the Justice Department and the Pentagon and all the good old boys do?
[25:06.360 --> 25:14.120]  They'll sit there and play golf and try to act like they're on both sides and just hope
[25:14.120 --> 25:19.880]  it isn't too big a disaster because none of them will stick their head up above the grass.
[25:19.880 --> 25:23.680]  And because of that, we're now a laughing stock and a corrupt weak system like the Soviet
[25:23.680 --> 25:24.680]  Union.
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.680]  But does he deserve Trump?
[25:28.680 --> 25:30.880]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[25:30.880 --> 25:37.280]  It's just that there's a normalcy bias with people that just think, oh, Kamala Harris,
[25:37.280 --> 25:39.720]  total fraud, pulls it 1%.
[25:39.720 --> 25:40.720]  She's a joke.
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.680]  They're going to contest the election.
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.320]  They're going to then say that the states are succeeding along the popular vote.
[25:49.320 --> 25:53.160]  They've said they're going to have their own inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris
[25:53.160 --> 25:54.880]  at some undisclosed location.
[25:54.880 --> 25:56.520]  I played Pelosi yesterday.
[25:56.520 --> 25:59.000]  They're not joking.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.920]  They're not joking.
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.160]  And when they try to burn down federal courthouses and shoot police officers, if the police fight
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.520]  back, they'll be arrested, so the police are going to stand down.
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.040]  And if citizens go out and fight back, the news will say we're terrorist.
[26:14.040 --> 26:20.280]  Hollywood, the mainstream media, the whole culture, it's all globalist hate America,
[26:20.280 --> 26:23.760]  all making its move now.
[26:23.760 --> 26:24.960]  It will blow up in their face.
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.040]  It will be a disaster.
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.480]  It will trigger a bloody civil war that will be Alexander Soros and George Soros' final
[26:31.480 --> 26:35.960]  countdown and final waterloo.
[26:35.960 --> 26:39.120]  But there's no reason to let this happen.
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.320]  If every person, it's extremely politically active, if every person listening tells people
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.760]  about this show and this live feed and these topics, and if we make other talk radio and
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.920]  Fox News cover this and make the president take it head on, they'll have to back down.
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.280]  And I know a blueprint to stop them will cover when we come back.
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.640]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[27:01.640 --> 27:03.560]  serious cognitive problems.
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.280]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalists and their
[27:08.280 --> 27:10.200]  allied crime syndicates.
[27:10.200 --> 27:13.480]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.920]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai Combs and others.
[27:17.920 --> 27:24.400]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.120]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.760]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.280]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[27:42.280 --> 27:47.280]  Kamala Harris and will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[27:47.280 --> 27:51.200]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[27:51.200 --> 27:53.920]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[27:53.920 --> 27:56.000]  We must expose the globalist.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.360]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[28:01.360 --> 28:03.280]  serious cognitive problems.
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.040]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[28:08.040 --> 28:09.960]  allied crime syndicates.
[28:09.960 --> 28:13.200]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.640]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai Combs and others.
[28:17.640 --> 28:24.160]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.840]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.480]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.040]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[28:42.040 --> 28:47.000]  Kamala Harris and will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.920]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[28:50.920 --> 28:53.640]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[28:53.640 --> 28:55.640]  We must expose the globalist.
[28:55.640 --> 29:02.520]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there have
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.720]  all gone on national TV and have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.240]  of the New York Times, that their war came in contesting the election when they lose.
[29:12.240 --> 29:13.240]  They know there's a landslide.
[29:13.240 --> 29:19.040]  If they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.520]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.520]  Harris.
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.760]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.960]  try to drive Trump from office.
[29:32.960 --> 29:37.520]  The Democratic Party, the Chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded
[29:37.520 --> 29:43.640]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[29:43.640 --> 29:49.120]  riots and martial law that your races went in truth and old Nazi collaborator George
[29:49.120 --> 29:54.000]  Soros created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa, America's fighting for its life, but
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.480]  we will win.
[29:59.480 --> 30:06.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:29.480 --> 30:52.960]  It's been said history repeats and it does, but it also rhymes.
[30:52.960 --> 31:00.200]  We have a Republican who is really seeking to unify the nation and you have the very
[31:00.200 --> 31:05.640]  same Democratic Party saying they're going to secede if he is reelected.
[31:05.640 --> 31:08.400]  Well, that's what happened with Lincoln.
[31:08.400 --> 31:11.840]  When he was elected the first time, they just did not honor him.
[31:11.840 --> 31:14.440]  And again, I've studied the Civil War.
[31:14.440 --> 31:16.000]  Both sides were in the wrong.
[31:16.000 --> 31:22.040]  Andrew Jackson was right stopping the Civil War that almost happened 30 years before.
[31:22.040 --> 31:23.480]  Sam Houston was against the war.
[31:23.480 --> 31:29.520]  He was the governor of Texas and was literally thrown out of the building at gunpoint when
[31:29.520 --> 31:31.800]  he said it's going to go on for years.
[31:31.800 --> 31:35.560]  It's going to kill our best men and we're going to lose because they got five times
[31:35.560 --> 31:37.920]  the men and they got all the factories.
[31:37.920 --> 31:41.440]  But British intelligence manipulated that the North was doing stuff that was wrong.
[31:41.440 --> 31:42.680]  The South was doing something that was wrong.
[31:42.680 --> 31:49.400]  But the point is, is that Lincoln was the Republican president and the South didn't
[31:49.400 --> 31:53.600]  like him being elected, so they began succession.
[31:53.600 --> 32:00.200]  The very same Democratic Party, I'm getting chills, is now trying to create a racial crisis
[32:00.200 --> 32:09.600]  again and is trying to have the blue state secede and is calling for the military to
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.600]  throw Trump out.
[32:10.600 --> 32:12.320]  Do you understand what I just said?
[32:12.320 --> 32:17.400]  And I know for the last week I've been saying the same thing because it'd be like a giant
[32:17.400 --> 32:20.080]  meteorite was coming to blow the planet up.
[32:20.080 --> 32:25.280]  In six months I'd say let's get rockets up with nukes, let's try to blow it up.
[32:25.280 --> 32:29.120]  I wouldn't be talking about how there's a forest fire five miles away or how there was
[32:29.120 --> 32:35.400]  a car wreck down the street or how my cousin has cancer, hypothetically, because the big
[32:35.400 --> 32:40.840]  enchilada is that that asteroid's coming.
[32:40.840 --> 32:45.280]  The New York Times sat in on the meeting with the Clintons, the Obamas, the Democratic Party
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.840]  and Podesta still running it.
[32:46.840 --> 32:48.480]  They're running the DNC.
[32:48.480 --> 32:53.520]  They're the headliners again with their platform for the UN and the contact tracers.
[32:53.520 --> 32:58.080]  They just graduated on to the world government level and then Biden and Harris will be their
[32:58.080 --> 33:00.320]  placeholders here.
[33:00.320 --> 33:03.920]  America's a little cog in this thing and their power.
[33:03.920 --> 33:10.200]  We're just slaves to be used and they say we will have the state secede, we will say
[33:10.200 --> 33:15.720]  the election's illegitimate, we will even hold our own inauguration and we'll see who
[33:15.720 --> 33:19.640]  the military sides with when the cities burn.
[33:19.640 --> 33:25.760]  That's in the New York Times, a message to the military and the brass, everybody else,
[33:25.760 --> 33:31.520]  that oh, the stock market went down 10,000 points since the contestant election is what
[33:31.520 --> 33:32.520]  you'll be hearing.
[33:32.520 --> 33:36.040]  It'll go down another 10,000 if we don't turn it around.
[33:36.040 --> 33:37.040]  Trump's got to go.
[33:37.040 --> 33:38.040]  It's his fault.
[33:38.040 --> 33:43.040]  We need unity.
[33:43.040 --> 33:46.540]  We're going to hold this country hostage.
[33:46.540 --> 33:52.240]  They say they're going to hold the country hostage and we're just sitting here flatfooted
[33:52.240 --> 33:59.920]  with our thumbs, you know where I am horrified that I watched Fox News, almost no mention
[33:59.920 --> 34:00.920]  of this.
[34:00.920 --> 34:08.400]  Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, please, please, please understand what's going on.
[34:08.400 --> 34:13.240]  Thank God Breitbart has the proper headline.
[34:13.240 --> 34:16.080]  Thank God people, some people are listening to this.
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.160]  I know the president gets it, he's like, well, I might not be around very much longer.
[34:20.160 --> 34:21.920]  You might not see me for a while.
[34:21.920 --> 34:24.120]  These criminals are coming after me.
[34:24.120 --> 34:25.120]  Yeah.
[34:25.120 --> 34:31.160]  Democrats war game for election includes West Coast secession possible civil war.
[34:31.160 --> 34:36.120]  That's not just West Coast secession, she said California then led by blue states across
[34:36.120 --> 34:38.120]  the country.
[34:38.120 --> 34:44.960]  So we're watching bank robbers sit there and plan the damn thing in front of us.
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.600]  But they're going to rob us of our liberty, our freedom, our whole future.
[34:47.600 --> 34:51.840]  And then Kamala Harris, we got to get these other clips because I saw her say this on
[34:51.840 --> 34:52.840]  MSNBC.
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.200]  And I had the guys looking, we've been able to find it, but here's the quote that reminded
[34:56.200 --> 34:57.200]  me.
[34:57.200 --> 34:59.200]  And I've seen a bunch of the Democratic Party operatives say this, you've all seen them
[34:59.200 --> 35:03.040]  say this, where we got to wants to get rid of Trump, we got to get his supporters and
[35:03.040 --> 35:07.160]  outlaw them and hunt them down and level them and destroy them and demolish them.
[35:07.160 --> 35:08.960]  I mean, these are the terms.
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.280]  And once Trump's gone, this is Kamala Harris, and once Trump's gone and we have regained
[35:14.280 --> 35:20.400]  our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorse his actions
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.520]  because we'll be coming for you next.
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.920]  You will feel the vengeance of the nation.
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.200]  No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation.
[35:31.200 --> 35:39.040]  Or it is you who have betrayed us, Kamala Harris, June 18th, 2020.
[35:39.040 --> 35:40.040]  And they'll call you a racist.
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.560]  They'll call you criminal and they'll point a mob at your house to go burn it down.
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.960]  And if you shoot back, you'll be called a white supremacist.
[35:47.960 --> 35:56.280]  This is race-based KKK 101 Democrat tactics, but flipped onto white people and the Republican
[35:56.280 --> 35:59.920]  Party and the party of Lincoln because the public is so stupid.
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.000]  The public, again, the average person does not know you die without vitamin C or vitamin
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.400]  D3 or zinc.
[36:05.400 --> 36:10.680]  They literally in the news think it's a conspiracy theory and they go, the UN says you don't need
[36:10.680 --> 36:18.240]  that, says the head of YouTube, the CEO, that the UN says you don't need zinc.
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.560]  I go back to that because it's like saying plants don't need water.
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.400]  It's like idiocracy where they're putting Gatorade on plants and he goes, you know,
[36:26.400 --> 36:32.280]  the plants are dying, I think, because you're putting Gatorade on them.
[36:32.280 --> 36:33.800]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.800]  Look at that town hall.
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.200]  If you disagree with the WHO, we're pulling your content.
[36:39.200 --> 36:41.200]  We're under the UN.
[36:41.200 --> 36:42.840]  It's already here.
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.760]  They're burning down federal courthouses and attacking federal officers with hatchets.
[36:48.760 --> 36:50.880]  The federal officers are inside the building.
[36:50.880 --> 36:52.040]  They're hacking in.
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.040]  They come out.
[36:53.040 --> 36:54.840]  They hit them in the head with a hatchet.
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.120]  They try to kill us with hammers and they go in the news and go, nobody's violent.
[36:59.120 --> 37:00.440]  We're nice people.
[37:00.440 --> 37:05.600]  Oh, and they're climbing on top of our truck with hammers screaming, SU, SU, I'm gonna
[37:05.600 --> 37:06.600]  kill you.
[37:06.600 --> 37:07.600]  I'm gonna kill you.
[37:07.600 --> 37:08.600]  I'm gonna kill you.
[37:08.600 --> 37:09.600]  I'm gonna kill Alex.
[37:09.600 --> 37:10.600]  I'm gonna kill Owen.
[37:10.600 --> 37:11.600]  I'm gonna kill you.
[37:11.600 --> 37:12.600]  I'm a SU pig.
[37:12.600 --> 37:13.600]  I'm gonna kill you.
[37:13.600 --> 37:22.560]  I mean, oh, such nice people and they beat up women and children and new videos are out
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.720]  today of just people driving on the road and Antifa runs out screaming black lives matter
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.240]  and pointing guns at people and the person tries to drive around them and they go, don't
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.200]  hit me and run in front of the car.
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.080]  And then you got black people breaking in stores in Chicago, grabbing jewelry, grabbing
[37:40.080 --> 37:42.680]  clothing going, I can't breathe like it's okay.
[37:42.680 --> 37:43.680]  I can't breathe.
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.680]  As long as I say I can't breathe, I can shove some more Louis Vuitton in this bag.
[37:47.680 --> 37:51.000]  I mean, we've been decadent.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  We've been evil.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  We've been broken down.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.680]  We've been on welfare and now it's produced scum, black scum, white scum, brown scum,
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.000]  entitled scum with no empathy, no common sense who believe that you're driving a big
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  nice blue truck.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  You're white.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.360]  I'm gonna jump in front of you and point a gun at you.
[38:09.360 --> 38:16.080]  Well, don't you try to back up and they're like, don't run me over, don't run me over
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.160]  while he's backing away.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.960]  It's all this mental illness.
[38:19.960 --> 38:20.960]  It's like magic.
[38:20.960 --> 38:23.680]  I can rob a place if you just say I can't breathe.
[38:23.680 --> 38:24.680]  You can shoot somebody.
[38:24.680 --> 38:27.440]  If you just say I can't breathe, you can block traffic.
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.440]  If you just say I can't breathe, well, yes, you, you blocked the wrong person appointed
[38:31.440 --> 38:32.440]  gun with them.
[38:32.440 --> 38:36.280]  You ain't going to be breathing.
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.120]  So I've got so much to cover here, but I'm just trying to explain to people.
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.640]  Trump saw this is my pick.
[38:41.640 --> 38:42.960]  It's exactly who I want.
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.160]  It's a very worst choice.
[38:44.160 --> 38:46.360]  I love it.
[38:46.360 --> 38:48.040]  And politically, he's right.
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.200]  She's the worst choice.
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.600]  It goes Biden because they want weak, stupid people that aren't respected that they control.
[38:55.600 --> 38:57.720]  Harris is controlled.
[38:57.720 --> 38:58.800]  Biden is controlled.
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.560]  They will do exactly what big tech and the chai comms tell them.
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.400]  Joe Biden's gone on TV and said, we need to have every aspect of our lives governed by
[39:08.400 --> 39:09.400]  the Chinese.
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.480]  I'm going to play the clip again.
[39:11.480 --> 39:17.040]  The Washington Post says, Gigi Ping must destroy Trump.
[39:17.040 --> 39:20.160]  And the average liberal reads that I have people that work at this office.
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.960]  Some of them have known 18 years.
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.760]  I know their families.
[39:26.760 --> 39:32.680]  One of them sisters will not talk to him and literally she's white, worships Gigi Ping
[39:32.680 --> 39:35.200]  and hopes he will crush America.
[39:35.200 --> 39:42.520]  The average leftist literally loves the dictator of China and a country that's killed 115 million
[39:42.520 --> 39:43.520]  of their own people.
[39:43.520 --> 39:44.680]  They are psychotic.
[39:44.680 --> 39:45.840]  They are nuts.
[39:45.840 --> 39:46.840]  They are crazy.
[39:46.840 --> 39:47.840]  They are in power.
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.920]  And they're backed by Jeff Bezos and all these billionaires and they're making their move
[39:52.920 --> 39:53.920]  now.
[39:53.920 --> 40:01.040]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[40:01.040 --> 40:04.640]  to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of
[40:04.640 --> 40:05.640]  slavery.
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.200]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[40:10.200 --> 40:11.200]  and others.
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.000]  And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.240]  the election and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.600]  John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and, of course, Joe Biden.
[40:23.600 --> 40:27.440]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[40:27.440 --> 40:30.840]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote.
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.400]  And we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[40:35.400 --> 40:37.480]  This is officially in the New York Times.
[40:37.480 --> 40:39.080]  I don't just believe the New York Times.
[40:39.080 --> 40:42.560]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan from other statements they've
[40:42.560 --> 40:47.480]  made in the Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council
[40:47.480 --> 40:48.480]  on Farm Relations.
[40:48.480 --> 40:49.480]  This is their plan.
[40:49.480 --> 40:51.160]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[40:51.160 --> 40:52.160]  What are you going to do?
[40:52.160 --> 40:53.160]  I'm serious, folks.
[40:53.160 --> 40:55.680]  This is the time to save the country.
[40:55.680 --> 41:01.160]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown, and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[41:01.160 --> 41:04.640]  to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of
[41:04.640 --> 41:05.640]  slavery.
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.280]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[41:10.280 --> 41:11.280]  and others.
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.560]  And the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal the election
[41:15.560 --> 41:20.120]  and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with John Podesta at the
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.680]  very top with Kamala Harris and, of course, Joe Biden.
[41:23.680 --> 41:27.520]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.360]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote, and we are then going to
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.480]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[41:35.480 --> 41:37.520]  This is officially in the New York Times.
[41:37.520 --> 41:39.160]  I don't just believe the New York Times.
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.040]  I've been telling you for over a year.
[41:41.040 --> 41:45.240]  This is their plan from other statements they've made, and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.640]  Post, the Financial Times of London, and the Council on Farm Relations.
[41:48.640 --> 41:49.640]  This is their plan.
[41:49.640 --> 41:51.120]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[41:51.120 --> 41:52.320]  What are you going to do?
[41:52.320 --> 41:53.320]  I'm serious, folks.
[41:53.320 --> 41:57.640]  This is the time to save the country.
[41:57.640 --> 42:00.920]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[42:00.920 --> 42:06.640]  Well, you trigger race riots, and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[42:06.640 --> 42:10.360]  the Speaker of the House that you are legitimately now the president.
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.960]  That's what she's been said on CBS News, and then you're going to have those blue states
[42:14.960 --> 42:15.960]  secede.
[42:15.960 --> 42:20.520]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.360]  backed by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms, and the whole globalist system.
[42:24.360 --> 42:29.440]  This is treason with a capital T, and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.440]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our president has been
[42:33.440 --> 42:34.440]  exposing it.
[42:34.440 --> 42:35.440]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[42:35.440 --> 42:36.960]  You need storeable food.
[42:36.960 --> 42:40.840]  You've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two- to four-week delivery
[42:40.840 --> 42:42.080]  with 80 days out from the election.
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.920]  You need to get high-quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this
[42:45.920 --> 42:46.920]  off.
[42:46.920 --> 42:49.440]  We're going to have a Great Depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.440]  look like a cakewalk.
[42:50.440 --> 42:55.440]  Get your high-quality storeable foods now, and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.600]  Get prepared.
[42:56.600 --> 43:00.720]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything.
[43:00.720 --> 43:05.040]  They also bet, as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will adapt
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.280]  to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.200]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[43:13.200 --> 43:16.440]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[43:16.440 --> 43:18.280]  They lied about where it came from.
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.920]  They lied about person-to-person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[43:22.920 --> 43:29.680]  at 4%, but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[43:29.680 --> 43:32.680]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[43:32.680 --> 43:36.680]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[43:36.680 --> 43:40.080]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown, now we're six months later.
[43:40.080 --> 43:43.960]  Now they say it's permanent, that you've got to wear masks forever, and forced inoculations
[43:43.960 --> 43:47.080]  are coming, and they're going to track everywhere you go with what you do, the global social
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.120]  credit score, and the UN is the boss, and anybody questioning it is censored off the
[43:51.120 --> 43:52.840]  internet loses their job.
[43:52.840 --> 43:54.480]  That's called 21st-century tyranny.
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.520]  That's called world government takeover.
[43:59.520 --> 44:06.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:29.520 --> 44:41.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[44:41.520 --> 44:44.640]  Think about it.
[44:44.640 --> 44:51.240]  You have lived to see a large portion of the public and government corporations openly
[44:51.240 --> 44:59.760]  side with Communist China against the United States and call for Xi Jinping to, quote,
[44:59.760 --> 45:01.040]  destroy our president.
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.640]  You see tens of millions of citizens side with foreign powers against the existence
[45:05.640 --> 45:08.680]  of their very country.
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.160]  It's incredible.
[45:13.160 --> 45:14.160]  They're globalist.
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.680]  They believe they're conquering us, but the average person siding with it isn't.
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.520]  Here's Joe Biden just a few years ago saying China should guide us and influence us through
[45:23.520 --> 45:24.760]  every aspect of our lives.
[45:24.760 --> 45:25.760]  Well, they already do.
[45:25.760 --> 45:26.760]  They own Hollywood.
[45:26.760 --> 45:27.760]  Here it is.
[45:27.760 --> 45:35.160]  I'm also proud that more than 160 Fortune 500 companies are operating in Chengdu high-tech
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.680]  zone, including pioneer American businesses like Intel, Dell, and Oracle.
[45:40.680 --> 45:47.440]  The U.S.-China relationship has also improved dramatically in the past 30 years.
[45:47.440 --> 45:53.880]  In order to cement this robust partnership, we have to go beyond close ties between Washington
[45:53.880 --> 45:57.720]  and Beijing, which we're working on every day.
[45:57.720 --> 46:00.760]  Go beyond it to include all levels of government.
[46:00.760 --> 46:08.160]  Go beyond it to include classrooms and laboratories, athletic fields, and boardrooms.
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.120]  That's why we launched our 100,000-strong initiative to boost the number of American
[46:12.120 --> 46:17.000]  students studying in China each year.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.760]  Another bellwether sign of the establishment being very, very long on the tooth, Sumner
[46:23.760 --> 46:32.960]  Redstone billionaire media tycoon dead at age 97, an extremely evil individual who let
[46:32.960 --> 46:35.560]  Nickelodeon promote pedophilia, you name it.
[46:35.560 --> 46:36.560]  Tough, though.
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.520]  He was in a burning building once and held on for several hours by his hands that almost
[46:40.520 --> 46:41.520]  burned off.
[46:41.520 --> 46:48.080]  He spent the last years of his life fighting with his family over tens of billions of dollars.
[46:48.080 --> 46:50.920]  Built a media empire and long reigned over it.
[46:50.920 --> 46:55.880]  His dad owned a string of movie theaters across the country and thought that movie theaters
[46:55.880 --> 46:56.880]  was what mattered.
[46:56.880 --> 46:58.400]  It was the venue, not the talent.
[46:58.400 --> 47:01.480]  He said, no, it's about content, content, content.
[47:01.480 --> 47:06.680]  So so much of our modern media age was governed by a truly a visionary and also extremely
[47:06.680 --> 47:09.000]  evil, dead.
[47:09.000 --> 47:15.120]  Now, continuing, here's Kamala Paris, there's a bunch of these clubs saying that she will
[47:15.120 --> 47:18.840]  have executive action to take your semi-autos.
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.840]  Here she is.
[47:19.840 --> 47:20.840]  Let's look at the facts.
[47:20.840 --> 47:29.840]  One in four police officers who was killed in the line of duty by John Fyre is killed
[47:29.840 --> 47:30.840]  by the solid.
[47:30.840 --> 47:39.080]  Let's look at the fact that there are four million assault loophies in the United States
[47:39.080 --> 47:42.840]  which were imported here from foreign countries.
[47:42.840 --> 47:48.440]  So I am also prepared, and I'm announcing for the first time today here with you, to
[47:48.440 --> 47:56.600]  take executive action to ban the import of assault loophies.
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.920]  And she also said that she was about to a roar to ban semi-autos, there's a whole bunch
[48:00.920 --> 48:01.920]  of these clips.
[48:01.920 --> 48:05.160]  But remember, they just had a front-line piece, two weeks against me, a two-week school PBS
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.400]  saying, Jones is crazy, no one wants executive action against your guns.
[48:09.400 --> 48:10.400]  So they gaslight you.
[48:10.400 --> 48:12.800]  They tell you they're going to do all this, but then, oh, we're not doing it.
[48:12.800 --> 48:15.520]  Here she is during the debates.
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.720]  Because there are people in Washington, D.C., supposed leaders, who have failed to have
[48:20.720 --> 48:26.720]  the courage to reject a false choice, which suggests you're either in favor of the Second
[48:26.720 --> 48:30.200]  Amendment, or you want to take everyone's guns away.
[48:30.200 --> 48:35.800]  Supposed leaders in Washington, D.C., who have failed to have the courage to recognize,
[48:35.800 --> 48:38.080]  you know what, you want to go hunting, that's fine.
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.800]  But we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, starting with universal background
[48:42.800 --> 48:45.480]  checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban.
[48:45.480 --> 48:48.440]  But they have failed to have the courage to act.
[48:48.440 --> 48:51.000]  So Ben, here's my response to you.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.480]  Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.160]  together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.480]  And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.280]  And specifically, what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells
[49:10.280 --> 49:15.840]  more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those
[49:15.840 --> 49:16.840]  guns.
[49:16.840 --> 49:24.280]  And I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license,
[49:24.280 --> 49:26.920]  and by the way, ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[49:26.920 --> 49:30.840]  Well, the ATF has been doing a lot of the A and the T, but not much of the F. And we
[49:30.840 --> 49:32.840]  need to fix that.
[49:32.840 --> 49:33.840]  And then...
[49:33.840 --> 49:36.840]  Well, yeah, they want to disarm us so bad, they can taste it.
[49:36.840 --> 49:40.280]  There's a bunch of other clips where she says she agrees with Beto O'Rourke and then her
[49:40.280 --> 49:42.560]  official stance wants to ban all semi-autos.
[49:42.560 --> 49:49.040]  People play more of those clips coming up next hour, but no, she said when she's president.
[49:49.040 --> 49:56.640]  But she pulled it 1% throughout those primaries, but the 1%, the establishment, they sure liked
[49:56.640 --> 49:58.280]  what they heard.
[49:58.280 --> 50:03.360]  So remember, she's coming after you and your family and CNN reports that she's ready to
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.880]  step in when Biden decides to step aside.
[50:07.880 --> 50:13.080]  That's been the plan all along.
[50:13.080 --> 50:21.200]  And we've got Alexander Soros coming out, very, very, very excited, tweeting today, but he
[50:21.200 --> 50:25.480]  can't wait until she's the president, because that's what this is.
[50:25.480 --> 50:29.400]  How do you put somebody super unpopular in?
[50:29.400 --> 50:36.240]  Alexander Soros is the main funder of Antifa on record, a little general, a little general
[50:36.240 --> 50:44.320]  that could, who believes the country should not exist at all.
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.560]  The article's up on enforce.com if you want to see it.
[50:48.560 --> 50:50.400]  But before we go to break, I want to give the number out.
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.080]  I want to open the phones up in the next hour, specifically on the Democrats' announcement
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.600]  that they want to contest the election, have the blue states secede, and then have their
[50:58.600 --> 51:01.200]  own inauguration, and have the military take Trump out.
[51:01.200 --> 51:02.960]  You go, oh, that's wishful thinking.
[51:02.960 --> 51:08.680]  Well, they got defeated with the previous coups, but this one is 100 times more dangerous
[51:08.680 --> 51:09.680]  than out in the open.
[51:09.680 --> 51:10.680]  And they're going for broke.
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.120]  So we're just going to let them break the country apart and burn everything down, and
[51:14.120 --> 51:15.120]  then they'll try something else.
[51:15.120 --> 51:16.560]  They just never get in trouble.
[51:16.560 --> 51:18.120]  It's all illegal.
[51:18.120 --> 51:19.320]  And they're in bed with China.
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.360]  They're foreign enemies.
[51:21.360 --> 51:28.400]  They're collaborators against the existence of the nation, 877-789-2539, first-time callers.
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.200]  If you called in and didn't get through, you were on hold, we'll go the front of the line,
[51:32.200 --> 51:38.840]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 on this one subject.
[51:38.840 --> 51:42.960]  The election, how they're going to contest it, their plan to secede, their wargaming,
[51:42.960 --> 51:43.960]  what does Trump do?
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.520]  I'll tell you what I think he needs to do.
[51:45.520 --> 51:55.560]  Coming up next hour, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, and we will get you up and on the air in
[51:55.560 --> 51:56.560]  the next hour.
[51:56.560 --> 51:57.560]  We have a special guest.
[51:57.560 --> 51:58.960]  I'll tell you about it a little bit later.
[51:58.960 --> 51:59.960]  Don't forget tomorrow night.
[51:59.960 --> 52:05.120]  I'm going to be live with a whole bunch of special guests from 7 to 10 p.m. commercial
[52:05.120 --> 52:10.960]  free on the radio and TV satellites, stations want to carry it, and the streams at band.video.info.wars.com,
[52:10.960 --> 52:13.960]  FordsLessShow, and newswars.com, FordsLessShow.
[52:13.960 --> 52:17.160]  And again, I keep telling you, it's paramount.
[52:17.160 --> 52:20.400]  People ask, how are you taking it being totally censored two years ago off the Internet?
[52:20.400 --> 52:23.040]  I said, we already built our own infrastructure when it was coming.
[52:23.040 --> 52:24.040]  And you're next.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.400]  Well, now the president's being censored.
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.280]  People just complain about the censorship, tell people about the live feed at newswars.com,
[52:30.280 --> 52:34.600]  FordsLessShow, or band.video, the Alex Jones section of the live feed, or the other live
[52:34.600 --> 52:35.600]  shows.
[52:35.600 --> 52:36.600]  Share it.
[52:36.600 --> 52:39.560]  Most of the time, you won't get censored on Twitter, Facebook, you know, Google, because
[52:39.560 --> 52:44.680]  they're just too brain dead, especially if you use a newswars link or a band.video link.
[52:44.680 --> 52:49.520]  Share it via text message, share it via your email, word of mouth, that's king.
[52:49.520 --> 52:53.600]  And know this, we are ending the big mega sale we had.
[52:53.600 --> 52:56.360]  We extended it, but had to get rid of free shipping because we're not bringing the revenue
[52:56.360 --> 52:57.360]  we need.
[52:57.360 --> 53:01.160]  It's great deals on our high-quality supplements that are selling out.
[53:01.160 --> 53:04.680]  So we've got to stop on the body's ultimate turmeric at 50% off, double-patriot points
[53:04.680 --> 53:05.680]  this Sunday.
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.760]  The living defense, 50% off, so good to flush yourself out, next level, probiotic, this
[53:09.760 --> 53:10.760]  next level.

[53:28.000 --> 53:29.600]  is the most important one right there.
[53:29.600 --> 53:34.800]  50% off, winter sun, the booster immune system, D3 and K, take it under the tongue, highest
[53:34.800 --> 53:38.720]  quality, 50% off, chill force, it goes on and on.
[53:38.720 --> 53:42.080]  Your purchase funds this operation without you, we will not be here.
[53:42.080 --> 53:47.000]  We also have to end sometime next week because they're getting low, the Alexa Pure Breeze
[53:47.000 --> 53:54.440]  four-stage ion filter that they sell to us at their cost, we tack like $35 on to it to
[53:54.440 --> 53:59.360]  fund ourselves, other filters on average are $400 that are comparable, they're a great
[53:59.360 --> 54:06.200]  deal at $250, they're selling them to us with a $35 profit in it because they're ordering
[54:06.200 --> 54:09.800]  a whole bunch more for the winter, they wanted to have a guaranteed amount of this order
[54:09.800 --> 54:13.840]  so they dump these on the market through us because they're total fans, the same folks
[54:13.840 --> 54:18.800]  that own my Patriot and we're their biggest seller and then they just do us favors, nobody
[54:18.800 --> 54:22.160]  else gets them at anywhere this price, you'll find them at $250 sold all over, $200 when
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.200]  they're on discount, it's 137 smackers right now and I put them in every room in my house,
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.840]  two or three of them will do a small house, five or six to a big house, but I just absolutely
[54:32.840 --> 54:36.880]  love them, you just change out one filter and wash it off like once a month, put it back
[54:36.880 --> 54:39.280]  again in the other filters, you don't have to be replaced.
[54:39.280 --> 54:45.360]  Come forward, store.com, stay with us, second hour coming up.
[54:45.360 --> 54:51.240]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert, as of taping this alert, you're 82 days out
[54:51.240 --> 54:55.880]  from the election, as many of you know in the last year, I've pointed out statements
[54:55.880 --> 54:59.800]  out of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump
[54:59.800 --> 55:06.240]  is going to win in a landslide, so their strategy will be to contest the election, if they fail
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.760]  to successfully steal it, then they are openly now wargaming, this is in the New York Times,
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.560]  having Democrat states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.560]  policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down, that is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[55:22.560 --> 55:26.360]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in D.C., they
[55:26.360 --> 55:33.200]  said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war, this is their public criminal plan,
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.480]  we should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[55:42.480 --> 55:46.160]  the office to expose this criminal activity.
[55:46.160 --> 55:52.040]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert, as of taping this alert, you're 82 days out
[55:52.040 --> 55:56.640]  from the election, as many of you know in the last year, I've pointed out statements
[55:56.640 --> 56:00.560]  out of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump
[56:00.560 --> 56:07.000]  is going to win in a landslide, so their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.560]  to successfully steal it, then they are openly now wargaming, this is in the New York Times,
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.360]  having Democrat states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's
[56:17.360 --> 56:23.360]  policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down, that is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[56:23.360 --> 56:27.120]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in D.C., they
[56:27.120 --> 56:34.020]  said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris, ladies
[56:34.020 --> 56:39.840]  and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war, this is their public criminal plan,
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.320]  we should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[56:43.320 --> 56:49.040]  the office to expose this criminal activity.
[56:49.040 --> 56:58.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:58.880 --> 57:02.640]  Coming up next segment, I'm going right to your phone calls, what does Trump do, the
[57:02.640 --> 57:05.920]  Democrats announced a plan for secession.
[57:05.920 --> 57:12.880]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.880]  That's right, we are live raw in a censor.
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.840]  The full Tucker Carlson 10 and a half minute analysis is excellent, it's on Infowars.com,
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.080]  but here's just some of it that we're going to go to break and come back with your calls.
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.200]  Single most transactional human being in America, there are timeshare salesmen you would trust
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.120]  more than Kamala Harris, you could find payday lenders who are more sincere, so it seemed
[57:37.120 --> 57:42.400]  inconceivable that given his current state, Joe Biden would choose someone so transparently
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.080]  one dimensional as Kamala Harris, someone as empty as he is, he would be the first entirely
[57:48.080 --> 57:53.440]  hollow presidential ticket in American history, and we thought it could never happen.
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.000]  But it is, they're doing it anyway, Biden Harris, that's what they're going with.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.080]  And the choice tells you a lot about the current state of the Democratic Party.
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.600]  America is still technically a democracy, yet neither Biden nor Harris has ever been
[58:06.600 --> 58:08.800]  popular with actual voters.
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.080]  This is Joe Biden's third run for president, the first two attempts ended in embarrassing
[58:13.080 --> 58:14.080]  disasters.
[58:14.080 --> 58:19.040]  The third was headed at high speed in that direction, and then a series of unforeseen
[58:19.040 --> 58:24.400]  flukes in a highly crowded primary field left Biden the last man in the race.
[58:24.400 --> 58:27.040]  He was clearly shocked by his own victory.
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.520]  On election night, the night he clinched the nomination in March, Biden was so rattled
[58:31.520 --> 58:35.920]  he must took his sister for his wife during the acceptance speech.
[58:35.920 --> 58:41.240]  At the time, Joe Biden's relative unpopularity seemed like a major problem for Democrats.
[58:41.240 --> 58:47.360]  This is politics after all, the people who tend to have the most support tend to win.
[58:47.360 --> 58:51.360]  So if you're choosing a presidential nominee, you'd think you'd want someone with a built
[58:51.360 --> 58:57.200]  in constituency, a base of passionate voters you could count on on election day.
[58:57.200 --> 59:01.320]  But as it turns out, that is the last thing the leaders of the modern Democratic Party
[59:01.320 --> 59:02.320]  wanted.
[59:02.320 --> 59:05.200]  They already had a candidate like that, in fact, his name was Bernie Sanders.
[59:05.200 --> 59:07.920]  And they did everything they could to stop him.
[59:07.920 --> 59:11.960]  No, what they wanted instead was someone they could control.
[59:11.960 --> 59:14.800]  And Joe Biden fit that description perfectly.
[59:14.800 --> 59:18.000]  Biden was eager, malleable, and totally blank.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.880]  He was willing to be whatever his handlers wanted him to be.
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.480]  Kamala Harris will be every bit as eager, and that's the point.
[59:25.480 --> 59:28.920]  If Biden Harris still doesn't make sense to you as a ticket, it's only because you're
[59:28.920 --> 59:31.280]  not cynical enough.
[59:31.280 --> 59:33.640]  Harris clearly wasn't picked for her personal charm.
[59:33.640 --> 59:36.240]  More than 30 years ago, she dated a man called Willie Brown.
[59:36.240 --> 59:38.280]  He was later the mayor of San Francisco.
[59:38.280 --> 59:39.920]  She was 29 years old at the time.
[59:39.920 --> 59:42.080]  Brown was 60 and still married.
[59:42.080 --> 59:43.880]  Brown launched Harris's political career.
[59:43.880 --> 59:45.480]  He knows her very well.
[59:45.480 --> 59:50.560]  Last week, Brown publicly urged Joe Biden not to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate.
[59:50.560 --> 59:54.320]  But it turns out Willie Brown's opinion no longer matters in the Democratic Party.
[59:54.320 --> 59:56.720]  Jeff Bezos' opinion matters.
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:01.200]  So do the opinions of his fellow Bay Area tech titans and the finance mobiles in New
[1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:02.200]  York.
[1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:04.800]  Here's the people who bankroll the Democratic Party.
[1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:09.440]  They are the economic engine of the left, and they love Kamala Harris.
[1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:10.640]  Not personally.
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:11.720]  It's business.
[1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:15.640]  Their main interest is in keeping the government carve-outs that have made them rich.
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:19.920]  They know the last thing Kamala Harris will do is threaten any of those.
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.640]  Never, under any circumstances.
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.280]  One thing you can be certain of, in a Biden-Harris administration, private equity barons will
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.340]  still pay half the tax rate you pay.
[1:00:30.340 --> 1:00:32.600]  And that's the real point.
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:36.520]  Voters may not like Kamala Harris, but Wall Street does, just in case you're wondering
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:38.720]  who is actually in charge.
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:44.480]  And yet still, even politicians have souls, technically anyway.
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:50.160]  So how could Joe Biden pick a running mate who once publicly denounced him as a racist?
[1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.160]  You remember the moment?
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:52.160]  It was at a debate last summer.
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:56.840]  I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden.
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:04.000]  I do not believe you are a racist, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.920]  her public schools, and she was bused to school every day.
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:17.440]  And that little girl was me.
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:19.520]  I do not believe you are a racist.
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.720]  I do not believe you beat your wife, right?
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:26.840]  Kamala Harris, civil rights icon, actually Harris grew up mostly in Canada.
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:31.400]  And in any case, forced busing was a disaster from the beginning to the end.
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:34.040]  Nobody liked it, including black families.
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:38.160]  Joe Biden may be a bigot, but it's not because he opposed forced busing.
[1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:40.600]  But apparently he's forgiven Harris for that slur.
[1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:42.560]  Maybe he doesn't even remember it.
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:48.040]  But even a giving 77-year-old must have some memory of what Harris once said about his
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:49.920]  purported sex crimes.
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:54.360]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:59.560]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:05.080]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.360]  thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:13.160]  They are openly wargaming this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party.
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:17.760]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election, Trump
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:18.760]  is going.
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:24.000]  Let's hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris, and that anyone challenging
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.560]  that will be called a racist.
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:30.680]  They will then trigger race riots and violence they've already beta tested around the country.
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:33.880]  We are not living in normal times.
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:37.280]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:41.320]  they can't believe that they're living in such a criminal era.
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:42.320]  We are.
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:45.640]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:48.440]  America is being exposed and removed.
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:52.200]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:03:17.280]  Spread the word now, Paul Reverez.
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:18.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:21.440]  We're into the second hour of the transmission.
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:22.440]  Thank you for tuning in.
[1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  Thank you for spreading the word.
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:24.440]  That's how we're going to win this war.
[1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:28.200]  That's why big tech is trying to censor not just us, but you and the president, everybody
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:29.520]  else that wants to be free.
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  They're a group of out of control tyrants who never are held responsible for anything
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:35.520]  they get caught doing.
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:39.960]  Not be attempted coup against the president, not be attempted coup against the election.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:47.240]  And the American people, not all the coups they run around the world.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:50.680]  They believe they are invincible because they control the corporate media and the central
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:51.680]  banks.
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:57.280]  But despite all their fraud, all the different top analysts are projecting that Trump is
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:58.760]  going to win in a landslide.
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:03.400]  And so the Democrats began preparing the ground the last few months, saying, if he can test
[1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.160]  it, we're going to have the military overthrowing.
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:11.680]  And now they've been very, very specific with all of us.
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.920]  They've been extremely specific and they've told us exactly what they're going to do.
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:19.640]  And I think that's a pretty big deal, don't you?
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:23.760]  You know, the president says Kamala Harris is who he would have picked because she is
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:24.760]  so weak.
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.480]  But see, that's if you're trying to win the election, none of you're trying to contest
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.640]  it and tear the country apart.
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:41.160]  So here is the president saying that he likes Harris and that Harris would have been his
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:42.160]  choice.
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:43.160]  Thank you.
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:44.160]  Thank you, President Trump.
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:49.320]  If I could have two questions, I'd like to ask you one about Senator Harris's record
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:52.280]  and then a different one about FISA abuse.
[1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:57.480]  So regarding Senator Harris's record, you had a pretty quick response to that.
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.160]  You had that out that said that she was a phony and I wanted to drill down.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.160]  She was a what?
[1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:03.160]  A phony.
[1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:04.160]  A phony.
[1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:09.160]  And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment.
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:16.040]  On San Francisco D.A., she oversaw, according to the Mercury News, 1,900 marijuana convictions.
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:19.960]  But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana and she appeared
[1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:23.840]  to joke and according to some people, lie and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg
[1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:24.840]  and Tupac.
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:28.960]  Well, their music hadn't come out at the time while she said she was smoking pot and listening
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:29.960]  to it.
[1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:30.960]  Why would she lie about that?
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:35.960]  Do you see that as more evidence than is surpassed by marijuana liability?
[1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:36.960]  Well she lied.
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:40.720]  She said things that were untrue.
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:47.840]  She is a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true.
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.520]  She's very big into raising taxes.
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:56.480]  She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody can even believe.
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:59.320]  She is against fracking.
[1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:02.880]  Fracking is, she's against petroleum products.
[1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:09.840]  I mean, how do you do that in going to Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great state of
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:10.840]  Texas?
[1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.360]  She's against fracking.
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.840]  Fracking is a big deal.
[1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:19.960]  She's in favor of socialized medicine where you're going to lose your doctors, you're
[1:06:19.960 --> 1:06:21.720]  going to lose your plans.
[1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:30.680]  She wants to take your health care plans away from 180 million Americans, 180 million Americans
[1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:37.040]  that are very happy with their health insurance, and she wants to take that away.
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.520]  So she was my number one pick.
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:42.560]  I mean, she was, as they would say, because hopefully you'll start college football.
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:46.200]  She was my number one draft pick.
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:53.000]  So yes, she would be the number one weakest person pulled at 1% throughout the entire
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  primary process.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.600]  You know, the establishment was behind her.
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:57.440]  She went over like a lead balloon.
[1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:00.520]  People ask me back at the time, who do I think will win?
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:04.640]  The nomination, I thought Kamala Harris, because that's who they wanted.
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:06.080]  And Joe Biden was faltering so bad.
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:09.600]  They just said, oh, we'll use Joe as a placeholder.
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:10.600]  She's getting too much heat.
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:11.600]  She's too unpopular.
[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:14.040]  We'll hold her back and then insert her.
[1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:18.400]  They were thinking about Hillary, but Hillary and Bill are running the UN, the contact
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:20.520]  racing, all this global stuff.
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:24.560]  They're sitting back now as a puppet masters still in control of Obama.
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:28.720]  And so they're just putting these two weak individuals in there.
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:33.840]  They believe for control, but if they'd asked me the question, when does she flip flop?
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:35.680]  When did she tell different stories?
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:42.800]  She said she believes the accusers of Biden that he sexually assaulted them and that Biden
[1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:43.800]  needed to step down.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:44.800]  He shouldn't run.
[1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:47.000]  But now she loves Biden and doesn't believe them.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.920]  I mean, boom, boom, boom.
[1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:50.920]  That's the big one.
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.920]  Let's play a clip of her saying it.
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:53.920]  Here it is.
[1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:59.720]  I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:00.720]  to do it.
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:03.720]  Do you believe that the vice president shouldn't do this race?
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:07.040]  Oh, he's going to have to make that decision for himself.
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:09.720]  I wouldn't tell him what to do.
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:10.720]  Okay.
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:12.920]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:16.520]  I want to start going to your calls right now.
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:21.520]  If you look at this as her as a challenger to Trump, you think she's weak.
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:27.200]  Think again, she's part black, so they can then say, when she can test the election,
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.880]  if you can test that, you're being mean to a black woman.
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:30.880]  She's above reproach.
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:34.400]  The media is already saying you can't criticize her or you're a racist.
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:40.360]  Most people will bow down and roll over on their backs and show their yellow bellies.
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:41.520]  And that's just how this works.
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:45.600]  And then when they can test, they can trigger the riots nationwide.
[1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:48.720]  And then they have their placeholder if Trump is removed.
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:52.680]  And the Democrats say we intend to put the country into such a crisis that the military
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:57.080]  and the establishment will act to remove Trump to save themselves.
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:02.200]  So we have this criminal group of crazy people on the Chai Kampay roll making a run at all
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  of us.
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.840]  Tyson, Robert, Dylan, Jacob, Tom, Matthew, Trey, Chris, Snaps, Robert, we're going to
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:09.840]  all of you.
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:12.600]  Trey from Georgia, Trey, you're up first.
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:13.600]  Thank you.
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:15.840]  Alex, how are you doing?
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:16.840]  I love your show.
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:17.840]  Well, I love you too, brother.
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:19.040]  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm all right.
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:20.240]  I mean, how are you doing?
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:22.280]  I mean, I'm sitting there wondering, what do we do?
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:23.280]  How do we respond?
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:24.280]  What does Trump do?
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:26.440]  I'll tell you what, I'm fired up.
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:33.080]  I just got to tell you, I warn family, friends, everyone, I almost prophesize every day almost
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.360]  that we've got to get prepared.
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:40.040]  I don't want people to forget how she treated Kavanaugh.
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:46.120]  I think she was an obvious choice for her connections and how embedded she is.
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:50.040]  And also, she wasn't such an open Marxist like some of the others.
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:53.200]  So they couldn't, he couldn't choose them.
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:56.200]  And also, she's from San Francisco area, correct?
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:57.200]  Yes.
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:58.200]  The DA or?
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:09:59.200]  Yes.
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:00.200]  Look who's the DA now in San Francisco.
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.520]  He's the son of the top weatherman bombers.
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:05.520]  That's right.
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:06.520]  Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dorn.
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:09.360]  I mean, this goes deep.
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.360]  People need to wake up.
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:11.360]  I, and also.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.360]  Oh yeah.
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:16.440]  Yeah, all these people are weatherman alumni or their children.
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.920]  Absolutely.
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:22.360]  And if people do not wake up to this, this is, then you know what, keep their heads in
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:23.360]  the sand.
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:25.160]  I've got a bug out plan, family, friends.
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:26.560]  We are ready.
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:33.680]  And I mean, truly, this is, I pray every day, I have two young daughters and I'll be damned
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:36.280]  if I'm going to let something take their nation down.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:37.800]  It's over my dead body.
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:43.000]  But I do want to plug Alex, I've got six months of the Patriots supply.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.880]  I take your supplements every day.
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:52.040]  The red pill, a red pill plus, I take the X2 and I just appreciate everything you do.
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:54.280]  Well, brother, I really appreciate you.
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.160]  And I'm here to tell you, you keep us on air under incredible withering attacks.
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:00.120]  But we're stronger before it.
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:03.320]  So just your word of mouth, your prayer and your financial support when you also get great
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:05.480]  products at the same time is a 360 win.
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:06.680]  So thank you so much, sir.
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:09.760]  All right, let's jam in one more before we go to break here.
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:11.160]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:12.800]  Robert, you're on the air.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  Hey, Alex.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:15.800]  Welcome.
[1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:16.800]  Can you hear me okay?
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  I can, yes.
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:22.800]  Alex, you asked the question about what Trump should do about succession.
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:27.200]  Well, I asked you, what did you do about everything that's going on?
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:30.840]  He's limited there in the swamp, actually.
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.760]  And obviously, they're censoring him in all media that he can.
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:41.560]  I think, again, that he should go on television and do a fireside chat and address the nation
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:46.600]  like the old days and that we communicate directly to the people that that way.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:48.280]  Yeah, they don't want to press conference.
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:51.160]  They want him directly talking to us.
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:56.240]  I think every night in the next 80 days, because they shut down the rallies through all the
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  fear.
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.760]  Oh, he can't have a rally, but the communists can.
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:03.160]  And so I totally he's got to go on the warpath.
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:04.600]  He's got to expose.
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:08.640]  He's got to start talking about their plan to have states secede and have that repudiated
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:11.120]  ahead of them announcing it.
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  Absolutely.
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:13.120]  Absolutely.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:14.120]  And I think he should go on.
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:19.360]  That's the only way I think he can reach the people's directives by back on television.
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:25.200]  Even after he's elected again, he should go and continue doing that.
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:29.640]  And also, I want to take something else out, Alex, that we you talk about a lot about praying
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:30.640]  and everyone should be praying.
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.840]  I want to know Robert, I don't want to cut you short.
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:36.200]  I'll put you on hold and come right back to Robert after the break and then every other
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.120]  call over getting to all of you.
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:40.480]  And I'm going to give you my views on what the president needs to do, but it's very similar
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:42.240]  to what Robert was just saying.
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.840]  And believe me, the president ends up getting this information and we need the rest of talk
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:46.200]  radio to get this.
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.440]  This is the main talking point, not making fun of Kamala Harris.
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:50.440]  Stay with us.
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:57.600]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.520]  serious cognitive problems.
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:04.280]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.200]  allied crime syndicates.
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:09.440]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.880]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms and others.
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:20.400]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:25.040]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.760]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:38.280]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:43.280]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:47.200]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.920]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:52.000]  We must expose the globalist.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:57.800]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had serious
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:13:59.300]  cognitive problems.
[1:13:59.300 --> 1:14:04.040]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:05.920]  allied crime syndicates.
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:09.200]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.640]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms and others.
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:20.120]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.800]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:34.440]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:38.000]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.960]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:46.880]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:56.000]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster, we must expose the globalist.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:25.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:33.600]  We are living in such incredibly historic times that I just feel horribly guilty that
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:38.400]  when I'm not doing enough, I lay in bed at night for hours.
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:41.480]  I normally go to sleep so easy just trying to think about what can I do?
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:43.040]  What can I say?
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:44.280]  What should we say to the president?
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:45.760]  What can he do?
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:49.720]  And God just literally touches my heart and says, you need to pray more for people to
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:50.720]  awaken.
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:52.240]  You need to pray more for Providence.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:55.320]  You need to pray that the enemy's plans be frustrated.
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:59.960]  I mean, if you read what our ancestors did when they would win battles and wars, they
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:04.400]  would pray for days before those battles and seriously ask for God's guidance and ask
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.720]  for God's intervention and Providence is real.
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:11.320]  Of course, Washington was obsessed with it and it was 100% real.
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:16.280]  You have to get God involved in everything and you have to promise God that you're going
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:17.280]  to take action.
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:22.680]  So I think the biggest solution here is what I'm guessing Robert's about to go to is humble
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:28.000]  ourselves and really not be arrogant and private people and really think about the
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:33.320]  bad things we've done individually and really commit to God that we're going to stand up
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:37.080]  against evil and we're going to speak out against it and we're going to take action
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:43.400]  and then do it because if God sees us take action, then God will get behind us like
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:47.800]  wind in the sails, but we just sit there and do nothing.
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:53.320]  God will not be with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we are facing true evil and I know it
[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:54.320]  makes you sick.
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:57.520]  It makes me sick to see people going against their own common sense and against their own
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:02.280]  interests and just throwing everything away and to see the evil boiling out of all their
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:07.760]  rat holes, pointing guns to innocent people at Antifa checkpoints and burning down courthouses
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:11.120]  and screaming, we love Satan and just all of it.
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.680]  But that's what we've allowed to breed, that's what we've allowed to grow.
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:18.360]  So that's what we become, at least in many areas.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:23.000]  And there's just a spirit of decadence, there's a spirit of anger, there's a spirit of not
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  being thankful.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.160]  And one thing my dad taught me that's always been important is being thankful for everything
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:34.160]  you get, for every breath you take, for every person you love, for every chance you've had,
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:39.120]  for all the beauty you've seen in the world, thanking God for that every minute is what's
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:40.400]  going to lift us up.
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:44.680]  The average leftist has money, power, you name it, and they are not happy.
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.320]  The average leftist minion doesn't have it, but the controllers do.
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:52.040]  And they're the most unhappy, empty people in the world.
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:56.680]  I've been to globalist events, and Democrat events, and you get around them and they're
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:02.400]  all empty and they're all walking over each other trying to say things and look genuine
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.400]  and it's totally fake.
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:11.040]  That's why the Hollywood and globalist money never was enticing.
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:14.520]  I mean, if it had smelled good and looked good and felt good to my soul, I might have
[1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:15.520]  got into it.
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:18.560]  But it was not hard to say no.
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:25.560]  It's creepy, it stinks, it's cold, it's creepy crawly, and everything that God and Jesus
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:34.800]  gives me is just warm and powerful and strong and focused and true but humbling.
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:38.640]  And I look at the eyes of Hollywood people in these Hollywood magazines and publications
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:41.080]  and they just look demonically possessed.
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:45.760]  They could be black, they could be white, and I watch LeBron James when he's talking
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:50.440]  about himself and everything, and it's just delusion.
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:54.720]  They're just running a program in their head that they're God and you're not God.
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:59.440]  And so I really think it's we need to repent, and other than that I'll talk if we take more
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.680]  calls about what I think Trump should do, but we're taking your calls about what Trump
[1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:03.680]  should do right now.
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:05.880]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting from California, go ahead.
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.160]  No, Alex, I agree with you.
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:10.640]  We talk about pray for intervention and that's true.
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:15.520]  Let me also let you know and the listeners know that there will be a worldwide national
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:22.920]  day of repentance on prayer rally at the Washington DC Mall on September 26th, so that's a worldwide
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:24.440]  national day of prayer.
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:31.960]  I want to tell you that you go to the returnwebsite.org, that's the returnwebsite.org, get more
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:37.840]  information, but that will be a national and worldwide day of prayer.
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:42.520]  All denominations, just go there and get the information and God help us all.
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:43.520]  And thank you, Alex.
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:44.520]  I love you so much.
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:45.520]  I listen to your show.
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:46.520]  Thank you, brother.
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:47.800]  Please just spread the word.
[1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:48.800]  We've got it.
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:49.800]  We've just got to get the word out.
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:50.800]  We've got to be the Paul reveres.
[1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:56.200]  I know it keeps saying that, but now I wish I was wrong about all this every day.
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:58.680]  People say on the street, man, you're vindicated.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:19:59.680]  I bet you're feeling good.
[1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:03.920]  I'm like, no, I ain't feeling good.
[1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:04.920]  I'm feeling good about this.
[1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:05.920]  I know you're not either.
[1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:06.920]  This is bad, folks.
[1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:07.920]  This is bad.
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:09.720]  But I don't say that to scare you.
[1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:11.720]  I say that to get everybody moving.
[1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:15.080]  All right, this has been holding the longest here.
[1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:18.480]  Is it Robert or is it Jacob?
[1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:23.120]  Is it Tom?
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:26.040]  Tom in Delaware, then Tyson and others.
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:27.040]  Go ahead, Tom.
[1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:28.040]  You're on the air.
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:29.040]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:33.280]  I'm working with an action alert for patriots in the Delaware Valley.
[1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:37.880]  Anybody within a 50 mile radius of Wilmington, Delaware needs to show up at AI DuPont High
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:39.600]  School in Wilmington, Delaware.
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:40.600]  I have the address.
[1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:47.120]  If you have your pen and paper, it's 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 1-9807, Joe Biden
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:53.200]  and Kamala Harris will be appearing at my alma mater in the state that he and the globalists
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:57.400]  like to use as their launch pad for their corporate agenda.
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:02.560]  And I think if Trump needs to do something, so do we, and we can all do something by showing
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.560]  up.
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:05.840]  Woody Allen said 50% of life is showing up.
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:09.600]  So anybody within the sound of my voice that can get there, it's less than an hour from
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:10.600]  Philadelphia.
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:17.080]  50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 1-9807, type it in your ways, let's show up and tell
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:18.480]  Biden what we think.
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:20.760]  Well, I agree.
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:24.600]  We've got videos of Biden being in front of San Antonio about the pedophilia and all
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:25.600]  the rest of it.
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:28.000]  We should get those back out and start running those.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:35.280]  But the fact that Kamala Harris's family, not a long time ago, but in the last century
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:39.560]  had slaves in Jamaica, and people that were basically sharecroppers, still blacks living
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:44.240]  on their plantation, I mean, it's just, you can't, and then Hillary's caught smuggling
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:48.520]  kidnapped kids out of Haiti, it's just like, it is the craziest thing.
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:54.320]  And now their whole DNC events going to be the Clintons and Obama again, I mean, this
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:56.500]  is unbelievable.
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:22:01.320]  They think that Delaware is a sleepy backwater that they can use to set up these events away
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:04.480]  from, you know, national press coverage.
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:08.840]  And to your point with the pedophilia, Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden, who is revered as
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:14.840]  a sort of saint because he died of brain cancer, a former attorney general of Delaware, gave
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:20.900]  a plea deal to Rob Richards IV, who is a DuPont heir, son of the partner and one of the largest
[1:22:20.900 --> 1:22:25.760]  corporate law firms in Wilmington molested his own children, three and five years old.
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:30.760]  Oh, listen, I know somebody that grew up with the DuPont and he said, it's devil worship
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  pedophilia and a bunch of the kids are trans and because they're just rejecting their identity
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:40.800]  and it's just, it's the money's destroyed them, they're completely mentally ill.
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.120]  And that's one of the most powerful families in this country.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.800]  And that's where all this sickness comes from is the sick families that are worth hundreds
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:52.080]  of billions of dollars or more, leveraging trillions, they have an agenda to ruin your
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:56.800]  life because you're happy, you're successful, you got red blood, you may be an old black
[1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:03.040]  truck driver or a young white mechanic or an Asian school teacher or whatever you are.
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:07.360]  If you love God and justice and are thankful and appreciate life, they hate your guts
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:09.200]  because they've turned their back on life.
[1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:13.560]  Tom, tell me where this event is one more time because yes, everywhere they go, people
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.480]  need to RSVP to try to get in, most of these events will be staged, go out and bullhorn
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:19.520]  them outside, stream into the world.
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:20.520]  Go ahead.
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:24.800]  So the address is 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 1-9-8-0-7.
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:28.600]  There's no security, you can go in, there's a giant ring road around the entire school.
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:33.000]  We need to fill that road up with patriots screaming at Joe Biden because he thinks he's
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.240]  going to have a nice quiet rally.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:39.600]  The AP article said, there will be no adoring throngs due to coronavirus restrictions.
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.080]  Well we need to prove how true that is.
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:44.120]  That's right, Corona is a smoke screen that they have no support.
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:48.440]  Corona is the lock down smoke screen, it's all a giant hook, stay with us, more call
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:50.280]  straight ahead.
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:57.200]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there, have
[1:23:57.200 --> 1:24:01.480]  all gone on national TV, have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of
[1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:06.880]  the New York Times, that they're wargaming contesting the election when they lose.
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:08.360]  They know there's a landslide.
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:13.640]  If they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:19.160]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:20.160]  Harris.
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:25.360]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.520]  try to drive Trump from office.
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:32.080]  The Democratic Party, the Chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:38.200]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:44.200]  riots and martial law that you're racist when in truth an old Nazi collaborator George Soros
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:48.880]  created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa, America's fighting for its life but we will
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:49.880]  win.
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:56.720]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there, have
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.040]  all gone on national TV, have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:06.440]  the New York Times, that they're wargaming contesting the election when they lose.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.040]  They know there's a landslide, that they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:16.760]  it and have Democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:19.520]  Joe Biden and the other public Kamala Harris.
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:24.960]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:27.120]  try to drive Trump from office.
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:31.680]  The Democratic Party, the Chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:37.760]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:43.280]  riots and martial law that you're racist when in truth an old Nazi collaborator George
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:48.200]  Soros created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa, America's fighting for its life but
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:49.200]  we will win.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:55.200]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:58.680]  to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of
[1:25:58.680 --> 1:26:03.760]  slavery and they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry, liberal
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.440]  academics and others and now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:12.480]  going to try to steal the election and contest it but then their internal war gaming documents
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:17.560]  come out with John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of course Joe Biden
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:21.560]  and they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose but we're going to have the Democrat
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:26.440]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote and we are then going to
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:29.520]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:33.320]  This is officially in the New York Times, I don't just believe the New York Times, I've
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.320]  been telling you for over a year this is their plan for other statements they've made and
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:41.600]  then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:42.600]  on Farm Relations.
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:43.600]  This is their plan.
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:45.160]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:46.160]  What are you going to do?
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:47.160]  I'm serious, folks.
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:53.480]  This is the time to save the country.
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:27:07.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:12.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:24.520]  Alex Jones.
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:36.080]  Let the news up in the air.
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:37.080]  Let the bars, you rock and roll.
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.080]  Let the good times roll.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:39.080]  Let the good times roll.
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:40.080]  Let the good times roll.
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:41.080]  Let the good times roll.
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:42.080]  All right, let's try to go to a bunch of your calls now in this segment.
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:45.360]  I have dozens of incredible reports.
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:51.040]  All these amazing articles, huge astronomical discoveries, science discoveries, human animal
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:57.800]  cloning news, George Soros trying to crash the U.S. dollar and that's part of this overthrow.
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:03.640]  But the Democrats hatched up the Russiagate thing and we told you that and then it was
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.640]  a three year fiasco, two and a half year fiasco.
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:14.180]  And now they're hatching up that they're not going to concede and that they're going to
[1:28:14.180 --> 1:28:19.280]  just say Biden's the president because he wins the popular vote in certain blue states
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.480]  and that they are forming a new America with a new inauguration.
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:26.400]  She said it's not about geography.
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:27.560]  He'll have his inauguration.
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:28.720]  We'll have ours.
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:31.040]  That's how globalists operate.
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.800]  They want to end the convention to bring in their control.
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:39.160]  Remember Leo Zagani seven years before the new Jesuit Pope came in.
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:41.160]  He said it will be this Jesuit Pope.
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:42.160]  The other pope will stand down.
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:46.600]  You'll have two popes at once and then they're going to get rid of a pope and have a council
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:50.600]  so that it's totally controlled by them because they don't even want one person in power.
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:52.400]  That's why they don't want Biden that strong.
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:53.600]  They don't want Harris that strong.
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:58.000]  They don't even trust minions because sometimes they'll get uppity.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.800]  They want people totally compromised and that's what this is and they're making the move.
[1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:05.520]  Donald Trump is their worst nightmare.
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:12.400]  Pig-headed, smart, pro-America, common sense, pragmatic, not scared of them.
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:13.800]  He's God's sin.
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:16.040]  It's how the universe works.
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:17.840]  But do we respond and support that?
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:23.440]  A lot of people get mad at Trump because he can't get everything done we want, folks.
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:28.840]  I got over a hundred crew members total with our operations and the things we do and if
[1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:31.600]  they weren't behind me all the way, we couldn't get anything done.
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:35.760]  You imagine Trump with all the traders and backstabbers and double talkers and triple
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:38.760]  dealers.
[1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:42.000]  I don't even like telling my crew what to do because I don't like boss people around
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.080]  and they're great and I want to quit sometimes because I don't like being in charge.
[1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:50.920]  You imagine what it's like for Trump with backstabbers all around him.
[1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:53.240]  At 46 years old, I couldn't do it.
[1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:57.200]  He's 74 years old.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:01.160]  Now he does yell and scream at people and does throw fits, but who wouldn't because he's
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:03.600]  got to be on all the rest of the time.
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:10.640]  Believe me, but it's just incredible and we should be praying for President Trump, but
[1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:13.640]  I will tell you this.
[1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:16.520]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:17.520]  I'll tell you next time.
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:18.520]  I think the president should do.
[1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:21.960]  We're taking your calls on what you think he should do right now.
[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:22.960]  Tyson in Mississippi.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:23.960]  You're on the air.
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:24.960]  Welcome, Tyson.
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:25.960]  What's going on?
[1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:26.960]  That's how you doing today?
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:29.800]  Man, I just think every minute counts right now.
[1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:33.640]  I've never had it on my heart so strong that it's due or die and the stakes have never
[1:30:33.640 --> 1:30:34.640]  been higher.
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:35.640]  What do you think?
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:36.640]  Yes, sir.
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.640]  I agree with you.
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:39.640]  Absolutely.
[1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:44.880]  I believe Corona, this whole Corona deal has expanded the internet, societal internet
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:51.520]  integration and through that, it's making us go rely on Apple and these big tech industries
[1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:56.800]  because it's forcing society to use their products because everything from all corporations
[1:30:56.800 --> 1:30:58.800]  now has their apps.
[1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:03.200]  Part of the AI takeover and then when more deadly viruses come out, robots and driverless
[1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:05.120]  cars will have to take care of us.
[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:07.520]  We're being domesticated right now.
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:08.520]  That's exactly right.
[1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:13.480]  I also don't know why we sit back and we just allow these things to happen and because
[1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:18.880]  it's that people don't know about it and when people find out about it, they just don't
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:20.800]  care to even change anything about it.
[1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:25.720]  Well, that's because they've all been taught to be responders in the spectator sense, not
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.560]  actors, not people that are actually involved and engaged.
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:30.440]  So everyone's thinking one dimensional.
[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:35.440]  They don't respect themselves and they don't think they're going to get ahead by caring
[1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:40.840]  that they're being screwed over and so really they've been given over the grand delusion.
[1:31:40.840 --> 1:31:46.080]  And also with this whole internet integration, it's also normalizing the mail-in ballots
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:49.960]  because I need to get my groceries delivered to my house now.
[1:31:49.960 --> 1:31:53.000]  Well, I can't go out in public, I'll get Corona.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:56.840]  So now I need to mail in my ballot and they don't even understand that's breaking down
[1:31:56.840 --> 1:32:01.360]  the roads, the civilization, the infrastructure that's built around us traveling and moving
[1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:02.360]  and being involved.
[1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:08.760]  They're destroying the human infrastructure that no military or war could do.
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:09.760]  Kill people, break things.
[1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:15.120]  Well, this is killing industry, killing savings, killing infrastructure, killing the production
[1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:20.360]  capacity in a trade war with China, but it's a bigger picture about the AI takeover and
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:22.680]  they admit now it's about the AI takeover.
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:23.680]  You're absolutely right.
[1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:25.840]  What does President Trump need to do?
[1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:32.760]  Well, first of all, so it's not, the question is, would you get a neural link brain chip?
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:33.760]  That's not the question.
[1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:39.320]  The question is, should we allow people to have internet integrated AI neural implants?
[1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:44.680]  Because once we allow people to have AI implants, then that completely will change society as
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:45.680]  we know it.
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:49.560]  Not just for the people who do have them, but it will completely change for the people
[1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:50.680]  who don't have them.
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:57.800]  And Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, they're all racing Elon Musk with their brain chip
[1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.320]  neural uplinks as the new future.
[1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:06.080]  And there's a sub view that no one in the mainstream media will say anything against
[1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:07.080]  it.
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:08.720]  No one comprehended it all.
[1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:09.720]  That's right.
[1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:13.000]  We were total cooks to warn this was all coming decades ago.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:14.080]  Now it's here.
[1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:15.600]  It's all positive reporting on it.
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:17.200]  And if you don't like it, you're bad.
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:18.200]  Thank you, sir.
[1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:19.200]  Great points.
[1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:21.200]  It's revelation.
[1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:22.200]  It's all happening.
[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:25.320]  And the globalist admit it's about a post-human world to make humans obsolete.
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:28.800]  And then those that choose to, quote, live will voluntarily give up their bodies and
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:29.800]  be uploaded.
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  No, you're going to be dying.
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:36.000]  But see, to criticize someone becoming trans, it's not about chopping your balls off, folks.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  That's just phase one.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:41.200]  Not just about becoming a cyborg, you have to give the body up to be carbon neutral and
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:42.200]  save the earth.
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:46.720]  And then you can't say that someone in a computer that copies their voice, their personality
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:52.280]  that even has a machine avatar or even a flesh avatar, you can't ever say that's not real.
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.600]  That will be the ultimate thought crime because they need everyone to voluntarily kill themselves
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:58.920]  believing they're uploading.
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:04.560]  Believe me, years from now, if you can even find this information, you'll be watching this
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:05.560]  going.
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:06.560]  How did he know this?
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:07.560]  The enemy is public about it.
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:10.360]  She having another call here.
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:16.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Florida.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  Robert, you're on the air.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Welcome.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Hello, sir.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  How are you doing?
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  My name is Robert Christensen.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.600]  I'm over here in Spring Hill, Florida, and I was the spark to something that is taking
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:33.280]  off like a wildfire in this area called Operation Flag Drop.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.320]  Tell us about it.
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:37.320]  All right.
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.720]  And pretty much it's every Friday, 6pm to 8pm.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:41.720]  Okay.
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.440]  Every Friday you get people together, you get to a main intersection and you do your
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:51.400]  love for Trump, get out, get people active, get people on the ground in these everywhere,
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:52.400]  everywhere.
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:56.160]  6pm to 8pm to show the polls are lying.
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:01.160]  Also expose the scam demic for what it is and, you know, bring people together in the
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:04.800]  community because, you know, promote your small businesses that are coming out to those
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:05.800]  flag drops.
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:09.640]  Promote your local candidates that are running for election in those areas.
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:10.640]  See who stands with Trump.
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:16.080]  This is pure genius and if Trump won't have the rallies because these people are too cowardly,
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:19.560]  we all have to start having these rallies for Trump and America everywhere.
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:21.720]  We have to hit the streets in a peaceful way.
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:23.120]  You're an absolute genius.
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:26.440]  Is there a website or do people just pay to get together and say, we're going to be at
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:30.720]  the corner of this with flags and just it'll be one of you at first and then you drive
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:33.600]  by your honk, pull over and join them.
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.640]  Tell us how this started and what's coming next.
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.320]  That's exactly how this started because there was Joe Biden people rallying over here.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:45.000]  I just wanted my taco bell, but then he said that American flags, a symbol of oppression
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.080]  and that Donald Trump supporters are too cowardly to face and I went and stood out there by myself
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:51.600]  with a homemade Trump sign.
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:55.040]  Next thing I know, there's 10 people standing with me and we said, let's keep this going.
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:01.640]  Now we have over 550 active members in our area and then nationally we got over 12,000
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:05.720]  people participating last Friday.
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:09.160]  Join the national flag drop movement to save America.
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:12.240]  People put an article in a video out on this brother.
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:15.800]  Is there, I know Facebook will probably man a page if you have it, but where can people
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:19.280]  find photos or information about this?
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.960]  Hill operation flag drop Trump 2020 on Facebook.
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:25.800]  We also do a coffee with conservatives.
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:27.240]  It's a little like a little talk show.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:29.760]  You inspired me to do it.
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:30.760]  Very exciting.
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:31.760]  Say that again.
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:32.760]  How do people find you?
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:33.760]  Right on Facebook.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.240]  Coffee with conservatives or Spring Hill operation flag drop Trump 2020.
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:41.040]  I want operation flag drop nationwide.
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:42.040]  That is a huge solution.
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:43.920]  I'm going to do it myself this Friday.
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:45.680]  You've got my commitment.
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:50.400]  Operation flag drop goes live worldwide.
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:53.640]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:59.400]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:03.120]  the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president.
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:07.640]  That's what she's been said on CBS news and then you're going to have those blue states
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:08.640]  succeed.
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:09.640]  Yes.
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:13.520]  That's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are backed
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:17.080]  by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms and the whole globalist system.
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:22.280]  This is treason with a capital T and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards.
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:26.160]  They won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has been
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:27.160]  exposing it.
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:28.160]  Here's the bottom line.
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:29.680]  You need storeable food.
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:32.080]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now.
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:35.760]  Two to four week delivery with 80 days out from the election, you need to get high quality
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:39.320]  storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this off.
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:42.200]  We're going to have a great depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:43.480]  look like a cake walk.
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:48.200]  Your high quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:50.360]  Get prepared.
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:53.640]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:59.360]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:03.080]  the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president.
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:07.680]  That's what she's been said on CBS News and that you're going to have those blue states
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  succeed.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.680]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:17.080]  The Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms and the whole globalist system.
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:22.280]  This is treason with a capital T and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards.
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:26.160]  They won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has been
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:27.160]  exposing it.
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.160]  Here's the bottom line.
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:29.680]  You need storeable food.
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:33.680]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two to four week delivery with
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:34.680]  80 days out from the election.
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.680]  You need to get high quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this
[1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:39.680]  off.
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:42.200]  We're going to have a great depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior
[1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:43.200]  look like a cake walk.
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:48.200]  Get your high quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:50.440]  Get prepared.
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:54.600]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything.
[1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:58.880]  They also bet as they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will adapt
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:03.160]  to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:07.080]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:10.320]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.160]  They lied about where it came from.
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:16.800]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:17.800]  at 4%.
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:23.560]  But it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:26.600]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:30.560]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:33.960]  They only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now or six months later.
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:35.560]  Now they say it's permanent.
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:39.280]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.320]  you go and what you do the global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:46.720]  questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:48.360]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:50.280]  That's called world government takeover.
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:53.560]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert.
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.440]  As of taping this alert, you're 82 days out from the election.
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:01.440]  As many of you know in the last year, I've pointed out statements out of the council
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.640]  on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:06.640]  in a landslide.
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:10.080]  So their strategy will be to contest the election.
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:14.960]  If they fail to successfully steal it, then they are openly now war gaining.
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.720]  This is in the New York Times.
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.440]  Having Democrat states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:25.080]  policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:27.480]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:31.240]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in DC.
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:37.920]  They said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:41.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:43.920]  This is their public criminal plan.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:44.920]  We should be praying.
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:46.320]  We should be spreading the word.
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:54.000]  We should be demanding Trump won the office to expose this criminal activity.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:07.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:11.120]  This nation is under siege.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:16.240]  They've created a normalcy bias where we just think things are okay and that we're still
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:19.280]  in a free country and the social contract hasn't been broken.
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:24.360]  It's been broken by the deep state, by the globalist, by the Democrats, by all the slobs
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:28.160]  that have not been working for decades and expect us to take care of them that want to
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:29.440]  hold us hostage.
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:33.320]  And now the Democrats are holding the country hostage saying they're going to contest the
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:34.320]  election.
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:39.200]  They know there's going to be a landslide.
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:44.160]  And so they're going to have states secede and they're going to trigger race war on the
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:50.520]  back of George Floyd, whereas I could show you four videos that came out just since
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:56.040]  last night of white people being executed just because they're white and white people
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:41:57.040]  being beaten.
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:58.040]  But you know what?
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:03.400]  I can't even bring myself to do it.
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:06.080]  But I will because we have to.
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:11.840]  Long narrative US mainstream media mom on murder of five-year-old white boy shot in
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:16.640]  the back of the head in his own front yard by the black neighbor because he rode his
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:21.600]  bike through the edge of his yard, killed him execution style in front of his two seven
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:24.600]  eight-year-old sisters.
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:27.760]  The father looking out the window thought it was a joke, thought it must have been a
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:33.080]  cap gun, but it wasn't the zero coverage in the mainstream media.
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:41.320]  This happened four or five days ago, only hit the real media yesterday and Twitter and
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:44.480]  Facebook are blocking posts about it.
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:45.480]  Dehumanizing.
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:46.480]  Now I don't want race riots.
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:51.000]  I want to randomly go target black people because a crazy black person looks like he's
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.800]  out of his mind, killed him.
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:56.800]  I want to see the guy get the death penalty, but not because he's black.
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:00.920]  I mean, if your white guy ran up and you shot some little black kid randomly, you'd have
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:05.480]  this country burning down right now because the media would say it's not a crazy white
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:06.480]  guy.
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:09.720]  It's every white person's fault.
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:14.000]  So this poor little white boy, no one will ever care about his name.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:20.080]  He's got to go fund me that our camera guy actually gave some money to pitiful almost
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:21.080]  no money's been given to him.
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:25.600]  If he was black, it'd be a $50 million right now, but it all be directed to Kamala Harris
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:30.040]  who likes to block black folks up and Joe Biden like the black lives matter money gets
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:35.240]  all of it directed to them to have a five-year-old North Carolina boy who reportedly was killed
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:43.440]  when a man ran up to him and shot him in the head for no reason apparently was not compelling
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:47.640]  enough to merit US mainstream media coverage.
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:55.800]  The boy, Cannon Hennett was riding his bike in front of his house Sunday in North Carolina.
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:00.760]  The 25-year-old suspect was a neighbor who reportedly walked up for all these witnesses
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:08.360]  and shot the boy multiple times in the back of the head in front of a seven-year-old sister.
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:13.160]  The hair-raising details have never hit mainstream news.
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:20.360]  Oh boy, five-year-old executed while playing in the street police arrest 25-year-old neighbor
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:28.320]  Darius C. Soms.
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:31.120]  You know, I don't care if the person's black or white, but when they got eyes that look
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:34.040]  like that, you need to move.
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:35.880]  I live next door to that guy.
[1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:38.320]  I'd go live in a ditch before I live next to that guy.
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:43.280]  That guy looks like a serial killer.
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:45.680]  And there's something in these demons that hates children.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:47.320]  The left wants to kill babies.
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:48.320]  They don't care what color they are.
[1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:51.840]  They want to kill them in the womb, out of the womb, they want them dead.
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:57.560]  You look at that look, that's not a person driving that soul.
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:02.440]  You see that dead look, the person has been pushed back, the soul has been pushed back
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:03.440]  or out.
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:07.240]  There's something else looking right through that face.
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:11.440]  You look at Joe Biden's eyes, look at Kamala Harris' eyes, he's the same thing.
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:14.880]  They're called shark eyes.
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:20.840]  He's got shark eyes, like Tim Cook.
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:23.400]  You know they're bad.
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:32.880]  Wow, unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:36.360]  They can't even hide what they are.
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  Demons.
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:43.240]  We got a demon problem, folks, not a racial problem, but some groups do seem to be more
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:45.360]  susceptible to the infestation.
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:51.760]  It's a very sad thing, very, very sad.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:55.120]  Now, who's been holding long?
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:56.120]  Is that me?
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  Dylan in Colorado.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:58.120]  Dylan, thanks for holding.
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  Go ahead, Dylan.
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:01.120]  Mr. Jones, can you hear me loud and clear?
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:02.120]  Loud and clear, brother.
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:03.120]  Thanks for calling.
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  Oh, good.
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:10.520]  Because, Dan, I don't mean to be the Dylan down or the broadcast, but over the past
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:17.040]  few weeks, you've asked what we can do, and you've had at least one person, every single
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:23.760]  broadcast, say that if we just pray to God and submit to Jesus that we'll have this hedge
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:31.560]  of protection lifted above us, and I just can't disagree with that more.
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:37.760]  We may have had a hedge of protection at one point, but it is gone, it is gone at this
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:38.760]  point.
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:41.520]  Oh, I think you're misunderstanding.
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:42.720]  People want the hedge of protection back.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:47.720]  I think everybody agrees it's being lifted right now.
[1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:51.280]  But the only thing we can do to get that back is to fight this.
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:54.560]  I think what is coming is coming, and I don't think we can stop that.
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:58.400]  No, no, I agree that it's just going to get worse from here on out.
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:04.640]  Trump was just a warning light on the engine, and all of our complacency will bring down
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:08.880]  destruction where God will force us to not be complacent anymore, and God will force
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.480]  us to choose a side.
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:13.920]  And so part of me is glad this is all happening, because all these lazy-ass people want to
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:17.360]  keep complying, want to keep bowing, want to go with the system, we'll see how that
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:18.880]  goes for them.
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:23.320]  Exactly, but I don't think God wants monks right now.
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:29.440]  He wants warriors, and I think the only way to do that is to actually get involved.
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:39.160]  You know, I'm 29 years old, I've been listening to you since 2010, probably, and I've enlisted
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:40.160]  in the military.
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:45.320]  I think people need to, I think we need to do exactly what the, I don't even want to
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:50.000]  call them Democrats, but what these litards have done, and in bed also, I agree.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.440]  They want to take over our institutions and ruin them and make all the good men and women
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:54.440]  get out.
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.240]  So the answer is, join all the institutions and let God's spirit guide you, but don't
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:02.520]  be like the left, don't lie about what you stand for.
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:05.480]  Do your job, but if God tells you to keep your mouth shut, keep your mouth shut, God
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:06.480]  tells you don't.
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:11.120]  Talk, but get in, go up through the organizations like the communists have done, so that at
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:14.320]  key points, we can then destroy them.
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:17.400]  We need to go back into the institutions and take them back.
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:21.880]  Corporate institutions, educational institutions, governmental institutions, and just being
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:27.280]  on the street, and in our own families, we have to start working hard and standing up
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:28.280]  for our families.
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:31.640]  That means spending time with our children, and it means getting out and demonstrating,
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.280]  and it means suing people, and it means if somebody walks up, there's a leftist that
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:39.800]  attacks you, it means defending yourself, and it means becoming men again.
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:45.920]  Exactly, pray to God, but row the damn boat to shore.
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:51.960]  Unarrest Thompson, God bless you, which is a rip off of a better one saying, trust in
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:52.960]  God and tie up your camel.
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:56.760]  It's like, hey, God's there for him, but tie your camel up or it's going to run off.
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:00.280]  Let's do another caller here.
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:01.560]  Let's go to Ivan and then Chris.
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:04.040]  Ivan in Oklahoma, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:05.040]  Hello, Alex.
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:07.640]  I'm calling from Oklahoma, how are you, sir?
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:11.680]  Man, I tell you, I'm certainly not bored, I'm certainly not.
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:13.320]  I'm pretty excited.
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:15.320]  These are crazy times, brother.
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.280]  It's first time caller, kind of nervous, you could hear my voice.
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:20.280]  Don't be nervous, Ivan.
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:22.280]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:28.520]  Well, I was trying to call yesterday, and well, they told me to talk about today's topic,
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:33.960]  but I wanted to talk about, you know, how we've seen these protests in different cities.
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:40.320]  Why haven't we seen them go all over, you know, here where I live?
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:46.360]  You barely see people on the street, on the sidewalk, where they just write, you know,
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.160]  BLM and this and that.
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:52.920]  That's because the BLM antifa is synthetic and is only done in blue cities where they're
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:55.800]  with the police chiefs in crime.
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:56.800]  Okay.
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:03.240]  And, you know, I was just, you know, kind of wondering, no, we see this in big cities,
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:08.400]  but not in, you know, all across, you know, and it just keeps me on my feet.
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  You know, I kind of look here and there, just kind of keeping an open eye.
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:20.200]  Anyway, I just want to say, sir, I've been praying for you.
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:24.680]  I've been praying for the whole info or staff every day when I go to bed and when I wake
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:26.760]  up.
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:29.840]  And I have always praying for the president and the administration.
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:34.600]  I'm always praying for you guys, and thank you for the job that you do, sir.
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:40.760]  I try and listen to your broadcasts, even after it airs, keeps me on what's going on
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.040]  because for me, primarily, I don't listen to the mainstream media anymore.
[1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:47.280]  I stopped a long time ago.
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:50.520]  Well, they're there to distort things and what you're doing is awesome, Ivan.
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:55.080]  And every person you tell about news wars.com or band.video or go, Hey, you've heard of
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:56.080]  info wars.
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  It's demonized.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:00.080]  You can go there and actually see what they don't want you to see all the band doctors,
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.840]  all the truth about COVID and people are really receptive right now, sir.
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:04.840]  God bless you, Ivan.
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:05.840]  All right.
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:06.840]  We're going to start the next hour.
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.880]  I got a guest popping in, but we're going to continue with calls.
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:11.840]  The guest is on for a couple of segments, but we're going to go to everybody.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:19.840]  We're going to get to Isaiah, Flo, Jacob, Howard, Matthew, Tim, Chris, Kathy, and others.
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:20.840]  In fact, go to Kathy first.
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:21.840]  I'm going to Chris.
[1:51:21.840 --> 1:51:26.560]  We'll get to everybody here because, I mean, they're telling you they're going to contest
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:29.360]  the election to create the breakdown of society.
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:30.360]  That's what the chai comes.
[1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:33.120]  The globalist wants the break up of the country here like the Democrats will probably lose
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:34.120]  that.
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.120]  They don't care.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:36.120]  They're like a bomb.
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:37.120]  They're meant to tear it apart.
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:38.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:44.600]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:48.280]  for people to be charged for attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:49.280]  of slavery.
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:54.080]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:55.080]  and others.
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:58.880]  And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:03.120]  the election and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:07.480]  John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and, of course, Joe Biden.
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:11.320]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:14.720]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote.
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:19.280]  And we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:21.400]  This is officially in the New York Times.
[1:52:21.400 --> 1:52:22.960]  I don't just believe the New York Times.
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:26.440]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan for other statements they've
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:31.360]  made in Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council
[1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:32.440]  on Farm Relations.
[1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:33.440]  This is their plan.
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:35.200]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:36.200]  What are you going to do?
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:37.200]  I'm serious, folks.
[1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:40.480]  This is the time to save the country.
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:45.640]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:50.160]  The New World Order, Chai Comm, Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:55.440]  dollar and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:59.280]  They are openly war-gaming this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party.
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:03.840]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:04.840]  Trump is going.
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:10.120]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:11.640]  that will be called a racist.
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:14.160]  They will then trigger race riots and violence.
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:19.960]  They've already beta tested around the country, but you're not living in normal times.
[1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:23.360]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat-footed because
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:27.420]  they can't believe that they're living in such a criminal era.
[1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:28.420]  We are.
[1:53:28.420 --> 1:53:31.760]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:34.520]  America is being exposed and removed.
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:38.040]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.480]  Spread the word now, Paul Reverez.
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:52.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:55.680]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:53:55.680 --> 1:53:58.480]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:06.000]  You know, I feel a big weight off of being one respect, but a bigger new weight in another
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  way.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.600]  But the world government's out in the open.
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:15.280]  We were dead on about it all, and now we're really faced with the Long Hard Hall up against
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:19.240]  the Antichrist AI system that we're going to end up defeating with God's help, but not
[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:20.240]  before the enemy.
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:23.840]  We've been in control for a while, and it's to take us down for a deep dive of real torture.
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:26.480]  But that's what we deserve for what we've done.
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:30.040]  God's going to test us as men and women, and I appreciate the fact that God's doing that
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:34.440]  so that we can be reunited with Christ, and so we can go through the fire and become more
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:35.440]  Christ-like.
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:39.960]  But I assure you, all of you out there that want to dodge the pain, the pain's coming.
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:43.800]  You're not going to dodge it, so you better get ready to get into it and enjoy it.
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:47.560]  Because it's not going to physically feel good, but at the end, you will be stronger
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  because of it.
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:51.920]  And we're taking your phone calls about the globalists and their announcement of civil
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:54.760]  war and secession, the breakup of the United States.
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:58.080]  They're announcing it like it's just a no big deal in the news, hey!
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:54:59.720]  And well, what should we do?
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.160]  Kathy in New York, thanks for calling, thanks for holding.
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:04.160]  Welcome.
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:05.160]  Yes, hi.
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:07.680]  I've been listening to you since 1996.
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:11.680]  I'm a longtime listener here, and I hope I don't trip over my words because I'm nervous.
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:13.200]  Oh, please don't be nervous, Kathy.
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:14.200]  We love your voice.
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:15.200]  Go ahead.
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:16.200]  Okay.
[1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:21.640]  So what President Trump should do, already people are sort of like geared into going
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:26.160]  and getting tested, sitting in their cars, you know, waiting to be tested.
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:29.160]  This is what we should do when people go to vote.
[1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:35.360]  We already have the voting places already in place, and someone should, people would
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:37.320]  line up in their cars.
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:42.360]  People would go along and get people each a voting ballot that they would use.
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:48.040]  The machines would be set up outside the big lines, and then people would then, by that
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:54.000]  point, have filled out their ballot, drive up, put it through the machine, and be done
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.920]  with it because it's already in place.
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:02.680]  Let's just tweak it a little bit, and President Trump should do that.
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:08.920]  Also, I mean, he definitely should be exposing the criminals here, so people can see and
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:15.800]  understand these people that are trying to speak against him, that they're actually criminals,
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:16.800]  okay?
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:23.600]  And if anyone, any of your listeners, are skeptical about this coup, Nancy Pelosi herself
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:28.280]  revealed it when she said that she was second in line.
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:32.840]  Now, when you first heard that, you thought, what is she talking about, doesn't she understand?
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:34.560]  Yes, she does.
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.280]  She, this is the coup.
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:39.760]  You get rid of Trump and Pence, and then they go in.
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  So you have to listen to what these people are saying.
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:49.960]  So I wanted to definitely let you know about that, and also, I'm 71 years old, wanted to
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:55.880]  let you know I'm using body ease, and I'm telling you, after you take, it's for me,
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:57:03.520]  for myself, 30 days, I started to notice giant increases in my mobility with my arm that
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:08.800]  I injured when I was exercising, and it's really working for me, so I just wanted people
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:09.800]  to know that as well.
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.520]  How long did it take for bodies to kick in for you, Kathy?
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:22.440]  Well, it took, as I say, it took about 30 days for me to take, taking it, and then,
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:29.120]  all of a sudden, after that 30 days, each day I took it, I started to feel large increases.
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:34.240]  But in the beginning, I say, about the third week, I started to feel something really starting
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:35.240]  to change.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:36.640]  Well, that's exactly what I tell people.
[1:57:36.640 --> 1:57:38.920]  With the DNA force, it takes about a month.
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.400]  With the iodine, it takes about two weeks.
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:45.600]  And with the bodies, depending on how old the person is, two weeks to a month, for it
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:50.800]  to really build up and then have its cumulative effect, and, I mean, cumulants are powerful.
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:54.720]  They're known what they do, and that's why I just encourage people to get bodies.
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:57.640]  We have the new liquid turmeric extract as well.
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:00.240]  They don't compete with each other, other apples and oranges.
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:03.360]  You know, I said I'd do it last segment, but I'll do it next segment.
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:06.440]  I'm going to tell people briefly what I think President Trump should do, but it's basically
[1:58:06.440 --> 1:58:07.840]  what you're saying.
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:12.480]  We have to get over the stigma of how crazy the Democrats are.
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:15.080]  If we repeat what they're saying, it sounds like a lie.
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:20.120]  Like when I say the Austin City Council has a proposal in the budget to blow up the police
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  department.
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:24.800]  When I say that, I feel like I'm lying, because it just sounds crazy.
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  But it's true.
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:27.800]  It's crazy.
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:28.800]  We love you.
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  Amazing that you've been listening for 25 years or so, and we really appreciate you.
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:33.800]  Call again.
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  All right.
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:35.800]  More calls straight ahead in 60 seconds.
[1:58:35.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  And then we have a special guest.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:41.800]  I'll tell you about coming up as well, and some special reports, and Info Wars is trending
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:42.800]  on Twitter again.
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:43.800]  Yes.
[1:58:43.800 --> 1:58:46.800]  Wait till we tell you about that.
[1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:52.600]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:58.400]  Well, you trigger race riots, and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:02.080]  the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president.
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:06.600]  That's what she's been said on CBS News, and that you're going to have those blue states
[1:59:06.600 --> 1:59:07.600]  succeed.
[1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:11.640]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:16.080]  The Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the Chikoms, and the whole global system.
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:21.280]  This is treason with a capital T, and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards,
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:25.160]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our president has been
[1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:26.160]  exposing it.
[1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:27.160]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:28.160]  You need storeable food.
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:32.640]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two to four week delivery.
[1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:36.080]  With 80 days out from the election, you need to get high quality storeable food right now.
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:39.960]  In case they are able to pull this off, we're going to have a Great Depression war on the
[1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:42.480]  streets that will make a road warrior look like a cake walk.
[1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:47.200]  Get your high quality storeable foods now, and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:54.200]  Get ready, get ready, get ready, get prepared.
[1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, even on Fox News, they're saying students should wear armbands that
[1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:03.080]  track their temperature and yellow buttons if they haven't been vaccinated, meaning
[2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:05.880]  no one can touch them.
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:14.200]  They're getting you ready for the forced inoculations and the contact tracers, a bipartisan takeover.
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:20.840]  New Jersey Governor also mandated temperature-tracking armbands for students and staff at schools.
[2:00:20.840 --> 2:00:24.120]  DeAnna Lorraine, always a great interview, is on top at all.
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:28.040]  She'll be joining us coming up next segment to go over all that, and info wars is one
[2:00:28.040 --> 2:00:31.320]  of the top trends, Alex Jones.
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:37.840]  My wife tried to go this weekend on Sunday.
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:44.360]  She tried to go hike on the green belt that's over several hundred square miles, and they
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:49.640]  had lifeguards blocking the entrance like their police officers saying you must sign
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:54.000]  up behind a thing of glass like you have COVID because going outside is dangerous.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.600]  All the city on golf courses are closed, they still got the pools closed, but for months
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:01.480]  they quote open the green belts because nobody was paying attention to them.
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:02.640]  Everybody was still going in there.
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:03.840]  Well, they weren't letting anybody in.
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:04.840]  They said it was full.
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:07.760]  Well, the police said no, there's no enforcement, let them in.
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.160]  The media has released an edited video that doesn't show all that to make it look like
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:13.720]  I was just screaming at innocent people.
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:16.840]  But that's why they're mainstream media, and it's why they're in so much trouble.
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:22.480]  Conspiracy, there is Alex Jones, Shouts at Austin employees, Hikers at green belt entrance.
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:23.480]  Austin American statesman.
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:29.880]  I thought I'd gone bankrupt three times is people know that they twist and they deceive.
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:39.160]  But we have the full video at info wars.com and band on video.
[2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:43.360]  Austin green belts reopened after mayor illegally sends in contact tracers.
[2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:47.240]  See all the fake Rangers and all the police standing by the police for the one saying
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:48.280]  it was pure bull.
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:53.000]  They called seven police cars on me and that family was able to march in.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.520]  But the media says I screamed at the family and doesn't show you them high-flying me.
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:02.400]  I was mean to the Hispanic family.
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:03.480]  They never high-fived me.
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:04.480]  They never liked me.
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:05.480]  No, no.
[2:02:05.480 --> 2:02:06.480]  So that'll be another thing.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:12.720]  We'll show you next hour how they take something that was a victory and turn it into a defeat.
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:14.320]  But that's why no one believes them.
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:16.880]  That's why they're frauds.
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:20.360]  So guys get the video that's on Twitter versus what we put out.
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:26.160]  Yeah, they got a minute long thing on Twitter versus the five minute report because they're
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:35.360]  decepticons, decepticons, decepticons, but I don't mean from the Autobots transforming
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:40.640]  rule out Megatron prepare to die Megatron prepare for battle.
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:42.800]  I don't mean those decepticons.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:46.800]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:49.680]  We're going to go to Chris in Chicago.
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:50.680]  Chris, welcome.
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:51.680]  Hey, Alex.
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:59.800]  I can tell you right now Chicago is prime for the formulaic method of siege.
[2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:04.760]  Essentially every day we see another restaurant in the loop and downtown in the Gold Coast
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:05.760]  closed.
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:11.120]  And I think they're having to raise drawbridges as hordes of people burn things down.
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.520]  I mean, it's like a medieval siege.
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:14.520]  Yes.
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:20.920]  And I think what the plan here is the force people out that have me, you know, I'm in
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:21.920]  the restaurant business.
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:23.600]  I've been in the food business forever.
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.800]  All the high end chefs, all the full star chefs, they're exiting, they're either going
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:29.760]  to the suburbs or leaving the state.
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:35.000]  So I think what will happen, especially guaranteed income situation is they'll just suspend everyone
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:40.320]  paying rent, give them guaranteed income, and these will be the people that will control
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  the city of Chicago.
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:42.320]  That's right.
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:45.000]  Just like in Europe, they brought in tens of millions of illegal Islamics.
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:49.960]  Now they want 500 million for Europe, 600 million for us who will be the permanent clients
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:50.960]  of the globalists.
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:53.440]  That if they don't get what they want, they burn everything down.
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:58.640]  Well, I think the thing with the bridges was a big play by Bull Dyke, Admiral Ackbar.
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:03:59.640]  Yeah.
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:00.640]  Yeah.
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:07.880]  Admiral Ackbar leading an attack on the Death Star.
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:10.600]  By the way, if new listeners tuned in, we're not joking.
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:15.160]  The riots over the weekend over a guy aiming a gun at police and they said later he didn't
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:16.160]  have one.
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:17.160]  He did have one.
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:18.560]  There's video of it.
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:22.080]  They had to raise the draw bridges, explain to people about Chicago and the canals.
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:27.200]  They literally had to raise the draw bridges to stop more looting.
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:30.720]  If you look at a map of Chicago, Wacker Drive runs along the river.
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:34.920]  So if you have to go to the west part of Chicago or the north part, which is the Gold Coast,
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:39.280]  which is where all the high end shops are from the loop from the main downtown area,
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:41.560]  you can't get across the river that way from downtown.
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:47.800]  But here's the thing, Alex, Block 37, which is in the loop, was one of the main hit areas.
[2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:51.120]  The people coming to loot were just exited out of the south side of the city.
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:55.520]  I think the mayor just did that to act like she was doing something.
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:56.920]  She's not doing a goddamn thing.
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:58.480]  She's not doing anything.
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:00.160]  And here's the other thing.
[2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:04.720]  If you look at the grateful ass articles about the Pritzker family, about Penny Pritzker
[2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:10.280]  and how she was superior finance, screwed over African-Americans here, they're the folks
[2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:19.160]  that ran the scams on black Americans with Obama as her head guy, as slumlords.
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:20.160]  Yes.
[2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:25.600]  And so I need the info warriors to tweet that at Governor Pritzker because I'm telling
[2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:30.080]  you, it's deep here, and they've got this city, and it's a lot.
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:36.320]  Hey, Alex, one quick thing I wanted to mention off this topic, Michael Carcock, if you ever
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:43.640]  heard of him, he was a operation paperclip guy who came from Germany, I was listening
[2:05:43.640 --> 2:05:44.640]  to an interview recently.
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:52.240]  I'd never heard this before about Michael Carcock, K-A-R-K-O-C, trained Michael Aquino,
[2:05:52.240 --> 2:05:58.200]  who's the big stateness in the military, and also trained none other than John Brennan.
[2:05:58.200 --> 2:05:59.920]  And this interview I heard, I'll send it to the show.
[2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:04.080]  No, no, I mean, I did know that Aquino and John Brennan were trained by Nazis.
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:05.080]  That's actually well known.
[2:06:05.080 --> 2:06:12.160]  Okay, so she, when it goes into the harvesting of Adrenochrome and all of this stuff, and
[2:06:12.160 --> 2:06:15.480]  it was an amazing interview, I'll send it to the showtips, but anyway.
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.760]  Do that, brother Chris, I appreciate you.
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:20.320]  Yeah, I mean, Chicago used to be a cool city.
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:24.280]  You know, the South Side had its problems, but I was up there a few years ago, and it's
[2:06:24.280 --> 2:06:26.640]  just, everything's going downhill on purpose.
[2:06:26.640 --> 2:06:30.360]  The globalists are taking over, they want raw power.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:34.920]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:37.440]  This has been holding the longest now.
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:39.080]  That would be Matthew in Kansas.
[2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:40.080]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:42.080]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:46.480]  Uh, it sounds like you got a phone problem, but try to talk into your receiver.
[2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:48.480]  There's a better.
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:49.480]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:50.480]  All right.
[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:55.480]  I'll just take a quick 60 seconds, but the main thing that I wanted to touch on was pretty
[2:06:55.480 --> 2:07:01.560]  much on Kathy's call, is we got to use our cars, and maybe Trump can have like a drive-in
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:08.040]  rally to really show the numbers of the people turning out through their last local drive-in.
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:12.960]  And I also want to plug in Dr. Jones, the charcoal toothpaste, I'm about to buy some
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:17.680]  of that today, and I'm on the waiting list for that info-warned, clear t-shirt.
[2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:20.640]  Well, that's awesome, brother.
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:25.600]  Yeah, we all should be organizing our own events, like the flag drop we heard out of
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:26.600]  Chicago, and I'm going to do it.
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:31.520]  I'm going to go out this Friday, 6 to 8, and we'll announce on the website what corner
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:32.520]  we're going to be at.
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:33.520]  And maybe it's just an hour.
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:38.440]  We have American flags, we get out, you know, we support freedom, and we exercise being
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:39.440]  out in the open.
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:43.760]  In fact, the best place to go is probably the south side of the Capitol.
[2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:44.760]  Just do that.
[2:07:44.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  That's the best place, I think, to meet.
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:48.520]  And we'll call it the flag drop.
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:49.520]  Everybody brings your American flags down.
[2:07:49.520 --> 2:07:50.520]  It's not an info-wars event.
[2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:54.000]  It's an American event, Matthew.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:57.320]  Magger rallies at the drive-ins.
[2:07:57.320 --> 2:07:58.320]  I agree.
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:01.320]  Drive-in theaters, we're already making a comeback because of the stupid COVID hoax.
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:03.240]  We're back again.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:06.200]  And so my daughter was asking me to take her to one last week.
[2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:07.880]  Maybe we will this weekend.
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:08.880]  And I agree.
[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:10.960]  People just all pick a one drive and you're going to go to.
[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:14.840]  You all fly the American flag and all meet up there.
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:19.080]  It's key for us to meet and be human and get outside of our houses.
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:21.000]  The globalists want us inside our houses.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.040]  They want the post-human world.
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:25.120]  Sounds like a science fiction movie because it is.
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:26.600]  Thank you so much, Matthew.
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:27.880]  All right.
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:32.160]  We don't have time to put anybody else on the board, but I will get to Clint, Isaiah,
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:38.680]  Flo, Jacob, Howard, Mark, and Tim after our guest is on with us.
[2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:41.680]  So if you want to hold, we will get to everybody, the order they receive.
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:45.800]  First up will be Jacob, then it'll be Tim, then it'll go in the order.
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:47.160]  Some people called in 10 minutes ago.
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:48.840]  Some people called in an hour ago.
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:51.640]  I will get to everybody.
[2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:57.360]  But we're going to get into how the next level of lockdowns is here in the blue cities and
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:08:58.360]  blue states.
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:02.680]  And we'll soon, by the winter, even if Trump loses, they're going to do this, we'll be
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:03.680]  locked down permanently.
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:06.680]  I mean, we're talking months inside your high rise.
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:10.720]  That's what they target first, where you can't ever leave your house or you'll be body slammed
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:11.720]  even if you wear a mask.
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:16.800]  You've seen all that footage out of Australia, just men brutally choking women out because
[2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:19.600]  they have been told cult-like to put them under martial law.
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:22.640]  That is the example for the rest of the world.
[2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:23.640]  China's not doing the lockdowns.
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:24.840]  It teaches how to be slaves.
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:30.360]  Now Australia is doing it, and it is just vicious, and it is satanic, and those officers
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:31.360]  are Nazis.
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.720]  They are absolute scum of the earth filth, and they're carrying out illegal orders,
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:35.720]  and it's disgusting.
[2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:40.200]  I'll tell you this, the Austin cops I ran into were all listeners, and when the camera
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:41.200]  went non-shaking my hand.
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:46.320]  Let me tell you, those police in Australia are shameful sacks of leftist garbage.
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:51.680]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:53.600]  serious cognitive problems.
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:58.320]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:00.280]  allied crime syndicates.
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:03.520]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:07.960]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms, and others.
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:14.480]  So she has been chosen because she's part African, and now anyone that criticizes her
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:19.120]  will be called a racist and evil, and she is now above reproach.
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:23.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:28.760]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:32.280]  than white people, and that the woman is a monster.
[2:10:32.280 --> 2:10:37.320]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election, and
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:41.200]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:43.920]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:46.080]  We must expose the globalist.
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:49.960]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory, more than anything.
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.080]  And they also bet, as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.800]  adapt to being a slave, that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:02.760]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:05.960]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:07.800]  They lied about where it came from.
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:12.480]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:19.200]  at 4%, but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:22.240]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:26.200]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:29.600]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown, now we're six months later.
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:33.480]  Now they say it's permanent, that you got to wear masks forever, and forced inoculations
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:36.600]  are coming, and they're going to track everywhere you go with what you do, the global social
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:40.640]  credit score, and the UN is the boss, and anybody questioning it is censored off the
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:42.360]  internet loses their job.
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:43.960]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:49.040]  That's called world government takeover.
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:12:12.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:17.800]  The annual rain is a great talk show host and activist, and she's run for Congress.
[2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:19.480]  She's done a lot of great work.
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:23.880]  She was just on Australian TV and cut off when she brought up some of the discrepancies
[2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:27.120]  with the coronavirus, because you know the UN's in charge, and they're choking women
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:32.920]  out that leave their homes, period, even with masks, and now temperature testing.
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:36.720]  All of this is the next level of control, so she's here to talk about the latest Gavin
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:40.680]  Newsom draconian measures, where they're still trying to keep the beaches locked down, but
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:45.680]  here they're keeping all the major parks, and the equivalent of state parks here in
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.160]  Austin, the city has parks that are as big as state or national forests.
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:51.360]  Those are locked down for COVID.
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:54.840]  It's absolutely asinine and a power grab.
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:56.880]  So Deanna Lorraine joins us.
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  Thanks for coming on.
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:12:58.880]  What do you want to tackle first?
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:12:59.880]  Well, I don't know.
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:05.200]  You want to tackle the Australian cut off when they pretend that it was a bad feed,
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:09.080]  or we can talk about communist Gavin Newsom.
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:10.080]  Which do you want to talk about?
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:12.320]  Let's get into Australia first.
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:13.320]  Okay.
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:18.640]  So, Australian invited me, how kind of them, I put up a tweet, okay, a couple weeks ago
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:23.480]  I put up a tweet, once I found out that they were going on another lockdown for six weeks,
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:27.920]  they were not even letting people go outside of their homes, okay, except for maybe essential
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.920]  services here and there, and they said they were having a wall of steel, meaning police
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:37.320]  forces all the way outside the city of Melbourne to make sure nobody comes in or out.
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:42.600]  So I put up a tweet defending their individual liberties, saying, hey, this is like prison.
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:46.680]  This is basically prison, you know, Australians fight, fight for your liberties.
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:50.600]  So the Australians.
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:54.600]  While her Skype comes back, let's go ahead and roll the video of her on Australian television
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:58.000]  when they cut it off claiming a technical difficulty, kind of like when Biden has trouble
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:13:59.840]  speaking, they claim it's a technical difficulty.
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:00.840]  Here it is.
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:08.320]  Okay, number one, the CDC is counting presumptive positive test, presumptive positive cases
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  as positive.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:13.920]  So if you can have the nipple that's the other headache, then you are tested positive now.
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:22.720]  We also have the president of Tanzania, who also has the...
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:28.720]  I think the link is dropping out because I don't think we should be giving her any time.
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:45.920]  So is that her Skype breaking up like it just did or were they cutting her off?
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:48.920]  I know that the United Nations censors people.
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:50.760]  I know they censor Greg Rees.
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  I know they censor us.
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:57.520]  I know the head of YouTube says if something disagrees with the United Nations, we shut
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:00.840]  it down and that's why we need our own communications.
[2:15:00.840 --> 2:15:05.280]  By the way, I'm inviting her to town next week so she can be in studio with us.
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:10.280]  I ran into her out of the big Virginia rally for guns and really familiar with her work
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:12.440]  and we're going to get her in studio next week.
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:16.960]  That way, one way or another, we can actually hear what she has to say because she's smart
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:20.120]  as a whip and I really look forward to that.
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:23.520]  If we're able to get her Skype stabilized, we'll get her back with us.
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:26.800]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to another caller.
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:30.520]  Let's go ahead and speak with Jacob in Georgia.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:31.520]  Thanks for holding.
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:32.520]  Go ahead.
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:33.520]  Hello.
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:34.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:35.520]  Go ahead.
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:36.520]  Welcome.
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  Oh, yeah.
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:46.760]  I'm just, I was just, I've been listed since I was in ninth grade and I'm a caller from
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:52.800]  Georgia and I go to KSU in Georgia and I was just going to tell you how bad they're using
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:58.920]  COVID to basically, I guess you could say, push the global platform.
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:04.600]  And I just got an email from one of the directors from Georgia and he said that, or the director
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:11.080]  from KSU, he said that now what they're going to be doing is using contract tracing, masks
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:13.600]  are required or you will not be allowed on campus.
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:17.680]  And then another one says that they will be using the armband.
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:19.440]  So it's real.
[2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:20.440]  It's real and it's scary.
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:21.440]  That's right.
[2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:24.360]  All across the world it comes in in phases.
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:29.920]  First stay in your house, then wear the mask, then have your temperature taken, then wear
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:34.520]  armbands, then have an app, then have an inoculation to prove you haven't and then they want you
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:36.040]  to wear badges.
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:42.360]  If you haven't had your vaccine, a yellow badge right out of Nazi Germany, I'll talk
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:43.960]  about that with our guests in a moment.
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:48.400]  What do you make of the New Jersey governor just mandated the temperature tracking armbands
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:52.120]  and you're saying you're hearing that at college in Georgia?
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:53.120]  Yeah.
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:55.640]  It's crazy, ma'am.
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:59.680]  Hang up the phone.
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:03.520]  Does your wife have something to say?
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:04.520]  He's gone.
[2:17:04.520 --> 2:17:05.520]  All right.
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:07.120]  Deanna Lorraine is here.
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:10.640]  We're flying her to Austin next week to go host a show with me a couple of days and to
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:12.640]  be on the war room and to be with David Nikes.
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:18.360]  I love her work whenever I see it, but I don't know they cut her off in Australia because
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:22.240]  I mean, I think I think it might be her Skype connection, but she'll be with us next week.
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:23.240]  So I'm announcing that.
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:25.720]  So I'm going to make sure that make sure that happens also tomorrow night.
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:30.880]  I'm going to do a special 7 to 10 p.m. live transmission on their attempts to overturn
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:31.880]  the election.
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:35.480]  Let's shift gears of that a few minutes we have and we'll come back to the other topics
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:36.480]  on COVID.
[2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:44.120]  What do you make of Democrats Pelosi there in your district in California saying that
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:46.480]  she's second command, they're going to contest the election.
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:50.640]  They'll have another inauguration for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and that they're
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:54.320]  going to have liberal states to see that civil war.
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:55.880]  I mean, they're really planning this.
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:17:56.880]  What do you think?
[2:17:56.880 --> 2:17:57.880]  Absolutely.
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:01.160]  I mean, this was planned, this was locked and loaded from day one.
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:03.320]  Obviously, Joe Biden is just a puppet.
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:04.320]  Okay.
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:06.800]  It's not President Trump versus Joe Biden.
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.120]  It's President Trump versus this Marxist globalist takeover.
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:12.120]  You know it.
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:13.120]  I know it.
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:14.120]  Everyone knows it.
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  Who has half a brain.
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:17.320]  It's in regardless of what happens.
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:22.160]  So I'm obviously freaked out and very afraid of what's going to happen if President Trump
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:25.480]  loses because then America as we know it is over.
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:31.040]  But if he wins, I mean, they're going full steam ahead with this no matter what, right?
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.840]  California, you know, we patriots need to do something because the left, they're going
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:37.520]  through with their agenda no matter what.
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:39.880]  It seems like we almost don't have a say in it.
[2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:43.280]  And meanwhile, while we're holding nice little rallies and waving the American flags and
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:48.240]  honking horns, which is nice, you know, they are causing massive destruction and seizing
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:50.480]  police stations, right?
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:53.960]  And destroying monuments and everything and they're making much more of a dent in this
[2:18:53.960 --> 2:18:54.960]  war than we are.
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:55.960]  Don't you think?
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:57.560]  I mean, we're not doing enough.
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:00.760]  And I think that we need to get mobilized and organized because they're obviously very
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:02.160]  well funded and well organized.
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:03.160]  Well, that's right.
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:05.960]  They keep pushing and pushing and they never get in trouble.
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:09.240]  And so the attempted coup against Trump with Russia gate and Ukraine gate.
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:12.240]  And now this is just, they're going to try it because why shouldn't they?
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:14.080]  They're not going to get in trouble for it.
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:15.080]  Right.
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:16.080]  Exactly.
[2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:18.480]  All they're doing is pushing and pushing and seeing what they can get away with.
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:20.160]  But look, they're getting away with a lot.
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:21.160]  That's the fact.
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:25.200]  And if you looked at just pure optics, it looks like they're winning this war.
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:26.680]  What are we really doing?
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:31.120]  And we're kind of, you know, we've got 90 days or so till the election and President
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:33.400]  Trump is making some moves.
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:36.040]  But you know, there's some fear about vaccines.
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:38.680]  You know, obviously if the Democrats have it their way, they're going to try to push
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:40.400]  for mandatory vaccines.
[2:19:40.400 --> 2:19:44.200]  They're going to try to push for microchips, obviously in New Jersey, they're trying to
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:45.200]  push.
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.280]  They already mandated arm bands at schools.
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:48.280]  Okay.
[2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:53.000]  That's one step away from mandated vaccines and microchips, right, and tracking devices.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:57.160]  Contact tracing has already been rolled out, even though the HR666 bill hasn't even been
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:19:58.840]  passed yet.
[2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:04.200]  So we have to fight and we have to be mobilized or else we are going to lose this war, especially
[2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:05.200]  if they win.
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:08.560]  You know, there's going to be full massive civil war, I think, if President Trump wins
[2:20:08.560 --> 2:20:10.600]  because they've got every trick up their sleeve.
[2:20:10.600 --> 2:20:11.600]  Well, you're right.
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:15.000]  You know, I've tried to build an operation and try to get things lined up to buy election
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.680]  time to be till midnight live every night.
[2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:18.680]  We haven't got that done.
[2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:20.000]  We finally have the crew hired.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:22.320]  I'm looking to launch some more shows that are nighttime shows.
[2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:25.720]  I'll just say it up front, we ought to try to get you to help us anchor that because
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:30.200]  now is the time and quite frankly, I get exhausted by five, six, seven at night, but I will be
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:33.960]  here tomorrow night, commercial free, seven to 10 p.m.
[2:20:33.960 --> 2:20:37.640]  And we're just intending the crew signed on to it to be going live seven days a week
[2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:41.240]  here in just a couple of weeks because this is history happening right now.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:42.240]  The animal reigns today.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:44.960]  Well, this will be right back.
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:49.800]  I'm cutting the sad on Wednesday, August 12th, 2025 is coming Sunday.
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:54.320]  This huge sale we've been running for last week will have to end the reopened America
[2:20:54.320 --> 2:21:02.040]  back to school special 50% off 60% off all of our top best sellers and double Patriot
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:03.040]  points.
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:08.120]  The end to sale, we're selling out of bodies at 50% off living defense of the percent off
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:12.680]  as over 50% off for about 40% off by the mental season to set off.
[2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:17.160]  Those are all very close to selling out a bunch of other best sellers still have, but
[2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:19.560]  I will end this special on Sunday.
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:25.960]  We haven't do great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:26.960]  X to the original.
[2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:30.720]  We'll come back and stop it will be discounted, but it's not available yet.
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:35.520]  So this is a great sale that funds the operation for great items in crazy times like this.
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:39.120]  It's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading the word about info wars,
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:40.720]  because you are the modern voice.
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:48.160]  You are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary
[2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:53.320]  Clinton and the list goes on from there have all gone on national TV have all gone on the
[2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:58.360]  internet and have been in the pages of the New York Times that their war came in contesting
[2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:03.960]  the election when they lose, they know there's a landslide if they're unable to steal it.
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:09.720]  They're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:13.400]  inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala Harris.
[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:18.800]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:21.000]  try to drive Trump from office.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:25.560]  The Democratic Party, the chai comms, the deep state are using black lives matter funded
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:31.640]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:37.160]  riots and martial law, that you're racist when in truth an old Nazi collaborator George
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:40.840]  Soros created black lives matter along with Antifa.
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:44.440]  America's fighting for its life, but we will win.
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:49.280]  I'm cutting the sad on Wednesday, August 12th, 2025 is coming Sunday.
[2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:52.240]  This huge sale we've been running for last week will have to end.
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:59.720]  To reopen America, back to school special 50% off to 60% off all of our top bestsellers
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:02.120]  and double pay three at points.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:07.040]  I have to end this sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off, living defense at
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:12.160]  50% off, Pazzo, 50% off, turbo force at 50% off, bottom end will tease at 50% off.
[2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:14.160]  Those are all very close to selling out.
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:19.200]  A bunch of other bestsellers we still have, but I will end this special on Sunday.
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:25.040]  We'll have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:26.040]  as the original.
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:27.040]  We'll come back and stop.
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:32.000]  It will be discounted, but it's not available yet, so this is a great sale that funds the
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  operation.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  They're great items in crazy times like this.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:38.840]  It's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading the word about Info Wars because
[2:23:38.840 --> 2:23:40.160]  you are the modern voice.
[2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:47.560]  You are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you.
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:54.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:54.560 --> 2:24:09.560]  I was standing line for this, there's always room in life for this, oh baby, oh baby, then
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:13.000]  it fell apart, fell apart.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:18.680]  Diana Lorraine is our guest, she's an amazing activist lady, ran for Congress, got a lot
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:23.560]  of great word out there in the San Francisco area, but was defeated by another Islamist.
[2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:28.640]  Just like we just saw Ilhan Omar, despite the fact she was way outspent by a moderate
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:35.240]  socialist progressive communist, she just won massively in the primary in Minnesota because
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:40.040]  people are doubling down on someone who says abolish the police, America sucks, thanks
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:42.800]  for saving me America, you totally suck.
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:46.840]  She's got her new book out, it's excellent, Taking Back America.
[2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:50.240]  What's the best website or best place for people to visit Diana Lorraine to find your
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:52.200]  great book and all your great work?
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:56.920]  Yeah, my Twitter is extremely active, I get retweeted by the president every once in
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:02.400]  a while, so go to my Twitter at diana4congress, that's diana4congress, you can get my book
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:05.920]  at Amazon and you can go to my website at dianalarraine.com.
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.080]  All right, so you were saying, what do you want to cover next?
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:15.200]  You've got the floor, we can get into how they're electing all these weird crazy Islamic
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:20.680]  women and why the left's behind that, what Soros is going to do, the election, the rest
[2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:23.480]  of COVID lockdown, you've got the floor.
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:28.080]  Well, obviously with the COVID lockdown, the thing that upsets me about the president
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:33.200]  and you know I support the president so much, but all of these numbers are phony, right?
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:38.560]  You know that the death toll is inflated and false, we know that the test numbers are
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:39.560]  inflated and false.
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:43.360]  I mean, people are reporting everywhere that they didn't even go and take the test and
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:46.720]  then they get called a couple days later and they get tested positive, right?
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:51.680]  We know that non-human samples have been tested positive, so why are we basing all these draconian
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:57.680]  measures and changing schools and having creepy paper fans and digital fans in the sports
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:03.600]  stadiums and changing our whole lives mandated masks on false numbers, right?
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:07.800]  So I don't think this nightmare is going to go away until the president of the United
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:12.760]  States really says, look, you know, this is false, these are on false numbers and we can't
[2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:17.080]  change our entire world and usher in this new normal based on false numbers.
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:21.120]  Meanwhile, Gavin Newsom is banning singing in churches.
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:27.000]  He just made an authorization that we cannot have any gatherings, so like forget having
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:31.800]  a barbecue or anything with your family unless you get it authorized by him or else he's
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:34.440]  going to shut off water and power, right?
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:37.400]  I mean, how disgusting and Nazi is that?
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:39.000]  So this is the world we're into.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:43.560]  Of course, Soros is behind it, the globalists are behind it and they're extremely happy
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:46.600]  to usher in this new normal, right?
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:48.800]  And people are just going to go along with it.
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.280]  Nothing's going to get done unless we patriots fight back and say, no, I will not wear a
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:54.280]  mask.
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:58.520]  I will, I'm willing to get arrested to keep my business open so I don't comply to these
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:26:59.520]  draconian measures.
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:02.720]  You don't have a right to shut off my power, my water.
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:05.360]  And I think that we need to really send a strong message that we're not going to put
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:06.360]  up with it.
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:10.880]  We're not going to obey this and not going to submit our children to child abuse, right?
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:14.760]  Wear a mask all day long and not have normal social interaction, right?
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:15.760]  And that's just the beginning.
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:18.960]  I mean, now it's where the bracelets do all the rest of it.
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:20.640]  Let's play this clip from Fox News.
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:25.840]  Tucker Carlson is a great guy, but the doctor he has on, you know, sometimes says some good
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:28.000]  things, but my goodness, he was on there.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.280]  He was on there last night and he was saying that children that haven't had their vaccine
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:39.440]  need to wear a yellow sign like a Jew and Nazi Germany saying no hugs.
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:41.640]  This is absolutely insane.
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:42.640]  Here it is.
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:46.560]  Now, what are these 97,000 kids all have in common?
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:49.280]  All of them, almost all of them have mild cases.
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:55.280]  The same time CDC, and this did not go reported, 600 kids have been hospitalized since the
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:58.320]  beginning way less than adults have been hospitalized.
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:00.840]  They get much milder cases.
[2:28:00.840 --> 2:28:05.520]  Now what we have to do to reopen the schools, of course, is to provide virtual learning
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:08.680]  for those most at risk, teachers most at risk.
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:11.020]  We have to have an infrastructure in place.
[2:28:11.020 --> 2:28:16.320]  We have to teach our kids about how to take proper precautions, but we need our schools
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:21.400]  to be centers for learning and centers for socialization and social skills.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:27.400]  That will decrease the amount of despair and deaths from non-COVID related causes.
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:31.960]  We have to test everyone as well, and we should have prodigious testing.
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:35.200]  Here's one other thing we have to do sadly.
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:36.200]  No hugs, please.
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.840]  Now, if you look at this pin, Tucker, you'll see this pin looks like something you might
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:40.840]  remember.
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:42.120]  No smoking, please.
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.280]  Let's give our kids all of these pins, no hugs, please, sadly.
[2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:51.080]  But I'm going to say this, with this pin or shirts, no hugs, please, guess what's going
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:52.080]  to happen?
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:57.360]  We're going to get 26 candidates for a vaccine coming out at the clinical trials right now.
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:28:59.240]  Vaccines are going to emerge.
[2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:03.840]  We're going to beat this thing, and then this goes in the garbage, and we're all going to
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:04.840]  hug each other.
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:07.320]  In the meantime, Tucker, let's show our kids courage.
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:10.640]  They're looking to our parents for leadership.
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:14.080]  Leadership says, open the schools wherever we can, Tucker.
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:18.440]  So even the angle of open the school is, got to wear this badge because you haven't been
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:19.440]  vaccinated.
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:20.440]  You're dirty, you're bad.
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:22.400]  Oh, those at risk can't come to school now.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:24.680]  You'll be on the computer, so be neurotic.
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:30.600]  They're trying to turn the whole country, the whole world into what we've seen before
[2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:34.160]  with crazy eccentrics that are scared to go out in public because they're worried about
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:36.560]  diseases like Howard Hughes.
[2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:39.840]  I mean, this is welcome to Planet Howard Hughes.
[2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:40.840]  Right.
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:45.640]  Agoraphobic, germaphobic, major OCD, that's what they're turning them into.
[2:29:45.640 --> 2:29:51.760]  And yet Gavin Newsom is one of the many governors that he's releasing 18,000 prisoners, violent
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.440]  prisoners from jails and prison, right now, okay?
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:58.120]  So don't tell me that it's about ourselves, health and safety.
[2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:01.480]  Don't tell me it's about our health and safety when you're actually encouraging people to
[2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:05.760]  be together en masse for Black Lives Matter protests and rallies and looting.
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:06.760]  Okay.
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:08.360]  Don't tell me it's about our safety anymore.
[2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:09.360]  It's so disgusting.
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:11.040]  And this is a child abuse.
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:16.320]  If you look at the CIA's definition of torture, this meets the qualification of torture.
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:21.000]  If you look at any of the studies up until about six months ago, it is a well-known fact
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:28.920]  that social isolation creates major psychological issues, mental issues, suicidal, homicidal.
[2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:32.960]  You know, there's so many different side effects that happen with social isolation.
[2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:33.960]  Okay.
[2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.840]  And all of that was well-known and well-documented.
[2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:40.160]  Oh, up until about six months ago when all of a sudden COVID came out and now social
[2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:41.840]  isolation is somehow good.
[2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:43.000]  You can't just erase this.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:47.360]  You can't just erase years of knowledge and science and replace it with junk science just
[2:30:47.360 --> 2:30:51.120]  because these people walk around in white lab coats and have fancy names after them,
[2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:52.120]  like Anthony Fauci.
[2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:53.120]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:54.120]  Well, that's right.
[2:30:54.120 --> 2:30:55.960]  And everything Fauci said is a fraud.
[2:30:55.960 --> 2:30:57.960]  Look at these headlines.
[2:30:57.960 --> 2:31:02.160]  Colleges attempt to impose no parties, no trips, COVID-19 rules for the fall.
[2:31:02.160 --> 2:31:03.160]  Total cult.
[2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:04.160]  Right.
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:08.800]  And I don't want to see, I don't want to look in a sports stadium and see digital fans
[2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:10.080]  or paper cutouts.
[2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:13.400]  I don't want to go to a restaurant or a bar and I want to see like blow up dolls or
[2:31:13.400 --> 2:31:15.240]  something as a replacement for people.
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:16.240]  Excuse me.
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:17.240]  I want to see people.
[2:31:17.240 --> 2:31:20.800]  I want to see people laughing, smiling, having a good time, but that's what they're doing.
[2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:23.800]  They're trying to have this devoid of human contact.
[2:31:23.800 --> 2:31:26.720]  They want this virtual, touchless world.
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:28.280]  It's very dystopian.
[2:31:28.280 --> 2:31:31.360]  And the thing that pisses me off the most, sorry, I'm so fired up, but this just really
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:32.360]  fires me up.
[2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:33.760]  Yeah, this is the robot rollout.
[2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:35.320]  The robots are allowed to go.
[2:31:35.320 --> 2:31:36.560]  They'll deliver you food.
[2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:40.320]  They'll drive the cars because they're safe, but humans aren't.
[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:43.720]  Humans are bad dreaming of the post-human world.
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:46.760]  They're even saying that we need to have sex wearing a mask.
[2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:47.760]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:50.480]  They're saying that people need to not have sex or have sex wearing a mask.
[2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:51.880]  I hope I can say that on this show.
[2:31:51.880 --> 2:31:52.880]  You can't.
[2:31:52.880 --> 2:31:57.960]  Now major universities are saying, you're bad, you're dirty, wear a mask while you have
[2:31:57.960 --> 2:31:58.960]  sex.
[2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:02.440]  So they're making the normal biological world dirty and bad, even though almost all the
[2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:06.920]  studies show more contact with people, make sure immune systems stronger, not the other
[2:32:06.920 --> 2:32:07.920]  way around.
[2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:08.920]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:13.280]  But the people that are carrying the water for these globalists, the people that are
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:17.200]  going along with it, that are so brainwashed and then, and then shaming people for not
[2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:21.200]  wearing a mask or something, those are the people that upset me and discuss me even more
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:24.640]  because they're the ones carrying this agenda and it's going to be too late by the time
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:26.920]  that they figure out, right?
[2:32:26.920 --> 2:32:27.920]  I agree.
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:32.120]  What do you think President Trump needs to do with them trying to openly war game, having
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:33.620]  states to seed?
[2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:37.000]  And I mean, I think you should attack that head on and point out that it's their next
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.120]  big hoax, their next big coup.
[2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:42.560]  Don't wait till they officially roll it out, which is already starting to happen.
[2:32:42.560 --> 2:32:47.160]  Yeah, no, we need to lead a movement right now, and I'm already starting to activate
[2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:48.160]  some troops.
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:51.520]  You have to be careful about the way that I say that, but we need to lead a movement.
[2:32:51.520 --> 2:32:56.600]  We need to have the militias, we have to have the three percenters, all these people that
[2:32:56.600 --> 2:33:00.840]  really care about our country to go out en masse and actually fight for this and make
[2:33:00.840 --> 2:33:01.840]  a big deal about it.
[2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:06.360]  I am going to start sounding the alarm on it, and I know that you are too, because this
[2:33:06.360 --> 2:33:07.800]  is getting so nuts.
[2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:12.280]  And every time they roll this out by the time people figure it out, it's usually too late.
[2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:15.280]  So yes, I will be sounding the alarm a lot about it, and you're going to hear a lot about
[2:33:15.280 --> 2:33:16.280]  it in the next coming weeks.
[2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:21.880]  I want to talk about what it's like being in California right now, and the exodus happening.
[2:33:21.880 --> 2:33:25.320]  You know, Joe Rogan is moving to Texas.
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:28.080]  He finally went in and announces at the end of the month, I mean, I know where he's moving
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:32.680]  and where and all the rest of it, and I'll just leave it at that, but it's pretty exciting.
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:36.360]  But he talks about what it's like there, and everybody else he knows is leaving as well.
[2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:38.080]  So maybe you need to be leaving.
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:39.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:48.480]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown, and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:52.840]  to be charged with attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery.
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:57.600]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:33:58.600]  and others.
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:02.400]  And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal
[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:06.640]  the election and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:11.000]  John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and, of course, Joe Biden.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:14.840]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:19.680]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote, and we are then going to
[2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:22.800]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:24.920]  This is officially in the New York Times.
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:26.520]  I don't just believe the New York Times.
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:30.000]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan from other statements they've
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:34.520]  made and that Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, and
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:35.920]  the Council on Farm Relations.
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:36.920]  This is their plan.
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:38.720]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:39.720]  What are you going to do?
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:40.720]  I'm serious, folks.
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:42.760]  This is the time to save the country.
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:46.080]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert.
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:49.960]  As of taping this alert, we are 82 days out from the election.
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:53.960]  As many of you know, in the last year, I've pointed out statements out of the Council
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:58.680]  on Farm Relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:34:59.680]  landslide.
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:04.880]  So their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:05.880]  it.
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:09.840]  Then they are openly now war-gaming, this is in the New York Times, having Democrat
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:14.840]  states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's policies
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:17.640]  on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:20.000]  That is nothing but a dressed rehearsal.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:23.760]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in D.C.
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:30.640]  They said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:36.440]  This is their public criminal plan.
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:39.920]  We should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[2:35:39.920 --> 2:35:44.640]  the office to expose his criminal activity.
[2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:47.920]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:53.640]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:58.240]  the Speaker of the House that you are legitimately now the President, that's what she said on
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.560]  CBS News, and that you're going to have those blue states secede.
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:07.520]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:11.360]  backed by the EU, Hollywood, the Chikoms, and the whole globalist system.
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:16.440]  This is treason with a capital T, and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:20.440]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our President has been
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:21.440]  exposing it.
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:22.440]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:26.600]  You need storeable food, we've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:30.040]  to four week delivery, with 80 days out from the election, you need to get high quality
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:33.840]  storeable food right now, in case they are able to pull this off, we're going to have
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:37.760]  a great depression, war on the streets, it'll make a road warrior look like a cake walk.
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:42.440]  You're high quality storeable foods now, and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:43.440]  Get prepared.
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:48.760]  Attention, attention, attention, do anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:54.280]  The New World Order Chikom Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:58.560]  thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:03.040]  They are openly work ending this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:07.760]  and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election, Trump is going,
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:13.240]  they will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris, and that anyone challenging
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:17.520]  that will be called a racist, they will then trigger race riots and violence, they've already
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:19.920]  beta tested around the country.
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:23.120]  We are not living in normal times.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:26.480]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:30.560]  they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era.
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:31.560]  We are.
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:35.560]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:37.640]  is being exposed and removed.
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:41.160]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:47.080]  Spread the word now, Paul Revere's.
[2:37:47.080 --> 2:38:04.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:24.840]  One way or another, I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you one
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:25.840]  way.
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:26.840]  Daniel Lorraine is our guest.
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:30.840]  You can find her new book, Taking Back America on her website.
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:34.560]  What about the cultural rod?
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:36.040]  What about the war on the family?
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:43.240]  I know that you recently did your own reaction video to Cartier B, which it's really even
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:44.240]  hard to play this video.
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:45.240]  It's almost all cussing.
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:52.040]  Where she's teaching young girls to go out and tax men for sex, how to be prostitutes.
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:55.560]  And this is the thing being pushed by the culture, but then people that say that they
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:38:57.560]  believe in a family, they're bad.
[2:38:57.560 --> 2:38:59.920]  Oh, it's absolutely disgusting.
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:06.040]  I kind of created a little monster a couple of days ago inadvertently because I critiqued
[2:39:06.040 --> 2:39:12.440]  Cartier B on her new song, WAP, I'm not even gonna say what the WAP stands for, but the
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:17.360]  whole song is about hoes and basically turning girls into hoes.
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:20.120]  That's really like the underlying premise there.
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:25.640]  And so I said, at a time, first of all, these women and this song is putting back women
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:30.920]  about a hundred years, okay, because feminists have always been calling for respect and getting
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:31.920]  respect and everything.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:36.160]  And they're just setting the whole thing backwards with songs like this, that's absolute filth.
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:40.320]  And secondly, we have a major problem with the broken family unit.
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:44.960]  And one out of every three kids grew up in fatherless homes, but especially in the black
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:45.960]  community.
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:49.360]  In the black community, it's about 80% of children grow up in fatherless homes in the
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:50.360]  black community.
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:53.840]  And do we really need more single baby mamas?
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:56.560]  Do we really need more fatherless homes?
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:01.000]  And this song and songs like this are really perpetuating that culture.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.720]  And oh my God, you would have said I was calling for a black lynching.
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:10.080]  I've gotten thousands of hate mail messages from Cartier B fans saying, how dare you say
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:11.480]  that about blacks?
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:13.480]  How dare you say that about Cartier B?
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:14.800]  I've gotten death threats.
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:17.560]  People have called my personal cell phone number.
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:21.960]  Not sure how they got that, but they're calling me, they're going crazy saying that I'm insulting
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:24.000]  them and then I'm racist, I'm racist.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:25.680]  But all I'm doing is saying a fact.
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:27.400]  And that's the problem with today's day.
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:30.600]  You can't say a fact without being called a racist.
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:32.320]  Now facts are racist.
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:37.360]  I can't say, look, I actually care more about the black community than you probably do.
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:41.280]  Has it ever occurred to you that I think the black community should be thriving and they
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:45.600]  could be thriving, but the broken family unit is a big problem.
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:50.240]  And songs like this that are absolute filth that are teaching women that women's empowerment
[2:40:50.240 --> 2:40:56.200]  is being a hoe and being a sex worker and seeing how many guys you can sleep with.
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.560]  Has it ever occurred to you that that's probably not the good thing for the black community
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:01.680]  and that's creating more brokenness?
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:03.000]  But they don't want to hear it, Alex.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:04.920]  They don't want to hear it.
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:08.680]  And that's the cultural revolution that we're in right now that we also need to be fighting,
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:10.360]  that I'm fighting every day.
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:14.160]  Well, I mean, take black lives matter.
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.240]  Almost none of the people involved are black.
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:20.080]  And then the three women that founded it are all the same thing.
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:27.160]  It's like light flash or it's like the Attorney General in New York, James or any of these
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:28.160]  people.
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:33.040]  They're all, for whatever reason, obese black lesbian women, you know, the lady up in St.
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:37.280]  Louis and guiding the family defended themselves, their house and they they're racist.
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:38.280]  They hate white people.
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:39.280]  They hate men.
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:45.480]  And they say the message is trans men, men cutting their testicles off and they go on
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:49.000]  to say that they want to end the nuclear family.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.800]  So when you point out, hey, this tries to end the nuclear family, you're not kidding.
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:54.300]  They're advertising.
[2:41:54.300 --> 2:41:55.800]  This is the road to happiness.
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:41:58.360]  When it's not, it's the road to prison and destruction.
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:02.760]  So so they're literally there, Judas Goats trying to lead people into destruction.
[2:42:02.760 --> 2:42:06.200]  And the video I wanted, it's not the music video is the one I saw like last Friday.
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:08.560]  I've sent it over a few times.
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:09.560]  Probably best we don't play it.
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:10.560]  Okay.
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:13.800]  You know, I learned to give up some time and it's her with green nails and these other
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:14.800]  women are on there.
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:19.640]  Like, you got to tax it, you got to sell you such as such the men that's how you control
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:23.160]  the men is you got to tax them with your pussy and all this stuff.
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:24.400]  Excuse my friends.
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:25.400]  That's what this has become.
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  It's just incredible.
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:27.400]  Yeah.
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:28.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:33.560]  And the the women that were writing back to me, if you could call them women, but you
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:38.160]  know, you can even go to my Twitter guys, like go to my Twitter, see they're threatening
[2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:39.480]  you saying shut up.
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:40.480]  Oh, yeah.
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:43.040]  And they're saying like, you know, you just you don't get black culture.
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:44.040]  You don't get black culture.
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:48.240]  The revolution is a and T bitch.
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:50.680]  Keep your white female antics to yourself.
[2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:54.880]  Torque is a circle with my ancestors twerking with the circle with my ancestors.
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:42:58.960]  I'm like, well, if that's, you know, yeah, you really showed me, okay, twerking in circle.
[2:42:58.960 --> 2:43:04.240]  If this is the black revolution is turning girls into absolute hose, unabashed hose,
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:07.640]  then you know, great, like that's real a recipe for a thriving culture.
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:10.240]  But we know it that that's not a recipe for thriving culture.
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:11.920]  That's a recipe to send people in prison.
[2:43:11.920 --> 2:43:16.440]  That's a recipe for miserable, you know, depression and more brokenness.
[2:43:16.440 --> 2:43:20.200]  And when you come from a broken family and when you end up in the prison system, et cetera,
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:21.920]  you're a drain on the whole society.
[2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:23.240]  It's not just on a micro level.
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:24.480]  It's a macro level.
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:29.520]  And also if they even care to check at the website of black lives matter, it is a Marxist
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:30.800]  organization.
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:34.500]  And one of their goals is to disrupt the Western nuclear family unit.
[2:43:34.500 --> 2:43:38.720]  It's right there in black and white and to try to raise children by the village.
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:43.600]  You know, Hillary Clinton always says it takes a village to raise a child, all right?
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:45.840]  You know, that's not, that's a communist value.
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:50.200]  It means trying to take parents away from their children and raise them separately so
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:53.800]  they can instill their own creepy communist values in them.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:58.240]  And yet these black lives matter and these white guilt liberals that are protesting for
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:01.280]  black lives matter, they don't know any of this or they don't care.
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:07.240]  And that's what just disgusts me even more and really fires me up.
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:10.960]  You know, we sit here and we talk about what Trump needs to do all day, but what do we
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:11.960]  need to do?
[2:44:11.960 --> 2:44:13.360]  What do you think citizens around the country should do?
[2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:18.200]  I mean, this is such an obvious multinational attempt to take over the United States with
[2:44:18.200 --> 2:44:23.520]  race war and dollar collapse at Soros saying, you know, Trump's created a bubble, pop it
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:25.720]  because he's betting against the United States.
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:29.080]  Of course it's a bubble, but they're trying to pop it because China's created even bigger
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:33.320]  bubble and all these folks that are in league with China promoting the end of America, do
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:36.720]  people realize what's going to happen if the dollar goes down?
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:37.720]  Right.
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:41.160]  No, I don't think they're really realizing it.
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:45.440]  And I also don't think, you know, it's still like, I sound the alarm every day on my podcast,
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:47.680]  okay, about what's coming down the pipe and you do.
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:49.040]  I know you do too.
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:53.440]  So a lot of people just think either it's conspiracy theory or they don't realize like
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:57.400]  the urgency of it, but this is not happening like five years from now.
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:00.120]  And nor is this a pipe dream like this is happening right now.
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:04.560]  They're ushering this stuff in right now and they're pushing for mandatory vaccines.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:07.360]  They're pushing for this global tyranny.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:09.280]  Contact tracing is being pushed in right now.
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:11.680]  It's already being rolled out and activated.
[2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:15.240]  So these things are happening and we need to resist them as much as possible.
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:19.600]  We I, you know, I'm trying to build a coalition, for instance, of, you know, raise a lot of
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:24.920]  money so that we can pay for legal fees of business owners, church owners and citizens
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:27.880]  to fight back to these tyrannical COVID orders.
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:31.520]  A lot of people feel like they can't or they don't have the means to our resources to.
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:34.960]  I want to raise a bunch of money for people to be able to feel like they can fight back
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:39.400]  with confidence and then give them the tools and educate them on their rights so that they
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:44.160]  can fight back and actually win because we have, we have the ability to fight back.
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.800]  We have the masses on our side, but we're not really utilizing them.
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:50.600]  You know, and you're absolutely right.
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:51.600]  You're absolutely right.
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:55.560]  Well, listen, Deanna Lorraine, I'm going to be hosting a special three hour show, seven
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:45:58.640]  to 10 central commercial free.
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:01.440]  If you've got time to pop in for 30 minutes tomorrow night, Roger Stone is going to be
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:02.440]  there.
[2:46:02.440 --> 2:46:05.120]  That's going to be a big event promoting congressional candidates.
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:08.640]  We've got Laura Loomer, who's set to win the primary on as well, but if you can't do
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:09.640]  tomorrow night, that's fine.
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.920]  I'm going to call you later about getting you here in studio with us next week because
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:17.040]  I've been wanting to do that for a while and it's my fault for dropping the ball.
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:18.040]  So I apologize for that.
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:22.120]  And we just really appreciate you and the great book, Taking Back America will talk to you
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  very, very soon.
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  Sounds good.
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:25.120]  Alex.
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:26.120]  Okay.
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:28.800]  I wanted to get Roger on yesterday and they had a time zone issue and he's got some
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:29.800]  breaking news.
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:35.600]  He's going to pop in briefly and then I'll finish up with these few callers, Yanni and
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:40.680]  Clint and Isaiah and Howard and Tim, but I wanted to get him to pop in with Bill Gates
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:45.800]  responding in a Wired Magazine article to Roger's criticism of the danger of these untested
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:47.240]  vaccines that's coming up.
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:55.440]  And then separately, this whole operation, this whole dog hunts because of your patronage,
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:58.760]  because of your support and I salute you and I thank you and I thank this great crew and
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:00.760]  I thank the great audience.
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:02.160]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:06.360]  We've got to end the big Reopen America back to school special.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:08.200]  We've got to end it this Sunday.
[2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:13.840]  It's 50 to 60% off the best selling items, double Patriot points and a lot of these items
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:17.760]  like bodies ultimate tumor formula and living defense that flushes out all the unwanted
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:19.840]  visitors next level probiotic.
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:24.640]  All of that is selling out and because of supply chain breakdowns, a lot of these companies
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:29.520]  aren't even taking the down payment of 25% or 50% the varies with the companies to get
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:30.520]  it produced.
[2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:32.480]  Then we pay it on the rest of Liberty.
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:36.320]  There's that much of a breakdown as you've heard with the truck drivers and the callers.
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:39.320]  Not because the products aren't there, but because of the breakdown of the warehouses
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:41.000]  and all the hysteria.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.260]  Everyone's scared to leave their houses.
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:46.320]  This is humanity being domesticated next level.
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.160]  The answer is get out on the farms, get out on the ranches.
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:53.360]  If you can get out of the cities, but for now get prepared, get ready and listen.
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:58.600]  We have the highest quality storeable food in the best packaging you're going to find.
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:47:59.600]  It's amazing.
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:00.600]  It's high quality.
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:02.920]  They're ready to ship within two to four weeks, depending on what item you order most
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:04.080]  of us two weeks.
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:05.320]  They have it all in stock.
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:08.040]  You need to get your food now before all hell breaks loose.
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  You need firearms.
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:11.040]  We don't sell those.
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:12.040]  You need water filtration.
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:13.040]  We do sell that.
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:16.520]  I'm telling you, get your storeable food needs handled at infowarstore.com while you still
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:17.520]  can.
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  Don't wait.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:19.960]  Don't be like the grasshopper that doesn't get ready.
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:23.200]  Get ready like the pan because things are crazy.
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:24.920]  We're getting Roger Stone on the line.
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:32.880]  He's got key intel and so much more and I am fit to be tired of what's going on.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:37.040]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything.
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:41.360]  They also bet, as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will adapt
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:45.600]  to being a slave, that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:49.520]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:52.720]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:54.560]  They lied about where it came from.
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:59.200]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:05.960]  at 4% when it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.000]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.960]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:14.880]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown.
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:16.360]  Now we're six months later.
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:17.960]  Now they say it's permanent.
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:21.640]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere
[2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:25.720]  you go and what you do, the global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody
[2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:29.120]  questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:30.760]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:33.400]  That's called world government takeover.
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:38.760]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:40.680]  serious cognitive problems.
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:45.840]  He has always been an implicit that does what he's told by the globalist and their allied
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:47.360]  crime syndicates.
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:50.600]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:55.040]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms and others.
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:50:01.560]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:06.240]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:15.880]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  than white people.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:22.680]  The woman is a monster, Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:28.280]  to steal the election and she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:31.000]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  We must expose the globalist.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:51:04.880]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner
[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:09.160]  or later, going to put you on our number four, John Rappaport's coming up.
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:11.760]  I'll hit a few year calls as well.
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:16.920]  So much to counter so much to deal with, but I wanted to get Roger Stone to pop on today
[2:51:16.920 --> 2:51:18.520]  ahead of a special three hour broadcast.
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:23.800]  They'll be part of tomorrow night, seven 10 p.m. with Laura Loomer and many others.
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:31.120]  But Bill Gates specifically singled out Roger Stone in a Wired Magazine article concerning
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:35.880]  vaccines and the testing being fraudulent and he admitted the testing is almost all
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:36.880]  fake positives.
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:37.880]  So very, very bizarre.
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:43.600]  So I wanted to get a chance to get Roger Stone's response to the great Dr. Bill Gates, the
[2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:46.640]  man in control of our destiny, he says, responding to him.
[2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:48.680]  Why do you think this happened, Roger?
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:51.960]  Well, Alex, let me put it this way.
[2:51:51.960 --> 2:51:59.000]  I revel in Bill Gates' hatred because if I was not effective, he would not hate me.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:06.360]  And when I questioned his role in trying to benefit and profit from this pandemic, it
[2:52:06.360 --> 2:52:14.800]  obviously hit the target right on and therefore he has fired back.
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:23.400]  It is absolutely clear that he and his cohorts intend to try to use this public health crisis
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:31.000]  to their political and geopolitical benefit and to reap millions while they're doing it.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:36.240]  If not millions, and it's so bold that they own the patents on coming out of vaccines for
[2:52:36.240 --> 2:52:41.840]  COVID-type viruses and that Fauci's involved and they both go on patents and that he ran
[2:52:41.840 --> 2:52:48.360]  Operation Event 201 and that he's up there telling us what's going to happen next.
[2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:53.640]  I mean, from your research, as a former top lobbyist, have you ever seen anyone maneuver
[2:52:53.640 --> 2:52:58.240]  themselves into a position of power like this other than a president?
[2:52:58.240 --> 2:53:04.560]  Well, it helps to have billions of dollars to begin with, which he has at his access.
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:10.880]  He can buy access, he can buy politicians, buy the boatload, and it's clear that he has
[2:53:10.880 --> 2:53:12.720]  a plan.
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:19.000]  Anybody who will do the basic research can see that the public is being manipulated and
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:26.160]  that he hopes to ultimately, I believe, have a mandatory vaccination and perhaps even a
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:27.160]  chip.
[2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:31.160]  I can't speak for you, Alex, but I'm not going to be vaccinated nor am I going to be
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:32.160]  chipped.
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:38.600]  And I think most Americans will refuse this, but you were predicting this decades ago before
[2:53:38.600 --> 2:53:41.520]  even I realized it was a possibility.
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:44.960]  I recognize the electoral plan here.
[2:53:44.960 --> 2:53:51.760]  It seems very obvious to me, but they intend to steal the next election through widespread
[2:53:51.760 --> 2:53:58.360]  ballot fraud, but they're trying to inoculate the public to what is happening by saying
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:05.040]  out front, Trump is going to be defeated and refused to leave office, translation.
[2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:11.000]  We're going to steal this from Trump and we intend to limit his ability to challenge
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:15.560]  the theft in the courts and in the court of public opinion.
[2:54:15.560 --> 2:54:18.840]  They're trying to co-op the president's position.
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:21.680]  I still believe we had an honest election.
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:26.960]  That means an election in which only people who were legally eligible to vote and they
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:32.880]  only voted once, Donald Trump would win in a landslide.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:36.120]  We've got one more segment with you when we come back and I want you to recap that because
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:38.360]  I want to try to get this message to the president.
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:43.840]  We have the New York times for those who just joined us saying, yeah, it's true.
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:48.600]  We war game with the top Democrats, John Podesta, not leaving office, having Democrat states
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:55.320]  secede and then having our own inauguration for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and then Pelosi
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:58.360]  is giving interviews saying, oh, I'm second in command.
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:00.040]  We'll just have another inauguration.
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:01.200]  We don't need to be in DC.
[2:55:01.200 --> 2:55:06.320]  So they're saying to governments at once, the Roman Empire splitting into we'll be back
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:09.040]  in 60 seconds with Roger Stone to talk about this.
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:10.400]  This is so otherworldly.
[2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:14.160]  And then Trump's statement a few days ago, hey, I may be gone for a long time.
[2:55:14.160 --> 2:55:16.040]  The corrupt elites are really angry at me.
[2:55:16.040 --> 2:55:20.640]  I mean, this is all edge of your seat, crazy time.
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:23.640]  And Roger Stone has been given clemency.
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:26.960]  It's all just otherworldly to know Roger and to be in the middle of this and you're all
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:27.960]  in the middle of this.
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:30.640]  We're all in the middle of it on this planet and it's just going to get wilder in the next
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:31.640]  82 days.
[2:55:31.640 --> 2:55:32.640]  Stay with us.
[2:55:32.640 --> 2:55:42.880]  Roger Stone on the other side.
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:47.720]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday, August 12, 2025 is coming Sunday.
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:52.240]  This huge sale we've been running for last week, we'll have to end the reopened America
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:56:00.000]  back to school special 50% off 60% off all of our top best sellers and double Patriot
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  points.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:05.440]  We'll have to end this sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off living defense
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:09.800]  of the percent off as of the percent off turbo forcing percent off by the middle decent
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:10.800]  percent off.
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:14.960]  Those are all very close to selling out a bunch of other best sellers we still have,
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:17.560]  but I will end this special on Sunday.
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:23.880]  We have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:26.360]  X to the original will be back in stock.
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:28.640]  It will be discounted, but it's not available yet.
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:33.440]  So this is a great sale, it funds the operation, they're great items in crazy times like this,
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:37.240]  it's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading the word about Info Wars because
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:54.560]  you are the modern voice, you are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you.
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:57:17.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:24.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you with extremely serious information and Roger Stones here
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:28.680]  with us to give us an expert analysis Bill Gates has just responded to him in a Wired
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:34.880]  magazine article and said, how dare him question if Bill Gates is making money off the vaccine,
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:40.360]  even though he is along with Fauci, so this is a very Trumpian thing that Stone does an
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:41.360]  attack on the president.
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:47.440]  The president now knows that Gates is working against him with the medical deep state, but
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:50.840]  the big thing I want to cover in a message that sure to get to the president from Roger
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:57.640]  Stone is Roger's response to President Trump last Thursday saying, I may be gone for a
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:03.080]  long time, they may try to take me out, I'm going out to China, big pharma and some very
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:06.600]  big powerful corrupt organizations.
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:08.240]  What does that cryptic statement mean?
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:13.520]  Well we know, headline Breitbart.com, Democrats war game for election includes West Coast
[2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:20.800]  secession, civil war, and that's why Pelosi said we'll have our own inauguration and he
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:23.760]  won't be the president and then we'll see what the military does, well it turns out
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:29.240]  Podesta running it with the Clintons, Obama and Biden, this is the New York Times, got
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:35.320]  almost no attention last week, said their war gaming to lock the country down, hold
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:42.040]  it hostage, have the western states at least secede and then have the military remove Trump.
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:48.920]  This is showdown at the okay corral on steroids, Roger Stone, you've got the floor in the minutes
[2:58:48.920 --> 2:58:54.520]  we have, former top political advisor to President Trump, what's really going on, what are they
[2:58:54.520 --> 2:58:59.360]  pre-programming people for, and what should President Trump do?
[2:58:59.360 --> 2:59:06.720]  Well that of course Alex is the game plan for the side that lost, in other words, possession
[2:59:06.720 --> 2:59:12.080]  is nine tenths of the law, if the president wins this election, which I think he will
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:18.280]  in the end, and they'll be the ones disputing that, that certainly could be decided in the
[2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:19.280]  courts.
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:26.000]  Al Gore lost in 2000, he did not go out and set up a shadow government and declare himself
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:29.200]  president of an alternative country.
[2:59:29.200 --> 2:59:35.080]  What I think is important here of course is to maximize our chances of winning a clear
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:38.080]  cut victory that cannot be disputed.
[2:59:38.080 --> 2:59:44.760]  I actually think that the selection of Kamala Harris will prove to be an error, as you know
[2:59:44.760 --> 2:59:51.760]  I'm extremely critical of Joe Biden for his role in turbocharging the war on drugs.
[2:59:51.760 --> 2:59:58.720]  It is Joe Biden who fathered the legislation that requires the harsh mandatory penalties
[2:59:58.720 --> 3:00:06.400]  for the first time nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:11.280]  Drug abuse is a public health problem, not a criminal justice problem, but thanks to
[3:00:11.280 --> 3:00:16.320]  Joe Biden, literally hundreds of thousands at this point, probably millions of black
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:23.400]  people who are not violent criminals, have been incarcerated for ridiculously long periods
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:30.680]  of time, taxpayers are paying to house and feed and incarcerate people who are not violent
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:37.280]  criminals, people who need rehabilitation, not incarceration, and here's the kicker.
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:44.120]  Kamala Harris' record on these issues is as bad as Joe, as district attorney and as
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:46.960]  attorney general of California.
[3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:53.600]  We not only incarcerated a record number of people for possession, these aren't drug
[3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:58.880]  dealers and drug tin cans we're talking about, but in some cases she fought for extending
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:05.880]  their sentences beyond their term so the state could benefit from their free labor.
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:07.240]  Who are the racists?
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:12.840]  I say they are the racists, and I've seen this commercial that the Trump campaign comes
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:18.760]  out, came out with, that had a bunch of racist quotes by Joe Biden, but Alice, I would suggest
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:22.880]  you that deeds are more important than words.
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:28.760]  Just look at his record, whether it is his opposition to the integration of the Wilmington
[3:01:28.760 --> 3:01:36.160]  Delaware school system, whether it is his responsibility for turbocharging the failed
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:38.560]  racist war on drugs.
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:44.720]  Joe Biden, I don't understand how any person of color could vote for him given his actual
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:47.720]  record.
[3:01:47.720 --> 3:01:53.600]  Now I totally agree with you and this is so historic and I agree, it shows their desperation
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:59.720]  that they're already pre-preparing people that secession is normal and martial law is
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:04.840]  normal and civil war is normal and that the military is going to walk him out, it's almost
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:10.120]  like a ghost dance, like they're hoping that this is going to happen, everything else they've
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:11.320]  done has failed.
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:16.880]  It just seems so dangerous to sit here 80 days out and wait for them to try this again
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.560]  when it's a giant destabilizing criminal fraud that can tank the economy and then they'll
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:28.200]  hold his hostage and say, it's Trump's fault, I just don't like sitting here taking it.
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:30.000]  It's a legitimate concern.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:36.320]  My concern, of course, is that during the eight years of the Obama presidency, most
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:43.160]  of the conservative or patriotic-oriented generals and admirals at the upper levels
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:51.160]  of our military were retired and those who were promoted were largely globalists.
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:57.920]  My fear, while I believe the rank and file and even those in the mid-level of our military,
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:03.400]  our patriotic Americans, think like you and I, and will follow a direct order from the
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:09.640]  commander of chief, I worry about soldiers like, oh, I don't know, the Vindman brothers,
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:11.040]  for example.
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:18.880]  Those two liars who tried to bring the president down through false testimony regarding Ukraine,
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:20.040]  they're in the military.
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:23.560]  What does that say about where the army stands?
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:29.120]  Because that will be the crucial question in a showdown in which I predict you're going
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:37.880]  to have two different sets of election results, the real results, and the fabricated results,
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:40.520]  and we're going to fight this down to the wire.
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:44.440]  The deep state has shown that they don't have any rules.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:46.520]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:48.760]  They certainly don't care about the law.
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:54.480]  They will create their own reality, their expert at it.
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:57.600]  I've had a front row seat in that.
[3:03:57.600 --> 3:04:06.040]  So the president has thwarted them now twice, three times if you count COVID-19, and he's
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:07.040]  a brawler.
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:11.760]  It's not going down without a fight, and they know it, and they're preparing for the
[3:04:11.760 --> 3:04:12.760]  worst.
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:13.760]  That's right.
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:20.280]  In his comments last week, Alex, I pray for the president and his family and their safety
[3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:21.840]  every single day.
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:24.880]  I'm a living example that prayer works.
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:29.840]  I'm a living example that prayer is obscenely effective, and the best thing the Info Warriors
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:34.240]  can do is pray, day and night, for the safety of Donald Trump.
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:35.240]  Amen to that.
[3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:39.400]  He'll remain healthy, healthy, and vital and strong for the fight ahead.
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  Amen to that.
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:43.720]  And closing before you join us again tomorrow night, Roger, and I know you're doing a great
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:48.920]  job now, released like the Kraken from your prison of gag order, doing dozens of interviews
[3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:49.920]  a day.
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:50.920]  You're having a huge effect.
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:53.720]  I love seeing you out there with interviews, the millions of views every day, hundreds
[3:04:53.720 --> 3:04:54.880]  of thousands of views.
[3:04:54.880 --> 3:04:58.520]  They're definitely crapping their britches because you are, you are definitely in your
[3:04:58.520 --> 3:04:59.520]  prime.
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:03.600]  Now, Kamala Harris said this back in June of this year on the 18th, and once Trump's
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:08.880]  gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported
[3:05:08.880 --> 3:05:13.440]  him and endorsed his actions because you will be coming for you next.
[3:05:13.440 --> 3:05:14.800]  We'll be coming for you next.
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:16.600]  You will feel the vengeance of a nation.
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:22.160]  No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation.
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:26.760]  For it is you who have betrayed us, Kamala Harris, and the rest of them are saying they're
[3:05:26.760 --> 3:05:28.600]  going to persecute all of us.
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:30.160]  God forbid they get rid of Trump.
[3:05:30.160 --> 3:05:33.520]  Can you imagine the reign of terror they're going to be involved in?
[3:05:33.520 --> 3:05:38.880]  Well, that quote has been pointed out to be by numerous people because that appears to
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:46.240]  be a reference to me specifically, not surprising because Andrew Weissman, the epically corrupt
[3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:51.680]  federal prosecutor who really ran the Mueller investigation, basically already wrote an
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:56.400]  op-ed saying, we will retry stone as soon as we have power.
[3:05:56.400 --> 3:05:57.520]  They don't need charges.
[3:05:57.520 --> 3:05:59.040]  They just need the machinery.
[3:05:59.040 --> 3:06:03.160]  And that's why I raise that because the same groups after me, you know, we can't get into
[3:06:03.160 --> 3:06:04.160]  details.
[3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:05.160]  Exactly.
[3:06:05.160 --> 3:06:06.160]  She's saying no stone unturned.
[3:06:06.160 --> 3:06:13.360]  That was right up your pardon, or when the move towards your clemency was being built.
[3:06:13.360 --> 3:06:14.360]  Yeah.
[3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:16.040]  I mean, this is outrageous threats.
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:23.960]  Well, everything you say is true, but I would also remind you of the Tim Clemens prophecy
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:30.480]  that many Christians believe in, in which he predicts that David would take down Goliath,
[3:06:30.480 --> 3:06:36.240]  meaning those who would destroy the United States, he predicted, as you know, that Donald
[3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:38.160]  Trump would be elected president.
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:44.240]  Hold on, Rodgers, hold on one second.
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:50.760]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the list goes on from there have
[3:06:50.760 --> 3:06:55.160]  all gone on national TV, have all gone on the Internet, and have been in the pages of
[3:06:55.160 --> 3:07:00.520]  the New York Times, that they're wargaming contesting the election when they lose.
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:05.080]  They know there's a landslide, that they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:10.840]  it and have Democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for
[3:07:10.840 --> 3:07:13.600]  Joe Biden and the other public, Kamala Harris.
[3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:19.000]  This has now been announced, and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.200]  try to drive Trump from office.
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:25.760]  The Democratic Party, the chai comms, the deep state, are using Black Lives Matter funded
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:31.840]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:37.080]  riots and martial law, that you're a racist, when in truth, an old Nazi collaborator,
[3:07:37.080 --> 3:07:40.600]  George Soros, created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa.
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:43.560]  America's fighting for its life, but we will win.
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:49.200]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown, and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:53.560]  to be charged for the tinted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery.
[3:07:53.560 --> 3:07:58.320]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[3:07:58.320 --> 3:07:59.320]  and others.
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:03.120]  And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal
[3:08:03.120 --> 3:08:07.360]  the election and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:11.720]  John Podesta at the very top, with Kamala Harris and of course, Joe Biden.
[3:08:11.720 --> 3:08:15.560]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:20.320]  states to cede, claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote, and we are then going
[3:08:20.320 --> 3:08:23.520]  to set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[3:08:23.520 --> 3:08:27.240]  This is officially in the New York Times, and I don't just believe the New York Times.
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:30.720]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan from other statements they've
[3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:35.280]  made and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, and the
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:36.640]  Council on Farm Relations.
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:37.640]  This is their plan.
[3:08:37.640 --> 3:08:39.440]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:40.440]  What are you going to do?
[3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:41.440]  I'm serious, folks.
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:47.160]  This is the time to save the country.
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:54.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:06.760]  All right, Roger Stone's got a few more minutes with us, and he can do the whole hour.
[3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:07.760]  He's very gracious.
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:10.960]  He's on a way to a speech, but I need John Ralford, who's voted for mayor bill takeover,
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:15.360]  and Roger will join us tomorrow night, 7 to 10 p.m., we think it'll be all of us, the
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:19.440]  second hour, commercial free, and we'll have a couple hundred thousand people to tune into
[3:09:19.440 --> 3:09:20.440]  these live shows.
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:24.600]  I had some great crowd, that's two football stadiums, but I want to reach other people
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:29.600]  if those two football stadiums send out an email, and Facebook, and Twitter, and word
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:36.240]  of mouth, hey, hear the forbidden conversation live, commercial free, hear the verboten.
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:39.960]  Sometimes we've had three, four million people tuned into these streams four years ago during
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:45.200]  the election, and it's happening again, despite all the censorship, all the craziness, new
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:50.920]  channels pop up on YouTube every day, some of them will have 500,000 views in a couple
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:53.080]  hours, then they ban them.
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  So now an info wars whack-a-mole pops up, 200, 300, 400, 500,000 views on YouTube, and
[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:03.880]  I know it's really pissed off the deep state, they're trying to shut it down, but man, and
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:07.960]  we're on all these radio stations, banned off videos, got five times the traffic it had,
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:11.480]  folks coming out of the servers, I've spent millions to pay for it, but I love it, so
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:13.560]  thanks for funding us, folks, so we can do it.
[3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:18.920]  John Routeport is about to take over, no more fake news.com, but Roger Stone, finishing
[3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:22.440]  up, you were recapping, you were talking about that prophecy, please repeat that and finish
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  it off.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:30.280]  Sure, Alex, you had made reference to the fact that it appeared to me like Kamala Harris
[3:10:30.280 --> 3:10:36.560]  in a threat named me specifically as among those who would be punished if they were to
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.600]  take power, punished for supporting Donald Trump, but I was reminding you of the Kim
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:43.600]  Clemens prophecy.
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:49.600]  Now, Kim Clemens was an evangelist, he's no longer with us, I'm in touch with his family,
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:54.840]  who, by the way, has been banned from entering the United States by the Obama administration.
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:10:55.840]  Wow.
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:02.920]  Something I'm digging into, but Kim Clemens basically foresaw the election of Donald Trump,
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:09.280]  foresaw the failed impeachment, he has had an extraordinary record of accuracy, and
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:16.560]  he talks about this epic struggle saying they shall be shocked how he takes the giant down.
[3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:22.520]  The brothers of Goliath stand in glee watching America, we will cripple you, they yell, you
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:30.320]  will lose your credit, you will be destroyed, God replied, watch, look not to Wall Street
[3:11:30.320 --> 3:11:36.760]  however, but observe, what is your plan for this giant they demanded?
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:42.680]  And the Lord took a simple stone, remember that name, and he will hold it up and they
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:48.760]  will laugh at him, but the plan is so brilliant said the Lord that it could only have been
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:53.360]  given by me, that is the prophecy of Kim Clemens.
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:12:00.840]  So if I am in this time, in this place, if there is work that God wants me to do, I'm
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:06.600]  prepared, Alex, when God is ready to reveal his plan to me, I believe he will, and I will
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:11.000]  serve my God and my country as I'm supposed to.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:16.800]  I do believe that I was put in this epic struggle for freedom for some good reason, that I'm
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:23.280]  here in this time, in this place as you are, to save not just the United States of America,
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:24.280]  but Western civilization.
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:29.360]  Well, Roger, I remember hearing about Kim Clemens before Trump got elected and all the
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:33.240]  rest of it, I remember reading that and seeing that, and then now how obsessed they are with
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:38.000]  you and me to a secondary level, and Bill Gates coming out and attacking you, it is getting
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.040]  really crazy and really wild.
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:43.960]  All right, well, thank you so much, Roger, what's the best website for people to visit?
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:46.120]  Is it stonedefencefund.com?
[3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:51.920]  Stonedefencefund.com, because I still have to finance my appeal, I continue to insist
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:57.320]  that I am innocent, but more importantly, I want to expose the deep state at the appeal
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:12:58.480]  court level.
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:00.920]  It will all be revealed if I can get to appeal.
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:03.880]  All right, we'll talk to you tomorrow night, be safe.
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:05.640]  Look forward to it, God bless you, Alex.
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:06.640]  God bless you.
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:13.240]  NoMoreFakeNews.com, NoMoreFakeNews.com, people always wait for Wednesdays when John Rampford
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:15.640]  is here, we're starting to kind of know his time today, but he understands we have to
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:16.640]  do that sometimes.
[3:13:16.640 --> 3:13:17.640]  So thank you, sir.
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:18.640]  Tell us what you're about to cover.
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:24.800]  Okay, Alex, well, I'm just going to run down my research going back to the beginning of
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:31.760]  this whole coronavirus fake pandemic, because that's what I've done on my website.
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:38.240]  I've decided to go back to the beginning and just retrace every fake step all the way to
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:39.240]  the present.
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:46.800]  So I'll compress it down and just lay it out in the rest of the hour here.
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:49.400]  The floor is yours, my friend.
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:51.440]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:53.040]  Always good to talk to you.
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:14:04.200]  Okay, folks, so as we approach the first break here, I decided, because there are so many
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:12.880]  new people coming on board, readers and so on, let's go back to the beginning, how this
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:19.880]  all started, when I began to look into it and write articles and so on, been covering
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:26.800]  fake epidemics for 30 years, this pattern looks the same.
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:30.080]  So where does it begin?
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:39.360]  First of all, all the exercises, the planning sessions, the drills, the meetings, the seminars
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:48.800]  that people have detailed, the basic purpose of all of that pre-planning is to create a
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:59.760]  structure that will sell a story when the time comes, sell a story about a virus.
[3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:02.000]  That's what this is all about.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:09.520]  To create the structure worldwide, to weld it into place, yes, of course, it involves
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:18.920]  media, but it also involves public health agencies, not only the CDC and the World Health Organization,
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:26.760]  but individual national public health agencies in the U.S. at the state level, surrounding
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:33.360]  governors and mayors, they all have public health advisors, they bring the mayors and
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:41.560]  the governors in on these meetings, and they get agreement and understanding that if something
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:52.480]  sparks off, if there is a pandemic, some sort of sudden outbreak that everybody is on board
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:55.320]  with the message.
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:16:04.920]  That's how these political leaders were entrained and prepared and prepped to respond unanimously
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:09.560]  when the announcement was made that something happened in China.
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:13.040]  This is very important to understand.
[3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:22.960]  The pre-pandemic planning was about that, above and beyond everything else.
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:31.880]  How to install this structure to get stimulus response action from political leaders all
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:40.400]  the way up to the top of nations, to the top of states, so that when the trigger is pulled,
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:43.360]  everything becomes automatic.
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:53.280]  If the CDC, the World Health Organization, Bill Gates, etc., say it's time for lockdowns,
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:55.600]  everybody goes along.
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:17:04.760]  That was the plan to sell a story about a virus that would function as a cover story
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:12.920]  for the real war, economic devastation, and attack on the population of the planet, which
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:22.040]  is phase one of the transformation from the way things have been to the new normal, the
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:28.160]  new technocracy, the new fascism, the new tyranny.
[3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:34.680]  That is step one of creating a fake pandemic.
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:43.120]  We'll be back after the break with a lot more, and John Robin will be back for you.
[3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:46.400]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:52.160]  Well, you trigger race riots, and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:56.560]  the Speaker of the House that you are legitimately now the President, that's what she's said
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:02.440]  on CBS News, and that you're going to have those blue states secede, yes, that's officially
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:07.480]  called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood,
[3:18:07.480 --> 3:18:09.840]  the Chycoms, and the whole globalist system.
[3:18:09.840 --> 3:18:14.920]  This is treason with a capital T, and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:18.920]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our President has been
[3:18:18.920 --> 3:18:19.920]  exposing it.
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:23.800]  But here's the bottom line, you need storyable food, we've got the best quality ready to
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:27.920]  ship to you right now, two to four week delivery, with 80 days out from the election, you need
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:32.120]  to get high quality storyable food right now, in case they are able to pull this off, we're
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:35.120]  going to have a great depression, war on the streets, it will make a road warrior look
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:39.120]  like a cakewalk, get your high quality storyable foods now, and get ready and get prepared
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:42.080]  at infowarstore.com, get prepared.
[3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:47.960]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert, as of taking this alert, we are 82 days out
[3:18:47.960 --> 3:18:48.960]  from the election.
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:53.640]  As many of you know in the last year, I pointed out statements out of the Council on Foreign
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:18:58.880]  Relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a landslide,
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:04.560]  so their strategy will be to contest the election, if they fail to successfully steal it.
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:09.120]  Then, they are openly now wargaming, this is in the New York Times, having democratic
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:14.120]  states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's policies
[3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:16.920]  and coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:20.520]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal, they are saying they're going to have their own
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:26.400]  separate inauguration, not in DC, they said in another city, Pelosi has said this, when
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:29.920]  they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:35.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war, this is their public criminal plan,
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:39.240]  we should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:42.840]  the office to expose his criminal activity.
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:46.120]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[3:19:46.120 --> 3:19:51.880]  Well, you trigger race riots, and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:56.280]  the Speaker of the House, that you are legitimately now the President, that's what she's said
[3:19:56.280 --> 3:20:02.160]  on CBS News, and that you're going to have those blue states secede, yes, that's officially
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:07.200]  called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood,
[3:20:07.200 --> 3:20:09.560]  the Chikoms, and the whole globalist system.
[3:20:09.560 --> 3:20:14.760]  This is treason with a capital T, and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards,
[3:20:14.760 --> 3:20:18.640]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our President has been
[3:20:18.640 --> 3:20:19.640]  exposing it.
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:23.760]  Here's the bottom line, you need durable food, we've got the best quality, ready to ship
[3:20:23.760 --> 3:20:27.640]  to you right now, two to four week delivery, with 80 days out from the election, you need
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:31.840]  to get high quality, durable food right now, in case they are able to pull this off, we're
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:34.840]  going to have a great depression, war on the streets, it will make a road warrior look
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:38.880]  like a cake walk, get your high quality, durable foods now, and get ready to get prepared,
[3:20:38.880 --> 3:20:44.760]  at infowarstore.com, get prepared.
[3:20:44.760 --> 3:21:11.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:11.880 --> 3:21:15.640]  One, grab a board.
[3:21:15.640 --> 3:21:22.960]  Alright, continuing with the creation of a false pandemic.
[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:30.520]  Once you got the structure in place and the messaging, then you have to have an outbreak,
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:33.520]  which means a story about an outbreak.
[3:21:33.520 --> 3:21:39.320]  It doesn't mean a real outbreak, because it's much easier and much more controllables
[3:21:39.320 --> 3:21:46.320]  to sell a story about a virus than an actual virus. And I've spent many hours and many
[3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:57.100]  articles about this just to boil it down. In Wuhan, a story emerged about a novel virus.
[3:21:57.100 --> 3:22:02.960]  It was a fake story. It continues to be a fake story. I'm now publishing articles that
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:12.120]  no more fake news about the fake discovery of the new coronavirus. What does that mean?
[3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:18.520]  That means that researchers, some of whom, many of whom believe they're actually carrying
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:27.080]  out correct procedures to isolate a new virus, are not. They are carrying out procedures
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:33.440]  that can result in all kinds of extraneous material and irrelevant material being called
[3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:39.840]  a new virus, which is what happens. And they say we have a new virus, and we're going to
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:47.480]  call it SARS-CoV-2, and here it is, and it's spreading across the planet. That's the story.
[3:22:47.480 --> 3:22:54.520]  That's the cover story. That's the messaging, and it goes wall to wall. And then China locks
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:23:01.160]  down 50 million people overnight, which hasn't ever been done before at that scale in the
[3:23:01.160 --> 3:23:11.520]  history of human cons. And they sell that. We're restraining and constraining the virus.
[3:23:11.520 --> 3:23:18.680]  That's why we locked down 50 million people overnight. And remember, this also took place
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:24.280]  at a time of the Chinese New Year when there were hundreds of millions of people already
[3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:31.360]  moving about China. So they tried to squelch all of that. Of course, they couldn't, and
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:39.400]  they knew they couldn't. But they said we're locking down 50 million people. Then the CDC
[3:23:39.400 --> 3:23:45.880]  and the World Health Organization and Bill Gates turned around as if pleasantly shocked
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:52.480]  by this, as if they didn't know this was already in the planning, and said, my goodness, look
[3:23:52.480 --> 3:23:58.800]  at what's just happened. China locked down 50 million people. That must mean it's quite
[3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:06.080]  serious and quite heavy. And in the West, we may have to do the same thing. And now we
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:14.000]  can because China's broken the ice. China has set the new standard and all praise to
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:18.760]  China. That's exactly what happened.
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:24.400]  So now the entire Western world and other nations all around the world were teetering
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:35.840]  on the edge of declaring lockdowns. Italy did declare national lockdown based on nothing.
[3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:47.120]  Again, fake discovery of new virus based on nothing. So there needed to be one more little
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:53.440]  piece of the puzzle. And that was provided by Neil Ferguson, a computer modeler at the
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:25:01.080]  Imperial College of London. Ferguson's Institute is bankrolled by Bill Gates to the tune of
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:08.800]  tens of millions of dollars a year. Neil Ferguson is a failed computer modeler who is world
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:17.320]  famous for some unknown reason, certainly not as competence. I've detailed all of this.
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:24.440]  But nevertheless, he makes a dire prediction. 500,000 deaths in the UK, 2 million in the
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:33.240]  US. These figures are transmitted through Fauci, through other people, to Boris Johnson,
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:40.760]  to Donald Trump, and they fold like a cheap suit. Well, you're saying that two million
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:46.320]  deaths are going to be on my head unless I support state of emergency and lockdown in
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:53.720]  the whole country. Yes, sir. And then it was done. And it's still being done. And it can
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:26:04.560]  be done again because these opening ups of the economy are all conditional on what are
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:11.000]  the case numbers. So now we come to the fake diagnostic tests, which are supposedly the
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:20.240]  basis of all of these case numbers and death numbers. The tests, as serious people know,
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:28.320]  are inherently flawed to produce false positive results like coins coming out of a jackpot
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:40.960]  rig slot machine. That is, the test will read false positive pointing to COVID, okay, based
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:49.600]  on completely irrelevant germs in the body that have nothing to do with anything. Perfect.
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:56.280]  That gives you the case numbers, which are entirely meaningless and rigged and inflated
[3:26:56.280 --> 3:27:03.240]  16 different ways from Sunday. I've detailed all of that. So have other people. But the
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:09.960]  fundamental fakery in the diagnostic test is that they're looking for a virus that was
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:19.040]  never discovered in the first place. But nevertheless, this produces all the fake COVID case numbers,
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:25.600]  the death numbers and so on, which are hyped by the messaging wall to wall throughout the
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:32.840]  world by governors, mayors, premiers, prime ministers and presidents, public health authorities,
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:41.280]  and lead to more and more lockdowns and economic devastation, which again, is really the intent
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:52.080]  of the whole operation to create wreckage and chaos, poverty, despair, murder, suicide,
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:28:03.320]  et cetera, et cetera, bankruptcies, the end of the current currency system throughout
[3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:12.800]  the planet. The virus story is the cover story under which the real economic war is taken
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:22.520]  place. Now, as this operation proceeds, there are other branches that move off the central
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:32.720]  trunk of the tree, such as public health agencies will expand the definition of a case of COVID-19
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:40.320]  in order to billow and inflate the case numbers. For example, if you look at the March and
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:49.080]  April statements by the CDC, you will see that pretty much anybody can be diagnosed
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:29:00.000]  with COVID-19 without a test, chills and fever or a cough and a contact with some group
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:09.280]  said to be at risk, diagnose them as a COVID case. So there is the definition expanding
[3:29:09.280 --> 3:29:19.320]  phase where more and more people are brought under this fake umbrella of being COVID cases.
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:27.440]  And then of course, you also expand not only the number of people that can be brought into
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:35.440]  the game, but the number of symptoms that can be attributed to COVID-19 with no scientific
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:44.720]  rigorous evidence whatsoever, or heart attacks, mental disorders, whatever, whatever, whatever,
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:53.320]  and suddenly you have expanding coverage and definition of COVID-19, and you have more
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:30:01.080]  and more cases escalating more fear, etc., etc. Then because of the masks and the social
[3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:09.560]  distancing which are completely counterproductive and meaningless for all sorts of reasons,
[3:30:09.560 --> 3:30:17.040]  you isolate people from not only their loved ones, but from everybody else so that people
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:26.720]  can't righteously collect in one place to protest, to rebel, etc., etc., etc., because
[3:30:26.720 --> 3:30:32.800]  they're isolated. Now you're getting the picture, the fuller picture of how this whole
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:41.120]  operation works. I'll have more after the break. This is John Rappel for Not Inferno Wars.
[3:30:41.120 --> 3:30:46.440]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[3:30:46.440 --> 3:30:51.960]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate, is making its move to implode the dollar and
[3:30:51.960 --> 3:30:56.920]  thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election. They are openly
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:31:01.040]  wargaming this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi and others have
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:06.120]  gone on television and said they will contest the election. Trump is going. They will hold
[3:31:06.120 --> 3:31:11.200]  a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris, and that anyone challenging that will
[3:31:11.200 --> 3:31:15.440]  be called a racist. They will then trigger race riots and violence. They've already beta
[3:31:15.440 --> 3:31:21.280]  tested around the country. We are not living in normal times. When these type of things
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:25.600]  happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're
[3:31:25.600 --> 3:31:30.760]  living in such a criminal era. We are. We are living in the period where this criminal
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:35.360]  globalist syndicate that's been feeding on America is being exposed and removed. Now
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:39.160]  is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country. Spread the
[3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:44.720]  word now, Paul Reverez. The social engineers bet on you not having a memory, more than
[3:31:44.720 --> 3:31:48.960]  anything. They also bet, because they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you
[3:31:48.960 --> 3:31:54.320]  will adapt to being a slave, that you will learn incrementally to submit. So think about
[3:31:54.320 --> 3:31:59.360]  and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud. Remember that everything he said has been
[3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:04.240]  a premeditated lie. They lied about where it came from. They lied about person to person,
[3:32:04.240 --> 3:32:09.320]  the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate at 4 percent, but it's actually
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:17.160]  0.032 now and dropping. Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[3:32:17.160 --> 3:32:21.560]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column. They only said
[3:32:21.560 --> 3:32:26.160]  there'd be a 15 day lockdown. Now we're six months later. Now they say it's permanent.
[3:32:26.160 --> 3:32:29.840]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere
[3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:33.880]  you go and what you do. The global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody
[3:32:33.880 --> 3:32:38.440]  questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job. That's called 21st century
[3:32:38.440 --> 3:32:41.640]  attorney. That's called world government takeover.
[3:32:41.640 --> 3:32:47.440]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had serious
[3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:52.640]  cognitive problems. He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the
[3:32:52.640 --> 3:32:57.760]  globalist and their allied crime syndicates. Kamala Harris is even worse and does whatever
[3:32:57.760 --> 3:33:04.280]  she's told. She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chycoms and others. So she has
[3:33:04.280 --> 3:33:10.640]  been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her will be called
[3:33:10.640 --> 3:33:16.920]  a racist and evil and she is now above reproach. Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:22.160]  monster for who she is. We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:28.000]  black people three times longer than white people and that the woman is a monster. Kamala
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:32.760]  Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and she
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:39.280]  is a 110% new world order puppet. Now more than ever, we must expose this monster. We
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:42.520]  must expose the globalist.
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:48.040]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday, August 12, 2025. This coming Sunday, this huge sale
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:52.520]  we've been running for last week will have to end. The reopened America back to school
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:34:00.320]  special 50% off to 60% off all of our top best sellers and double Patriot points. I
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:04.760]  have to end the sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off, living defense,
[3:34:04.760 --> 3:34:10.920]  50% off, bad Zovey, 50% off, Turbo, 40% off, bottom and low fees, 50% off. Those are all
[3:34:10.920 --> 3:34:15.880]  very close to selling out a bunch of other best sellers we still have, but I will end
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:20.880]  this special on Sunday. We have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:27.040]  as extensive or expansive as to the original. We'll come back and stop. It will be discounted,
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:31.120]  but it's not available yet. So this is a great sale that funds the operation. They're great
[3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:35.680]  items in crazy times like this. It's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:39.480]  the word about info wars because you are the modern voice. You are Paul Revere and I salute
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:45.800]  you and thank you.
[3:34:45.800 --> 3:35:09.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show news, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:17.200]  and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:24.760]  Last segment here folks. So with all of this setup that I've been describing here, now
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:33.200]  comes of course solution, which is vaccine and they've been desperately trying to move
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:39.960]  it into the market to get it approved. What is it going to be? There are numerous candidates,
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:47.080]  clinical trials, etc, etc, etc. We've got Moderna, for example, which is a company that
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:54.400]  has received $500 million from the federal government to develop a COVID vaccine and
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:02.160]  that company has never brought a drug or vaccine to market ever, ever. So there's something
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:09.120]  about this company that is significant for Anthony Fauci who is touting it, Bill Gates
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:19.240]  who is touting it and that is that it has RNA technology and nanotechnology behind it.
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:24.440]  Without going into a long song and dance, since I don't have the time about those technologies,
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:31.800]  I've covered them before here on the show. Gates is desperate to get RNA technology approved
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:38.680]  in any product into the marketplace. It's never been approved before because it causes
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:47.360]  severe adverse reactions, as they say, in patients who are treated with this technology.
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:56.000]  Body tends to go to war against itself, which is euphemistically called an autoimmune reaction.
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:37:03.800]  But the thing about RNA technology is that it can be used to develop and produce vaccines
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:09.880]  very quickly, easily, and cheaply, which, of course, Gates wants to do, because then
[3:37:09.880 --> 3:37:15.400]  you can say, well, we have 50 new viruses we just discovered and instead of taking six
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:21.720]  years in each case to bring a new vaccine to market by the old method, we want to do
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:28.040]  it quickly in a matter of months for all 50 and shoot up everybody and that's the way
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:37.040]  to do it with RNA technology. So they're trying to move this down through the pipeline. It's
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:46.080]  not a slam dunk, but they're using every method they can to get this into the marketplace.
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:55.280]  Watch out. Watch out. Besides the vaccine, what are we talking about? Well, as I said,
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:02.760]  the real operation here, phase one, is economic wreckage, but it isn't just to leave that.
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:10.080]  What's phase two? Phase two is building a new world order on top of the wreckage, which
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:17.280]  is already in progress in case you had noticed. What does that mean, NWO? Globalism. What
[3:38:17.280 --> 3:38:24.800]  does that mean? It basically means a borderless planet, or to look at it another way, what
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:34.560]  is euphemistically called global governance, meaning the entire planet is ruled top down
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:44.080]  by a small group of men. You can call it anything you want to. You can call it socialism, communism,
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:49.760]  totalitarianism, call it tyranny, you can call it fascism, you can call it Nazis, you
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:57.480]  can call it USSR. It doesn't matter what you call it. All of these names amount to the
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  same thing. Police, state, iron control from the top down. What is the reason given for
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:18.240]  this? Well, look at what happened when we had this pandemic. We can't afford to miss
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:26.200]  an early warning signal when the next one comes along. Don't look for logic here, folks.
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:32.320]  This is hype. This is propaganda. This is promotion. We have to have planetary surveillance
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:42.840]  wall to wall in your workplace, in your home, in public places, everywhere, all the time,
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:54.000]  and in your body, because we don't trust simply exterior surveillance. We need new technology.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:40:01.800]  We need technocracy. We need engineering at a level at which it's never been done before.
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:09.160]  For example, using nanoparticles, very tiny particles, to insert into the body that will
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:17.040]  function as sensors. What does that mean? That means these little tiny, I mean very,
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:26.040]  very tiny sensors in the body, in the brain, would be able to transmit information from
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:35.000]  inside your body to an external control point where that information, all about physiological
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:41.560]  changes, processes in the body, in the brain that are taking place. This is real. This
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:49.840]  is not science fiction. It's in progress under development, as we speak, that all of this
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:58.920]  information flowing out of your body from these sensors is collected, collated, analyzed,
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:07.080]  profiled to see what you're up to, basically. What are you up to? This is the most intimate
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  look they can do to try to spy and discover what you are up to at any given moment in
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:24.440]  real time. But these nanotechnology sensors also function in the opposite direction. That
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  is, they would be able to receive information from the outside while they are located in
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:40.120]  your body and brain. What would that mean? That would mean information, as for example,
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:49.120]  instructions. Instructions that could change your physiology, change your function, body
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:59.200]  function, brain function. That's the objective there. Control, control, control, and more
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:07.640]  control and then more control. That's the promised land. That's the holy grail of what
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:18.760]  are euphemistically called the globalists. They are the technocrats. They are the technologists.
[3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:28.240]  They are technocrats. They want to create the world as a machine. They're on the way.
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:37.840]  They reset, of course, because as we've seen even before this whole COVID insanity, currencies
[3:42:37.840 --> 3:42:46.360]  were dead-ending not just once but multiple times in a crash, on a crash, on a crash,
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:42:54.040]  on a crash worldwide because the invention of money on top of money on top of other invented
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:43:03.680]  money and so on and so forth was reaching a point of no return, meaning that the collaborative
[3:43:03.680 --> 3:43:15.040]  fakery of nations was falling apart. It was just too much to sustain. The stage play was
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:24.000]  becoming too obvious to too many people. It was time for a massive currency reset and
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:33.800]  they, again, technocrats, globalists, needed an excuse, a reason to say, well, now we certainly
[3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:41.760]  have to have a currency reset, which is a complete global reorganization of the concept
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:50.760]  and the practice of money by new standards. That's what we're talking about and so the
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:58.760]  excuse is, well, look at the economic wreckage all around. Is the bailout working? No, it's
[3:43:58.760 --> 3:44:05.360]  not. We acknowledge that, yes, indeed, we're doing the best we can, etc., etc. We're devoting
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:12.560]  trillions to trying to help people who have been afflicted by the lockdowns, etc., etc.,
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:20.120]  but really, is this solving the problem? Unfortunately, no. Really, what we're going
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:25.240]  to have to do is certainly go to a digital currency completely and then we're going to
[3:44:25.240 --> 3:44:35.680]  have to, what is the word we really want to use here? Reallocate, reorganize, restructure,
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:46.920]  let's call it that, the entire global economy under new arrangements, under new arrangements.
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:53.400]  Where everything is digitized and, yes, we are certainly going to have, what could we
[3:44:53.400 --> 3:45:01.440]  call it? Let's call it UGI, universal guaranteed income for every person on earth. You like
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:07.440]  that idea, people would like that idea, but of course, it's tied to your behavior. If
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:15.360]  you behave, if you fall in line, then you get this income, but if you don't, no. Does
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:21.720]  that sound like a horror show? It is. There's much more to say, but my time is up this week.
[3:45:21.720 --> 3:45:27.800]  I think you're getting the complete picture here. John Rafferport, no more fake news.
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:54.960]  See you next time.
