[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:10.000 --> 00:20.000]  All right, coming up, I'm going to get into Homeland Security, NATO expansion worldwide. By the way, NATO is a private corporation.
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  We'll also get into tainted blood, how the Red Cross and other agencies are knowingly putting tainted blood with HIV and hepatitis in the supply.
[00:28.000 --> 00:38.000]  Top scientists want GM crop ban. I'm going to get into the federal ruling that the World War II and Korean War veterans will no longer get healthcare.
[00:38.000 --> 00:50.000]  A lot of incredibly serious issues as corporate welfare expands and then the services promised to our veterans are now being called welfare and being revoked.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  Again, Bush is just something else, Al Clinton and Clinton. We'll also get back into GOP targets, pro-Borders 10, Credo.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  Boy, Bush is just amazing, isn't he? This guy is incredible.
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.000]  Now, yesterday, I read a news story on air, part of it. It was seven pages from WorldNetDaily. It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:13.000 --> 01:24.000]  We've had them on before, Homeschool Legal Defense Association. Chris Klenick is the head of this organization.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  I've had them on in the past. They're doing a wonderful job.
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  We first had them on a few months ago talking about California just said, well, homeschooling is illegal unless you've got a teaching certificate.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  Well, that's not true, but it's just color of law. They say, show up to a pretrial hearing. There's no subpoena, no indictment, no charges.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  And then it's a contract law. It's the only real form of law. Commerce law. And they're operating out of this.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's maritime jurisdiction. They're now admitting it. And they just call you in and try to get you to forfeit your children, sign over to agreements.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  They want CPS to visit the homes. They're doing this now in Illinois, Texas, many other areas.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  This case, though, is of a substitute teacher who raises her daughter. And she has the certificate in Illinois, which you don't even need.
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  CPS came, demanded into her house. Then later, squad cars came. And they're talking about charges and saying, show up to our pretrial hearing without charges.
[02:24.000 --> 02:35.000]  It's all color of law. But people don't know the law, even the basics. So government is now practicing and expanding and creating Nazi-like precedents.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  Again, joining us is Chris Kalanick. And it's great to have you on the show, Chris, to break down this incredible development.
[02:46.000 --> 03:01.000]  Yeah, it's amazing what has happened in Illinois. You have a superintendent in charge of three counties who's taken upon himself to exceed his authority, send out squad cars to homeschoolers.
[03:01.000 --> 03:11.000]  There's 22 of them that have been contacted already in this three-county area. One, to an officer. We got one account from one of our members, homeschool families.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  To an officer who said, I can take your kids away if I want to, and we'll be scaring the mother.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  Now, that's pure terrorism. That is textbook terrorism.
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  Oh, you're not kidding. This is intimidation to the maximum. And another time, they insisted on entering a person's house.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  They looked at the curriculum. They didn't think it was good enough. Then they were demanding the lady go to a pretrial hearing.
[03:34.000 --> 03:43.000]  The squad cars would deliver personal letters to families saying they had to come to a pretrial hearing. And none of these families have done nothing wrong.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  It's simply a profiling that, because they're homeschoolers, is considering them guilty.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  Well, it calls it at risk. There was a report in the Austin paper two weeks ago, finally they're admitting the truth, that they're grabbing hundreds of children every month for at risk.
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  You go in to have some work done for your diabetes, and they show up and grab your child. Your baby has diaper rash. It's seen at daycare.
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.000]  They get paid off to call CPS. They grab your child. And it's the same system. They call them into these courts.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  They go, come to this pretrial hearing, and maybe we'll give your child back. This is like the Soviet Union.
[04:18.000 --> 04:26.000]  Oh, it's unbelievable. And we've been representing our families in Illinois, as we do in all 50 states.
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  But in this situation, we've written letters to the superintendent. We've told them we're not going to pretrial hearings. We're not going to allow home visits.
[04:33.000 --> 04:42.000]  They're unconstitutional. They violate the Fourth Amendment rights of these families. We've told the superintendent that we are prepared to sue him.
[04:42.000 --> 04:50.000]  He continues these tactics. I've talked to him personally. And it seems that he is going, he's considering hard changing his policies.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  So I'm so thankful for the press coverage, because it's put a lot of pressure on him to back down.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  By the way, this commissar's name is Bruce Dennison, regional superintendent of three counties.
[05:06.000 --> 05:16.000]  That's right. And so when I talk with him, he seems to be not so much mean-spirited as much as he thinks he's genuinely doing a good job.
[05:16.000 --> 05:26.000]  Well, let me give you an example. I have the Calhoun Reader used at the University of Texas as the standard social worker reference book.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  It's the keystone of their four-year training for a bachelor's.
[05:30.000 --> 05:40.000]  Now, it says in the book, I've read this quote many times, that families belong to the age of barbarism, that the schools will become the hub.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  They will have cradle-to-grave schooling. Now they're talking about making toddlers go to public school.
[05:45.000 --> 05:54.000]  Now they're, of course, Head Start families get two CPS visits a year. They're taking children out of the custody here in Texas of about one-third of the homes.
[05:54.000 --> 06:02.000]  This is like a science fiction horror movie, but they're doing it all color of law. You're a lawyer, aren't you?
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  That's correct. I've been in your county for 18 years at home school legal defense.
[06:06.000 --> 06:13.000]  When you speak to what this color of law, colorable law, these are fraudulent documents on their face to say,
[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  you'd better come to our pretrial hearing. On the face, it looks like that's false arrest, really is what it is.
[06:19.000 --> 06:29.000]  It is. It's a violation of families' basic due process rights. They're liable for this kind of tactic because they don't have to go to such hearing.
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  These pretrial hearings aren't truly pretrial hearings. They're simply a faÃ§ade because there is no court action.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  It's a place to pressure groups of families into signing other contracts waiving rights.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  That's exactly right. We deal with social workers every single day in every state.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  These are home school families who the social worker gets an anonymous tip, somebody's prejudiced against them.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  They come to the door. They insist on entry even though it's a violation of the family's fourth-minute rights.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  They insist on getting in, interviewing the children separately.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Of course, we stop that. The families call us. They hand the phone out the door.
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  I tell the social worker, the cop, whoever it is, that they don't have authority to come in.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  We work it out, keep them away from the kids and out of the home.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  But most families are intimidated and give in to these kinds of tactics.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  Well, this teacher did. She is a certified government training camp teacher.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  She's raising her daughter because she doesn't want her to become a crack addict or something.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  I mean, that's just reasonable. I wouldn't put my children in one of these camps for anything.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's what they are.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  So where does this go? Because it's obviously a concerted effort.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  We know Bill Clinton attacked homeschooling. Even some conservative talk show hosts have done it.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  How do we unify the two-plus million homeschooling families to stand up against this and to mock them up?
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  Because we had you on about the California situation. Tie all this together for us.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  Well, we've got some good news on the horizon. Now, there's two levels of attack.
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  We've got one level that's coming from states through legislatures or state superintendents that are trying to tighten up restrictions on homeschool freedoms.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  The other avenue is coming through the child welfare agencies, the ones you've been talking about in Texas and these kinds of things,
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  where they're intimidating people. They're acting like they know what's best for the children.
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  The children, the families don't. And they're trying to take kids without proper due process.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  The good news is, for instance, in Texas, we've got a group of legislators we're working with right now,
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Homeschool Leosunce is working with them.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  And we're preparing a package that's going to be introduced to the legislature this year to reform the child welfare system,
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  to build in some due process protection so they can't get away with these kinds of factors.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  And that due process was already there, inherent in the Bill of Rights.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  I know you know that, but here's the problem.
[09:00.000 --> 09:07.000]  My friend, Mike Hampton, his children, one of them is homeschooled, the other one goes to government training camp,
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  and Mike, his grandmother, died.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  And he took the children, one of the children, out of the public school for one day, wrote a letter the next day.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  Well, the next day, they got a knock on the door at 6.30 at night, CPS worker, with the county constable trying to force their way in.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  The trial opened the door, they put a pushing into his house.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  This is textbook Soviet Union. This is terrorism.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  That's right.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  How about criminal charges against these people?
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  We can. We do that.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  At Homeschool Defense, we have filed numerous suits against the child welfare agencies for violating the rights of families when they push their way in like this.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  And we've won. We've won two big cases in the state of California at the high federal court level, which affects the neighboring states as well.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  That clearly states that a social worker is under the same limitations of a constitution as any other law enforcement official.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  They cannot enter homes without warrants signed by a judge.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  And a judge can't sign a warrant unless he's got probable cause.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  None of this just breaking in and...
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  Now, here in Austin, they seize children at birth if the mother's on food stamps.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  They call it at risk, and it's been all over the news.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  And they don't even have a judge's order.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  They sign an emergency order themselves and have the judge sign it the next day.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  See, that's part of the changes that need to be made in the law, and that's what we're working on.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  Because some of the state laws have gotten a little bit further than our constitution's laws.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  So it takes us going in there either to...
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  A little bit further?
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  A little bit further, I was reading about Franco-Spain, where they took people's children.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Oh, yeah.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  I mean, that's exactly what America's done.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  I'm just blown away here.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  Now, last time you were on, you talked about, and I agree with you, this is a chilling effect.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  Isn't this to intimidate parents so they won't do it?
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  That's exactly right.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  It is causing a chilling effect.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  And a lot of families, unless they don't know their rights, are intimidated.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  And they let them in, and they waive their constitutional rights as a result just because of the intimidation.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  I'll tell you, there's one other bit of good news.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  On Capitol Hill, I testified at the end of last year, during the anthrax scare,
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  on a bill called the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  And this is a big government funding program that gives the 60 states money for child welfare agencies.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  Well, I offered five amendments, and two of them got accepted.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And they're expected to pass in this lame duck session or the first thing next session.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  But it will restore certain due process rights in all 50 states.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  All right, stay right there.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  One more quick segment, sir, I really appreciate you joining us.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  We've got the head of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  For 18 years, he's been fighting them, brought to a lot of families they've helped.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  In a big way, we'll tell you about their website as well.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  I want to talk about racketeering civil rights suits.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  Because if this isn't racketeering, nothing is that they're doing to our children.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  We're talking to Christopher Clickup, Senior Counsel and Staff Attorney,
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  Director of State and International Relations for the great organization,
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  Home School Legal Defense Association.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  We've only got time for one call here during this last segment with him.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  But I want to get back to this racketeering.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  You know, I'm not a lawyer, but I've studied the law,
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  and the whole federal government is engaging in color of law, organized crime operations.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  They're attacking good citizens.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  Homeschoolers have the highest test scores, the best rates of not being involved in drugs and sex and crime.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  We all know this. It's embarrassing the public schools, and they're engaging.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  I mean, I know good, upstanding people that make, you know, $500,000 a year that have had CPS visits.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  I mean, this country is falling apart, Chris. What do we do?
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  Well, I think eternal vigilance is what's necessary.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  And that means people need to be involved.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  They need to listen to your program so they can get the up-to-minute news.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  As you tell them times when they need to call their congressmen, their legislators, we can stop this.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  I've seen homeschoolers, when they band together, they can stop these things.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  We've defeated just tons of legislation over the years.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  We had a government nanny bill in Florida last year that passed the legislature by,
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  it was a last-minute trick at the end of the year,
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  and we convinced Jeb Bush to veto it and kill this government nanny bill
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  that would have controlled kids from cradle to grave kind of thing.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  Doesn't this show, Chris, that they think they own our children?
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  They said it in speeches and educational conferences.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  They think that they own our children.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  Isn't this more of a reason for more parents to leave the public schools?
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  Oh, I agree wholeheartedly.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  The public schools is not a safe place for our kids' hearts or souls anymore.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  You can't pray. You have the Ten Commandments on there.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  You can't have a minute of silence.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  Not to mention all the socialism that's being taught, the secular humanism.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  That's why I'm so excited and I work so hard on homeschooling
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  because it's a way for parents to instill the values of our forefathers and the children
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  so they can teach them the Bible, the bedrock of our society.
[14:19.000 --> 14:29.000]  Well, I plan to homeschool myself the website hslda.org, hslda.org.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  I'm sure you've heard about the 3,500 missing children.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  It's down to that number.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  Of the 46,000, they grab a year in Florida, and the CPS can't even say where the children are.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Right.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  And we're there in the front lines of the CPS battle, and we're winning it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  We're winning it in the courts.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  We're winning it in the legislatures.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  We're winning it before Congress.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  All we need, would you agree, is disclosure of these people.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  It's so evil what they're doing.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  There's no way they can survive the light of day.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  That's right.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  And we need people to join homeschool legal defense.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  If they do, then we can build up our numbers and our ability to make change.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  And it's when people have solidarity with one another.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  As Benjamin Franklin once said,
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  if we don't hang together, most assuredly we're going to hang separately.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  Absolutely.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  Quick call.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  Rhonda in Missouri.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  You're on the air with our guest.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Go ahead, Rhonda.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  Hi, Chris.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Hi, Alex.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  I don't get all this making new laws things.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  We have the Constitution.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  I think making new laws just legitimizes their right to come after you.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  Okay, well, we have the right to your children if we follow the proper procedure.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  I think what he's saying is they passed previous draconian laws.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Now those need to be struck down or overwritten.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  Exactly.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  We don't want to pass new laws creating anything new.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  We're just going after the old laws to get them to fit the Constitution.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  Well, like Alex asked you earlier, has anybody been held criminally accountable?
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  You know, maybe we should see a few school district managers do perp walks.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  Well, a federal judge just got kicked off the bench for protecting pedophiles.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  That's MSNBC today.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  What about this situation?
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  Are you going to go press any criminal charges?
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  It's hard to do criminal charges.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  It's just a whole lot easier to do civil rights cases.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Yeah, they claim immunity.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  Well, see, the thing is we're running out of time.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Americans, we're patient people.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  We've been very patient.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  We've been very forgiving.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  We've forgiven a lot of things.
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  But the rubber's meeting the road now, and we need to quit dancing around the bush.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  Those two suits you won in California.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  What were those for?
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  Those were for where CPS workers came in the door, and they literally pushed their way in.
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.000]  Strip search in one instance, the child, and we went after him for both punitive damages,
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  which is almost like criminal, but it's just money damages instead of jail time.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  Yeah, our money.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  They're paying us off with, like Alex has so brilliantly staked all the time.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  They have no problem.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  They're the lords.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  They sit up there on their thrones.
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  They're still untouched.
[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  They still walk around.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  Their area smiles on their faces.
[17:11.000 --> 17:17.000]  3,500 missing children that CPS has taken in Florida, and no one's been charged.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  That shows the incredible level of tyranny.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.000]  That's enough.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  Thanks, Miranda.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  We've been talking to the senior counsel and staff attorney for director of state and international
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  relations for Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  Chris, thank you for joining us, and I hope folks go to slda.org to learn their rights,
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  and I really appreciate you joining us.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  Going right online if they want to be part of Homeschool Legal Defense.
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.000]  Thank you very much.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  Thank you, sir.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  We'll be right back with more calls and all the other news as they break down America.
