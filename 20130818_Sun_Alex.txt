[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.000]  A lie! No man is obsolete!
[00:07.000 --> 00:12.000]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.000]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misforn little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  I am a human being!
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like a wind!
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  I don't care! I tell you, I don't care! I'm a human being! I exist!
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled in my grave!
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  Illusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  Illusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your crime!
[01:03.000 --> 01:20.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[01:23.000 --> 01:33.000]  Broadcasting worldwide. We're live. It is the 18th day of August 2013 on this Sunday edition.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  I didn't take any calls on the Friday broadcast, the weekday show.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  I promise to take a lot of phone calls today. That probably means I'll get to five or six in the next two hours.
[01:44.000 --> 01:51.000]  Seriously, I'm going to open the phones up for your specific wildcard questions for Alex Jones.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  Yours truly, if you're a new listener.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  On any subject you'd like to call in on, I will attempt to go to your phone calls and take your questions.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  I'll give the number out. The phone system's not open yet.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  I'll give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  And from the third segment at about, I don't know, 19 after or so, to the end of the two-hour transmission.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  So that's about an hour and 40 minutes of the broadcast.
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.000]  I will take nothing but your phone calls interspersed with little schniblets of important news.
[02:26.000 --> 02:38.000]  When one watches the meltdown of Egypt taking place, it is, it's like trying to describe a football game to people that don't speak English
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  and who have no hearing, no vision, no taste, almost like a blind brain in a jar.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  And I don't mean that in a sardonic condescending way about the general public.
[02:49.000 --> 02:57.000]  They just aren't into the narrative of how geopolitics has worked and the globalist policies in the Middle East
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  and what the in-game strategy and stratagems are.
[03:02.000 --> 03:10.000]  And so it's like trying to describe to someone who's never heard of football, never seen football, never seen civilization, what's going on.
[03:10.000 --> 03:19.000]  And I use that analogy because people that watch football know everything about it and who the quarterbacks married to and where they went to college
[03:19.000 --> 03:29.000]  and what their statistics were their freshman year and what their favorite soup is.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  And they show off to each other knowing all the details.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  So that means they're not even so much stupid as they are ignorant about what's really important.
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  I'm not knocking folks at like football. I've been a football fan myself and come from a football, you know, family.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  I'm from Texas, folks. I mean, come on, that's the real state religion down here.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  But when you've got the real game going on around you, you stop caring about stuff like that.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  There's just too many big fish to fry.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  And so I have faith in the public because if they can figure out baseball and football statistics going back 50 years,
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.000]  the general public can figure out politics, geopolitics and how it really works.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000]  But I'm going to try to just in a gestalt here in a basic boil down a sketch,
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  tell you what's really happening in the Middle East.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  And this is not my opinion. This is in all the scholarly papers.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  What I'm telling you is well known like the sun come up in the morning, as I say,
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  but it's not known by probably 90% of the public.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  I mean, I got to say, our listeners know it. One tenth of one percent, you know, political analysts know it.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  But our media is acting like this train wreck's happening and they don't know what's going on when they go full well.
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  So I'm going to get into that. I'm going to get into the newest NSA news, calls to kill Julian Assange
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  by Pentagon propagandist at Time Magazine and more.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  Supernatural silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast and a limited number of parasites.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  It can even purify water. Supernatural silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes,
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  To see how Supernatural silver can give you and your loved ones protection and peace of mind, go to supernaturalsilver.com.

[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Is that anyone else?
[06:52.000 --> 07:07.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[07:07.000 --> 07:17.000]  We're going to have wide open phones on this live Sunday worldwide transmission.
[07:17.000 --> 07:28.000]  It is the 18th day of August 2013. We're here weeknights, of course, with the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWarsNews.com.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  I have the daytime weekday show, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, the radio broadcast from over 160 affiliates.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  And then back Sunday's live, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, standard time, the toll free number to join us on this live Sunday edition.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  It's going to be a wild card type show where you can call them with any question or comment for old Alex Jones.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  And that's me. Thank you so much for joining us today. The toll free number, you're going to need it.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  877-789-ALUX, 877-789-2539er, 877-789-2539.
[08:03.000 --> 08:13.000]  That's different than the weekday show number because we produce the entire little broadcast right out of Austin, Texas with a Sunday show.
[08:13.000 --> 08:20.000]  Whereas the weekday show, we have some of the folks up in Minnesota where the GCN Radio Network is based flipping some of the switches.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  But great job to all of the crews, our sponsors, affiliates, and number one, the Good Lord above.
[08:26.000 --> 08:35.000]  But most importantly, when you talk about mere mortals, listeners, and supporters, and viewers watching us right now like you.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  Okay, we're going to open the phones up. They're open right now. People are calling in.
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  And I'm going to take calls for over an hour of the transmission starting next segment.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  We're only here two hours on Sunday, three hours weekday.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  There is just so much amazing news. Let me control myself and be well behaved. Let's see if I can do it.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  Let's mention the headlines I have here to get to.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  Egypt expert, the old guard is back in power.
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.000]  Egypt crisis tent standoff at Cairo Mosque. It's thousands dead now in the last few weeks of clashes.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  Egyptian death toll again continues to rise.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  President Obama calls for cooperation.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  Rand Paul pushed us for an end to aid.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  Morrissey supporters jump off bridges to avoid being shot.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  That is just some of the news we're going to be breaking down.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Egypt moles ban on Muslim Brotherhood as it calls for week of further protest.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  I love how they call it protest, firebombing people, shooting people, throwing people off roofs, burning down Christian churches.
[09:42.000 --> 09:52.000]  I don't usually defend militaries or shooting people in the street, but I'm going to tell you the rest of the story on this coming up here in just a moment.
[09:52.000 --> 09:59.000]  What's really behind this? By the way, this is not my opinion what's really behind this.
[09:59.000 --> 10:10.000]  This is on record what's really behind this, and that's what frustrates me about this, is that this is on record.
[10:10.000 --> 10:21.000]  And the mainstream media bought and paid for by corrupt, claptocratic, basically offshore, crony capitalist, mafia, anti-free market interest
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  will not tell the public what's really happening.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  It's in the council on foreign relations publications.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  It's in foreign affairs and foreign journal put out by the Washington Post.
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  It is, it's in foreign news, but just sit here and watch this designed train wreck.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  Purposeful, premeditated, murder one going on.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  And you know the same people train wrecking the Middle East are train wrecking us.
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  A lot of good old boys go good, just neutron bomb the whole Middle East.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  You don't think the corporate interest running the world won't neutron bomb us if they thought they could get away with it?
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  To come in and then take over all the resources?
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  And he classified those babies back in the 70s and Jimmy Carter said he banned them.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  If you believe that, I got a bridge on the moon, I'm willing to sell you.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  The Golden Gate Bridge, you know, I own that and can sell it to you.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  And Barack Obama, by the way, cares about you and is a big liberal as well.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  And I don't want to digress here into sarcasm.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  The point is, is that people need to get cynical, but more than cynical, they need to get informed about the world work.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  So we're going to be getting into that stack of news.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  Also Fukushima apocalypse years of duct tape fixes could result in millions of deaths.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  A nuclear experts RT has the article.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  It's up on info wars.com breaking it all down.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Wall Street Journal says Fukushima Watchtepco finally gets an official cleanup plan,
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.000]  which experts say could make the original meltdowns of five reactors of the six hit by the tsunami look tame in comparison.
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.000]  It's already roughly a hundred times bigger according to nuclear experts like Dr. Busby we've had on than Chernobyl in 1986.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  Radioactive water leaking from Fukushima by millions of lives are at stake.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  Zero hedge mission impossible Fukushima scientist brace for riskiest nuclear fuel cleanup yet.
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  That is just some of the reports.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.000]  Global research has the headline Fukushima Japanese government big business and corporate media have tried to hide a grave threat.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  Nagasaki bomb maker offers lessons for Fukushima cleanup Bloomberg.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  That is just some of what we've got in the stack and I will get to that after I take calls.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  We've got nuclear physicists like Dr. Busby and others coming up the next week to join us.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  Get Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, nuclear physicist, chemical engineer, Air Force officer, everything else you can imagine.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  Let's get him on with his take on all this as well in the upcoming week.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  Just calling those plays out to the great crew in there to set that up as I think live on air.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's just some of the news that's coming up as well today.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  And we are again, as I said, going to be going to your phone calls at 877-789-ALUX with any of your questions or comments,
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  but I particularly want to take your questions today and see what wild and brain stimulating directions you take us
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  and what important news items you mentioned that are usually in my stack, but I don't get to half the time.
[13:27.000 --> 13:35.000]  Also coming up today, WikiLeaks post 400 gigabytes of encrypted insurance data,
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  meaning in case anyone tries to kill them because they're getting death threats.
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.000]  And of course, Snowden was going to be extradited by Russia, but so many pundits called for his murder trying to show off to the police state
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  as part of the mafia of the media inside corporations that are tax exempt above the law
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  and the kleptocrat mafia in government that the Russians said, no, we're going to give Snowden a one year amnesty.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  And then Obama came out and said, we don't kill anybody. That's ridiculous. We won't kill him.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  Well, now Time Magazine reporter who called for drone strikes on Julian Assange yesterday faces Twitter backlash.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  He thought he'd get himself, I mean, if you look at this guy, he looks like such a tool bag.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  I mean, just another Mr. Tough guy talking tough about killing people. Yeah, let's kill reporters.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  Let's kill whistleblowers. Senior Time reporter calls for drone strike on WikiLeaks Assange.
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  And he went on to say that he can't wait to share the death of WikiLeaks Assange.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  Look at his tweet right here. I can't wait to write a defense of the drone strike that takes out Julian Assange says, Michael Grunwald.
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  Unbelievable. So we'll be getting into that. Oh, but nobody wants to kill these whistleblowers.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  By the way, under Bush, under Reagan, under Clinton, under all these other presidents that a lot of people don't like for different reasons.
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  No one ever went after reporters or whistleblowers that reported torture, stealing of money, corruption.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  Because politically you couldn't get away with that because you would get politically crucified.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  You would get politically destroyed. Richard Nixon went after the press and got destroyed.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  The press lined up against him. Alternative mainstream didn't matter.
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.000]  Nobody goes after the press and nobody anywhere. I mean, you report crime, you get lifted up on shoulders.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  You don't get secretly arrested, disappeared, you name it. That's what they're doing to people.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  Go to the front page of infowars.com. Look at this reporter who called for him to be killed.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  The look on his face. The Mr. Tough Guy with the reflected glory of the corrupt mafia that seized our government.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  Talking about lusting after killing people for exposing torture like WikiLeaks did.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  What a shame to humanity. What a danger.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Every three seconds someone becomes a victim of identity theft.

[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  When I talk about trying to explain the Federal Reserve, I say, I can't believe that you still have a bank account with Bank of America. Why haven't you switched to a local bank? Would it make any difference?
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  You'll make a massive difference. The big banks are openly trying to shut down the little banks right now on record using their unlimited taxpayer credit to shut everybody down. They're trying to get rid of credit unions, both university, police, military, you name it. The feds are even trying to get rid of the USAA right now.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  And it's tax exemption. They will shut everything down. They will loot every account. That's why they wage war on the family. They wage war on anything that is humans huddled together in common defense. The corporate board wants to atomize us to suck us up.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Well, I'm going to keep asking people to change their accounts then.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  By the way, I'm going to make an admission. I have two Texas banks that have the majority of my backup capital in them. But I've over the years had some big banks that I've used just for transactions because it's easier.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  And I've made the commitment, before this year ends, I will leave those big banks that I'm with. Even though not much money's in them, I use them for transfers and stuff. I agree. We should all break with the globalists. They've broken with us. They are the enemy. They are the plague. Go ahead.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  I had gone to a little local estate sale for one of my neighbors here. And I was asking, how do I bid on this little item I wanted to bid on?
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  And they said, well, you go over there and you show them your driver's license. I said, well, I'm not bidding them because they have no need to have my driver's license. And so someone ended up bidding for me that had already gotten a number.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  But I thought it was ridiculous. If I bought some $5 item and paid cash, why do they need a copy of my driver's license?
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  Ma'am, ma'am, they sell your data. The biggest business now, it's not the majority of their business, but it's the biggest one piece for Target, Walmart, the Steak Houses, Pizza Places is selling your data.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  The federal government spends over $50 billion a year just buying North American data that came out actually this weekend. $50 billion to buy all that data. And that's why they pressure you and push you and tell them to do it.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  And it's not the only thing to hide. And then they also use it to actuary it to figure out how to work with other corporations and price fix to cheat the general consumer.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Notice two weeks ago it came out that all the big stores have face scanners. They bought the digital driver's license photos and they know if you have more money and now they don't have a lot of price tags.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  They'll change them when you get there. Notice how everybody's now getting bills. Even though their contract doesn't say it, the bill goes up.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  They're just seeing what they can get away with. We have a criminal system now. God bless you.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Let's go to another caller, Mike. Mike is calling from North Carolina. You're on the air. Go ahead, Mike.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  Hey, how you doing, brother?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Good.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Excellent, excellent. I just want to say that you are a great inspiration and I thank you and may the Lord bless you for all the knowledge that you've
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  you've gave to me and to the world. And I think that we should really have put a petition together. You, Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, and we write this petition up and it's criminals that need to be put away forever.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  And we just have the people sign it and go after these criminals one by one and get this revolution started today.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  Yeah, Jamie Diamond. Congress has found that he did engage in criminal activity. Barack Obama, Henry Kissinger, the Pentagon Office of Special Plans that has been caught creating fake intelligence to invade Iraq.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  I mean, yeah, there's only about 6,000 globalists and Rothcops own words at the Kissinger group that run things and not even all of them are actually involved in everything.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  It's only a couple of thousand people who on record in their own words are shutting economies down to make us more controllable.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  They work full time not to just steal wealth, at least then that gets spent. They want to destroy it. They want to destroy us. They want to wreck us.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Final segment.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again. I do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Hundreds of you helped EFOODS Direct ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims. The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  The new Justin Case Pack from EFOODS Direct is the big brother to the 7-day emergency pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  It contains a two-month supply for one person, or a one-month supply for two adults, or a two-week supply for a family of four.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail. Call 800-409-5633 on the web EFOODS Direct dot com slash Alex.

[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  All right, a couple final news stories before I end the transmission with your phone calls until I'm back tomorrow, 11am to 2pm central with the Monday through Friday transmission.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  Internet traffic plunges by 40% as Google goes dark for five minutes as reported by the Daily News and Zero Hedge.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  I want to throw the world into sheer URL panic and outright informational chaos than just take out Google.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  That's probably a test. Google was set up by the CIA and NSA. You can look that up.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  An NQ tell, a division of the CIA 14 years ago and they want to be able to shut the web off and control it.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  And now you notice people with email or smartphones get forced Obama messages.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  I get them. My dad gets them. Boy, what a free country.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  Now they're announcing forced Obama messages.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  California got freaked out last week when the phones turned on the middle of the night.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  They hard turn them on and then give you messages.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  For your safety, of course. I mean, it's not a big brother tyranny.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  I mean, Winston Smith got woke up every morning by a big brother turning on the television and giving him orders.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  But I mean, after all, big brother cared. I mean, what's wrong with that?
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  So there's an example of that. Another story by krypton.com that links through to the United States patent 8,204,902.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  And it's got the police and fed saying, oh, yes, now all your new smartphones,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  we will listen to you 24 seven on them for your safety with AI computers listening for any signs of trouble.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  By the way, that's already going on. But then when you go out and want to film the police,
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  they'll just hit a button in their car that broadcast a code turning all electronics off.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  That's why there's going to be a huge business in old cameras and old systems.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  This is not going to stop anything. I got news for you.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  But this is the way they can double edge use technology to enslave.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  And by the way, cops, where you get excited about that, they can use data like that to disappear your identity and still your pension fund, too.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  This technocracy is the enemy of all humans. Technology could totally empower us,
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  but instead it's being built to totally enslave us.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  And then Bloomberg's public housing fingerprinting idea stuns and furiates residents.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Well, he's he's a total tyrant.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  We got that article that then ties into the police are saying they're looking at evidence that the military killed Princess Diana.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  Yeah, I said that back in 1997 and now it's been pretty much declassified.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  They turned off the camera. She was alive, killed her in the ambulance.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  And Prince Charles's letter and video to her saying, I will kill you in a fake auto accident is now public.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  The police haven't. But they're like, well, so we said, I'll kill you in a fake auto accident.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Then she died a week later. I mean, what's the big deal?
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  It's like, I'm going to shoot you in the head. And then you get shot in the head.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  And we say, well, Alex isn't a suspect. I mean, you know, the Navy Seals came back and said we didn't really raid bin Laden.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  It was a body double and we're all going to be killed soon. We've heard and then they all died.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  But it's it's the bin Laden raid was real folks. Obama is a hero.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  I'm sorry. It's pretty sick.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  Let's race now through your calls. Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air, sir. Welcome.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  In the DVD extras section under directors commentary for the 2007 movie shooter, the director cites the book.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  Economic hit man as being an influence on the movie. Now, I'm pretty sure he's talking about John Perkins book.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Confessions of an economic.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  By the way, John Perkins is in the is in the new Obama movie I'm making coming out.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  But but yeah, he was hired by the Pentagon openly to go in and bankrupt our world countries.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  And yes, I was aware that the writer of the shooter, incredible Mark Wahlberg film.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  It's really how stuff works. I mean, that's actually like real. Absolutely. Go ahead.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  All right. Thanks.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Thank you. Well, I was going to let you add any other points, but thank you.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  It looks like he made his point that we should play that extra here on air.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  We ought to find the extra to that and play that great point, sir. Thank you.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  Okay, absolutely. I love that movie so much. It's so accurate. It's like combines.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  The bad guy goes, kill me. It doesn't matter. There's hundreds of heads. You can't stop us.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  It's a criminal operation. I mean, it's just that's the problem with it.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in New Mexico. You're on the air.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  I'm doing all right. Welcome.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  I was going to have a bunch of comments, but I'm late for church.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  That's why it makes them real simple here, you know, or they minister and everything.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  You mentioned this, you touch on this even today, several times.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  If people, and we need to pray for the global sex way and pray for the sheep, well, they just need to get saved.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  They need Jesus Christ. And the Bible is very clear.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  No, no, I agree with you. Whether you believe in God or not,
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  when countries start doing the things we're doing, all this decadence, they collapse.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  In every case, when people act like we're acting and people lose a moral system,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  everything collapses. Absolutely.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  I mean, just real quick, one verse, 1-72-5, it says that there is one God and one mediator between God and man.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  That man is Christ. People need to receive Christ.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  Pender sends receive Christ to get saved. That will solve all the problems.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Absolutely. I mean, whether you believe in Jesus Christ as a true entity, you know, as the son of God, I do.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  I know it's real. I have a relationship. Regardless, I mean, who is our God then, the state?
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Who is our God, Hollywood? I mean, look at the values of Christ versus the values now.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  And you take it out of school. You take it out of the culture.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Look, I've just found in business, real Christians are the people to deal with, not fake ones.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  But when you deal with anybody else, I mean, you are going to get screwed over.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  I mean, it is just a fact. These worldly people are a pack of demons.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  And they think evil is cool. They think cheating you is cool. And they're all losers, too. They're dumb.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  And I just feel sorry for them. God bless you, brother. Absolutely.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  It's in dark times like these. They say there's no atheists in a foxhole.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  Is there atheists in a collapsing kleptocracy? Jim in New York, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones. How are you?
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  I'm all right, brother. Thanks for holding.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  I just want to tell you thank you for taking my call. And I want to propose something to you as far as sharing and expanding your show and the message of liberty.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  It's actually thinking about taking advantage of the independent musical artists out there that aren't signed.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  And also kind of like having a nationwide tour with festivals in local towns.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  It's a great idea. I just can't even organize, update my websites and finishing a film and run a nightly news program.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  But it's all, they're a lot of great artists. Hey, how about all the big artists that are out there come out for liberty?
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  Well, a lot of them have. But how about they come out more hardcore, not just food fighters, not just Rush, not just Muse.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  And I know all those folks are listeners. We've talked to many of them. I mean, how about they all come out?
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Because let me tell you, everybody knows it. There's no future now unless good men stand up against evil.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  I totally agree with you. I have actually sent you some emails pertaining to a rough outline of possibly how to put this together.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  Brother, I hear you, but God bless you. I appreciate your call. Did you hear what I just said?
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  I'm going to be here till nine tonight on Sunday night. My son cried as I drove off at one o'clock today saying, please, Daddy, go fishing.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  I'm sad when you leave. And he's not being emotional on purpose. He really wants me to be there.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Folks don't understand. I can't do it all. I'm not a good manager or whatever. I've done as bad as I can.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And people always want me to do it. Folks, you've got to do it. And people that are in leadership positions, they've got to decide to do a little more.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  I can't do it all. That's why I have other talk show hosts on, other people. I'm trying to build others up.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  I just want to beat the tyranny. That's my goal, not being number one.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  Let's take another call. Patrick in Illinois. Patrick, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Oh, it's a quick t-shirt idea, quick question. Okay. Okay. In the front of the t-shirt, it says, if you give tyranny an inch, it will drag you a mile with a personified constitution, personified constitution, and a militarized police officer playing a gun at him.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Okay. And my question is, I think Julian Assange, or do you think Julian Assange came out now supporting Rand Paul and Ron Paul because he's seen the writing on the wall with Bradley Manning and with Michael Hastings.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Absolutely. The neocons want to kill him, so do the Democrats. And, I mean, who else is out there saying no? Rand Paul is saying no. Who else is breaking state-run media blockades with Drudge Report and things like infoworks.com?
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  And so it just shows how the resistance is hot. People are looking to America worldwide for leadership. We've just got to give it.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Absolutely. What do you think of my t-shirt idea?
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  I think it's awesome, brother. I think you should make it and put it up on Zazzle or some account. If you sell 10, you're a winner. God bless you.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  You do YouTube videos about it. You probably sell a thousand. You all need to be leaders, folks. I can't do it all.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  If I became the big leader and was beating them, they'd kill me. The answer is create a transmission, a spirit, an idea, a wavelength to get others to resonate with that and move against the tyranny.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  I'm only a seed, ladies and gentlemen, not the tree that will grow out of it. You understand that? One final call.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  Eric in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air. Sorry to all the others. Go ahead. You're our tail gunner.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  Hello?
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  Yes, sir. Worldwide broadcast. Got 30 seconds.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Yeah, I was wondering what you think of Mamiah Abu Jamal.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  You know, I've seen a lot of evidence that what he's saying isn't really true and that he's basically a cause for the left to raise money.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  You notice the left, as soon as they're in control, love the police state. They're only anti-police as a way to act like they're anti-establishment.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  But I think you guys got a very interesting voice. But I can't judge him because I'm not sure on the case.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  But I know that the weather underground and others, not that he's connected to, did kill police and got away with it and raised Barack Obama.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Thank you.
