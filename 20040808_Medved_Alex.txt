[00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:08.478]  ...Muslims in mosques, whether it's people like Mr. Ian Spears, who is not Muslim and
[00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:13.918]  not Arab-American, whoever it is, we all ought to cooperate and cooperate cheerfully. I appreciate
[00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:19.998]  your call. I was listening to one of my colleagues on InTalk Radio, and no, I'm not going to
[00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:23.798]  tell you which one, and it made me embarrassed. It happens every once in a while. It made
[00:00:23.798 --> 00:00:27.858]  me seriously embarrassed, because it was a guy who was complaining about the Transportation
[00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:34.658]  Security Administration. Now look, at the TSA, I deal with a lot, because I fly a lot.
[00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:40.018]  And I respect the people who do those jobs, for goodness sake. Yes, they may not be brain
[00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:44.938]  surgeons, but for goodness sake, they're people trying, for the most part, to do an honest
[00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:49.758]  job, and I am glad that they're there. Should they racially profile? Of course they should
[00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:55.358]  racially profile. Should they look specially at Middle Eastern males? Of course they should.
[00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:59.278]  But to say that, gosh, these are the kind of low-lives, these are the kind of people
[00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:04.378]  I've worked my whole life to get away from, I'm sorry, these are decent working Americans
[00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:09.198]  who are trying to do a job. And they deserve respect, and they deserve cooperation, for
[00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:13.518]  goodness sake. Let's go to Alan in Tacoma. You're on the Michael Medved Show on Talk
[00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:19.838]  770 KTTH. Hi, how you doing, Michael? I'm doing well, Alan. Hey, great. Well, I just
[00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:24.118]  called because I heard you talking. I'm a regular listener of yours. Thank you. And
[00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:29.678]  a friend of mine who's a filmmaker in Seattle was doing some research on the Internet about
[00:01:29.678 --> 00:01:37.198]  Illuminati and conspiracy theories and things like that. And he found a video that really
[00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:42.318]  moved him, and he started duplicating it. The author of the video, I guess, gives people
[00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:48.078]  permission to duplicate it. And he started passing these out, and the next thing he knows,
[00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:54.078]  he's being investigated by the Secret Service. What's the video? It's called 9-11,
[00:01:54.078 --> 00:02:04.438]  The Road to Tyranny by Alex Jones. Okay, wonderful. Do you know the context in which
[00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:10.398]  he was handing out the video? Yeah, he was basically duplicating them and then just passing
[00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:17.638]  them out to whoever was interested. Was he just giving them to friends, or did he advertise
[00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:22.238]  on his own website? Just giving them to friends. And so what happened in the Secret Service
[00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:28.958]  investigation? Well, at first, you know, he saw a white van kind of posted outside of
[00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:38.478]  his house for a while, obviously with people looking at him. And then after that, you know,
[00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:45.838]  a couple of guys, late 20s, maybe early 30s, came to his door, and they started asking
[00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:50.198]  him a bunch of questions. And then they asked if they could search his house, and they searched
[00:02:50.198 --> 00:02:54.478]  his house, and they found a lot of books like, you know, Bush Lies and things like
[00:02:54.478 --> 00:03:00.398]  that. He's liberal. And they just said that he's the weirdest guy he's ever met, and they
[00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:06.238]  started digging up his medical history and his past and grilling him for days and days
[00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:12.318]  and days. It sounds like it's probably an overreaction. However, let me ask you this.
[00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:17.518]  Have you seen the video you're talking about? Have you read what Alex Jones says? Yes, I have.
[00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:22.158]  Okay, basically, Alex Jones accuses the President of the United States of being a mass murderer.
[00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:29.598]  Well, he accuses any... Yes, he does. He does. Come on. He accuses the President of the United
[00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:36.798]  States of being responsible for for 9-11. He believes that that both Democrats and Republicans
[00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:43.118]  are both being influenced by private America, you know, mainly like Bilderberg Group and other large...
[00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:48.798]  Right, I understand. I'm very, very familiar with that line of thinking. I do think it's
[00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:55.358]  appropriate. If people really sip deeply on that kind of paranoia, I would like some government
[00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:59.598]  officials to keep a special eye on them. Should they be arrested? No. Should they have their
[00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:04.798]  rights taken away to duplicate that kind of video? No. But should we be careful about those people
[00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:10.318]  like we should have been more careful about Timothy McVeigh? By all means. When we come back,
[00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:15.918]  we'll go back to your calls about from those of you who believe that the government right now is
[00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:20.478]  a bigger enemy than terror. I know there are lots of you out there who think that somehow this entire
[00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:27.278]  terror threat was somehow orchestrated, somehow created in order to take away your rights. I don't
[00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:33.838]  believe that having agents ask for your ID when you're on federal property involves taking away
[00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:38.638]  your rights. I don't think it takes away anyone's rights if they suggest that Muslims should be
[00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:43.038]  particularly focused on what goes on in their mosques, especially given what we know about what
[00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:48.078]  some of those mosques have amounted to. And I want to share with you the death of a federal
[00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:53.118]  program that would have made us safer but was killed by political correctness. That and more
[00:04:53.118 --> 00:05:19.758]  coming up. 1-800-955-1776. I am so shocked you're talking like this.
[00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:28.878]  The story out of Rochester, New York says that recently FBI agents have been told to establish
[00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:33.598]  contacts with Muslims across the country. The U.S. government believes this could stop an attack
[00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:40.638]  and a Muslim activist in Rochester says his name is Hanif Abdul Waheed. He says some part of me
[00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:45.198]  says that they shouldn't have to do that because naturally Muslims are law-abiding citizens and they
[00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:50.398]  cooperate on the side of what's just. It's racism in the sense that when you pinpoint a particular
[00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:55.518]  race for something, meaning that you're undermining their sincerity, their patriotism in this country.
[00:05:56.238 --> 00:06:02.158]  Oh really? Or is it just common sense that given the fact that mosques, so many mosques in America
[00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:09.838]  are funded by the Wahhabi sect of Islam and do at least tolerate and include some radical
[00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:15.038]  preachments. Isn't it common sense to ask those patriotic Muslims to keep their eyes open?
[00:06:16.478 --> 00:06:22.158]  1-800-955-1776. We go to Ed in Walla Walla, Washington. You're on the Michael Medved show.
[00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:26.638]  You know I just I was just amazed to hear you uttering the phrase we all ought to cooperate
[00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:33.358]  and cooperate cheerfully. It just reminded me of you know there were people who were Jewish who
[00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:40.718]  felt that way in Germany in 1939. Do you really want to leave the analogy out there that America
[00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:45.038]  is like Germany in 1939? I'm not saying it is, but I'm saying there's something creepy about you
[00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:49.518]  making that statement. There's a huge difference between those two ideas. Now for you there's not
[00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:53.678]  because you're blinded by you know a kind of cultural fascism that you are trying to induce
[00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:58.158]  in America. Do you think it's cultural fascism to suggest to people that it's better that they
[00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:01.758]  cooperate with police officers? I think it's cultural fascism to suggest that anyone who
[00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:05.838]  doesn't support this war is completely unpatriotic and you know evil which is what you've done.
[00:07:10.478 --> 00:07:15.998]  First of all I've never done that. The only time that the term unpatriotic has been used that I can
[00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:21.678]  think of in this presidential campaign was it was used by Howard Dean saying that John Ashcroft is
[00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:28.478]  not a patriot. But if anybody can and the standard had a challenge come up with any major Republican
[00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:33.278]  who has called any major Democrat unpatriotic. Nobody answered the challenge because they can't.
[00:07:33.998 --> 00:07:43.038]  Dave in Phoenix, Arizona KKNT you're on the Michael Medved show. Hello Dave. Dave was that or
[00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:52.798]  yes Dave that's you. Okay this is Craig. As far as as far as enemies I think right up there with
[00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:58.718]  the terrorist or the liberal democratic demagogues in Congress are doing everything
[00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:04.798]  through lies and deceit to get back into power irregardless of the impact on the safety of this
[00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:10.558]  country. Okay I don't think that cheap politicians count as the enemy. I think that politicians being
[00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:18.318]  political and being selfish is kind of normal but you shouldn't qualify people with whom you disagree
[00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:25.038]  politically as the enemy it seems to me. We go to Grant in Renton Washington on talk 770 KTTH.
[00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:30.318]  I just wanted to say that I think there's bad apples on both sides of the equation and although
[00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:36.478]  the terrorist problem is definitely larger than this ballad law that locks in incidents it's not
[00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:42.718]  necessarily an isolated case and I do think we need people to stand up for their rights and
[00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:48.318]  and keep the abuses from being prevalent. What are the abuses that you're worried about?
[00:08:51.838 --> 00:09:02.638]  The abuse of power by the police. I understand such as? Such as happened in that case. Why is
[00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:06.318]  it an abuse of power if somebody has called up and said hey there's a guy over here he's taking
[00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:10.638]  photographs on federal property he's acting suspicious could you check it out? Why is it
[00:09:10.638 --> 00:09:17.758]  an abuse of power for a cop to come up and say can I see your ID sir? I'm not saying that that was
[00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:22.158]  an abuse of power and I don't know what the situation was there because I wasn't there.
[00:09:24.238 --> 00:09:28.718]  That's what the situation was according to all of the newspaper accounts appreciate your call.
[00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:33.678]  Jeff in Augusta Georgia listening to us on XM radio you're on the Michael Medved show. Yeah I
[00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:37.678]  wanted to start by saying first off I am a conservative Republican and I listen to your show
[00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:43.598]  but I heard at least in my mind one of the enemies today and that was you just a few minutes ago
[00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:47.998]  when the guy called in about his friend who accessed the internet basically what I believe
[00:09:47.998 --> 00:09:54.238]  I heard you say was that you were perfectly comfortable with a violation of that individual's
[00:09:54.238 --> 00:09:58.958]  freedom to speech and freedom to access stuff on the internet without being investigated and
[00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:04.638]  harassed by the government. Wait wait wait. So you are aiding abetting the terrorists and that you
[00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:10.478]  are helping them win the victory. Jeff tell me tell me where there is any traditional freedom
[00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:18.478]  from investigation. There is a thing called probable cause. You bet. And accessing a document
[00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:24.078]  that the Bush administration. Not accessing duplicating and that's the problem he's
[00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:27.998]  duplicating and distributing it. If you're duplicating and distributing a document that
[00:10:27.998 --> 00:10:32.078]  says the President of the United States is a murderer it seems to me appropriate for the
[00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:35.758]  Secret Service to take a look at you but stay with me I want to continue the conversation
[00:10:35.758 --> 00:10:39.518]  because God forbid I don't want to take away your freedom of speech. We'll also talk about
[00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:44.718]  a promising federal program that just died because of political correctness. The Michael
[00:10:44.718 --> 00:10:59.918]  Medved Show MichaelMedved.com
[00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:08.718]  44 minutes past the hour on the Michael Medved Show a number of people on the left have said the
[00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:15.038]  real enemy isn't terrorism. The real enemy is the United States government and its seizure
[00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:21.278]  of more and more authority. It's a violation of your constitutional rights. Jeff believes that
[00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:27.838]  I'm part of the enemy. Jeff in Augusta Georgia because I made light of a story that somebody
[00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:31.598]  called up and told I don't even know if the story is true about a friend of his who was
[00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:38.078]  distributing copying and distributing a video that says that President Bush helped to plan and
[00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:43.678]  execute the 9-11 attacks along with his co-conspirators and apparently the person
[00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:49.518]  who was distributing this video was investigated by the Secret Service. Jeff my basic point is this
[00:11:49.518 --> 00:11:56.558]  if the guy were arrested if he faced consequences ruined business ruined life if he were interrogated
[00:11:56.558 --> 00:12:01.758]  if he were beaten up if something bad happened to him because he had distributed this scurrilous
[00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:06.878]  video then I would share your concern that would be a violation of rights. It does not seem to me
[00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:11.358]  to be a violation of rights when somebody distributes a video calling the President of
[00:12:11.358 --> 00:12:17.038]  the United States a mass murderer and distributes the thing to take a look at him. Okay Michael let
[00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:22.878]  me ask you this how is that different than Fahrenheit 9-11 and does that mean that you
[00:12:22.878 --> 00:12:27.278]  believe that the government should be investigating and doing the same sort of thing to Michael Moore?
[00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:33.358]  I think Michael Moore should be watched very carefully. Okay and then are you also a proponent
[00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:37.838]  of returning to the Hoover and the McCarthy era because that's exactly what you're describing
[00:12:37.838 --> 00:12:45.438]  anybody who says anything contrary to the current government's desires or wishes or criticizes them
[00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:50.958]  in a manner that you decide is too harsh should now have a dossier and a file on them and be
[00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:57.198]  subject to federal investigation. First of all wouldn't you assume that given Michael
[00:12:57.198 --> 00:13:02.718]  Moore's expressed desire to see America destroyed and he said that many times one evil empire down
[00:13:02.718 --> 00:13:08.558]  another evil empire to go if somebody says that I think the FBI would be derelict in their duty
[00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:15.038]  if they didn't have a file on Michael Moore don't you if somebody says he wants America to be
[00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:20.798]  destroyed don't you think okay and where do you draw the line where do I where do I draw the line
[00:13:20.798 --> 00:13:25.438]  is what what is too far and here's the problem here's the problem with what you're saying
[00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:31.918]  is you want to determine a degree of freedom of speech you don't want real freedom of speech
[00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:37.998]  you want freedom of speech defined by you or people that decide okay what is acceptable to
[00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:43.598]  say and what is not that's when you step over that boundary now you are going to be the subject
[00:13:43.598 --> 00:13:48.078]  of an investigation yes that's absolutely not true now you use the term probable cause before
[00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:52.318]  and good for you let me give you another term that I think you understand which is called prior
[00:13:52.318 --> 00:13:58.398]  restraint interference with pre-freedom of speech involves a prior restraint of speech or
[00:13:58.398 --> 00:14:04.078]  the consequences that ruin your career ruin your livelihood or ruin your life because you have
[00:14:04.078 --> 00:14:08.398]  spoken out I don't think this is one of the things that I thought was so stupid about the whole
[00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:13.998]  controversy regarding the Dixie Chicks the Dixie Chicks are more popular than ever well of course
[00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:18.158]  it was great press for them they loved it all right so you see the idea that freedom of speech
[00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:23.038]  is threatened in this country is ridiculous by the way I also think that the Dixie Chicks are
[00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:27.518]  too dumb to be foreign agents and I hope that the FBI doesn't have a file on the disc on the
[00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:33.358]  jet well and again I mean we can go back to the paranoia of Hoover or we can be reasonable you
[00:14:33.358 --> 00:14:38.718]  know what you see I I honestly believe if you read some of the books that have come out because
[00:14:38.718 --> 00:14:45.918]  of the declassified Soviet files a lot of that paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover was absolutely justified
[00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:51.838]  the American media the American government American universities were riddled by active
[00:14:51.838 --> 00:14:58.798]  communist agents Hiss was guilty the Rosenbergs were guilty these were real cases of infiltration
[00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:04.638]  in high places by people who dedicated their lives to destroying the United States okay but at what
[00:15:04.638 --> 00:15:12.558]  point at what point do we decide that we have to pull a balance that doesn't allow the terrorists
[00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:18.078]  to win by fundamentally changing life in this country as we have known it let me let me try to
[00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:22.238]  change in our rights let me try to give you as clear an answer as I can for a question that's
[00:15:22.238 --> 00:15:27.518]  asked I think in absolutely the right constructive spirit we have to stop well short of what they
[00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:33.278]  have in Canada in Canada they have restrictions on what you can say on the radio for instance we
[00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:40.078]  have no such thing here in the United States if on the radio I called publicly for blowing up
[00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:44.718]  federal buildings or killing federal agents you bet I think it's reasonable that I should be
[00:15:44.718 --> 00:15:49.278]  looked at but if I well actually in that case I would be more than looked at no just just looked
[00:15:49.278 --> 00:15:54.238]  at because the point is what you want to determine at in law enforcement is is this person just a
[00:15:54.238 --> 00:16:00.878]  blowhard in which case he's probably harmless or is this person actively involved with other people
[00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:06.958]  in some kind of actual effort to harm this country or to commit crimes and that it seems to me is
[00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:12.958]  reasonable let's let's go to Robert thanks for your call to Robert in Van Nuys California KRLA AM
[00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:20.798]  870 yes um even though people don't directly say you're unpatriotic if they say you belong to the
[00:16:20.798 --> 00:16:28.478]  hate America crowd or the blame America first crowd or can't support our troops without unless
[00:16:28.478 --> 00:16:35.678]  you support the government uh policy against the enemy so-called these are comments that were made
[00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:45.038]  by somebody like I think his name is T.J. Simmons and other Republicans I have no idea who T.J.
[00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:50.558]  Simmons is and I don't care but let me let me ask you a question yes do you say that you support
[00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:55.838]  the troops yes do you support their mission no how can you support the troops without supporting
[00:16:55.838 --> 00:17:00.878]  their mission that's the same as saying you're unpatriotic no answer my question because I give
[00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:05.598]  them tax money for one thing all right so you financially support them without giving them
[00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:09.758]  taxes do you but that's not what you meant when I asked you do you support the troops
[00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:14.238]  when I asked do you support the troops it's not their fault they're in a morass
[00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:20.718]  I understand but the point of the United States led by George Bush do you support me do I support
[00:17:20.718 --> 00:17:26.798]  who me you yeah in what way do you support me would you say I support Michael Medved
[00:17:27.758 --> 00:17:33.518]  well I'm listening to you okay fine fine fine but you probably don't you know probably don't
[00:17:33.518 --> 00:17:39.278]  support me any more than you support the troops the point about this uh Robert it's very simple
[00:17:39.278 --> 00:17:43.278]  saying that you don't support the troops isn't saying that you want them to die I understand
[00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:47.838]  that you don't want them to die no one wants them to die but to say I support the troops has to
[00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:53.838]  involve supporting their mission has to involve wishing them success I don't think you wish them
[00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:59.038]  success do you it's a morass I understand thank you for answering my question so you don't support
[00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:05.918]  the troops yes I do in what sense I don't support their mission how then do you to support them
[00:18:06.478 --> 00:18:11.118]  well I give them tax money but that's not even voluntary that's not even voluntary you don't
[00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:16.718]  volunteer your tax money Robert you prefer to give your tax money rather than go to jail
[00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:20.798]  probably wouldn't even give tax money if you didn't have to we'll be right back by the way
[00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:23.998]  I think your show is great I disagree with almost everything you say but you
[00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:27.278]  at least give people a chance to talk
[00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:37.758]  so
[00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:55.038]  this hour is brought to you by american conference do you care about this country's future
[00:18:55.038 --> 00:19:00.238]  they call american compass toll free at 1-888-64-BOOK
[00:19:03.118 --> 00:19:08.878]  55 minutes past the hour on the Michael Medved show I mentioned to you that a promising federal
[00:19:08.878 --> 00:19:17.758]  program called CAPS the computer assisted passenger pre-screening system CAPS 2 has been cancelled
[00:19:17.758 --> 00:19:22.958]  and Tom Ridge just announced this he said there were too many privacy concerns what CAPS would
[00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:27.518]  have done would have been to color code all airline passengers to make it easier and faster
[00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:34.798]  to go through the security checks is it so ridiculous is it so outrageous to expect people
[00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:40.478]  who engage in the privilege of air travel to have their backgrounds checked a little bit
[00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:47.838]  I honestly don't get this level of paranoia we go to Edgar in Los Angeles on KRLA you're
[00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:53.278]  on the Michael Medved show um hello Mr Medved um first I want to say that I'm a die-hard
[00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:58.478]  conservative and a compassionate one at that and I hear your radio show from time to time
[00:19:58.478 --> 00:20:01.998]  and I find that you're very quick to poo poo conservative get get to the point
