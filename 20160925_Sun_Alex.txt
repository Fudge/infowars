[00:00.000 --> 00:25.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance,
[00:25.800 --> 00:30.800]  Alex Jones.
[00:30.800 --> 00:58.800]  Today, the revelation surrounding Seales' involvement with the vice presidency of George H. Bush, the Arkansas governorship of Bill Clinton, secret money laundering dealings with the DEA, and CIA director William J. Casey's shadow government of the United States paints a clear picture of the evolution of the current corruption that infests the highest levels of government today.
[00:58.800 --> 01:08.800]  In a staff meeting in 1981 with newly elected president Ronald Reagan, CIA director William Casey said,
[01:08.800 --> 01:26.800]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[01:26.800 --> 01:53.800]  Governor Bill Clinton's new initiative to bring good jobs to the people of Arkansas, to her surprise, Teresa Dickey gradually uncovered a massive shadow government operation, replete with illegal cargo plane modifications for drug running and money laundering that would have huge ties to the DEA, and at the center of that deliberate and illegal operation was Barry Seal, a fearless drug smuggler and gun runner for the DEA and the CIA.
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.800]  Barry Seal had been busted for drug smuggling and worked out a deal with the DEA to act as an informant.
[01:59.800 --> 02:11.800]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seal's enemies caught up with him and killed him. Tonight, three men are in custody, NBC's Brian Ross reports that Seal was about to testify for the government once again.
[02:11.800 --> 02:21.800]  It was Seal who posed as a smuggler and flew into Nicaragua and took these pictures, showing Colombian drug dealers and Sandinista officials loading cocaine on his plane.
[02:21.800 --> 02:42.800]  I came to the table with a background in Air Force Intelligence, eight years during the Vietnam War, worked with the CIA and Air America, and then that led me into contract work with the CIA in an obscure place called Mina, Arkansas, back when Bill Clinton was governor, and back when George Bush was the president.
[02:42.800 --> 02:59.800]  And I personally witnessed a complicity between these two men, Bush and Clinton, in terms of transporting cocaine into the U.S. for the purpose of sale to generate money to fight a war.
[02:59.800 --> 03:06.800]  That war at the time was the conflict in Central America involving the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
[03:06.800 --> 03:20.800]  And after the Iran Contra hearings detailed Oliver North's diversion of funds to the Contras and all of the failed indictments never brought anyone to justice, to this day the banks continue to launder the billion-dollar drug cartel industry's money.
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.800]  And when they are caught, they pay a fine and no one goes to prison.
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.800]  Thank you, Clinton and Bush crime family. Corruption has been largely normalized.
[03:29.800 --> 03:38.800]  Although all of this evidence may seem irrelevant as the statute of limitations has been surpassed, what does it mean to the upcoming election?
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.800]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:41.800 --> 03:47.800]  It means everything. It means innocent people mysteriously died in Arkansas for no reason.
[03:47.800 --> 03:59.800]  Because of Linda Ives investigation into the death of her son, she was placed on Bill Clinton's enemy list by White House counsel Mark Fabian.
[03:59.800 --> 04:07.800]  Already people associated with the case were beginning to die and what amounted to a reign of terror among young people in Alexander, Arkansas.
[04:07.800 --> 04:24.800]  The crime syndicate operating within the Bush and Clinton families will either be stopped dead in its tracks from entering the executive office once again, or a Hillary presidency will usher in a new age of corruption that will bring the United States to its knees.
[04:24.800 --> 04:39.800]  John Bown for info wars dot com.
[04:39.800 --> 04:54.800]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we'll be back after this quick break. So get locked in loaded. We're less than 24 hours out right now to the kickoff of the big debate. I mean, it's technically like 26 hours, 27 hours.
[04:54.800 --> 05:10.800]  But for all the purposes, it is game time. Stay with us.
[05:10.800 --> 05:25.800]  You guys were putting those out there. I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine fine products. Welcome to the info war. It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[05:25.800 --> 05:44.800]  I'm a nine year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals. I feel effects. Nice. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking? Everything from Superman to brain force to winter sun X to even got a little DNA force.
[05:44.800 --> 06:07.800]  So when I just free up everything and I just went to auto bill visit info wars life.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself. That's info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:07.800 --> 06:19.800]  It's Sunday, September 25th, 2016, 43 days out from the November 8th general election. The final countdown.
[06:19.800 --> 06:28.800]  We're going to be live here for the next few hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 16 central. I'm Alex Jones, your host in the final countdown of this historic election.
[06:28.800 --> 06:44.800]  That is calling it lightly calling it historical this unprecedentedly important election. I was up here yesterday working for about eight hours with Rob do our news director who put in 14 hours yesterday on Saturday and he's up here right now working.
[06:44.800 --> 07:02.800]  And the reason we're working so hard and the reason I can't drag kid Daniels away who's been working seven days a week writing for info wars.com who's in the room next to me right now is because history is happening and anybody who's even half dialed in understands that everything we do right now echoes throughout history.
[07:02.800 --> 07:18.800]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday transmission. We are going to be here for the next two hours and I'm going to be back tomorrow. 11am to 3pm with the four hour weekday transmission.
[07:18.800 --> 07:36.800]  Then I will return with the rest of our crew from seven central until 11 central or so or midnight Eastern with four plus hours of live coverage of this historic 90 minute debate to take place at a university in New York.
[07:36.800 --> 07:49.800]  Now, they're also putting this out as being hosted by NBC's Lester Holt, but it's being put out on a lot of platforms we've subscribed to the feed. So I'm not going to be talking over the feed.
[07:49.800 --> 08:05.800]  And be able to analyze corporate media feeds, corporate spin, you know, these different reporters that try to score brownie points and engage in dirty tricks. I'll only be commenting during brief applause or during brief breaks. We'll have an hour of live analysis before.
[08:05.800 --> 08:19.800]  Seven o'clock central eight o'clock. It kicks off at 9 31. It ends. We'll have analysis of the debate. All the clips. I'm going to have the full crew up here grabbing clips. They'll all be ready with highlights analysis. Leanne McAdoo, David at night.
[08:19.800 --> 08:29.800]  Rob do Mr. Shroyer and so many others that are part of the team. We will be here breaking it down live with our writers, our reporters, our crew.
[08:29.800 --> 08:41.800]  Also radio affiliates out there that want to pick up my weekday show. We're on the radio satellite at night, obviously with the TV show. I never thought the TV show would get picked up by almost more stations than my radio show.
[08:41.800 --> 08:56.800]  But you're welcome to pick that up as well. And also welcome to pick up the two hours of analysis afterwards. So a lot happening. We also have some UHF, VHF and cable stations picking up the transmission, which shows how the new independent media is growing.
[08:56.800 --> 09:04.800]  The old dinosaur media is dying. A very historic time to be alive. Okay, where to begin?
[09:04.800 --> 09:15.800]  Donald Trump showing what presidential material he is yesterday when Mark Cuban came out and said, I'm going to be trolling you in the first row. I'm a guest of hitlery.
[09:15.800 --> 09:26.800]  Trump said, well, that's fine. I'm going to bring Jennifer Flowers, who you settled a sex case with and who you admitted that you basically did things to an abuse.
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.800]  And Jennifer Flowers said, you bet with a little kissy mark, a little emoji back at Trump that she will be there tomorrow night.
[09:33.800 --> 09:45.800]  Now Paula Jones and Kathleen Willie and others. We've interviewed all these women over the last 20 plus years. They're all going to be there now in the front row. So see how Mark Cuban and others like it.
[09:45.800 --> 09:56.800]  See, they strike out at Trump and the populist. Trump doesn't lay there like a rhino or a neocon. He strikes back against the empire. So very, very exciting.
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.800]  But listen, here's the big issue. Do you really think that Hillary can show up when she can't even stand up for more than 10 or 15 minutes?
[10:04.800 --> 10:14.800]  She's canceled all of her live events the last week, only does brief Skype or satellite interviews. It looks like she's on drugs and behaves bizarrely in her eyes or pointing different directions.
[10:14.800 --> 10:24.800]  And by the way, when I first started hearing this a week ago, I thought it was the listeners who sometimes just like I used to, I've got a little jaded over the years, less conspiratorial, though most of the time we're right.
[10:24.800 --> 10:33.800]  They were saying it's a blue screen with her with a big plane behind her. It was just strong together or together strong. And it's fake. It's blue screen.
[10:33.800 --> 10:45.800]  But then I noticed day after day press conference after press conference, it's the same shot, a different outfit with the same lighting. And you can tell it's blue screen. She is blue screening.
[10:45.800 --> 10:56.800]  Because I went and looked at her record, she's admittedly not flying around the country on top of it, but keeps popping up with daily, not really news briefings, but just news statements to the press.
[10:56.800 --> 11:07.800]  So it's getting crazier and crazier and crazier. So all of that is coming up today. We got a big stack of polls showing Trump continuing to surge across the nation.
[11:07.800 --> 11:15.800]  That's why the Justice Department run by the UN publicly with the Strong Cities Initiative says they're openly going to come in and try to federalize this election.
[11:15.800 --> 11:30.800]  You know, to Soros gave hundreds of millions more the last month, Ford Foundation 100 plus million, billions total last few years to race baiting communist organizations like BLM to cause destabilization in the country.
[11:30.800 --> 11:41.800]  And everyone is seeing through it, ladies and gentlemen, but they are really doubling down and clearly their October surprise is a multi-faceted attack pattern.
[11:41.800 --> 11:49.800]  Racial division sees unquestionable police shootings and make them the number one issue. Also, start wars with Russia.
[11:49.800 --> 11:57.800]  Actions against Russia have massively intensified in Ukraine. We have the top U.S. general in a clip coming up after the break.
[11:57.800 --> 12:05.800]  This is amazing. No fly zone would require war with Syria and Russia. Top U.S. general says, General Dunford.
[12:05.800 --> 12:14.800]  But he goes on to follow the orders of Obama in a longer clip we have and say we should implement a no-fly zone against Russia but not against, quote, U.S.
[12:14.800 --> 12:20.800]  And the Russians have come out and detailed that Obama and Hillary have been aiding ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[12:20.800 --> 12:28.800]  The al-Nusra front, as it's known, is al-Qaeda slash ISIS in Syria. And Russia is asking that be declassified by the U.S. Congress.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.800]  They say they've seen the documents that even Congress knows that they are running ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.800]  Syhersha's come out. You name it. But this is massive. No-fly zone would require war with Syria and Russia. Top U.S. general.
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.800]  We have the video clip. It's on infowars.com. That is going to be coming up.
[12:44.800 --> 12:52.800]  Economic collapse. Escalated theater level war. Baby wars with Russia. Escalated crises in Ukraine.
[12:52.800 --> 13:02.800]  Economic collapse. As I mentioned, race war. They're trying to start. This is the incredible level that we have reached, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:02.800 --> 13:12.800]  Meanwhile, we have George W. Bush hugging Michelle and Obama on a vacation with the Clintons at the opening of a, quote, museum.
[13:12.800 --> 13:19.800]  I mean, this is so transparent that the elite are basically two wings on the same bird, same bird of prey.
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.800]  Michelle Obama gives George W. Bush a big hug. Nation goes wild.
[13:25.800 --> 13:32.800]  It's okay that Obama continues minimum sentencing for black people, that the Bushes continued and that the Clintons created it.
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.800]  It's okay. Because it's all about just hugging and kissing and saying, you love us, then it's okay if you actually target us.
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.800]  By the way, there was that mall shooting on Friday and I didn't know what happened.
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.800]  And some people were saying, I saw in the comments of infowars.com, why aren't you seizing on this?
[13:49.800 --> 13:56.800]  Because it's not a Muslim. And I'm like, listen, I'm the person that was against invading Iraq and all these countries and destabilizing the Middle East
[13:56.800 --> 14:02.800]  and putting radical Islam in charge. I'm not some Islamophobe. I'm against Wahhabism out of Saudi Arabia.
[14:02.800 --> 14:08.800]  There's now the dominant form of Islam. But I was waiting and seeing what happened because no one had any information.
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.800]  The guy shot four women and one man.
[14:11.800 --> 14:22.800]  Well, now we know. Burlington shooter ID'd as Arkan Sitten, immigrant from Turkey, not a citizen, but a legal permanent resident of the United States.
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.800]  That's from Breitbart.com. It's also on infowars.com.
[14:26.800 --> 14:35.800]  Here's another one, CBS, Seattle, gunman on run after killing five at Macy's, now confirmed to be a Muslim from Turkey.
[14:35.800 --> 14:44.800]  Turkish immigrant, Washington mall shooting suspect 20 is arrested 30 miles from crime scene in a zombie-like state as police refused to rule out terrorism.
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.800]  So, I didn't come out on Friday and say, hey, I bet it's a Muslim.
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.800]  But I noticed the Muslim groups and others attacked me saying, oh, they're not covering as it wasn't a Muslim.
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.800]  About 90% of the time there's a mass shooting now in this country. It's a Muslim or a bombing.
[15:03.800 --> 15:11.800]  And then Hillary comes out and tries to cover it up. The point is you're bringing people in from countries where they can't even get along with each other, much less us.
[15:11.800 --> 15:22.800]  And then we get George Soros' own emails a month ago from DC leaks and they're admitting right there that he wants to destabilize things and cause a collapse of civilization.
[15:22.800 --> 15:28.800]  And then have people so concerned about all the terrorism that we then capitulate to a central leftist government police state.
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.800]  Hitler did the same thing, firebombing his own government building.
[15:32.800 --> 15:43.800]  On February 27th, 1933, he went from being an elected El Presidente to becoming the chancellor and the president, that's known as the Fuhrer or the leader.
[15:43.800 --> 15:51.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, all this and a lot more straight ahead, MSNBC's pushing the narrative that police may have planted gun at Keith Lamont Scott shooting.
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.800]  We've got our reporters there on the ground. Ian North Carolina, Stay Weathers, I'm Alex Jones.
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.800]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[16:02.800 --> 16:13.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[16:13.800 --> 16:21.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[16:21.800 --> 16:29.800]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[16:31.800 --> 16:39.800]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[16:39.800 --> 16:43.800]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.

[17:28.800 --> 17:41.800]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[17:41.800 --> 17:49.800]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[18:58.800 --> 19:03.800]  Brainforce. It's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us.
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.800]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[19:07.800 --> 19:14.800]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.800]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[19:18.800 --> 19:25.800]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[19:25.800 --> 19:32.800]  Got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise,
[19:32.800 --> 19:38.800]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.800]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[19:42.800 --> 19:48.800]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce, and came in.
[19:48.800 --> 20:02.800]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[20:02.800 --> 20:19.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:19.800 --> 20:30.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:30.800 --> 20:37.800]  We have a nuclear war with Russia or China, and we will all be radioactive.
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.800]  Coming up, Joe Biggs noticed this on the official Fox News website, and I found it in other places.
[20:42.800 --> 20:49.800]  Fox News lies, says, white cop killed Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[20:49.800 --> 20:56.800]  I kept hearing, you know, these white people killed this guy. It was a black cop, and now the media's claiming the police planted a gun.
[20:56.800 --> 21:00.800]  They talk about conspiracy theorists. They have no proof. They have four cops saying drop the gun.
[21:00.800 --> 21:07.800]  They have video of the guy with the gun on his hand, but they're saying that is staged.
[21:07.800 --> 21:15.800]  But then when Reuters adds 15% more Democrats to national polling for three months and admits that they're doing that, that's not a conspiracy.
[21:15.800 --> 21:21.800]  When they claim Hillary's at a dead heat, when they add 15% more Democrats to the demographic that they actually questioned.
[21:21.800 --> 21:26.800]  Next, next level BS. But let's get to this really, really serious issue.
[21:26.800 --> 21:37.800]  For those that don't remember about a week and a half ago, there was a big bombing that killed 80 Syrian regular military troops who were battling Al-Nusra in a key city.
[21:37.800 --> 21:43.800]  And Al-Nusra is the name of Al-Qaeda, or the Wahhabist slash ISIS. Al-Qaeda means base.
[21:43.800 --> 21:49.800]  IS means Islamic base, Islamic state. It's the same group out of Saudi Arabia that's who funds it.
[21:49.800 --> 21:55.800]  That's indisputed, by the way. The media thinks you're stupid and tries to confuse it. That's their entire program.
[21:55.800 --> 22:02.800]  And so they got all this unfolding, and then you've got the Syrian military winning all over the country.
[22:02.800 --> 22:13.800]  And the Russians, 90% pulled out for the last few years, but they've left some forward observers, some people there to identify targets in some aircraft, and advisors to the Syrians.
[22:13.800 --> 22:21.800]  And so every time they're about to defeat Al-Qaeda or ISIS, the US planes, or NATO planes, accidentally bomb the forces.
[22:21.800 --> 22:28.800]  And sometimes they bomb Russians. Last week it was the Syrians, Syrian military.
[22:28.800 --> 22:35.800]  And so now we have the headlines. Russia says US failing to deliver on Syrian ceasefire wants the tales classified. That's from RT.
[22:35.800 --> 22:44.800]  There's another report from Breitbart. This is all up on Infowars.com. Hillary Clinton sponsored Secret of Arab Spring program that destabilized the Middle East.
[22:44.800 --> 22:54.800]  Tomorrow we're going to break a major report. Paul Watson is with eyewitnesses, documents, you name it, that add to what is admitted.
[22:54.800 --> 23:01.800]  Gaddafi was trying to surrender for over a year. He didn't start the war. They wanted to direct the country and hand it over to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[23:01.800 --> 23:07.800]  That's why they did this. Because Hillary came, she saw, and Gaddafi died.
[23:07.800 --> 23:19.800]  Hillary Clinton sponsored Secret of Arab Spring program that destabilized the Middle East. I'm giving you credit for inspiring the peaceful protest with regard to Egypt with quotation marks around the word peaceful.
[23:19.800 --> 23:32.800]  Remember CNN with their different hosts, like Anderson Cooper, how great all this was, turning loose, Sunni, Wahhabist, Al-Qaeda, all over the region.
[23:32.800 --> 23:43.800]  Here's another article. West still arming al-Nusra in Syria's peace, almost impossible. Russia's UN envoy. We have the video clips of all of this.
[23:43.800 --> 23:51.800]  Russia says U.S. filling the liver on Syrian ceasefire. Here's another one. West still arming al-Nusra in Syria, peace almost impossible, on and on and on.
[23:51.800 --> 24:03.800]  Now, let's go to a chilling clip here. And the full clips, again, on infowars.com. It's like 30 minutes long of testimony.
[24:03.800 --> 24:15.800]  No fly zone would require war with Syria and Russia. Top U.S. General, General Dunford, says the U.S. to control all the airspace in Syria would require going to war against Syria and Russia.
[24:15.800 --> 24:31.800]  Syria is a sovereign nation invaded, basically, by Saudi Arabia with Wahhabists. They're mainly Shiite, Christian, and Alawite. They're minority groups. They're being invaded. They're peaceful. Then our government says we've got to invade Syria because Al-Qaeda and ISIS is there.
[24:31.800 --> 24:41.800]  Our criminal government is the one that financed them. The refugees they bring out of Syria are the Wahhabist, Al-Qaeda, ISIS people that get their butts kicked.
[24:41.800 --> 24:53.800]  So they evacuate to the U.S. and Europe. Then they attack us. General Dunford says that the U.S. to control all the airspace in Syria would require going to war against Syria and Russia.
[24:53.800 --> 25:06.800]  This is his response to the latest proposal by John Kerry, which involves grounding only Syrian and Russian airplanes, and that means shooting them down if they try to take off, even fly back to their country, speaking of the Russians.
[25:06.800 --> 25:17.800]  So that's the two minutes to midnight we've now come to. And the top Syrian general came out last week and said, we're already seeing World War III. It's biblical. It's starting in Syria. It's happening right now.
[25:17.800 --> 25:28.800]  And they go on and add, we're not even against Israel. Syria wants to work with Israel. Even Israeli newspapers are saying, why are we on the side of the people trying to overthrow Syria and Israel?
[25:28.800 --> 25:35.800]  Because it's globalism, folks. It's a giant double cross against humanity. So here's the chilling clip of General Dunford.
[25:35.800 --> 25:42.800]  What about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.800]  What do you think of that option, sir?
[25:46.800 --> 25:55.800]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria, it would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[25:55.800 --> 26:01.800]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[26:01.800 --> 26:09.800]  Let's back that point again. That's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, just like General Dempsey was the chairman a few, four years ago.
[26:09.800 --> 26:20.800]  And they went to Obama and Hillary, and they said, listen, if we go in there, Russia's got a deal to defend them. There was Russian troops. This is sovereign nation. They're going to fight us.
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.800]  And at that point, they said the military is not going to do this. And there was a stand down. There was a soft coup. We should get Dr. Pchenek on the mar to talk about this is so big.
[26:27.800 --> 26:35.800]  Now it's got to the point where they go, oh, barrel bombs like babies out of incubators. They've always got some red, you know, shirt to wave.
[26:35.800 --> 26:41.800]  Oh, my gosh, they're dropping big bombs on Al-Qaeda. They're dropping big bombs on the Wahhabist.
[26:41.800 --> 26:51.800]  Oh, my gosh, their country got invaded. They got attacked. They were working with the West. Syria was a good guy compared to Saudi Arabia.
[26:51.800 --> 26:58.800]  Saudi Arabia attacked us on 9-11, folks. We attacked Iraq, their arch enemy, that was secular and sold playboys on store shelves.
[26:58.800 --> 27:04.800]  And women didn't have to wear hijabs. And 60% of their college graduates were women.
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.800]  The government of Iraq had more women in it than any other government in the Middle East, next to Libya.
[27:09.800 --> 27:15.800]  And again, what you see is truly more progressive states that want to work with the West getting set up.
[27:15.800 --> 27:23.800]  Don was trained by the CIA. It's declassified. He was set up and told to attack Kuwait. Look it up.
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.800]  We've been attacking the guys that don't have the beards, the guys that play rock and roll music.
[27:27.800 --> 27:33.800]  I'm not saying that's the sound of freedom. I'm just pointing out, for Saudi Arabia, this is the bait and switch. Let's play this clip one more time.
[27:33.800 --> 27:41.800]  What about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.800]  What do you think of that option, sir?
[27:45.800 --> 27:55.800]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.800]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.800]  World War III. And then if you watch, which I've been watching hours of, the Russian Ministry of Defense briefings,
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.800]  and then they've got brave people in the field as generals that look like they're about to die, completely freaked out going,
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.800]  and they're moving in their forces and they're getting ready to attack us and we're getting our weapons ready.
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.800]  And I just, we hope, and it's like doomsday, folks.
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.800]  I mean, these shots are like Russians with big, like red globes behind them and like satellite tracking,
[28:24.800 --> 28:27.800]  and they're just sitting there like they're in a doomsday bunker.
[28:27.800 --> 28:34.800]  And the average American has no idea what's going on. No idea.
[28:34.800 --> 28:36.800]  So, yeah, the debate tomorrow is big.
[28:36.800 --> 28:39.800]  And I was really anticipating it. We're going to be covering it live.

[33:10.800 --> 33:19.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:19.800 --> 33:22.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.800 --> 33:27.800]  Now to be clear, I'm going to be going to bed very early at night.
[33:27.800 --> 33:29.800]  I'm going to go home right after this show.
[33:29.800 --> 33:31.800]  It's six o'clock central.
[33:31.800 --> 33:34.800]  I'm going to hang out with my family and have a little dinner.
[33:34.800 --> 33:41.800]  At six o'clock I'm going to put on my little nightcap and climb into bed and get to bed by about 9.30.
[33:41.800 --> 33:45.800]  Because tomorrow I'm going to be hosting four hours of the worldwide broadcast.
[33:45.800 --> 33:47.800]  It's been around for 19 years.
[33:47.800 --> 33:50.800]  I've been on radio for 21, but 19 years syndicated.
[33:50.800 --> 33:52.800]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.800]  And then I am going to go in my office and I'm going to take a nap for a couple hours.
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.800]  A four snap to recharge.
[33:59.800 --> 34:02.800]  Not that I even need it, but I'm not as on if I don't.
[34:02.800 --> 34:04.800]  I'm going to go take a nap for a couple hours.
[34:04.800 --> 34:05.800]  I'm going to take a shower.
[34:05.800 --> 34:06.800]  Got a shower in my office here.
[34:06.800 --> 34:09.800]  And then I'm going to get dressed and suited up and researched for an hour or so.
[34:09.800 --> 34:14.800]  And I'm going to go for an hour with a round table discussion before the big debate tomorrow.
[34:14.800 --> 34:17.800]  And then I'm going to cover an hour and 90 minutes of it live.
[34:17.800 --> 34:18.800]  We're carrying the feed.
[34:18.800 --> 34:19.800]  We've licensed it.
[34:19.800 --> 34:20.800]  We've gotten it.
[34:20.800 --> 34:23.800]  But before we just do fair use, we're one group's covering it and it's public.
[34:23.800 --> 34:25.800]  And we're going to analyze the propaganda.
[34:25.800 --> 34:26.800]  No, I've actually gone out and licensed it.
[34:26.800 --> 34:28.800]  We're going to be carrying it from two different feeds.
[34:28.800 --> 34:29.800]  I've licensed it from.
[34:29.800 --> 34:35.800]  And then we are going to have two hours of live analysis after plus all the different highlights.
[34:35.800 --> 34:37.800]  You're going to have the very best coverage.
[34:37.800 --> 34:38.800]  Folks always complain.
[34:38.800 --> 34:40.800]  They go, man, when I tune in to see a debate here, let's turn on radio.
[34:40.800 --> 34:48.800]  You guys talk over more than half of it because if it's exclusively singing in or Fox or ABC or whatever, it's their event.
[34:48.800 --> 34:51.800]  And then you have, we pioneered this four years ago, the last election.
[34:51.800 --> 34:58.800]  Now everybody does it from Len Beck to the young Turks to, you know, Huffington Post, which I'm proud of the fact that we pioneered it.
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.800]  But I talked to lawyers, checked it out.
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.800]  We're talking over it, given analysis, criticizing the media or agreeing with it.
[35:04.800 --> 35:05.800]  It doesn't matter.
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.800]  It's the same reason you can play clips of a movie or clips of commercials or clips of shows and analyze them.
[35:09.800 --> 35:12.800]  It's fair use because it's your free speech to analyze them.
[35:12.800 --> 35:14.800]  We're not doing that tomorrow.
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.800]  We're carrying the debate.
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.800]  I'll sit there probably with a sock in my mouth, you know, during certain points, during applause or during breaks or during a dirty trick.
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.800]  I'm going to throw in quick little comments and give some analysis.
[35:27.800 --> 35:35.800]  But the real analysis is going to be with our crew, our reporters, our investigative journals are going to be in a live time analyzing what Hillary and Trump say.
[35:35.800 --> 35:45.800]  In fact, checking it and then posting articles and video blurbs to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and our other big sites in live time.
[35:45.800 --> 35:48.800]  So really proud of the crew, everything they're doing.
[35:48.800 --> 35:55.800]  Very, very thankful to the listeners and viewers out there for your support because what you've done, spreading the word, buying our products,
[35:55.800 --> 35:57.800]  our sponsors has made all this possible.
[35:57.800 --> 36:00.800]  You can see the huge effect that infowars is having.
[36:00.800 --> 36:06.800]  Speaking of that, before I get back to the news, we have a lot of different specials that are about to end.
[36:06.800 --> 36:11.800]  And we have super male and super female vitality, 20% off.
[36:11.800 --> 36:20.800]  It's cold pressed, compact herbs, known to increase vitality in a healthful, energetic way, libido, you name it, it's changed my life.
[36:20.800 --> 36:30.800]  Third party review sites have close to 1,500 reviews, 1,470 plus reviews on third party power reviews, which are big sticklers and other review sites.
[36:30.800 --> 36:32.800]  Nobody's got a 4.8.
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.800]  That's because nobody cold presses these.
[36:35.800 --> 36:38.800]  Okay, total game changer.
[36:38.800 --> 36:40.800]  I was looking from a distance of 4.5 right now.
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.800]  So infowarslife.com, your purchase supports the broadcast.
[36:44.800 --> 36:46.800]  It makes it all possible.
[36:46.800 --> 36:56.800]  We also have methylcobalamin, we call it secret 12, the highest quality, organic, absorbable vitamin B12 that you take under the tongue every day.
[36:56.800 --> 36:58.800]  It tastes delicious as well.
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.800]  This is such a game changer, natural energy, stamina, clarity.
[37:02.800 --> 37:04.800]  Vitamin B12 is magic.
[37:04.800 --> 37:08.800]  That's why so many medical doctors basically inject the same formula, but don't inject this.
[37:08.800 --> 37:10.800]  This is from the tongue.
[37:10.800 --> 37:14.800]  Injectable is more absorbable, but normal pills and stuff you barely absorb.
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.800]  The gut doesn't really absorb this.
[37:15.800 --> 37:18.800]  It's under the tongue in the mouth.
[37:18.800 --> 37:21.800]  So this is as best as you're going to get without going to the doctor and getting injections.
[37:21.800 --> 37:24.800]  And I'll tell you, MD's got something even better.
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.800]  Okay, just to be honest with you, but this is as good as it gets without the injections.
[37:28.800 --> 37:38.800]  So secret 12, 20% off infowarslife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[37:38.800 --> 37:44.800]  But I really want to, before I get into more news, enlist the listeners.
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.800]  To realize that it's not just the fact that we're going to be covering the debate live tomorrow.
[37:48.800 --> 37:51.800]  It's not just that we have more viewers than CNN now.
[37:51.800 --> 37:52.800]  I mean, that's conservative.
[37:52.800 --> 37:53.800]  They're a joke.
[37:53.800 --> 37:55.800]  The other average show is like 200,000 viewers.
[37:55.800 --> 37:58.800]  Our average hour has about two, three million listeners.
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.800]  It's that the real power is you taking action.
[38:03.800 --> 38:10.800]  And if you get the link to infowars.com forward slash show where the live debate will be held tomorrow night.
[38:10.800 --> 38:13.800]  We're going to have a bunch of different video feeds of it.
[38:13.800 --> 38:14.800]  We're going to have our own video feed of it.
[38:14.800 --> 38:16.800]  We're going to have our live coverage of it.
[38:16.800 --> 38:17.800]  We're going to have a feed we're going to put out.
[38:17.800 --> 38:22.800]  It's a one camera shot with our reporters there that is just one camera on the stage.
[38:22.800 --> 38:23.800]  No interruptions.
[38:23.800 --> 38:24.800]  So there's no complaints.
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.800]  You're going to have a feed with no Alex Jones.
[38:26.800 --> 38:34.800]  You're going to have a feed with Alex Jones and have another feed that is our crew breaking in.
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.800]  So that's tomorrow night infowars.com forward slash show.
[38:38.800 --> 38:41.800]  But the real situation is this.
[38:41.800 --> 38:51.800]  We've covered events before like the 2012 election where we had 3.8 million viewers in 24 hours just on these video streams,
[38:51.800 --> 38:56.800]  not on our 180 plus affiliates on AM and FM and then a bunch of TV stations as well.
[38:56.800 --> 38:57.800]  It's over 300.
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.800]  We count all that not just shortwave or the satellites just on our streams.
[39:03.800 --> 39:07.800]  3.8 million connections.
[39:07.800 --> 39:13.800]  Now granted, some of that was the same folks coming back and recollecting, but whatever that is unbelievable.
[39:13.800 --> 39:15.800]  People would say, oh, whatever.
[39:15.800 --> 39:18.800]  I mean, you have videos every week that have four or five million views a piece.
[39:18.800 --> 39:20.800]  You know, you've got tens of millions of views a week now.
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.800]  I mean, why aren't you saying it's bigger than 3.8 million?
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.800]  Because the average CNN show has 200,000.
[39:27.800 --> 39:29.800]  This is a testament to liberty.
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.800]  Now popular it is.
[39:31.800 --> 39:34.800]  So I want tomorrow to break that 2012 record.
[39:34.800 --> 39:41.800]  I want to have 4 million people tune into our YouTube stream, our Facebook stream, our own stream.
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.800]  People say, why don't you just have your own stream?
[39:43.800 --> 39:45.800]  I don't know if it can handle it tomorrow.
[39:45.800 --> 39:46.800]  I don't know if my bank account can handle it.
[39:46.800 --> 39:49.800]  Do you understand what happens when 3, 4 million people tune into something?
[39:49.800 --> 39:51.800]  Even when you have the cheapest bandwidth around.
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.800]  I mean, I'm going to get like 100,000, $200,000 bills.
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.800]  And that's what I'm saying by the products, by the Hillary for President t-shirt.
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.800]  It's about to, you know, be part of history.
[40:02.800 --> 40:04.800]  It's a limited edition.
[40:04.800 --> 40:06.800]  The third edition is about to end and I've decided that's it.
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.800]  I'm going to move on to some new slogan.
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.800]  In fact, that's the new announcement I'll make tomorrow.
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.800]  Hillary for President, everybody copies it and it's viral everywhere.
[40:12.800 --> 40:14.800]  And on the top search terms last six months, great.
[40:14.800 --> 40:15.800]  We had our victory.
[40:15.800 --> 40:16.800]  We're going to move on.
[40:16.800 --> 40:18.800]  This is the last edition, version three.
[40:18.800 --> 40:20.800]  I've decided it's over.
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.800]  It might be Hillary for, you know, Mars or, you know, Hillary for, you know, Captain kangaroo.
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.800]  I don't know, but this is about to end.
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.800]  If you want it, it's historic.
[40:33.800 --> 40:35.800]  That does have a 4.7 review.
[40:35.800 --> 40:36.800]  Let's see if my eyeballs are right.
[40:36.800 --> 40:37.800]  Let's blow that up.
[40:37.800 --> 40:38.800]  This is across the room.
[40:38.800 --> 40:40.800]  Yeah, 4.7 review.
[40:40.800 --> 40:41.800]  Whole bunch of reviews.
[40:41.800 --> 40:47.800]  That's just on the third version info wars store.com info wars, live.com on the back.
[40:47.800 --> 40:50.800]  It says legalize freedom.
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.800]  So that's a limited edition that is about to enter into history info wars.com on the right hand shoulder.
[40:55.800 --> 40:59.800]  Now I said I'd get into polls, race rioting.
[40:59.800 --> 41:03.800]  We've already covered them trying to start a military crisis as they're October surprise.
[41:03.800 --> 41:05.800]  This is historic.
[41:05.800 --> 41:08.800]  When we come back, I'll get into all the latest polls, latest race rioting.
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.800]  Fox News Live says white cop killed Keith Lamont, Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[41:13.800 --> 41:17.800]  MSM pushes narrative that police may have planted gun on Keith Lamont.
[41:17.800 --> 41:20.800]  I mean, I've watched the video folks.
[41:20.800 --> 41:21.800]  Cops are a lot of things.
[41:21.800 --> 41:25.800]  There's some bad ones out there, but they're not actors with four cops, white and black,
[41:25.800 --> 41:26.800]  screaming, put a gun down.
[41:26.800 --> 41:28.800]  The guy's got a gun in multiple videos.
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.800]  And then now they say, oh, it's not visible in his wife's video from 50 yards away.
[41:33.800 --> 41:34.800]  I mean, give me a break.
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.800]  You think cops want to go shoot somebody, much less a black guy and lose their career.
[41:38.800 --> 41:39.800]  No, no.
[41:39.800 --> 41:43.800]  The evidence shows they slow roll and actually don't serve the communities and the crime rates
[41:43.800 --> 41:44.800]  and death rates have exploded.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.800]  That's what's really killing black lives.
[41:45.800 --> 41:47.800]  But can you criticize the cops for that?
[41:47.800 --> 41:50.800]  And I'm not in some cop butt kissing mode here.
[41:50.800 --> 41:53.800]  Outside sources are trying to bankrupt our country and cause a civil war.
[41:53.800 --> 41:54.800]  I stand against it.
[41:54.800 --> 41:55.800]  Period.
[41:55.800 --> 41:56.800]  It's no brainer.
[41:56.800 --> 41:58.800]  Mama didn't raise the fool.
[41:58.800 --> 41:59.800]  Let's play this clip though.
[41:59.800 --> 42:02.800]  The chairman joint chief saying, you want us to do a no fly in Syria?
[42:02.800 --> 42:03.800]  It means war with Russia.
[42:03.800 --> 42:04.800]  Here it is.
[42:04.800 --> 42:05.800]  We're Syria.
[42:05.800 --> 42:12.800]  What about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[42:12.800 --> 42:13.800]  All options.
[42:13.800 --> 42:15.800]  What do you think of that option, sir?
[42:15.800 --> 42:22.800]  Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war
[42:22.800 --> 42:26.800]  against Syria and Russia.
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.800]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.800]  Now, I don't want to say this guy's perfect, but the point is the generals have been holding this back.
[42:35.800 --> 42:38.800]  Usually they're the ones that want war until they're nuclear weapons.
[42:38.800 --> 42:39.800]  They get it.
[42:39.800 --> 42:40.800]  It's the end of their existence.
[42:40.800 --> 42:45.800]  They have to go to these Rhino Republicans who are even worse than Obama, quite frankly, and say, listen,
[42:45.800 --> 42:47.800]  if we bomb the Russians, they'll attack us.
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.800]  It means war, war three.
[42:49.800 --> 42:50.800]  You understand?
[42:50.800 --> 42:54.800]  And then the little fake conservatives go, oh, I do hear you now.
[42:54.800 --> 43:21.800]  Yeah, it means no more golf course, dumbass.
[43:21.800 --> 43:24.800]  He also tweeted, BLM is pathetic.
[43:24.800 --> 43:25.800]  Obama is pathetic.
[43:25.800 --> 43:28.800]  Everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals.
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.800]  Now he is just sharing his opinion, though I think the animal's common is what triggered people.
[43:33.800 --> 43:37.800]  But again, he's not allowed that opinion because he's white.
[43:37.800 --> 43:41.800]  You could actually read those tweets and they could come from a black person or a white person
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.800]  because there is no racism, just objective fact and opinion.
[43:45.800 --> 43:46.800]  Don't worry, though.
[43:46.800 --> 43:49.800]  The Seattle Mariners are very disappointed.
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.800]  This proves once again, you're either with the left or you're a racist.
[43:53.800 --> 43:54.800]  Shut up.
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.800]  Be sure to download the new app at infowars.com slash app.
[43:58.800 --> 44:00.800]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[44:00.800 --> 44:01.800]  It took you over a year to do it.
[44:01.800 --> 44:02.800]  Why is this so good?
[44:02.800 --> 44:08.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[44:08.800 --> 44:13.800]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[44:13.800 --> 44:19.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[44:19.800 --> 44:25.800]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[44:25.800 --> 44:27.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.800]  These are all parasites.
[44:29.800 --> 44:30.800]  Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[44:30.800 --> 44:31.800]  There's so many things that are in it.
[44:31.800 --> 44:32.800]  You have the neem in there.
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.800]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[44:35.800 --> 44:39.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[44:39.800 --> 44:42.800]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[44:42.800 --> 44:43.800]  It just came back in yesterday.
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.800]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[46:28.800 --> 46:33.800]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[46:50.800 --> 46:55.800]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[46:55.800 --> 47:02.800]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[47:02.800 --> 47:10.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.800]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:15.800 --> 47:20.800]  Imagine Congress going, Democrats and Republicans, can't we just bomb the Russians that were
[47:20.800 --> 47:23.800]  invited into a sovereign country to fight al-Qaeda?
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.800]  And the chairman goes, well, I've got a war with Russia.
[47:25.800 --> 47:27.800]  You want to do that?
[47:27.800 --> 47:31.800]  That's the level we've reached.
[47:31.800 --> 47:33.800]  That's how crazy this is.
[47:33.800 --> 47:37.800]  Meanwhile, we've got George Soros, this master criminal that has admittedly overthrown more
[47:37.800 --> 47:43.800]  than 30 countries, because he's got a rest war inside around the world who is financing
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.800]  with hundreds of millions of dollars with the Ford Foundation and others.
[47:46.800 --> 47:48.800]  That's not Ford vehicles, folks.
[47:48.800 --> 47:50.800]  I heard people say, we're going to boycott Ford.
[47:50.800 --> 47:51.800]  Ford's not part of that.
[47:51.800 --> 47:53.800]  The Ford family's not part of it.
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.800]  The foundation, their grandfather set up, got hijacked by leftist lawyers.
[47:57.800 --> 47:58.800]  It funds open borders.
[47:58.800 --> 47:59.800]  It's horrible.
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.800]  It wants to drive down wages.
[48:01.800 --> 48:03.800]  The opposite of what Ford wanted to do.
[48:03.800 --> 48:07.800]  They've got their own problems, but the Ford Foundation isn't Henry Ford.
[48:07.800 --> 48:08.800]  Let's just be clear.
[48:08.800 --> 48:11.800]  And I've studied it.
[48:11.800 --> 48:14.800]  They're funding race war because they want us fighting with each other while the big
[48:14.800 --> 48:15.800]  banks rob us.
[48:15.800 --> 48:17.800]  It's very simple.
[48:17.800 --> 48:19.800]  We've all got beefs with each other.
[48:19.800 --> 48:22.800]  There's some real issues there, but overall, the thing is contrived.
[48:22.800 --> 48:23.800]  It's artificial.
[48:23.800 --> 48:24.800]  It's admitted.
[48:24.800 --> 48:26.800]  We have George Soros' emails.
[48:26.800 --> 48:32.800]  But now MSNBC goes to a new low and claims that the black police officer with three
[48:32.800 --> 48:36.800]  other white cops called to a guy that was reportedly office medication.
[48:36.800 --> 48:42.800]  We now learn doing weird stuff scaring people with a criminal record had a gun in his hand.
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.800]  Well, it's not clear from one video.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  It's clear in some other videos.
[48:46.800 --> 48:50.800]  So MSNBC is saying, and the videos are up on info wars.com if you're a listener want
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.800]  to see it, that he made this up, that the cops just, that a black cop just wanted to kill
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.800]  a black guy so he could get sued and get indicted.
[48:58.800 --> 48:59.800]  Let me explain.
[48:59.800 --> 49:02.800]  The average cop does not want to go out and kill anybody.
[49:02.800 --> 49:04.800]  Okay, use your brain, folks.
[49:04.800 --> 49:05.800]  Do you want to kill somebody?
[49:05.800 --> 49:08.800]  Imagine the trouble you get in, even when you're doing it in the right?
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.800]  That's why nobody wants this job.
[49:10.800 --> 49:14.800]  Well, frankly, I got problems with a lot of police, but I mean, who wants the job, though?
[49:14.800 --> 49:16.800]  If you've got to ask yourself, would you do it?
[49:16.800 --> 49:17.800]  Have you ever called a cop?
[49:17.800 --> 49:19.800]  Then it gets very hypocritical, doesn't it?
[49:19.800 --> 49:20.800]  It does.
[49:20.800 --> 49:21.800]  I'm just being real here.
[49:21.800 --> 49:23.800]  It's like, I'm not going to blame the TSA.
[49:23.800 --> 49:26.800]  I blame myself for letting Congress pass all this crap.
[49:26.800 --> 49:29.800]  I used to shoot the TSA out all day, so I don't know, wait a minute.
[49:29.800 --> 49:30.800]  They didn't pass a lot of do it.
[49:30.800 --> 49:32.800]  I need to go after people that did that.
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.800]  It's not that what they're doing is okay.
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.800]  It's that we've got to go to the root of the situation, or idiots.
[49:38.800 --> 49:39.800]  Let's play this clip.
[49:39.800 --> 49:45.800]  MSNBC pushes narrative that police may have planted gun on Keith Lamont.
[49:45.800 --> 49:47.800]  We see on the ground around Lamar Scott.
[49:47.800 --> 49:49.800]  We're going to go ahead and play this next section for you.
[49:49.800 --> 49:50.800]  We'll slow it down.
[49:50.800 --> 49:51.800]  We'll zoom in at a point.
[49:51.800 --> 49:52.800]  Take a look.
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.800]  Yep.
[49:53.800 --> 49:58.800]  He better live.
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.800]  Looking at there, we have circled this item on the ground.
[50:03.800 --> 50:06.800]  And you see there, the item flicks out.
[50:06.800 --> 50:07.800]  There it is there.
[50:07.800 --> 50:08.800]  So there's one item on the ground.
[50:08.800 --> 50:10.800]  Let's go ahead and re-rack that if we can, guys.
[50:10.800 --> 50:17.800]  There's one item on the ground, and then you're going to see a flick of a second item that ends up being tossed on the ground.
[50:17.800 --> 50:22.800]  We are at this point simply not going to speculate about what those items may be.
[50:22.800 --> 50:24.800]  We have one more point of reference for you, Chris.
[50:24.800 --> 50:26.800]  And then I know there's going to be a lot here to talk about.
[50:26.800 --> 50:28.800]  We're going to go ahead and take a look here.
[50:28.800 --> 50:32.800]  The fifth clip of an officer who leans over.
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.800]  And what you're going to see, and again, this is that officer on the right with the red shirt, that black tactical black jacket.
[50:37.800 --> 50:39.800]  No, it comes from the guy at the cop on the hip-hop.
[50:39.800 --> 50:44.800]  It clearly, back that up unless I'm wrong, comes from the cop in the uniform throwing the gun away.
[50:44.800 --> 50:46.800]  Let's back that up.
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.800]  Look, regardless, if the cop's ended up playing this, fine, we'll expose it.
[50:49.800 --> 50:51.800]  But why would you do that?
[50:51.800 --> 50:54.800]  Unless it's part of some, I don't know, PR stage deal.
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.800]  But let's go to the next clip here.
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.800]  Here's where Mark Dice does a great job, one of our auxiliary reporters, breaking this down.
[51:00.800 --> 51:01.800]  Here it is.
[51:01.800 --> 51:08.800]  Now, countless liberal lunatics are claiming that police planted the gun on Keith Scott after footage has been released of the incident,
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.800]  which show police ordering him a dozen times to drop the gun.
[51:13.800 --> 51:24.800]  Let's have a look at this idiotic, insane claim where we can clearly see that what's put on the ground or dropped on the ground isn't a gun.
[51:24.800 --> 51:26.800]  It is a glove.
[51:26.800 --> 51:37.800]  The officer here is clearly putting a glove on, and as he pulls out his glove, you can see that one or two fall out of his pocket.
[51:37.800 --> 51:46.800]  Later on, he picks up the glove, and even if they were to think about planting a gun on him, they certainly wouldn't do it
[51:46.800 --> 51:56.800]  when there is a woman yelling and screaming at them 25 feet away where they know that they would be captured on video doing it.
[51:56.800 --> 52:07.800]  And even if a cop were to plant a gun on a suspect, getting another cop to go along with such an egregious crime would be almost impossible,
[52:07.800 --> 52:14.800]  let alone getting a half a dozen police officers to agree to committing the frame job.
[52:14.800 --> 52:15.800]  That's right.
[52:15.800 --> 52:17.800]  So I played doubles advocate saying, hey, is it a gun?
[52:17.800 --> 52:19.800]  It looks like it's coming from the left to the right.
[52:19.800 --> 52:23.800]  But then you look and slow mo, it's a gloves coming out of his pocket, the black cop.
[52:23.800 --> 52:28.800]  Let's go to this report, though, on Glenn Beck. This is important.
[52:28.800 --> 52:30.800]  Extremely important.
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.800]  Dealing with politics and where all this is going and what it means.
[52:33.800 --> 52:34.800]  Did you see it?
[52:34.800 --> 52:36.800]  It was historic this Friday.
[52:36.800 --> 52:41.800]  Senator Ted Cruz came out and endorsed Donald J. Trump against Hillary Clinton.
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.800]  Why is this so important?
[52:43.800 --> 52:51.800]  Because it shows that the arrogant Republican and Democratic establishments that are joined at the hip have been failing on every single front.
[52:51.800 --> 52:54.800]  They've been failing to start a race war with all of George Soros' money.
[52:54.800 --> 52:58.800]  They've been failing to deceive the public about Hillary Clinton's incredible illnesses.
[52:58.800 --> 53:07.800]  They have been failing to cover up the fact that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton literally created ISIS as a proxy army to take over the Middle East,
[53:07.800 --> 53:09.800]  part of their Arab Spring program.
[53:09.800 --> 53:14.800]  Everything they're doing, everything they're touching is blowing up in their face.
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.800]  And you've got Ted Cruz whose career is over.
[53:16.800 --> 53:18.800]  This guy's totally discredited.
[53:18.800 --> 53:20.800]  You talk about Benedict Arnold, the guy's a joke.
[53:20.800 --> 53:25.800]  But then we've got his counterpart, the Judas Iscariot of the so-called conservative movement.
[53:25.800 --> 53:26.800]  And that's Glenn Beck.
[53:26.800 --> 53:34.800]  He came out today and said, well, I can't believe that Ted Cruz did this and I'm going to go to the mountains.
[53:34.800 --> 53:38.800]  I'm going to just go away now for a while because I'm so incredibly upset.
[53:38.800 --> 53:40.800]  What a drama queen.
[53:40.800 --> 53:45.800]  This is the guy that implied Ron Paul supporters eight years ago were violent out of the clear blue sky.
[53:45.800 --> 53:52.800]  This is the guy that goes on liberal media to play the part of a conservative and then apologize and say that we're wrong.
[53:52.800 --> 53:59.800]  This is the guy that engages in all these incredible stunts and acts like he's some type of messianic leader.
[53:59.800 --> 54:01.800]  But I've got to give it to Glenn Beck.
[54:01.800 --> 54:09.800]  He's less opportunistic than Ted Cruz because Cruz now knows that despite all the dirty tricks against Trump,
[54:09.800 --> 54:16.800]  despite the fact that the Republican establishment didn't give him any money, despite the fact that the mainstream media blasted him with everything they've got,
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.800]  he's going to win the presidency.
[54:18.800 --> 54:20.800]  He's way ahead in polls across the board.
[54:20.800 --> 54:25.800]  So he's now panicking, trying to jump back to the side of the Patriots.
[54:25.800 --> 54:33.800]  And everybody should put basically a buoy or a marker on Ted Cruz to understand this guy is the slimiest of the slimy.
[54:33.800 --> 54:41.800]  Now over here, we've got Glenn Beck, whether he's been blackmailed or whatever it is that like a kamikaze will not give up and goes on all these
[54:41.800 --> 54:50.800]  Democrat shows like meet the press and face the nation and you name an MPR and basically says it's better to vote for Hillary or for anybody else other than Donald Trump.
[54:50.800 --> 55:01.800]  Again, the arrogance of this person, anyone with half a brain knows, including a lot of Democrats, that Hillary Clinton stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders and is a master criminal.
[55:01.800 --> 55:04.800]  So again, why is this historic?
[55:04.800 --> 55:18.800]  It is an absolute example of the arrogance of the power structure from the Democrats to the Republicans to the big mega banks from from from Goldman Sachs to General Electric to Apple to Google to Facebook to all the sensors to all these people.
[55:18.800 --> 55:26.800]  They think that they can sit there and dominate a populist movement in the United States when they can't even suppress one in the United Kingdom or Russia.
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.800]  The truth is nationalism and populism and people wanting to run their own lives is coming back.
[55:32.800 --> 55:39.800]  And the sleeping giant of Americana that was the wonder of the world is rising like a phoenix right now.
[55:39.800 --> 55:42.800]  The truth is Donald Trump is way ahead in every battleground state.
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.800]  He's way ahead across the nation, even in polls where they have more Democrats sampled than Republicans.
[55:48.800 --> 56:00.800]  The truth is the power structure is in a total panic and George Soros and the Ford Foundation and others have quadrupled down, giving hundreds of millions to Black Lives Matter and others to start race riots all across this country.
[56:00.800 --> 56:03.800]  But even that is blowing up in their face.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.800]  History is happening.
[56:05.800 --> 56:14.800]  Trump is only one manifestation of the populist tsunami that is gaining steam at hurricane force around the world.
[56:14.800 --> 56:21.800]  But those of us that do promote liberty have to understand that this is a sacred honor and a great charge that we've been given.
[56:21.800 --> 56:29.800]  And that once Trump gets into office, we have to fight even harder to ensure that this republic is restored.
[56:29.800 --> 56:35.800]  And infowars.com will continue to be on the front lines of this fight.
[56:35.800 --> 56:43.800]  I am so honored to be associated with other constitutionalists and conservatives and libertarians and patriots and nationalists of every race, color, and creed.
[56:43.800 --> 56:52.800]  I am so proud to be associated with the great folks at DrudgeReport.com and Matt Drudge and the great people at Breitbart.com under the leadership the last few years.
[56:52.800 --> 57:01.800]  It has done amazing things and WorldNet Daily and Daily Caller and everyone else because none of us are perfect, but we're not out to get the American people.
[57:01.800 --> 57:03.800]  And we believe in prosperity.
[57:03.800 --> 57:04.800]  We believe in freedom.
[57:04.800 --> 57:07.800]  And we are brothers and sisters in arms in this fight.
[57:07.800 --> 57:14.800]  And when we're done taking America back, we're going to take the rest of the world back in an initiative I launched 10 years ago.
[57:14.800 --> 57:17.800]  Operation 1776 worldwide.
[57:17.800 --> 57:19.800]  Not American colonialism.
[57:19.800 --> 57:29.800]  Not America taking over countries with armies, but America taking over the world with our original ideas of renaissance, the enlightenment, and freedom.
[57:29.800 --> 57:32.800]  We're on the march, the empire's home.
[57:32.800 --> 57:38.800]  Will America awaken? Will we take back control of our republic from the globalist?
[57:38.800 --> 57:41.800]  There's only 43 days until the general election.
[57:41.800 --> 57:43.800]  This is the InfoWare.
[57:43.800 --> 57:45.800]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[57:45.800 --> 57:48.800]  We've got Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Roger Stone and more.
[57:48.800 --> 57:50.800]  Secret 12, InfoWare's lives.
[57:50.800 --> 57:52.800]  Vitamin B12 formulation.
[57:52.800 --> 57:58.800]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[57:58.800 --> 58:05.800]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[58:05.800 --> 58:14.800]  InfoWare's life.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[58:14.800 --> 58:25.800]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.800]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[58:29.800 --> 58:31.800]  No needles, no injections.
[58:31.800 --> 58:33.800]  Don't take my word for it.
[58:33.800 --> 58:34.800]  Try it for yourself.
[58:34.800 --> 58:35.800]  Discover the secret.

[58:44.800 --> 58:45.800]  InfoWare's Life.
[58:45.800 --> 58:46.800]  Secret 12.
[58:46.800 --> 58:55.800]  InfoWare's is proud to announce the official InfoWare's Live app, available now for iPhone and Android.

[59:18.800 --> 59:21.800]  This is the first release, and it was completely built from the ground up.
[59:21.800 --> 59:25.800]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[59:25.800 --> 59:34.800]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[59:34.800 --> 59:39.800]  But InfoWare's Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[59:39.800 --> 59:47.800]  So download InfoWare's Live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon fed lives by the mainstream media.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.800]  It's the Alex Jones Show with yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:19.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.800]  I don't know why I do that. Nobody else does, but I just do stuff different.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.800]  Never know what I'm doing when I do it, but it always seems to work.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.800]  It's the mystery, isn't it?
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:42.800]  Now, I didn't grow up when I was a kid wanting to be a cop.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.800]  I didn't grow up worshiping police.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:54.800]  I grew up with family that were pretty highly educated and a lot of them that had been in different areas of the world and seen things that people hadn't seen.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.800]  They said, listen, government brings down the drugs.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:06.800]  The police department works for the feds. Here's how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.800]  But America still, compared to other countries, is a great place to live.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.800]  So I set out to try to reform the police and criticize the bad things they do.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  That's why I'm pretty much the perfect person to cover this because everybody knows I made four films and wrote books to cover in the police state.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:32.800]  There's a lot in some, you know, you got Anglophiles that worship English and Frankophiles that worship the French and Russophiles that worship the Russians.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.800]  And there's Japophiles that love the Japanese.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.800]  I just love freedom.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.800]  And I see the attempt to put all the sins of government and all the corruption of our elite on the police.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:56.800]  I'm like, the average cop's getting like $40,000 a year, has the highest rates of suicide, they're busting their ass, they got a crap job.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.800]  And I'm not buying into this whole thing.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.800]  Let me get the emails from Soros how they're planning a big civil war and the rest of it.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  Years after I told you it was a civil war, not that I'm a rocket scientist.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.800]  I've seen divided and conquer before in history.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.800]  But man, I got to tell you MSNBC has reached a level that I don't even know how to respond at this point.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.800]  I mean, I watched the footage, I tried to be realistic and I noticed it came from the right to the left.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.800]  And we blew the footage up and clearly it's three gloves falling out of the guy's pocket.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800]  The black cop that shot the black guy.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800]  God, God rest his soul.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.800]  Keith O'Mont Scott.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.800]  And then MSNBC, when I can figure it out, one of our contributors, Mark Dice, can figure it out.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  They know what's going on.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.800]  They think their viewers are dumb, but on their video, they don't really show it slow.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.800]  They say it slowed down, but it's barely slowed down.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.800]  You slow it down, it falls out of the cop's pocket.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800]  It's a damn glove.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.800]  And I'm just like, man, how do you get that evil where you sit there and try to frame people?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, it's not like it's some rogue cop framing somebody.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]  That's bad enough.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.800]  It's some giant media organization with thousands of employees doing this.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.800]  It just illustrates who we're dealing with.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  So let's go to the clip of Mark Dice breaking down the frame up and then the actual frame up.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]  Here it is.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.800]  Now, countless liberal lunatics are claiming that police planted the gun on Keith Scott
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:23.800]  after footage has been released of the incident, which show police ordering him a dozen times to drop the gun.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:31.800]  Let's have a look at this idiotic, insane claim where we can clearly see that what's put on the ground
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800]  or dropped on the ground isn't a gun.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.800]  It is a glove.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.800]  The officer here is clearly putting a glove on and as he pulls out his glove,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.800]  you can see that one or two fall out of his pocket.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  Later on, he picks up the glove and even if they were to think about planting a gun on him,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.800]  they certainly wouldn't do it when there is a woman yelling and screaming at them 25 feet away
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.800]  where they know that they would be captured on video doing it.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.800]  And even if a cop were to plant the gun on a suspect,
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.800]  getting another cop to go along with such an egregious crime would be almost impossible,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  let alone getting a half a dozen police officers to agree to committing the frame job.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  Mark Dice is always on fire and I love him.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.800]  We already played the clip. If you missed it, just tune in at FullWars.com.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.800]  MSNBC pushes narrative that police may have planted a gun on Keith Lamont-Scott.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.800]  Our country is being taken over by multinationals.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800]  We're having our whole future destroyed. Our job is to be overseas.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:49.800]  We've got weirdo-nazi collaborator George Soros funding a race war starting with attacking the police,
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.800]  which will only turn the police into a hit squad murder team.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.800]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. We do not want to do this with the police.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.800]  Dr. Grip, you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:14.800]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.800]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.800]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.800]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.800]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.800]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.800]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.800]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:20.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.800]  And Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign back in 2000 and again in 2015
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.800]  when he first announced, is our guest for the next 30 minutes.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.800]  And Leigh Ann McAdoo on this Sunday live edition will begin studio with her take on all this.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.800]  Roger will be joining us tomorrow night.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.800]  We're going to have coverage for an hour before.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.800]  We've licensed the feed to carry the full debate for an hour and a half
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800]  between Donald Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.800]  And then two hours of phone calls and clips and fact checking.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.800]  So four plus hours of analysis kicks off tomorrow night.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.800]  Seven o'clock central standard time.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.800]  So I'll do four hours tomorrow.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.800]  Then I'm going to come in and do four more hours because wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.800]  And also tomorrow morning, Roger doesn't know about this yet,
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.800]  but it ties into some news that's already here in front of us from Breitbart.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.800]  I want to get his take on a big breaking story we've got about Hillary
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.800]  and her war-bongering and working with Al Qaeda, ISIS Islamic State.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.800]  Breitbart's kind of got a smell of this early.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.800]  Hillary Clinton sponsored Secret of Air and Spring Program at the Stabilized Middle East.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.800]  So I'll get Roger's take on this once I can show him the article tomorrow.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:32.800]  It'll be up at 5 a.m. Central Standard Time when Paul Watson, who just finished his day,
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.800]  posted so much to cover, so much to break down.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.800]  Roger, I've got a stack of polls here showing Trump continuing to surge,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.800]  but then I've got mainstream articles about dead voters voting in Colorado where he's surging.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800]  We haven't talked in a few days.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.800]  I don't know what's front and center for you, the master of the dark art of telling the truth.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.800]  I'm a dark art. You're a master of dark art, so I guess I'm your minion.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.800]  What are we dealing with here, Dark Lord?
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:09.800]  We're conspiracy analysts is what we are, as Gore Vidal used to say.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.800]  Alex, I'm in New York City, kind of in the bunker,
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:20.800]  bearing some of the grassroots support for Donald Trump at this debate.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.800]  And I've got to tell you, I've been put in long hours.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:29.800]  If it was not for a brain force, I really, which really has given me
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.800]  an enormous amount of clarity and energy.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.800]  Now, you paid me to say that.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.800]  I didn't tell you I was going to say it's merely a fact.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.800]  Well, thank you. I saw you on the road at the RNC with big bottles of it.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800]  It is the best in tropics, the healthiest brain booster out there.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.800]  So thanks for the plug, Roger.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.800]  Well, I've been into alternative medicine, eastern based medicine for many years.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.800]  The Chinese, even the Egyptians knew more about the healing qualities of herbs
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.800]  and the importance of vitamins.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.800]  So I know they try to use it to make us sound like we're odd, but they're the ones.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.800]  Hey, hang that albatross around our necks. We love it.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.800]  Yeah, I agree. I'm feeling very confident going into this debate
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:21.800]  because the Donald Trump that I have known for 40 years is an instinctual fighter.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  In fact, I was reading he's not even doing pre the AP reports pre debate.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.800]  He is going to rise the occasion.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:34.800]  There are some inside his camp who have tried to press him into these mock debates
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.800]  where somebody plays Hillary and I would play themselves.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:50.800]  Now, Gerald Posner actually sent me an email offering to put on a size 16 pin suit
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.800]  and play Hillary if Trump wanted him.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800]  That's not Trump's style.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.800]  So you've been offered to play Hillary already.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:08.800]  Well, this gentleman volunteered the famous author of the book Case Closed,
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.800]  bolstered the war in commission and attorney, a Wiley debater.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.800]  He's wrong, of course, at least on that issue.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.800]  But Alex, I commend you his books on Saudi influence in the United States politics
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.800]  and the early dangers of al-Qaeda on which his books are on the money.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.800]  Boy, Trump sure destroyed Hillary when he said it was a bombing in New York
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.800]  and then it was a bombing in New York.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800]  And then for three days, she said it wasn't a bombing.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.800]  And then now we've got another Islamist attack out in Seattle.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.800]  It seems like the stars are lining up against Hillary.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.800]  Well, I think she carries a lot of baggage into the debate.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.800]  The point, of course, is that Trump is not going to do the formal kind of mock debating.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.800]  Nobody's going to play him, not Gerald Posner, not Laura Ingraham, not anybody.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.800]  He has his own way of preparing.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.800]  So, yes, people who ask me, is he preparing, yes, in his own way.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.800]  He's thinking. He's taking notes.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  Once in a while he asks people questions.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.800]  He doesn't tell you what he thinks of your answer.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.800]  He's got a wide cross-section of very smart friends.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  But at the end of the day, there's only one Trump advisor that matters.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800]  That's Donald Trump.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.800]  No one can put words in his mouth.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.800]  The idea of remembering a zinger.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.800]  He just doesn't work that way.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:36.800]  Now, Roger Ailes, who is, to my mind, one of the smartest guys ever in television,
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:44.800]  and who's a longtime friend of Donald, who has no formal capacity in the campaign,
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:52.800]  did, however, tell Donald advice that he gave Ronald Reagan the same advice I gave Ronald Reagan,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.800]  the same advice I would give Mr. Trump, but I don't like to divulge our personal conversations,
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.800]  that he should be thematic, stick to the big picture.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.800]  You don't need to know how many freighters are in our naval force
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:16.800]  or the name of every sub-chief of a tribe in Africa.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.800]  You just need to stick to the general themes.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.800]  You may remember when Reagan debated Mondale,
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.800]  and he was prepared for his debate by Dick Darman from Harvard,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  former Elliott Richardson raid aide, and Jim Baker.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.800]  They tried to cram Reagan's head with facts and figures and statistics.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.800]  Nancy Reagan later said they brutalized her husband.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.800]  It was the only debate in his long, political career that he lost.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:54.800]  So it is with Trump. He will win this debate his way.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.800]  Well, obviously, he's somebody that nobody would want to debate on his feet if he's himself.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.800]  What about Hillary, though? I mean, she can't be out in public more than 10, 15 minutes.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.800]  She's been missing for a week. She's with weird blue screens behind her, coughing and choking on TV.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.800]  When she does show up for a few minutes, her eyes are pointing different directions.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.800]  I'm not being mean. She looks like a cancer patient.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.800]  What is she going to do? I mean, I don't think, quite frankly, I don't think she could show up
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.800]  and do 90 minutes with no break.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.800]  Well, in negotiations, I can tell you, it was Trump who insisted on standing.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.800]  Her aides preferred to be seated.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.800]  It was Trump who insisted 90 minutes, no long bathroom breaks,
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.800]  no commercial interruptions.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.800]  So it really, Trump has gotten a format that I think is beneficial.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.800]  That's not his question. This is a godsend. How did this happen?
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.800]  Everything's been rigged against him. How suddenly do the gods of manna open up the sky
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.800]  and he gets exactly what makes sense?
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.800]  Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.800]  There's a woman on this moderating list who she doesn't have first debate,
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.800]  but I believe she has the last.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.800]  So they've got some knives and daggers and things hidden.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.800]  Bob attended this woman's wedding. She's a good friend of the court.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.800]  So I don't know who greeted these set of moderators.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.800]  I know that Donald Trump came out the other day and said, no moderators.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800]  Lincoln versus Douglas.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.800]  Exactly.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.800]  But still, it's a bigger challenge than that so-called, you know,
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.800]  commander in chief debate a few weeks ago that was just 30 minutes with her,
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.800]  30 minutes with him.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.800]  And which indisputably, she has some kind of earpiece.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.800]  Now, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.800]  However, she just told the FBI recently that she can't remember anything.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.800]  And she's got this black secret service agent jumping up saying,
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.800]  keep going. Just act calling. Everything's fine.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.800]  Right. So, you know, I've seen video of her falling off the back of the stage.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.800]  I mean, this, she is, she's doing practice.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.800]  Roger, we're about to go to break, but let me ask you this. In your gut,
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.800]  do you think she shows up and if she does,
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  does she have a coughing fit, or does she collapse?
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.800]  All right. When we can return.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.800]  Again, we want to plug the websites that carry both your books,
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.800]  the Clinton's War on Women, the Bushcrime Family, infowarstore.com.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  Can Hillary Clinton not mean this?
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.800]  Because quite frankly, I want this to happen tomorrow night.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.800]  I want Trump to destroy her.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.800]  This is a serial criminal. I just can't wait to see it.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.800]  I am absolutely questioning myself right now. You know, will she show up?
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]  I don't think she can.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.800]  I mean, she's been gone for a week if she does.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.800]  What are the bets?
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.800]  Coughing fit, 90%.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.800]  Falling down, 34%.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.800]  I mean, having to hang on the podium, but will that be her victimhood?
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.800]  In the new America, will it be if she like,
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.800]  craps her diapers, her adult diapers?
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.800]  Will that be read by the Democrats as the new tea leaves,
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  the new portend to worship?
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.800]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.800]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.800]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.800]  The same team based right here in America that brought you
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.800]  the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.800]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.800]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.800]  your coworkers, your family, your children,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.800]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.800]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.800]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.800]  The general public doesn't.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.800]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.800]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.800]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today

[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.800]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.800]  we use decades old scientific research
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.800]  that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.800]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market

[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.800]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.

[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.800]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.800]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.800]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.800]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential,
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.800]  in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:23.800]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.800]  This is the latest corporate crony capitalist in our entire free market
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.800]  that works with different forms of authoritarianism.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.800]  Our guest is going to be with us till 45 after the last segment.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.800]  We're going to have Purely to cover News and Liam McAdoo,
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.800]  but she's here riding shotgun with us right now through this segment and the next.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.800]  Pop it anytime, Liam.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.800]  We've got two more segments with Roger Stone.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.800]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., I'll be live on the air,
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.800]  and then we've got the coverage of the debate an hour before.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.800]  I'm actually licensing the debate, so I'll be carrying it live for an hour and a half,
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.800]  and then two hours after, so I want to invite Roger,
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.800]  who's obviously a busy guy, to pop in during or after the debate tomorrow.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.800]  But, Roger, I mean, I'm on the edge of my seat at a level I've never been before.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.800]  Obviously, you're the former head of the Trump campaign,
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  his friend for a long time, been advising, doing a great job,
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.800]  but I see the power structure in total panic,
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.800]  Ted Cruz being forced to endorse, the neocons basically falling,
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800]  the Republican establishment dying,
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.800]  and we've got inside videos on Info Wars of Democratic Party leaders saying,
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.800]  we like Trump, the Democrats we know all like Trump.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.800]  Talk about a landslide.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.800]  I don't want to be overconfident here, but it looks like that, as I said earlier,
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.800]  the stars are aligned against Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800]  Roger Stone.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:40.800]  Well, Alex, if you want evidence that Donald Trump is about to win,
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  merely look at the endorsement of him by Ted Cruz.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.800]  This guy is a weasel who knifed Donald Trump in the back of the Republican National Convention,
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:57.800]  Nelson Rockefeller style, but now he's figured out that there's an avalanche coming.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:05.800]  There's a tidal wave of reform coming as angry Americans storm the polls.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:10.800]  There is, in fact, I think a small but significant hidden vote
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.800]  in that it is not socially cool to be for Donald Trump.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.800]  On the other hand, anyone who's seen Hillary attempt to dance
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:24.800]  should realize that this is the least cool candidate of all time.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.800]  So the Republican establishment's panicking they're on the wrong side of history.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.800]  How do they counter strike? What do they do now?
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.800]  Well, I think they're kind of running out of options.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:41.800]  Trump's gains most recently in the polls, Alex, were largely Republicans coming home,
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:49.800]  meaning they are deserting their neocon leaders because the Republican establishment
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.800]  always pretends to be conservative.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.800]  Exactly. I shot a video yesterday that's gone viral that I say Ted Cruz,
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.800]  endorse of Trump, marks the end of Glenn Beck and the Republican establishment.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:07.800]  Well, in essence, yes, he's obviously trying to save his political career.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:12.800]  By the way, I am hopeful that former Governor Barry will choose to challenge
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.800]  the globalist Bush boy Ted Cruz, who's, as you know, Alex,
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  his campaign underwritten secretly by the Wall Street enormous suspicious loans
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800]  that he never reported.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.800]  Exactly. Let's be clear. We're not mad at him in a pissing contest.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.800]  He tried to defeat Trump. It's that he's a Judas Iscariot, a Benedict Arnold.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.800]  He was always a fake. We know he'll turn against us in the future.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.800]  That's why Cruz and Beck must be basically marked out here.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.800]  Yes. I mean, Ted Cruz is a whizzling.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.800]  His wife is in the Council on Foreign Relations. I rest my case. Let's move on.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.800]  Exactly. Goldman Sachs. But it shows a collapse in confidence for Hillary.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.800]  So what comes next?
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.800]  Well, as I have discussed, there are a number of options available to them.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.800]  The most obvious one is to steal this election.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.800]  Now, the Democrats try to dismiss this and they try to distract us into believing
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.800]  that voter fraud is the only issue and that that is non-existent.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.800]  Well, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.800]  It's widely practiced in the Democratic machines.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.800]  Fox News the other night had an excellent series on people who voted in two states
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.800]  in the same year. So it most certainly exists.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  But I'm more concerned, as you know, with vote rigging.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.800]  What Trump has said, these elections are rigged.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.800]  We have established by a Stanford study that shows it was done to Bernie Sanders
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.800]  that these machines are easily rigged for a desired result.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.800]  So that's the big problem. And we see Hillary in these weird,
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.800]  where she's actually a whole new person babbling saying,
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.800]  why are you not going to win 50 point? She seems to be melting down.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.800]  So I guess she's betting everything on election fraud.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.800]  Well, again, 45 days is an eternity in politics.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.800]  We certainly know the trajectory of this race.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.800]  Trump is gaining now two points down in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.800]  Extraordinary. This is their stronghold.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.800]  The Philadelphia machine, of course, is famous for election fraud
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.800]  and nonexistent and dead voters.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.800]  Here's a trivia question for you, Alex.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.800]  What state has more dead people on the state voter rolls than any other?
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.800]  Why it's the Keystone state?
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800]  This is Armageddon.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:47.800]  The reason Trump is dating here is because he has an appeal in western Pennsylvania
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.800]  that no Republican has ever had before.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.800]  That's right. They say he's either ahead or in a dead heat of three points behind in Pennsylvania
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  in a bunch of different polls. What does that mean?
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.800]  Well, essentially, there are white, patriotic, God-fearing,
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:10.800]  tax-paying Democrats who are most likely union members in western Pennsylvania.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.800]  It is a stronghold for the unions.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.800]  And these Americans are rejecting Hillary.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.800]  They voted for Obama. They voted for Hillary's husband.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.800]  But they are now voting for Donald Trump.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:31.800]  This, in a way, offsets the huge loss he's going to get in the city of Philadelphia.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.800]  He's going to come out of there 750,000 votes down, perhaps more.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.800]  The machine does his job.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:47.800]  The counties around Philadelphia, once reliably Republican, are now really purple.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  Well, what about the Google poll they admittedly did where she was 20-something points ahead,
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.800]  now she's only five points ahead? That's what really panicked her.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.800]  In two days after that, she went to D.C. to give a speech.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.800]  I mean, if she can't win D.C., my God.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.800]  Yeah, look, she's drunk now ahead in Ohio.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:10.800]  Despite the fact that the K-6 machine in the state Republicans are doing everything
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.800]  humanly possible to undermine the campaign.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.800]  Sure, so what about the chairman of the Joint Chiefs saying in Congress yesterday,
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.800]  or Friday, two days ago, he's been ordered to attack Russia,
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.800]  and he doesn't think it's a good idea.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.800]  I mean, he's been ordered by Obama to start World War III.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]  I played the clip earlier.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]  I mean, I can't believe I'm reading these headlines.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  I played the clip. I mean, it seems like what will they pull?
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.800]  A war? An economic collapse? A race war?
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.800]  Wait a minute. Hold on, isn't it?
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  Trump who's in bed with the Russians, this line of attack needs to be addressed.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.800]  Diane Feinstein, a tired old Democratic hat who's been in the Senate a long time,
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:56.800]  and whose husband has made millions in sweetheart, federal, questionable deals,
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:04.800]  looking for an investigation into Trump's business affairs in Russia or with Russians,
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.800]  of which he has none. Big headline.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.800]  Sure, but meanwhile, Obama is ordering an attack on Russian forces.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.800]  This is mainstream news.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.800]  Yeah, I mean, it just shows you how brave and disingenuous it is.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  Yeah, they can't win an election.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.800]  Here's where they're gonna start World War III, arrest these people.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  I think that they will do just about anything they can get away with.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.800]  So that's my question. We're going to break and coming back with you in closing.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  What are they gonna pull?
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  Roger Stone, you know, the consummate political insider.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  Not the insider like he's an establishment, but the guy that knows what's going on.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800]  Roger always gives us what he really thinks.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.800]  You know, for over a year, he's saying Trump's behind.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.800]  Oh my God, I'm so worried.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800]  Now he says Trump's way ahead, which is clearly he is.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.800]  What do they pull? I mean, they're trying to start wars,
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.800]  economic collapse, race riots, George Soros, hundreds of millions to start race riots.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.800]  Roger Stone will ask you with Liam McAdoo.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.800]  Try to head on all the shows.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.800]  The White House confirmed this week that President Obama will veto any legislation
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:08.800]  that allows the families of the victims of 9-11 to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.800]  As one Texas representative points out, Lewis Gomart,
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.800]  it shows where the president's loyalty truly lies.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.800]  He's standing with the kingdom and not with U.S. citizens.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  The veto announcement will arguably lay the groundwork for a showdown with Obama and Congress
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.800]  as this bill has bipartisan support on the Hill
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.800]  and gained final approval today in the House.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:35.800]  The 28 pages of the heavily redacted 9-11 commission report implicate Saudi Arabia.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.800]  Both clandestine and government complicity occurred in 2001
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:44.800]  in the attack that killed thousands of Americans in New York, D.C. and Pennsylvania.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.800]  The president's participation in blocking justice for these families reflects how he truly feels,
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.800]  despite speeches and fancy toast, honoring those that died that day.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:15.800]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.800]  Let's talk about the vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.800]  and aiding in the body's natural processes,
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.800]  but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:05.800]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.800]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:14.800]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.800]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.800]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.800]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.800]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.800]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.800]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.800]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:47.800]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.800]  infowarsleif.com and the profit we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the New World Order.

[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:21.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.800]  All right. Leigh Ann McAdoo is here. One of our great reporters.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  She'll be co-hosting with myself tomorrow night during the pre-debate, debate and after-debate.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.800]  Confidant will be joining us in the post-debate after 9.30 Central, 10.30 Eastern.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.800]  But Leigh Ann, it's funny. You were wanting to bring up a subject when you called me yesterday
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.800]  and said, hey, I want to come on the show Sunday, which you're always welcome to do.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.800]  I always say, come on when you want to come on. You want to bring up Jennifer Flowers
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.800]  and the genius of Trump coming out and saying, oh, you want to bring Mark Cuban to put in the front stage?
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.800]  I'll bring somebody that he settled a sex case with, Jennifer Flowers.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.800]  So it's funny. Then Stone during the break wants to bring this up.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.800]  So you're on the same page. You go ahead and lead this interview with Roger Stone.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.800]  Right. And now even, of course, as the media coming out today saying, well, now the Trump camp is back peddling.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.800]  They're not going to have Jennifer Flowers. She's not there. He tweeted, perhaps I'll have her in the front row.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.800]  She says she wants to come.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.800]  She said right away. She's like, I'll be there. I would love to be your VIP guest.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.800]  Better look at the Mark Cuban.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.800]  What I thought was so genius about it, and this is just the genius of how Trump can control the media
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.800]  and control the narrative, is even if she never does show up to become his guest,
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.800]  they're forced the media to have to report on just who Jennifer Flowers is.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:44.800]  Because there's so many young people under 30 who have no idea who Jennifer Flowers is.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  They don't believe all the stories about Bill Clinton or, you know, what, what people have been bringing up.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.800]  So, and they're one of the largest voting blocks now.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:55.800]  They don't know about what a predator to this guy is, or I stole the Haitian money.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:56.800]  Roger Stone.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.800]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800]  This is exactly right.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:05.800]  First of all, the prelude to a debate is somewhat like the prelude to a prize fight.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:10.800]  You're supposed to psych out and taunt your opponent.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.800]  This is the genius of Trump.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.800]  He didn't say he was inviting her.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.800]  He said, perhaps he was inviting her.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  Now, the Clinton campaign said they were inviting Mark Cuban,
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:29.800]  a man who made all of his money in a Federal Reserve created boom
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.800]  in which most Americans lost billions.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.800]  So, I imagine that Mr. Cuban wants Hillary's loose fed policies
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.800]  so he can continue to be a pirate.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  He sold his company to Yahoo for a year.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.800]  How pathetic is he?
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.800]  One was going to the campaign to be a VP a year ago, now butthurt.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.800]  I mean, is he really just lusting every Donald Trump?
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.800]  Is this kind of a latent gay worship thing?
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.800]  Look, he and Trump have had a, have not been close friends,
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.800]  but he went from mildly kind of saying,
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:06.800]  well, you got to give the guy credit to now being the attack dog.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.800]  He's a spurned, he's a spurned latent, and it's not the wrong being gay.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:13.800]  Well, yeah, because didn't Mark Cuban open up his stadium to him at the last minute
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.800]  for his huge crowds that Trump had in the last minute?
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800]  So, Cuban's got a crush on him and a spurned.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.800]  This poor bastard goes out and defends the Clinton Foundation.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.800]  They push him out to say, oh no, it's a great charity.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.800]  It was like that jackass, James Carville.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.800]  People will die if they go out of business.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.800]  No, people have already died because they're in business.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:42.800]  Black lives matter unless you live in Haiti, unless you live in Libya
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.800]  or any place else that the Clintons wish to.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.800]  Well, they only gave 5.7% of the money they gave.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.800]  Right, they only wanted to get in there because they wanted to steal the resources.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.800]  Absolutely.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:58.800]  What's interesting here, and I can tell you this, is that immediately after Trump hosted this,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.800]  Dolly Kyle contacted me, someone who had spoken to Juanita Broderick,
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:11.800]  contacted me, Paula Jones representative contacted me,
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.800]  and they were all willing to come to the debate
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:20.800]  or do anything else to let people know on behalf of Donald Trump
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.800]  the way Hillary Clinton has led the attack on women.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.800]  Bill Clinton is a sexual predator who has abused women.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.800]  This is about violence against women.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.800]  Hillary has covered it up, and therefore she is complicit in it.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.800]  And these women are all more credible than Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.800]  Right.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.800]  Now, you know what I'm curious about, Mr. Stone?
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  What do you think about the fact that Fox News had an article up yesterday talking about Bill Clinton
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.800]  being on Epstein's plane, and they actually released the plane log there
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800]  showing how many times Bill Clinton-
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800]  Was it the Pito plane?
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800]  Yes.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.800]  After Orgy Island.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  The admitted child rape plane?
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.800]  After Orgy Island.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800]  Like how-
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.800]  Why is Clinton on the pedophile plane?
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.800]  Now all of a sudden they're reporting on it.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.800]  First of all, with all due respect to the New York Times,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.800]  Nick Bryant wrote this story for Gawker.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.800]  He had it all.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:19.800]  There's not a morsel of news in the time story today that doesn't tell us what Bryant already
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.800]  told.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.800]  He is not a conservative, not a Republican, and one of the greatest investigative reporters
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.800]  living today.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.800]  No, you're right.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.800]  Gawker did bring it.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  So, and Mr. Epstein gave money to Clinton Foundation.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:40.800]  It has not only never been returned, but it seriously disappeared from their voluntary
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  website.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.800]  No.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:49.800]  You know, and we know that Clinton visited the hedonistic Orgy Island that Epstein-
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.800]  So what does this mean?
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]  He's blackmailed?
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.800]  He's compromised?
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.800]  Well, it's very hard to say.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.800]  The rumor has always been that Epstein, a billionaire hedge fund manager, finding it
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.800]  to a genius, had video of Bill.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.800]  Anything is possible in this murky world.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:13.800]  We do know that he was given a slap on the wrist by both Democrats in Florida and the
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.800]  Republicans in Washington.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.800]  All right, Stone, let me ask you this, because you're going to be homeless tomorrow night.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.800]  StoneCulture.com, carry both your books in 4store.com, and your Bill Clinton rape shirt, so important
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.800]  to wear that.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.800]  I suppose it's happening.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.680]  What else is on your radar?
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.680]  What else are you looking for?
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.680]  What else are you concerned about?
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.800]  Then lean and jump in with what else you're concerned about?
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:45.560]  Well, you have the entire question of the decree consent that the Republicans foolishly
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:53.560]  signed in 1982, which essentially prevents many of the staff to steal activities that
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:40:00.360]  we have been looking at potentially leading the way to an enormous legal battle.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.720]  If the polls are unattended, only the watchers for the federal government and the watchers
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.560]  for the Democratic Party are watching the polls.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560]  And how naked is that?
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.560]  First, we bring it up.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.560]  Trump brings it up.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.560]  It doesn't exist.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.560]  First of all, we got to have the UN come in and the Justice Department run everything.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560]  And that's pretty clear.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.560]  What a joke.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.560]  Yes.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.760]  I think that's, it is one of the dangers.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:29.560]  I have said many times on the show, and I repeat it, that I fear for Trump's physical
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.560]  safety.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.160]  It's not something I want to belabor, but it is, he is leading a revolution, and he
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]  is threatening.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160]  Sure.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.720]  So election fraud, Trump assassination, big war, October surprise.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.000]  What about a fake attempt at assassination on Hillary?
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.400]  You know, the globalists will do anything.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.560]  They killed John Kennedy.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:41:00.560]  They infiltrated the Watergate burglary teams to botch the mission and bring Nixon down.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.360]  They lied about healthcare.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.000]  They have lied about war in Libya.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.080]  So the sky's the limit.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.840]  The next 47 days is an epic town to be alive.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  Omar Gaddafi had agreed to abdicate and had given, in three different negotiations, everything
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.160]  Hillary State Department wanted, everything.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.920]  We still spent a billion dollars bombing that country, killing black people, and deposing
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:28.760]  a guy who was sharing his intelligence with us, who had renounced his...
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.760]  Well said.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.760]  Well said.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:33.760]  You're back with us tomorrow after the debate at 10.30 Eastern, 9.30 Central, Lee, and final
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.760]  comment.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.680]  We're going to come back with you after Roger Stone leaves us, but final question for him.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:41.560]  Well, we see there are already planning World War III behind the scenes.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.800]  This might be the October surprise that we're all going to get nuked before anyone gets
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.080]  into office.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.200]  Trump's already said he is running on diplomacy, not destruction.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.040]  Meanwhile, we know Hillary Clinton's just going to get in there.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.280]  And if she gets in, she's going to take out another player on the...
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.600]  So are you saying what is the October surprise or what?
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's like, what is Trump's plan?
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.360]  Roger, what is the October surprise or how will Trump counter this?
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:11.920]  If I reveal surprises that could come in October, I would be telegraphing punches.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.680]  This is going to be a very close, very hard fought campaign.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:22.000]  Well, you got some gigantic juices that you promised to at least in near time, give us
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.200]  one of the explosives, others the explosives, but we're going to have some explosives right
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.200]  here, right?
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.200]  Your tablets.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.760]  Well, I think that's a high probability.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.880]  There's a lot to play out yet.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.320]  The WikiLeaks are going to be significant.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.760]  The debates are going to be significant.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.480]  It's one hell of a time to be alive and if you go to thestoneculture.com, you'll find
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480]  it all.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.800]  Roger Stone will talk to you tomorrow night, 10.30 Eastern, 9.30 Central during the post-debate
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.800]  coverage.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.800]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  It could be here.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.800]  Yeah, good to be here.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.120]  This is a hell of a time to be alive and in FullWars.com, and believe it, we are the
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  tip of the spear.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  That ain't high.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120]  We are it, baby.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  Leigh Ann's coming up.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.320]  Listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.280]  of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.240]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.840]  at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.680]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.760]  AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.120]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.880]  the products that you need each month.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.320]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.600]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.920]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.280]  this is a sure win.
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.880]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.280]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:58.120]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.600]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.440]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:09.120]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.200]  care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.800]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.080]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:24.200]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.920]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:30.880]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.440]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting

[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:05.760]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, Secret 12 X2 Supermale Brain Force Prostagart Silver
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.760]  Bullet.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.760]  I use them all.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.760]  They're phenomenal.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760]  They work.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760]  Buy them, folks.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:11.760]  Thank you, brother.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.760]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.760]  products.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:19.760]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.040]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWars
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.040]  at the same time.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.040]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.040]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinotin.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.720]  Why, God, let me ask you a question.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.720]  Have they worked for you?
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.640]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  What products are you taking?
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640]  Are you taking?
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:43.080]  Everything from Supermale to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:48.720]  Even got a little DNA force, so I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:53.720]  That's infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.720]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.440]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.840]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.600]  Why is this so good?
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.200]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.880]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.880]  my system.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:20.880]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.920]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.280]  going on everywhere.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.280]  These are all parasites.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.240]  You have the neem in there.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.320]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:40.600]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.600]  All right.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.800]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.680]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.600]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.880]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.120]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:03.440]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:14.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:24.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commencement and the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240]  You know what's great?
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.240]  That's so hot.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.240]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.240]  All through.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.240]  All we do.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.520]  Culture is your listening.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:35.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.520]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.520]  We are the demons.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.520]  We'll give you everything you need.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.520]  Hold on to the good times.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520]  All right, Liam.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.520]  We've got 10 minutes left.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.240]  We didn't take calls that we will tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. the weekday show.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.040]  Huge coverage, 7 o'clock Central, past 10 o'clock of the live debate.
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.320]  Huge tomorrow, infowars.com, forward slash show.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:04.640]  Get your friends and family and neighbors with that link to tune in infowars.com, forward
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640]  slash show.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.600]  This is a battle against mainstream media.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.400]  It's a battle for hearts and minds.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400]  It's an info war.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.400]  Liam, take over.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.640]  I am really excited about tomorrow night's coverage.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.080]  I know I'm just going to be one of the millions, tens of millions of people out there that
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.960]  are watching this debate and cannot wait with baited breath.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.760]  We're all sitting and of course, when the the announcement that Trump said, perhaps
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.680]  I'll bring Jennifer Flowers in and have her sit on the front row.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.200]  I just was like, oh my gosh, grab the popcorn.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.040]  It just got real ringside seats to this show.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.440]  It just got gangster.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  Yeah.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.800]  I mean, Trump does not care, but you know, they would really don't have enough room in
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:49.480]  the audience for all of the women who are Bill Clinton's alleged sexual victims.
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.200]  So yeah, but, but truly it was, it was interesting being able to talk to young people.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.800]  There was a young girl, I was out and trying to explain to her who this woman was and she
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800]  had no idea.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.760]  And that's what's so key about how Trump could play the media like that and force them to
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.960]  have to talk about who Jennifer Flowers was like back to the future.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.760]  Young people are a massive voting block now.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:14.880]  And they have no idea about who the Clintons really are.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.960]  So I think that was pretty awesome.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:25.360]  But one thing that concerns me is regardless of who wins this election, we have wars on
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.080]  all fronts right now, not only World War III as the Pentagon is demanding a no-fly zone
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.800]  for Russia over Syria, which you sent me the video yesterday with General Dunford basically
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:38.040]  saying I'm not going to call for a no-fly zone.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:39.360]  He said this means war with Russia.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.640]  This means we're going to war with not only Russia, but also Syria.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:49.840]  And not only that, but it wasn't at the U.S. that was making those accidental air strikes.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.600]  So why are they the only ones that are allowed to fly?
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.600]  So they can take out.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:56.280]  No generals don't want to do this, but it's our own elite that are doing it, they're
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]  disconnected.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.280]  I can't believe it.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.480]  She can't show up for 20 minutes of speech for months.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.680]  How's she going to debate Donald Trump commercial free for 90 minutes?
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.360]  I mean, I don't want to be proven wrong, but my gut tells me she can't show, or maybe
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:09.360]  she can't.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.680]  I mean, what's going to happen?
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:17.240]  Okay, well, let's not put it past the rich and super powerful, the type of life extension
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.520]  technology they're going to be pumping into this woman.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  Baby blood transfusions.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.520]  Totally.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.020]  She's taken the last six days off.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:24.020]  19 babies.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.020]  Whole sacrifice.
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.020]  Yeah.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:27.020]  Like she's going to be.
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:28.020]  We're being sarcastic.
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:29.020]  Blu.
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:30.020]  Blu.
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:31.020]  Blu.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.020]  Blu.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:33.020]  Blu.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.020]  Blu.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.020]  Blu.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.020]  Blu.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.020]  Blu.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:38.020]  Blu.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.020]  Blu.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.020]  Blu.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.020]  Blu.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.020]  Blu.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.020]  Blu.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:44.020]  Blu.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.020]  Blu.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.020]  Blu.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.020]  Blu.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.020]  Blu.
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.020]  Blu.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.020]  Blu.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.020]  Blu.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.020]  Blu.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.020]  Blu.
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:54.020]  Blu.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:55.020]  Blu.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:56.020]  Blu.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.020]  Blu.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:58.020]  Blu.
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.020]  Blu.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.020]  Blu.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.020]  Blu.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:02.020]  Blu.
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:03.020]  Blu.
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.020]  Blu.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:05.020]  Blu.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.020]  Blu.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.020]  Blu.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.020]  Blu.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.020]  Blu.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.020]  Blu.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.020]  Blu.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:11.860]  Blu.
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:12.860]  Blu.
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:13.860]  Blu.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:14.860]  Blu.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.860]  Blu.
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:16.780]  Blu.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:17.780]  Blu.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:18.780]  Blu.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.780]  Blu.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:20.780]  Blu.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:21.780]  Blu.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.400]  everything that's thrown his way and then it just makes him more powerful like the whole
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.400]  Pepe debacle.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.680]  I didn't know that frogs were racist, but I didn't see one at the park the other day.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.800]  They were all racist from frog and I.
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:40.280]  Racist, riveting, but I think that what Hillary Clinton is going to try and do is lob these
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  bombs at Trump to throw him off his game because he's, I think he's going to go in there and
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.680]  try to, you know, appear presidential and she's going to try to piss him off.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.380]  She's going to try and throw him off and make him react in some way so that she can then
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:55.880]  for the next week with the news, they can say he's unfit to be president.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.780]  He, that's not presidential at all.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:59.420]  Oh my goodness.
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:03.180]  Just like they were when he said something about Jennifer Flowers, they were like, I
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.180]  have some class.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:05.180]  I agree.
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:10.340]  But I mean, at your gut level, no one knows special drugs resting a week.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:14.820]  Does she arrogantly try to make it because she gave a speech Monday and was like 10 minutes
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:18.600]  and she was coughing and she went on stage and then her eyes are pointing different
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.580]  directions with these green screens, these short things she does.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.580]  I mean, how does she go up against Trump for 90 minutes?
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:26.220]  I don't see her showing up, Leigh Ann.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.220]  I don't know.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.960]  You know, we don't just say she's sick and the Secret Service told us she has convulsions
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.780]  every 15 minutes unless she's on a bunch of drugs.
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:34.900]  And then she's so drugged up.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.740]  She looks like she's, you know, Mr. Sleepy else.
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:38.740]  Right.
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:44.020]  And that's the thing is like people, people forget that before she even admitted to having
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:48.180]  pneumonia, she was taking days off from the campaign trail.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:51.180]  She was already taking days of rest.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.180]  It's not just all of a sudden.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.180]  So what's your gut tell you?
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.180]  Does she show up?
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.180]  I think she's arrogant.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:57.660]  I think she shows up and then has coughing fits.
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:00.780]  Remember one debate she had 10 minutes in the bathroom.
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.940]  I know she could, she couldn't come back on time.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.780]  What if Trump lovingly changed her diaper?
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.460]  I hate to make predictions like that, but I've got to tell you, I kind of got a little
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.100]  excited last week and like some goosebumps because I was like, man, she's going to cough.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.700]  The way they had a dream over a month ago where she was in a debate with Trump and falls
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:22.260]  over during it and like hits her head.
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:23.940]  But Trump says something mean and she doesn't.
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.940]  So it's his fault.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:25.940]  Oh, of course.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:26.940]  So she wins the election.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:31.180]  How dare he attack her and throw those accusations that she caused her to faint.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:34.700]  But that's the thing is like with everything that's propping this woman up, all of the
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:39.020]  media outlets out there, all the newspapers, all of the establishment, every single thing
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:44.020]  that she's got working for her, it's her health and her dark heart.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.100]  What do you think is going on with her?
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:50.380]  She does look progressively worse than I actually, as a fellow human, feel sorry for at least
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.380]  that body.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:52.380]  You know, I have empathy.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:53.380]  I mean, I don't like her seeing her.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:54.380]  It's not nice.
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:55.380]  What do you think is going on with her?
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.300]  Well, she should just be, you know, now she's your sweet little grandma.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:03.700]  Honestly, Alex, I think people, you embody that cancer.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:07.340]  You can only hide it for so long or treat yourself with these life extension technologies
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:12.860]  for so long, but if you're truly an evil person and you're bad continuously for decades lying
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:17.060]  to people, that starts to fester inside of your body like a cancer.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:19.700]  So Hillary's cancer has come home, whether it's spiritual or physical.
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:20.700]  I agree.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:21.700]  That's what I think.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:22.700]  That's truly right.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.460]  I mean, I'm kind of saying what you're saying, so what does your gut tell you?
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:30.220]  Because it's, I mean, for me, I keep saying emblematic, but it really is a symbol of the
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:33.060]  corrupt, disconnected elite that they think they could run.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.300]  Hillary, who was having brain surgery reportedly four years ago.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:38.860]  I mean, why do they think we're so stupid?
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:43.300]  Well, that's what Matt Drudge said is that they think the American people are so stupid
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.140]  that they could literally have Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar.
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:51.460]  Lo and behold, a year later, it might just be Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar that's
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.460]  up there debating jobs.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.660]  I might vote for your brain in a jar, but not Hillary's.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:59.020]  Oh man, but can you imagine her body's not going to make it?
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.020]  That's, and that's a thing.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:03.740]  It's like, you got to read that fine print when you make those deals with the devil.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:04.900]  You know?
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.260]  Well Hillary is somebody that always smacks her lips about death and she goes out of her
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:09.740]  way to kill Christians and others.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.740]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.100]  I mean, we get the whole spirit world.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.980]  She's a very wicked person.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.060]  I agree.
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:19.580]  And that's the thing that's so frightening about it is that with this propping up whoever
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.020]  gets in, they're going to have to be dealing with the whole mess.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:26.420]  So we got Syria, the World War III that they're working on.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:29.580]  And then we have here in our own country, civil unrest.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:32.900]  I mean, look at the state of the country that we're in and how they've had to, in order
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.940]  to make it not a class war, because all the elite are, you know, getting all their bunkers
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.940]  and stuff ready.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:39.420]  They don't want the class war just yet.
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:43.900]  So they have to have the race war to continue propping up this failed system for a little
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:44.900]  while longer.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:45.900]  That's right.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:50.020]  Race war is before the class war, because we don't want all the rich rappers and stuff
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.020]  getting looted.
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:54.340]  It's so sad because I don't want to fight anybody.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:55.340]  I don't want to be racist.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:56:00.260]  I don't want to be brace-based, but it's so naked when a black cop's pulling gloves out
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:01.260]  of his pocket.
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:03.060]  He's dropping guns on some guy.
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:10.500]  Or how programmed your mind has to be that your brother gets shot by a black police officer.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.140]  And yet you look at the camera and you say, white cops are the devil, white people are
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:15.140]  the devil.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.460]  And it's like, dude, your brother was killed by a black cop.
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.740]  What is, you're that programmed that it's still white people's fault?
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:25.220]  Like we're just, it's just so racially charged.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.220]  Lee Ann, I'm excited.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:30.500]  You'll be here with us tomorrow kicking off at seven o'clock central with an hour of
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.020]  live coverage before we'll have the debate with limited comment.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:37.020]  We're going to just stream it in four wars.com, four slash show listeners, viewers, spread
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:38.940]  that link, defeat the mainstream media.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.940]  We the biggest audience out there.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:40.940]  We probably will.
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:41.940]  It's going to be huge.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:46.420]  And then we're going to continue on after with live analysis and it's going to be huge.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:47.900]  Cross your fingers though.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:48.900]  Does Hillary show up?
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.900]  Is she arrogant enough?
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:50.900]  I say 50 50.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:51.900]  Lee Ann, what do you say?
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.420]  I say she's going to show up, but I agree.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:55.860]  I think she's going to have a coughing fit.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:57.140]  I think she's arrogant enough.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:00.820]  I think she's going to show up and on drugs though.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:01.820]  She's going to be whacked.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:02.820]  She's going to be whacked.
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  So they were like, why ain't I 50 point ahead?
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.820]  I'm like, I'm ready to debate.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:07.820]  Who got these TVs?
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.820]  Bitch.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:09.820]  Tell me that.
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:14.820]  I mean, she is just like, you know, why am I 50 points?
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:15.820]  All right.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:16.820]  Lee Ann.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:17.820]  Great job.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:18.820]  Great job.
