[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:22.200]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.200 --> 00:28.040]  jade helm continues into september I haven't really covered it like I should
[00:28.040 --> 00:32.800]  there have been some new developments that's coming up today we're gonna get
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.880]  into an earthquake hitting in the middle of colorado and they're saying the big
[00:36.880 --> 00:41.280]  one in san francisco can be right around the corner in the telegraph there's a
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.040]  lot of geopolitical news and more today but first Paul Watson reports on some of
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.280]  the giant distractions that are out there as they weaponize the media and
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.520]  try to absolutely confuse the population is prominent black lives matter
[00:56.520 --> 01:00.920]  activist and self-help guru Sean King the next Rachel Dolezal
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.600]  conservative news websites are buzz with claims that King who says he is biracial
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.880]  is actually white and has been lying about his ethnicity all along King
[01:10.880 --> 01:15.800]  claims he was terrorized at school for being mixed race but a 1995 police
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.000]  report identifies him as white police also dispute Kings claim that he was
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.840]  brutally beaten by rednecks in a racially motivated attack which King
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.800]  alleged was Kentucky's first hate crime records show the incident involved only
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.800]  one other person and that the injuries were minor a birth certificate obtained
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.680]  by Breitbart from the Kentucky office of vital statistics also names a white
[01:40.680 --> 01:46.360]  man as King's father blogger Vicky Payton covered this photo of King as a
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.920]  child which appears to show a Caucasian kid with ginger hair even Kings daily
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.000]  coast colleague Bert Miles wrote a blog in which he said he was very concerned
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.280]  about King and his motives key documents appear to show that King has two white
[02:02.280 --> 02:06.600]  parents and that he has been lying to the public about his race reports
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.520]  Breitbart whenever King is quizzed about these claims on Twitter he immediately
[02:11.520 --> 02:17.040]  goes on a blocking spree and refuses to address the issue King finally responded
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.320]  to the story earlier today on Twitter asserting that it was a white
[02:21.320 --> 02:27.320]  supremacist conspiracy theory and that it was quote bullshit although when asked
[02:27.320 --> 02:34.680]  directly over and over again whether he was white or biracial King only said
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.760]  that his family history was a mess and that he will never go public with his
[02:39.760 --> 02:45.680]  racial story so why does it matter whether Sean King is white or biracial
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.640]  because he's become a darling of the Black Lives Matter movement and the
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.920]  leftist media on the basis of a personal story that may have been completely
[02:55.920 --> 03:02.200]  contrived he's also closely affiliated with D Ray McKee sin who many see as the
[03:02.200 --> 03:07.560]  de facto leader of Black Lives Matter this would also cement the existence of
[03:07.560 --> 03:14.080]  black privilege just like Dole Joll King has exploited his assumed ethnicity to
[03:14.080 --> 03:21.280]  further himself possibly at the expense of other African Americans King cited
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.680]  his ethnicity in order to obtain a black only Oprah scholarship to Morehouse
[03:26.680 --> 03:34.400]  College could King have misled Oprah an African American icon we've also had
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.400]  months of brow beating telling us that gender is a choice and not a biological
[03:39.400 --> 03:45.400]  absolute gender is far more biologically rooted than race so now thousands of
[03:45.400 --> 03:50.480]  young Americans could claim they identify as black assert their black
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.560]  privilege and start demanding places at prestigious colleges as Alan Bakori
[03:56.560 --> 04:02.000]  notes King could be the latest example of individuals who cover the status of
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.600]  victimhood in order to achieve moral infallibility by pretending to be oppressed
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.600]  these professional victims can assert superior virtue in the public arena and
[04:14.600 --> 04:20.680]  enjoy the privileges of lavish unquestioning media coverage and a
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.440]  plentiful supply of educational and job opportunities meanwhile the genuinely
[04:26.440 --> 04:31.840]  oppressed continue to suffer without a voice so what do you think could this
[04:31.840 --> 04:37.800]  scandal lead to the fall of Black Lives Matter if it is indeed revealed and
[04:37.800 --> 04:44.440]  confirmed that Sean King is the next Rachel Dole Joll let me know what you

[10:17.840 --> 10:25.800]  detail US to preposition tanks artillery in Baltics in Eastern Europe the US
[10:25.800 --> 10:33.800]  Defense Secretary announced yesterday very big news because that's already
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.880]  happened but now they're admitting it huge escalation north and south Korea
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.440]  exchange artillery fire today it's happened about two hours ago that's out
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.120]  of Reuters as that situation escalates with the north promising to basically
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.440]  bombard and attack the south and they've done this before but that regime is on
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.320]  the edge of collapse many analysts believe this is exactly when you would
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.960]  see some type of psychotic behavior by the demonic spoiled third-generational
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.760]  communist that runs that
[11:05.840 --> 11:14.000]  dark-age country that's coming up I covered this story a week and a half
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.720]  ago when it broke but now I'm working on this with some other folks that have
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.680]  photos and videos that we're going to be obtaining in Texas and other states of
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.640]  similar activities special ops soldiers use rental trucks to infiltrate and
[11:28.640 --> 11:35.400]  occupy California town for some reason last week when I got back I this was I
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.360]  was jet lagged and I made a mistake so I want to correct that now I got it in my
[11:39.360 --> 11:47.400]  mind that Jade Helm was running from July to August 15th and then I thought
[11:47.400 --> 11:51.640]  about it later and checked and then I was also corrected by Nico it in
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.120]  September 15th and I knew that it's just sometimes I flip things around in my
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.040]  mind I want to talk about some of the true developments of Jade Helm that have
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.680]  been taking place you've heard the callers calling in who've been confronted
[12:02.680 --> 12:06.640]  by military personnel and told to turn their cameras off or they'll regret it
[12:06.640 --> 12:13.360]  that's happened to myself covering some of these events and these type of
[12:13.360 --> 12:19.440]  activities are happening all the world in Spain a fellow got a large fine for on
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.960]  his Facebook saying the police are so lazy that this local department they
[12:23.960 --> 12:27.560]  should be given swimming pools and hammocks thought there was free speech
[12:27.560 --> 12:35.040]  in Spain he was fined thousands of euros now a woman is even in more trouble
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.640]  Spanish woman find 900 euros for posting picture of police parked in
[12:40.640 --> 12:47.040]  handicapped space to Facebook and we have footage of this that we need to go
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.080]  ahead from the trip and and pull it out we're putting in the documentary as
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.600]  well they made us erase it in front of them but we were able to salvage it off
[12:54.600 --> 13:01.560]  the off the memory stick there was a cathedral famous cathedral and police
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.520]  were like 50 yards in front of us part of the shot and we were getting shots of
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.160]  them repairing the cathedral with these big cranes and bricks going up and down
[13:11.160 --> 13:14.680]  it looked like a Richard scary illustration we're even actually trying
[13:14.680 --> 13:17.760]  to get cops on tape though there were cops standing around with machine guns
[13:17.760 --> 13:24.280]  and they came over and sort of speaking to us in Spanish and I said I speak
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.360]  English he goes oh you speak English you're so big well so do I and I went
[13:29.360 --> 13:37.920]  look we're just Americans we're just here you know filming and don't mean any
[13:37.920 --> 13:43.560]  trouble by it and he said well I could take you to jail for filming us I mean
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.080]  that's like Nazi Germany or that's like Soviet Russia and this is happening in
[13:48.080 --> 13:53.120]  the heart of Europe they're going back under a monarchy under Juan Carlos who
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.480]  was given power by the dictator Franco when he died in the 70s it's it's really
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.280]  just unprecedented and our media isn't making a big deal out of it like when
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.880]  China used to sell political distance organs 20 years ago it was a big deal
[14:06.880 --> 14:14.240]  it would at least be in the news now they just go big deal so it really shows
[14:14.240 --> 14:21.760]  a hardening of the conscience a hardening of the heart when you have
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.320]  that you have no empathy so we'll be breaking that down Joe Jennings came in
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.640]  today and he said you're not gonna air the latest Planned Parenthood video are
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.680]  you today even more footage of small babies and large babies being dissected
[14:35.680 --> 14:46.080]  one of them is about looks about like nine inches long has eyes lips and is
[14:46.080 --> 14:54.480]  struggling and looking around and then they obviously terminated right there and
[14:54.480 --> 15:01.240]  Joe was saying please don't air it I'll be honest with you I looked at it last
[15:01.240 --> 15:05.280]  night when a Don Salazar posted the latest video of it struggling fighting
[15:05.280 --> 15:12.720]  before it's dissected before the child is cut up alive and I couldn't watch it
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.800]  and then I was in a bad mood for the rest of the night and I had my parents and
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.680]  family over for dinner and I was in a bad mood and they were like why do you look
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.640]  so upset I immediately within about 30 minutes got raging heartburn which I
[15:26.640 --> 15:34.560]  never get I just take two pepsiday seas had so much acid in my stomach that I
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.960]  had to go back in the house we were outside cooking and vomit and then I
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.280]  couldn't even hardly dinner there was nothing in my stomach but acid you know
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.040]  because I hadn't eaten since lunch but I mean I never get an upset stomach
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.280]  hardly I have an iron-clad stomach and you know you hear about cops that go to
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.600]  murder scenes and see dead kids and the same thing happens to them they're
[15:56.600 --> 16:02.520]  people on YouTube making jokes about the baby so you know what we're gonna air
[16:02.520 --> 16:10.840]  the video coming up probably when Dr. groups in here and I'm gonna watch the
[16:10.840 --> 16:17.160]  whole thing because you know what I need to get sick I need to throw up I need to
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.360]  get physically upset that's my soul saying you got to fight this what are
[16:21.360 --> 16:27.400]  you doing because out of that you get real strength at the other side of it
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.800]  to do what needs to be done and I tell you the folks that are sneaking in and
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.120]  doing this can you imagine their courage and their will to be around these
[16:35.120 --> 16:41.360]  demons for months to get their trust and to sit there with a straight face while
[16:41.360 --> 16:44.920]  they're killing the babies and I told you they like to get them outside the womb
[16:44.920 --> 16:49.360]  under state and federal law it is murder once they're outside the womb to chop
[16:49.360 --> 16:54.560]  them up that's why they they they kill them and suck the brain out on a
[16:54.560 --> 16:59.720]  partial birth abortion seven eight nine month old baby with the head still
[16:59.720 --> 17:04.000]  inside the cervix they open the cervix up big enough to get the whole head out
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.280]  but the places that don't want to go to prison people go to prison for this they
[17:09.280 --> 17:15.520]  suck the brain out with a suction powered large needle huge gauge needle
[17:15.520 --> 17:22.480]  took a vacuum cleaner bigger than a turkey baster to then implode the head and
[17:22.480 --> 17:26.560]  then they check with a stethoscope to make sure the heart stopped before
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.840]  dissecting well what I was told by insiders we've had insiders on insiders
[17:31.840 --> 17:35.280]  have blown the whistle but footage was never gotten some clinics were shut down
[17:35.280 --> 17:40.560]  because their testimony they the places that want to get top dollar you need to
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.400]  keep the baby alive to dissect the organs and make sure that the tissue doesn't
[17:44.400 --> 17:48.600]  get damaged it takes a while to go in and cut them out properly and keep the
[17:48.600 --> 17:51.760]  arteries you know properly cut so they can be reattached to somebody else
[17:51.760 --> 17:58.240]  later and I'm sorry I've talked about all this I don't want to it has to be
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.760]  talked about and of course how bloody and filthy the facilities are and a lot
[18:02.760 --> 18:05.920]  of facilities get shut down as it turns out they are into the occult they're
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.520]  doing weird stuff with the babies I mean who else do you think wants to sit
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.200]  around dissecting seven month old babies all day I mean you've been to a

[24:11.640 --> 24:16.200]  all right I digressed off into a Don Salazar's article about the latest
[24:16.200 --> 24:22.120]  video smuggled out of the baby organ harvesting factories where the women
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.800]  aren't told what's happening where they're told just sign a bunch of forms
[24:25.800 --> 24:32.240]  horror intact fetuses moves arms and legs outside womb in latest Planned
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.360]  Parenthood video I'm looking at this fetus and its heart is beating and I
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.240]  don't know what to think
[24:40.240 --> 24:48.480]  those of you that are for abortion go watch the video and don't say that we're
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.480]  obscene showing this again if you're a new listener driving along on the highway
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.080]  going once you keep seeing a look at this we are simulcast television and I'm
[24:58.080 --> 25:05.400]  the first person in the internet age to simulcast a radio TV show there have
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.520]  been TV shows that have been aired on radio many times in that format but this
[25:10.520 --> 25:18.800]  is radio style free flow teleprompter free in a professional million dollar
[25:18.800 --> 25:24.640]  studio basically because it adds another layer you know first with talk radio
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.040]  when the internet came along people could say go to the site look at this and
[25:28.040 --> 25:33.120]  people could share the same photos the same articles together there starting in
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.920]  the early 90s with the internet becoming more widespread but now with
[25:37.920 --> 25:44.960]  television you see almost every major radio show moving into this format and
[25:44.960 --> 25:47.960]  that's just the natural evolution but I am proud of the fact that I've been
[25:47.960 --> 25:56.120]  doing it since 1996 off and on and then full times the last 12 years but I digress
[25:56.120 --> 26:02.640]  if you're a new listener info wars.com forward slash show when you hear me say
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.760]  put it on screen or look at this graph radio is the main audience though and
[26:08.760 --> 26:16.560]  sometimes we forget that I myself guest we have on basically try to air videos
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.120]  that don't translate well on radio so we always have to think about that in the
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.560]  main understand that about 80% of this audience is an FM affiliates out there
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.960]  across the United States that are so essential that we support and promote and
[26:31.960 --> 26:35.640]  become sponsors of or support the sponsors of and let them know you're
[26:35.640 --> 26:40.240]  supporting the sponsors and tell everyone you know every day to tune in
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.200]  because the big power of this broadcast is in the major cities across this
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.560]  country were on the air you're able to get huge amounts of people to tune in
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.320]  and please keep doing that it's having a giant huge effect and pray for those
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.640]  wonderful affiliates as well they're actually standing for the truth you
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.080]  notice that more and more of this information is becoming mainstream and
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.440]  that's because of the bravery of our affiliates some of which we have
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.680]  affiliates in upstate New York and places in Tennessee like WBCR and Knoxville
[27:11.680 --> 27:17.880]  and others that have been carrying this broadcast for I think Tennessee 16 17
[27:17.880 --> 27:25.840]  years upstate New York Dr. Wolf stations up there a great Jewish Christian
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.000]  American who died a few years ago but his son runs it we're on three affiliates
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.440]  in Rochester and Buffalo and other areas we've been on there about 17 18 years
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.520]  those are some of our oldest affiliates but we have a lot of new affiliates
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.960]  across the country and they're so important I didn't mean to go off on a
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.440]  jag about that it's just absolutely a key working part of everything we're
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.560]  doing here in the info war in fact it's it's it's the heart of it so I want to
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.160]  thank those affiliates and and listeners are going out joining with the stations
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.960]  and paying for billboards for the show that's happening across the country but
[28:01.960 --> 28:05.400]  don't count others to step up now is the time to put your money where your
[28:05.400 --> 28:10.360]  mouth is we're gonna lose everything if we don't put in a full effort and here's
[28:10.360 --> 28:15.960]  the good news in the bad news the fact that things are so bad now and so naked
[28:15.960 --> 28:22.160]  and so out in the open with all the tyranny and the arrogance that people
[28:22.160 --> 28:25.960]  now are ready to wake up if they ever will some people are deeper in denial
[28:25.960 --> 28:31.840]  you can't reach them but on average people are the most receptive to the
[28:31.840 --> 28:38.200]  truth now they've ever been and that's why they're pushing people like Donald
[28:38.200 --> 28:43.240]  Trump right now whether he be good bad or a mix of the two that's why he's so
[28:43.240 --> 28:47.080]  popular and the more he's attacked the more popular he gets because when the
[28:47.080 --> 28:51.560]  mainstream media attacks you that is the seal of approval as I told Politico
[28:51.560 --> 28:55.360]  and Rand Paul got elected four or five years ago they said yeah everybody came
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.120]  after him he only got more popular the dirty tricks what's the secret and I
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.640]  said well it's a populist libertarian you know system he's promoting but more
[29:03.640 --> 29:10.800]  importantly everyone demonized him in the establishment and if you want to
[29:10.800 --> 29:18.560]  destroy Rand Paul you've got to endorse his ideas but then he wins anyway so to
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.760]  bring down Rand Paul and eclipse him into the vacuum comes Donald Trump I
[29:22.760 --> 29:26.160]  just hope he's for real they have a really important report from the Nightly
[29:26.160 --> 29:30.200]  News last night that I want to air where David Knight breaks down some of the
[29:30.200 --> 29:34.480]  different angles to what Trump's really proposing I know I wouldn't say it's an
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.120]  attack piece it's a thoughtful piece and I want to believe in Donald Trump but we
[29:40.120 --> 29:45.240]  need to hold his feet to the fire and we need to research what he's up to that's
[29:45.240 --> 29:49.960]  coming up then the fall of Hillary appears to be completely imminent March the
[29:49.960 --> 29:57.260]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio net
[29:58.320 --> 30:03.760]  Ferguson Missouri was up in flames and tear gas once again last night after
[30:03.760 --> 30:08.760]  residents demanded to know why officers fatally shot a black suspect according
[30:08.760 --> 30:12.800]  to police officers were preparing to execute a search warrant when two black
[30:12.800 --> 30:17.360]  males ran out the back door both armed with weapons after being ordered to
[30:17.360 --> 30:21.920]  drop their weapons police said one of the suspects pointed his gun at officers
[30:21.920 --> 30:26.720]  he was promptly shot and pronounced dead at the scene police said the suspect's
[30:26.720 --> 30:31.120]  gun was found to have been stolen four guns total were recovered as well as
[30:31.120 --> 30:35.440]  crack cocaine soon after the shooting the street was full of nearly 100
[30:35.440 --> 30:40.240]  residents demanding answers several arrests were recorded but where was the
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.600]  community response in Ferguson when nine-year-old Jamila Bolden was shot dead
[30:44.600 --> 30:48.760]  as she did her homework on Tuesday night the black lives matter crowd was
[30:48.760 --> 30:53.280]  nowhere to be found the difference Jamila Bolden was killed in a drive-by

[34:23.720 --> 34:27.360]  Trump saying that well it's the right thing to do to deport all these
[34:27.360 --> 34:31.760]  illegals and try to get rid of anchor baby status but that he would
[34:31.760 --> 34:37.200]  accelerate bringing in people that actually have skills have jobs or who
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.480]  were here with good records and that makes sense you have to be deported then
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.520]  we can create a quicker pathway because you're not a felon you had a job you
[34:47.520 --> 34:53.760]  paid taxes let you come right back I mean every other country has very serious
[34:53.760 --> 34:57.840]  immigration laws you can get into Mexico very easily but you can't use any
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.040]  other services and if they catch you coming in from Latin America six months
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.360]  to a year hard labor in an open-air prison with mosquitoes biting you all
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.120]  day something out of Devil's Island like a French penal colony that's even
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.240]  been in the New York Times that Mexico has some of the most draconian
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.400]  immigration laws in the world until a decade ago or so you couldn't own land
[35:20.400 --> 35:26.160]  if you weren't a Mexican citizen well why is Mexico allowed to have these rules
[35:26.160 --> 35:34.080]  and other countries but we can't I mean we can't take on the whole world the
[35:34.080 --> 35:40.960]  world's going into a mass of depression and then to make it worse the the
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.680]  illegals come in they get put on the Democratic Party gravy train get filled
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.120]  with liberation theology and racists hate the white people ideology and that
[35:50.120 --> 35:58.200]  is what's going on and it's a ticking time bomb but here's Trump first in a
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.320]  New Hampshire event yesterday saying that he's not gonna drop out and this is
[36:02.320 --> 36:06.680]  good because he doesn't need to drop out he doesn't need to run third party
[36:06.680 --> 36:12.640]  because he's a quote conservative mainly that would put Hillary Clinton or God
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.720]  forbid Bernie Sanders in and I'm not normally a lesser two evils person but
[36:16.720 --> 36:23.440]  let me tell you any of the Republicans but Jeb Bush would be better than
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.240]  Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders I mean I don't think Bernie Sanders is an
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.320]  inherently evil person he's never worked today in his life he is a demonic
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.320]  little stupid chipmunk I mean look at his senatorial photo I mean he I don't
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.000]  usually go off looks but I mean Hillary looks like the Joker acts like the Joker
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.160]  and Sanders is this pie in the sky guy the Walmart people have billions what
[36:49.160 --> 36:54.720]  they need we need to take it well we need to understand Walmart has its
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.920]  employees subsidized about half of them on welfare Walmart does deals with China
[36:58.920 --> 37:02.800]  with slave goods if he criticized Walmart along those lines I'd say more
[37:02.800 --> 37:08.880]  power to him yes the Walmart people got their money by changing the way retail
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.560]  sales work there's not like 30 percent of retail sales in this country some like
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.640]  15 percent worldwide and yes they've helped deindustrialize this country but
[37:18.640 --> 37:28.320]  that's Americans actions a small town America killed itself committed Harry
[37:28.320 --> 37:35.920]  Kerry with Walmart so I don't blame the liquor companies when we got a hundred
[37:35.920 --> 37:41.200]  thousand people died a liver failure a year I blame people that are out of
[37:41.200 --> 37:47.600]  control I don't blame gun manufacturers whenever their firearms are used to
[37:47.600 --> 37:50.640]  kill somebody it's the person that did it but in the case of Walmart you can
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.480]  give them plenty of blame because they game the system they're monopoly
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.360]  capitalist not free market capitalist but Americans put their head in the
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.360]  noose with Walmart and now Walmart is closing in a lot of areas because the
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.920]  country's in a depression in many sectors it's an unevenly distributed
[38:09.920 --> 38:21.280]  depression just like the futures here it's just unevenly distributed and that's
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.160]  what the future is all about is diplomatic immunity above the law for
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.720]  the globalist but the average person has absolutely no rights so let's go to the
[38:29.720 --> 38:36.200]  Donald Trump Club who do I see as strongest you know changes from the
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.640]  only thing constant is Trump I mean all of them change on the bottom they're
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.680]  going up and down like yo-yo's but I've been up there for a long time and I hope
[38:44.680 --> 38:47.840]  I'm gonna be up there for a long time you know I read a lot of the phony
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.280]  reports a couple of reports today in the paper saying oh well you know when
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.880]  Donald Trump gets tired of doing this he's doing great and he's leading all
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.840]  the polls but some point again I'm not going anywhere folks I'm not doing this
[39:00.840 --> 39:07.040]  for my health I'm doing this to make America great again and again is a
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.400]  very important word very important word I'm not going anywhere I'm not going
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.400]  anywhere got a lot of money I don't need people funding me like the other
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.360]  candidates I have people coming up all the time wanting to give me millions of
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.360]  five million dollars less week I turned down from one man I said I don't want
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.920]  your money and I think that resonates with people I really think it resonates
[39:28.920 --> 39:35.200]  with people as if Donald Trump's interest won't become fabulously more rich if
[39:35.200 --> 39:38.000]  he gets into the presidency Hillary Clinton went into the governor's house
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.120]  with her husband worth nothing she was worth what was it two million dollars
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.760]  I remember it's covering at the time whenever Clinton got elected president
[39:46.760 --> 39:53.040]  now Hillary and Clinton I saw the headline two days ago made 140 plus
[39:53.040 --> 39:58.440]  million dollars check my memory Clinton's made over a hundred million
[39:58.440 --> 40:06.280]  dollars in the last year together and that's with all their inside deals I'm
[40:06.280 --> 40:12.040]  not saying Trump's doing that but I noticed he said what made America great
[40:12.040 --> 40:17.760]  again and that's true my memory was right Clinton's earned nearly 141
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.680]  million from 2007 2014 so it was over it was over seven eight years not a year
[40:23.680 --> 40:27.320]  see my memory fails I read so much news that's why double check it the crew takes
[40:27.320 --> 40:30.760]  everything I say basically puts it in the search engine and checks it and I'm
[40:30.760 --> 40:34.040]  right about 95% of the time I was wrong right there let's let's put it up I'm
[40:34.040 --> 40:41.080]  sorry they earned 141 million dollars in the last three four five six seven eight
[40:41.080 --> 40:44.600]  years of course that's not counting their foundation that made hundreds and
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.160]  millions as well that they have their houses and helicopters and jets in so if
[40:51.160 --> 40:55.400]  you add that together it's way way more than that but it's been good for them
[40:55.400 --> 41:01.400]  good for them you know they go to Japan and speaking at a million dollars we
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.440]  think that is it's a payoff for stuff they did for Japan when they were
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.720]  president because they were co-presidents basically and then now
[41:11.720 --> 41:17.720]  she's at the State Department is money from dictators but that's okay but the
[41:17.720 --> 41:25.520]  Clinton charity earned two billion since it was founded in 2011
[41:25.520 --> 41:32.480]  144 million in 2013 alone and see that's why I wanted to pull that up that's what
[41:32.480 --> 41:36.040]  my memory does ten years ago it was almost photographic it wouldn't have
[41:36.040 --> 41:39.720]  made that mistake I flipped numbers now I knew it was a hundred and forty something
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.320]  million in one year that was the foundation but that's constantly the
[41:44.320 --> 41:48.920]  mistake I make I flipped numbers that are in the same area and the same people
[41:48.920 --> 41:53.680]  I'll get them mixed up in my memory but that's why I have a crew to check
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.920]  everything I say so excuse me was a hundred and forty plus million in their
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.080]  foundation in a year and a hundred and forty something million in the last eight
[42:01.080 --> 42:05.240]  years for them as personal profit but of course like Bill Gates and all these
[42:05.240 --> 42:10.200]  other people most their money is in foundations that's tax free if you try
[42:10.200 --> 42:13.400]  to set something up like that they come and arrest you but they're allowed to
[42:13.400 --> 42:19.800]  operate like that now we got big news coming up I'm gonna get back to Donald
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.920]  Trump here in a moment but San Francisco earthquake is this the big one that's the
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.280]  one in Telegraph and that ties into this earthquake 4.2 that hit southern
[42:30.280 --> 42:36.160]  Colorado I tell you tectonically the ring of fire is on fire and it connects in
[42:36.160 --> 42:43.280]  from California and the West Coast into the central areas around Colorado and
[42:43.280 --> 42:50.400]  we are due for some big activity and a major earthquake hitting the West Coast
[42:50.400 --> 42:54.800]  that a lot of analysts think if it makes the faults go in can actually create an
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.280]  inland sea if you look right there where they think the earthquake may hit you
[42:59.280 --> 43:04.000]  notice that fully falls in the ocean would come in there that's a seismic map
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.400]  but but but notice where it's all centered it would create a inlet up north of
[43:09.400 --> 43:16.240]  San Francisco that's already there and flood everything give the ground lowers
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.120]  talk about California falling off in the ocean like Baja that will cause a
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.240]  depression super volcano goes off by the way they keep saying something giant
[43:29.240 --> 43:31.600]  is coming in September and I've been hearing this for a year and I kind of
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.720]  poo-pooed it I mean I'm not knocking Jewish mysticism and blood moons and
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.840]  all the rest of it historically things have happened on those dates but there's
[43:41.840 --> 43:46.720]  an article up on info wars calm the big list of 33 things that are going to
[43:46.720 --> 43:53.320]  happen in September 2015 everybody keeps saying September 24th is the big date
[43:53.320 --> 43:57.440]  and I would hear this about a year ago and I'll be honest I'd kind of roll my
[43:57.440 --> 44:02.400]  eyes the Pope though didn't announce until a few months ago that that's when
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.360]  he's going to address the joint session of Congress
[44:07.200 --> 44:12.080]  first time ever a foreign head of state of a religious order lecturing
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.280]  Congress but let's go to David nice report right now looking at different
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.840]  angles of Donald Trump here it is unlike every other campaign I've ever seen
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.400]  from president to dog catcher Trump has avoided putting up any issues any policy
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.680]  statements about anything he's been running on the strength of his character
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.800]  and his opposition to open borders now for the first time we see a detailed
[44:35.800 --> 44:39.160]  policy statement of course it's on immigration so let's take a look at the
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.360]  economic the legal and the liberty aspects of the Trump immigration policy
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.040]  Bloomberg business asks what would happen to the economy if Trump got his way
[44:49.040 --> 44:54.800]  Bloomberg says the supply of workers would shrink a lot they also say service
[44:54.800 --> 44:59.320]  occupations would feel the burn illegal immigrants they say make up 5% of the
[44:59.320 --> 45:03.920]  workforce and we don't have workers to replace them well that's not true at all
[45:03.920 --> 45:09.600]  this year Americans out of the workforce rose to 33% the highest rate
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.680]  since 1978 we all know from personal experience that entry level jobs are
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.400]  being taken by immigrants especially the jobs that typically went to students
[45:19.400 --> 45:23.440]  who were seeing depression level unemployment rates as these charts show
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.280]  since December of 2007 the entire recovery that we've had since then 75% of
[45:30.280 --> 45:35.520]  jobs have gone to foreign-born workers and we have seen declining wages in
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.960]  America the Bloomberg article also says that social security fund would take a
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.680]  hit they cite a study that undocumented workers pay $13 billion in payroll
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.000]  taxes do you really think that most illegals are paying social security taxes
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.080]  one of the major incentives for American businesses to hire illegal aliens in
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.800]  the first place is that they can save over 7.5% in payroll taxes versus
[45:58.800 --> 46:04.400]  paying for a citizen who is on social security and if they are paying the taxes
[46:04.400 --> 46:09.000]  then the person who replaces them who is an American citizen would be paying
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.800]  those same social security taxes Bloomberg Wall Street and the Washington
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.800]  politicians only look at the economic cost of businesses but what about the
[46:16.800 --> 46:21.040]  welfare and education costs that anyone who pays taxes are being saddled with
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.960]  our borders are being flooded with foreign students how is that going to be
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.280]  paid with property taxes it's not just the additional students the cost per
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.360]  student are higher if they need special tutors in Philadelphia 800 students
[46:36.360 --> 46:41.400]  speaking 40 different languages from 70 countries have just been registered if
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.960]  any child in the world can come here illegally and you can be compelled to
[46:45.960 --> 46:51.280]  pay for it how will you be able to afford those soaring property taxes will
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.880]  you be put out of your home or will you simply be impoverished one excellent
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.600]  aspect of Trump's immigration paper is the H1B visa abuse that he attacks
[47:00.600 --> 47:04.800]  reading from his statement he says increased the prevailing wage for H1B's
[47:04.800 --> 47:08.680]  we graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.000]  STEM jobs yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.040]  accomplished through the H1B program what are STEM jobs science technology
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.520]  engineering manufacturing the types of jobs that pay high wages that increase
[47:22.520 --> 47:28.240]  our standard of living let me repeat what he said 50% of Americans with STEM
[47:28.240 --> 47:35.640]  degrees can't get jobs yet 67% of entry-level IT jobs go to foreign workers
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.760]  with these H1B visas let's turn to the legal aspects now the anchor babies
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.560]  has been getting a lot of attention the idea that foreigners could come to the
[47:43.560 --> 47:48.880]  US have a baby and then use that babies citizenship to bring in an entire
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.240]  extended family that is not something that you can find in the 14th
[47:53.240 --> 47:56.560]  amendment a lot of people have pushed back against the idea that we could ever
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.960]  stop the anchor baby program but that's not in the text the purpose of the
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.960]  14th amendment remember was to establish the rights of citizenship for freed
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.000]  slaves going back to the original passage of the 14th amendment in 1866
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.520]  senator Jacob Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th amendment he
[48:14.520 --> 48:17.880]  said every person born within the limits of the US and subject to their
[48:17.880 --> 48:23.200]  jurisdiction is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.840]  United States this will not he writes of course include persons born in the
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.560]  United States who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.560]  ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.480]  United States so it was never intended to make American citizens out of people
[48:39.480 --> 48:43.760]  who were born here of foreign parents who are visiting that's what subject to
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.240]  the jurisdiction means but even if you ignored that why would you extend
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.880]  citizenship to the extended family this is an abuse and it needs to be stopped
[48:53.880 --> 48:58.200]  Trump is right to call for its end let's turn now to liberty and law
[48:58.200 --> 49:01.600]  enforcement issues I agree with Donald Trump that we should stop this
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.000]  ridiculous catch and release program of criminals who are illegal aliens being
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.240]  here illegally should not give you legal immunity you should not be treated
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.840]  like you're some kind of a foreign diplomatic ambassador Trump calls for
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.600]  building a wall and making Mexico pay for it he also calls for increasing the
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.200]  number of immigration and customs enforcement officers by three times he
[49:24.200 --> 49:27.480]  points out that since September 11th we've already increased the number of
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.080]  ICE officers by a factor of three so we're gonna have ten times the number of
[49:31.080 --> 49:36.040]  officers we are creating a massive police state we don't want to turn the
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.280]  American West into the West Bank of Israel with all of its oppressive
[49:40.280 --> 49:45.720]  population control measures he also calls for nationwide e-verify a new
[49:45.720 --> 49:51.040]  national ID card an army of new law enforcement officers and a gigantic wall
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.560]  around our country is not something that's going to stop immigration of
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.280]  people if you don't remove the subsidies and the incentives for them to come
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.920]  here the flood of illegal immigrants is due to the incentives and the subsidies
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.960]  that we've created for the benefit of corporate profits and a socialist agenda
[50:07.960 --> 50:13.520]  stop those incentives and you can stop the flood of people but creating a
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.640]  police state will do nothing to stop it if the incentives remain.
[50:17.640 --> 50:25.560]  For Infra Wars I'm David Knight. We're gonna skip this network break David Knight has
[50:25.560 --> 50:30.400]  knocked it out of the park yet again I thank God every day for the amazing
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.080]  reporters that we were been able to discover like Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson,
[50:35.080 --> 50:41.840]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, David Knight, our reporters like Kit Daniels and Paul
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.240]  Watson and Don Salazar, Miquel Palin just all the people there's something I
[50:46.240 --> 50:54.920]  can't mention everybody it really is a brain trust of great people and I think
[50:54.920 --> 51:03.760]  David's focused smooth research approach is a nice mix to what I do and our

[51:51.800 --> 51:55.960]  men's and women's bathrooms and the word is the Austin City Council is going to
[51:55.960 --> 51:59.360]  be voting on that in the next few months they're now writing it up I talked to a
[51:59.360 --> 52:04.600]  city person I ran into today who's in zoning I heard about it talking to a
[52:04.600 --> 52:08.640]  friend and they said yeah no that's coming up any new structures businesses

[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.880]  I've been in Hollywood people's houses and seen his products 13 14 years ago and
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.760]  didn't even know who he was and asked people what is this you know what is
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.880]  oxy powder what is anyways I'm not digressing off into that we're gonna
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.040]  get into politics with him Hillary Clinton some of the big victories were
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.240]  having and more to show you how smart Larry Nichols is nobody was saying this
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.120]  until today that Larry Nichols former top Clinton insider was on a few days
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:47.480]  ago and he said Trump could be for real Trump could be a shield for Obama
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.320]  because if you look he's not really defending her and he says they're at
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:56.960]  war because Hillary's kind of controlled him at first and now Obama may want to
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.240]  stay in or may want to keep his people in government even though he's gonna
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.480]  leave and the Clintons will put other folks in the bureaucracy than the Obama
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:11.880]  people the appointees they can appoint new people and so they're double crossing
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.000]  each other it's now in the Washington Times while Obama is torpedoing Hillary
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.160]  Clinton because I'm not Mackey of alien I don't believe in justifies the means
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:31.200]  but I can get in their shoes and look through their eyes and see what's going
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.560]  on and we're just at such a critical juncture right now the whole future of
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.800]  our planet is always being decided now but I mean now more than ever we're in a
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.920]  critical sector but we mentioned this because they're now finding people and
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.840]  arresting people that throw away their light bulbs or don't use the right light
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.200]  bulbs or caught shelling old toilets the wrong light bulbs and they're finding
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.680]  people or whatever that you know try to build bigger houses or put a fence around
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.000]  their house this is global it's in 21 now inside New York City's infamous 100
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.880]  square foot apartments they're now moving down from 250 down to 100 that way
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.600]  they can tax you more you don't save money doing this sure it's less than a
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.640]  big apartment at first then over time they phase it out this is social
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.040]  engineering let's go to the Audi Green Police ad from a few years ago which they
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.840]  admitted was social conditioning to prepare you for this and now this was
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:35.080]  five six years ago now it's happening here it is okay so it's 3708 paper
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.040]  plastic plastic that's the magic word green police you picked the wrong day to
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:04:00.880]  mess with the ecosystem plastic boy tragedy strikes tonight where a man
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.560]  has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb what do you
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:17.000]  guys think about plastic bottles now the water setting is that 105 you're good
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:27.640]  to go sir that are eco checks but he's driving an Audi so he's okay
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.360]  officers that's our phone cups you're drinking from yeah please step out of
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.760]  the car put them on the hood and it's all about social envy showing rich people
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:40.240]  being SWAT teamed and then cops getting in trouble too it's all leftist
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.000]  perspective and I said it was propaganda when it aired months later they
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.320]  bragged in the San Francisco Chronicle that this is what they're gonna do to
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.120]  us this is real they're not playing games they're totalitarians they seize
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:02.720]  power they kill children and sell their organs they are devils is America ready
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.640]  for D's nuts well if the polls are any indication a 15-year-old high school

[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.520]  system in 2016 D's nuts is more popular than Fiorina Huckabee and Walker and
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.760]  there's been no word from the candidates on how it feels being beaten by D's nuts
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:41.160]  in the polls but if you had to choose between Hillary Clinton Donald Trump or
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.720]  D's nuts who would you vote for now we all know how this election is gonna play

[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:26.080]  Edward group is visiting us up here in Austin Texas from Houston and we're
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.400]  gonna cover the waterfront in this hour we're going to open the phones up
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.720]  starting in the next segment for your questions on the latest health news on

[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.400]  Tosh Plumlee is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour the famous
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.360]  CIA contractor that just retired two years ago who blew Benghazi wide open
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.680]  two years ago on this broadcast he's got new information and a challenge
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.960]  towards Hillary Clinton we could be seeing the end of Hillary as I said
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.480]  Sunday I gave about an 85 90% chance that she's gonna have to get out of the
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:19.560]  race now you've got mainline Democrats coming out saying that and the
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.880]  Washington Times has an excellent article up on info wars calm why Obama is
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:35.080]  torpedoing Hillary Clinton so that's all coming up as well now speaking of
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:42.960]  torpedoing the economy from China to Europe is clearly in freefall and you've
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.520]  got the Pope coming to speak the 24th of September you've got CERN firing up to
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.320]  do some of its most dangerous experiments ever the superconducting
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.960]  supercollider or mega cyclotron that's in multiple states of France and
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.480]  Switzerland it's so big and even mainline scientists say it could create a
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.160]  black hole that starts sucking matter in and sucks the planet in it could create
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.720]  a strange look that sinks to the center of the planet and implodes it it could do
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.600]  all this but the probabilities low well maybe that's true but mathematicians
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:21.880]  respected ones physicists they've warned of it you tie all this together it just
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:27.040]  shows the hubris just like when they wanted to see if high-powered hydrogen
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.920]  bombs detonated in the upper atmosphere would destroy the atmosphere or ignite
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.040]  the atmosphere and they thought it might happen so they went ahead and did it
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.720]  that's covered in the documentary I talk a lot about just because it's well done
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.120]  was William Shatner Trinity and beyond on Discovery Channel came out like you
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.800]  know 1999 or whatever it just shows like genetic engineering any of it the
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.760]  whole world's a giant experiment now and used to that you know put moms on some
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.840]  drug to calm them down and it would that you know they have babies with no arms
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.760]  and legs and but that's just babies with no arms and legs that's bad that's a
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.120]  problem now we're doing experiments with the whole planet that could end the
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.480]  world as you know it so I want to get dr. groups take on that the election and
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.720]  more but he came in here and raised this point he goes everybody's bringing up the
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:22.040]  middle to late part of September and there's an article on info wars calm the
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.360]  big list of 33 things that are going to happen September 2015 in September 2015
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.040]  going to be the month that changes history you've got economic alignments
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.920]  top analysts saying implosion acceleration moving tanks and weapons in
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.920]  against the Russians kicking off in September you've got ISIS launching
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.680]  larger offensives you've got North Korea suddenly firing across today at the
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.800]  south or the South Korea exchanging artillery fire and minds have been
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.920]  killing South Korean soldiers major escalations there I'm not saying
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.160]  anything's gonna happen big in September but I remember actually a couple years
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.440]  ago hearing the last blood moon comes the middle of September and then all
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.840]  hell breaks loose and Jewish mysticism and I'm like okay I'm not pooping all
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.360]  that I'm not I'm not disrespecting it but come on and I didn't you know believe
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.560]  it and I'm not saying it's gonna happen now but you go over all the things
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.120]  happening the elites believe in this like the Romans used to go to war when
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.480]  Mars was in a certain aspect of vengeance or whatever when they thought the
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.840]  stars were ready and the elites today most presidents prime ministers they
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.000]  operate on astrology and all this so they believe in it whether you and I
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.880]  believe in it or not it's going on and now it's all coming to a head in the
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.120]  real world it's just weird that like two years ago talk about the blood moons
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.520]  in September of 2015 talk about the last blood moon talk about the I'm just
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.160]  like okay and go take your thorazine and then now it just looks really weird
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.160]  and in the last six months last year everybody I talked to does have this
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:05.680]  sense of this ominous or this port you know this this portend this this feeling
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.280]  of unease of the edge of your seat of excitement building and building and
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.960]  building and building and now I've gone past the dread point almost like the
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:22.920]  hair-on-fire exhilaration of the change is good and bad is rising at the same
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.880]  time a key point in human history and the elites know it they're accelerating
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.520]  everything so dr. group I was looking for four minutes
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.040]  prefacing this what do you think's going on what do you want to add to the mix
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.720]  here I don't really know exactly what's going on but I've been getting a lot of
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.320]  emails lately with people that are on YouTube that are putting all these pieces
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.320]  together you have financial collapse situation you have the pope coming in to
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.000]  meet in September you have jade helm ending in September what I'm concerned
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.640]  about is or the research that I've looked at from all these sources that give you
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.400]  information and give me information is the CERN Switzerland project which is the
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.640]  17-mile circle that's buried 300 feet under the ground which is a large
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.720]  hadron collider and the research that they've been doing on that is basically
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:20.520]  to create a portal and they're going to be firing that thing up in September I
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.400]  was just they admit they want to break into other dimensions I'm like you this
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.120]  is like you know you hear about the end of the world y2k and this is this here
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.160]  and this here but the information that I've been getting and looking at because
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.880]  I always keep an open mind to everything and try to evaluate everything but I'm
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.400]  telling you from all the movies that have been coming out tomorrow land actually
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:45.440]  has a section in it on the trailer that says 923 the everything is Lego is
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.560]  coming out with a dimensional portal set later in September the reactor is
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.320]  going to be fired up in September they don't even know it's like creating the
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.520]  God particle we're like trying to play God now that's what they call it yeah
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.680]  exactly I mean they're what they're doing is they're colliding particles at
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.960]  faster than the speed of light to create a big bet they're trying to figure out
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.920]  go back in time and say what happened with the universe we just put a mainline
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.880]  news article up where they admit that they've already done small tests now
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.080]  they're doing the big one with more power they admit oh we've already created
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.800]  any matter how wonderful well if there's a chain reaction bye bye and of course
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.200]  when you see like the last Star Trek movie before the last one two Star Trek
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.720]  back they admitted that they actually got that from the scientist of what a black
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.000]  hole forming on the earth would look like or a strangelet where the whole
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.680]  planet gets attacked and by a mining ship that basically does the same thing
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.240]  CERN does and it crushes the planet that's what it would actually look like
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.240]  if they do this and we're not saying this is going to happen the point is
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.280]  they're doing tests where they admit it could destroy the planet one gram of
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.600]  antimatter which is what they're trying to create is the equivalent of four
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.280]  atomic bombs I mean it's absurd to think that we would even be trying to carry
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.080]  on an experiment like that every one of the scientists said there could be
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.760]  dangers involved with it but we don't know what's going to happen until we fire
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.000]  it up well I don't know if Atlantis really happened but this is really
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.240]  happening this is really happening and it's not in the news and it's again it's
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.120]  just one of those things it seems like everything that you look at Yom Kippur is
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.840]  happening in September when you look at all the different things that are
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:36.640]  revolving around September I cannot remember a time that so many things point
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.880]  to September and again I mean we're not fear mongering and saying something's
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.080]  going to happen in September but there is a lot of things everybody else is
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.440]  saying it this is where I'm actually on the tail end of this we're not the
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.760]  progenitors of this exact people are freaking out about it yeah exactly and
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.360]  then you look there's a lot of stuff going on right and all the economic front
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.240]  the just the economic front look at the you know the controversy right now with
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.520]  what happened with the explosion in China I mean you know that's that's a
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.160]  whole nother subject with it with the economic collapse that's happening who
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.960]  knows what's going to happen but the main thing with me is let's try to protect
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.720]  the population as much as possible let's try to help as many people as we can get
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.000]  prepared you know it's always good to have a warning not to create fear and
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.400]  stress and bring your immune system down but at least know that hey if something
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.920]  happens I have what I need to survive or I have you know an area that I can go
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.640]  that I can get clear sure and by exposing this being concerned we don't
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.640]  have nuclear war on the Cuban Missile Crisis we don't have a war with Russia
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:46.400]  we don't have ISIS breakout into more countries by talking about the problems
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.880]  we force it out in the open so that a solution can be carried out like it
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.840]  it'll cost two three billion dollars to harden all of the US electrical system
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.000]  so there's a Carrington event or an EMP we're not back on the Stone Age the
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.800]  Pentagon and Congress admit 90% of America would die within one year if a
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.320]  Carrington event blew out a lot of the power right I mean it took us this long
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.200]  to build this infrastructure we're very precarious just in time delivery
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.920]  there's just a little example of real insurance we should have they actually
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.280]  did studies it's not funny but they did studies on what would happen in the case
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.800]  of an EMP and you basically everybody's not going to understand what happened the
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.440]  majority of people out there if you see cars all of a sudden dead on the road
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.920]  you you better just start getting outside of a big city as fast as you can
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.600]  because they after 24 hours the food starts to spoil people still don't know
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.640]  what's going on but you have about 72 hours after that all hell breaks loose
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.520]  all hell breaks loose because there's no food there's no water and in every
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.640]  study unless they're talking about Japanese it's just a fact people then
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:56.840]  start burning everything down and then within 10 days almost anyone will
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.760]  murder others within 15 days almost universal cannibalism you also have
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.600]  the crossing now and this has been this is actually NASA documents that say
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.400]  that there's as there's meteors that are going to be crossing in September to
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.560]  we're already entering a bunch of them that's why there's so many big
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.200]  that's right and it's funny it's not funny but about six years ago I was
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.600]  contacted by what was supposedly a top-secret organization that was working
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.000]  that was put together by the government to try to find the best method to
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.120]  deter meteor a meteor shower by the way that projects now admit it that's right
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.120]  but you know I'll tell you about what happened with that project after the
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.720]  break well I don't want to get anybody in trouble but the point is there's a
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.000]  lot of stuff going on behind the scenes we'll be right back the toll-free number

[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.000]  waterfront here what do you think of Hillary I smell her political blood in
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.760]  the air fee five faux-farm I smell the blood of a witch going down I think this
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.560]  probably is it she may last six months you may get pardoned but I think her
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.800]  political career is over what do you think I want to get your take no we
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.000]  disagree on that what do you think about have you seen the new video of the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.560]  little baby that's alive fighting for its life and then being dissected that's
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.960]  on info wars.com what do you think this whole this whole Planned Parenthood
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:24.480]  situation well I agree I think Hillary's on her way out I it just amazes me that
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.960]  she has well I know the numbers are you know skewed anyway but it amazes me that
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:35.960]  she supposedly has 38% of the presidential race poll I mean I don't
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.560]  see how that could possibly be it doesn't take but maybe 10 minutes of
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:48.080]  research online to learn about the past of that scenario as far as I mean as far
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:55.800]  as the Planned Parenthood I think that's sick I mean that video is you know
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.520]  atrocious that goes back to the Bill Gates family with the connections to
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:05.120]  Planned Parenthood that ties into the population control agenda and for them
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.160]  to be able to sell fetuses and take video of a fetus coming out with the
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.800]  heart still beating and dissecting I mean I said I'd play it again and I I
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.760]  cannot bring myself it's like when you jump off a hundred foot bridge and
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.880]  you're scared it's worse than that I cannot bring myself to order them to
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.240]  play it because if I play it I'm gonna watch it again and I only watched part
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:36.640]  of it and literally had so much acid produced that I started vomiting last
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.920]  night it's a and I mean I never do that I've seen people dead on the side of the
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.840]  highway and didn't get sick but it's just it's the realization that they're
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.040]  doing it they're getting away with it none of us are safe I mean it's the
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.000]  realization that we're dealing with literal demons I was just up in Canada
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.240]  and I was at a little statue thing over there and there was a group of autistic
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:04.320]  children that were there playing and it was you know it's it's sad to watch
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.000]  these 20 children that they just really don't even know where they are and you
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.760]  know it's they were soft killed it's like the video it's there's soft killing
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.560]  you just it almost you get so emotional about it it's like seeing troops have
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.560]  had their arms and legs blown off but it wasn't done by a foreign enemy to a man
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.520]  you realize this is the globalist this is their little gift to us right and the
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.240]  and the damage done I mean think at the the parents that have to go through and
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.840]  the fact that they can cover it up right the fact that they can just cover it up
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.480]  and act and say that the vaccines didn't cause the condition and soon it'll be one
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.640]  out of three within ten years the CDC admits and then it'll be it's no big
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.280]  deal let's have a race to raise money for their diapers no one wants to find
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.720]  out why it's happening we're being murdered it's all us we're living in a
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.280]  science fiction movie brother yeah the slow death is even worse I mean it's
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.520]  just so hard to see these children suffer and and the moms and all the
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.720]  psychiatric medications that they're feeding them and the vaccines and the
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.040]  genetically modified foods and the all the chemicals in the air and the water I
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:07.560]  mean it's it's a slow attack a manipulation from the time well even
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.560]  we've been suppressing burst I mean that's why it's so hard for people to
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.760]  even get pregnant these days in the west in the west I mean all the all the
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.800]  chemicals so and we haven't even seen what's gonna happen seven generations two
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.960]  or three or four generations down the road where it's supposed to be even
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.680]  worse we're gonna come back I'm gonna briefly ask you about North Korea

[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.800]  globalist social engineering and genetic engineering we are seeing the
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:18.920]  destruction of our very DNA we are seeing the very destruction of not just
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:25.720]  our species but the heart of the ecosystems of this planet we're seeing a
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:33.880]  genetic vandalism splicing plants with animals insects with animals it is over
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:38.640]  the top evil and then the very groups that are pushing all this stand up on

[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.120]  out of it Adon Salazar came up to me during the break he wrote the article

[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.840]  later it like hits your subconscious in fact I can't look at any more put it
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.120]  down and I understand why folks don't want to look at this and I know why you
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.880]  get mad at me putting it out but it needs to be there and at least looked at
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.000]  one time and people that are for this need to see it as well I mean if I see
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.440]  a little baby bird struggling and dying and I know it's got mites all over it
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.160]  and fire ants all over it I'll step on its head and one time I had a girlfriend
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.480]  in high school and it was a bird dying at the park with fire ants on it and I
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.720]  said all that birds in pain I'm gonna kill it she's like she got mad at me
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.440]  after I stepped on its head and I said baby I care about that bird it's it's
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  dead already it's look the fire ants had basically eaten its eyes out it's in
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.600]  hell I killed it for the reason it's like you know and I kept getting mad it
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.280]  was the emotion I said you know how they shoot horses that break their legs
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  because you can't really fix those because the horse won't stay in a cast I
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.120]  said it's the same thing you they don't shoot the horses because they don't care
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:39.000]  about them well if you can't look at this baby folks you shouldn't be able to
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.360]  look yourself in the eye ever again I've looked at it it's torn me up you need
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.960]  to look at it and other people need to look at it so they're gonna put the
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.920]  article back out with some updates and this gift that's gone viral for folks
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.800]  to share we're gonna leave the original article up with the headline group I
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.440]  want you to help me come up with a headline what is it baby fights for its
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:05.680]  life after being aborted or baby fights for its life before having organs
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:11.360]  harvested and then we explain out of a science fiction nightmare movie beyond
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:17.680]  anything we could ever imagine the fully developed child struggles and fights
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:24.880]  for its life with heart beating on a stainless steel table I mean this is the
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.480]  reality it's what they don't want you to see it they got 3d ultrasound banned by
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.520]  non-medical doctors because clinics were doing it just people wanted photos of
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.280]  their kids but people were stopping who were pregnant who were gonna get an
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.720]  abortion and seeing it was a human and weren't wanting to do it this is a
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.440]  classic example of them trying to keep us in the dark what headline should we
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.600]  run with and repost this I like the ones that you came up with I mean really
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:55.000]  helped stop the slaughtering and sale of living fetuses black market I mean
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.160]  something like that I don't know but it's baby fights for its life at Oregon
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:06.200]  harvesting facility yeah that's yeah that's true each every one of those
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.040]  headlines is true I mean it's oh my gosh it's I'll tell another really gross
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:15.480]  story one time my uncle who's died last year lived out in Fredericksburg and we
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.120]  were driving down the road next to his little ranch and we saw a deer for a few
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.400]  days that had been tied up you know had run and jump and got caught in a you
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.800]  know cattle fence and they'll struggle and get wound up and it was next to dead
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:37.320]  eyes had been gobbled out by birds but it was still alive and we you know I
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.520]  pulled out of AK-47 and you know shot it and then pulled it out of the fence and
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.080]  I didn't enjoy killing the deer I mean but it did it a genetic level felt good
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.480]  to put it out of its pain that makes sense yeah that makes sense I mean you
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.880]  know the suffering that's what we were talking about earlier with it the long
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.520]  term suffering and I see this with cancer patients year after year they're
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.760]  suffering and suffering diabetes they suffer then they lose their leg because
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.760]  of ulcers arthritis they can't walk I mean we have a society right now that
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:13.880]  treats degenerative disease so people suffer how many people do you know over
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:18.000]  the age of 40 that don't have some condition they suffer from whether it's
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.960]  obesity whether it's a joint pain headaches cancer diabetes heart disease on
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.600]  multiple metaphors all going up you know it's it's a long-term suffering that's
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:33.280]  exactly what's happening in America today it's a soft kill and and I tend to
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.160]  start telling stories or analogies that never finishing them that's how my
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.480]  brain works but these are children that didn't need to be suffering and be
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.920]  tortured I was just using the example of the empathy I have when I see an animal
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.680]  struggling and hating seeing it so I put it out of its misery well I didn't make
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:53.960]  the deer jump in the fence or I didn't make the baby bird have fire ants go up
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.200]  in the tree and get it and you know it falls out of the tree with this you
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.800]  can't deal with it because it's it's being done by these ghouls who want to
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.720]  keep people in the dark but I do think it's the helplessness and the
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.360]  struggling of the little baby and you realize what bullies these people are
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.600]  what lying bullies and you want to protect that child and not because I'm
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:21.240]  Mr. Goody two shoes or knight in shining armor it's at a genetic level seeing the
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:26.840]  young of our species being pissed on excuse my French being devalued being
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:32.360]  debased being executed being tortured and I didn't do anything and watching all
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.440]  these people that call themselves liberals smack their lips and tell me
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.000]  how they're moral and high and mighty when I know secretly they're a bunch of
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.400]  highl Hitler Nazis go ahead well you know that's why that's why we're
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:56.400]  trying to get out the good solutions to stop this abuse and to stop this attack
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.800]  and let people know that you do have the ability to heal yourself you do have
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.280]  the ability to reactivate your own self-healing mechanism you don't have
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.240]  to suffer anymore we could put a stop to all this if people stand up and people
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.360]  already are standing up people are becoming more educated looking at the
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:17.720]  positive side of things people are taking advantage of the technology that's
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.680]  out there to improve their own health they are waking up and realizing that
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:27.160]  they're going down the stairs of health one step at a time and they need they
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.200]  can turn themselves around they they can get results and start seeing results
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.160]  in their body exactly we're not just about telling you the bad so you're
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.200]  aware of it that's important but about taking action I want to go to phone
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:42.840]  calls but briefly South Korea this is one of the biggest blow-ups they've ever
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.040]  had since the demilitarized zone was set up you were in army special operations
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.760]  you said most of the actual adventure you had an action you had from being a lot
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760]  of places in Europe and other places was in Korea there on the demilitarized
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.880]  zone what's your take on the latest developments well you know I was there
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.960]  for I was sent over there for the 1988 Olympics because North Korea was banned
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.200]  from the Olympics that year and I can tell you the North Koreans back then
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.680]  used a lot of psychological warfare they had a whole city set up right there on
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.880]  the border on the DMZ and they would play Blair music they're doing that again
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:24.360]  downs all night long to try to use psychological warfare on us we our unit
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.000]  never was involved in any firefights but the South Korean unit that was
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.400]  special operations was ahead of us on the border and they were involved in
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.320]  firefights practically every night we were there to back them up in case
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.160]  something happened so you know there's always been tension between North and
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.960]  South Korea doesn't surprise me that it's finally escalating as we're starting
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.760]  to see different things escalate all over the world right now especially with
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.000]  military powers so we'll see what happens with that it just seems like hell's
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.040]  breaking loose everywhere yeah that's what it seems like we're gonna go to your
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.800]  phone calls thank you for holding Jeff in Tennessee thank you for calling in
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:08.440]  today you're on the air hey Alex doctor group great talk to you guys just had a
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.640]  couple questions on nutrition I've actually got thought on from but I'm
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.440]  more interested in nutrition you know with the economy and everything is
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.040]  great as it is my pay has been cut I don't have as much money to buy
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:26.960]  supplements that I used to have just a couple things that I'm doing I'm 37
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.200]  years old drink apple cider vinegar couple tablespoons mixed in a quart of
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:38.360]  water been taking the brain force which I don't think I can say about brain force
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:44.840]  but I can really tell it does is when the stress is on mainly I'm very steady
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.360]  I can definitely tell it's a very it keeps my mind very focused very well
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.880]  exactly we put it out not to make you jittery we put it out with stuff that's
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.720]  really just components of the brain and Dr. Group didn't formulate this but he
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.400]  was just talking with me off air about what a good formula it is we went for
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.960]  one of the biggest top manufacturers and and said we want to put out your dream
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:10.280]  product because other companies don't want to put something on expensive that
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.400]  is for the producer I mean this really has expensive ingredients in it for a
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.920]  low price comparatively but that's why there's not even more caplets in there
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:24.520]  because it is so expensive for us so much of the cost really is the cost of the
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:29.280]  products why do you think brain force creates that steadying focus that's
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.000]  one reason I've been still upset yelling a lot but I people said why is he so calm
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.760]  why is he so more focused a lot of the time and it is the brain force well I'll
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.080]  tell you the reason why most people need brain supplements is because of the
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.800]  heavy metals and the aluminum and the geoengineering that's going on obviously
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.400]  they also need vitamin D which is very important so I don't know if you're on
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.240]  that but I would definitely recommend the winter sun what's happening with all
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.880]  this geoengineering in the chemtrails is it's designed to block the UVB rays and
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:04.600]  so your own body can create vitamin D so from from what you've said so far Jeff
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.520]  you're doing really good on a limited budget taking the things that you need
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:14.760]  ultimately you know with drinking extra water believe it or not actually stress
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.160]  is one of the things that causes a lot of health problems to exacerbate so much
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.280]  is breathing that's free meditation is free exercising but I mean we don't sell
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.360]  it we promote brag you believe it's the best auto to apple cider vinegar just
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.600]  daily is the game changer well you know everything's going towards gut health and
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:37.680]  that's why the oxy powder is so effective it helps heal the gut probiotics
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.040]  or the new thing that everybody needs to be talking about because everything
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.080]  really starts in the gut in the liver and also making sure that your liver is
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.080]  clean you have the liver shield here which is an incredible product that
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:53.280]  people can take to clean the liver every now and then let the liver function
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.560]  again because the liver is what really handles all the chemicals in the toxins
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.000]  and detoxifies them from your system so if you heal the gut heal the liver
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.800]  reduce your stress you're making serious strides to perfect health and that's why
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.160]  people are you know drinking you can drink kombucha tea you know for the
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.760]  fermented foods you know getting those good probiotics just a lifestyle change
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:19.600]  don't eat processed foods don't eat GMO drink a lot of water get more
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.960]  exercise and again I'm not mr. Beach boy but compared in the photos we put out to
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:30.480]  myself 10 years ago and now I mean I've lost 60 plus pounds of fat and I mean
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.400]  when I'm in a bathing suit people can really see it then we can dig up the
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.480]  photos I didn't plan to plug this stuff but I mean it's a massive difference
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:43.520]  anything else chef well I was also gonna say that I take the tangy tangerine I
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.340]  can definitely tell that that's a really good product the vitamin D you think
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:51.760]  that's a pretty good that would be something good to add to what you know
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.840]  those things that I'm doing what I've read from chemists and medical doctors
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:57.680]  and everybody is vitamin D really is a building block of everything isn't it
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.000]  group vitamin D and iodine are pretty much the building blocks that we've
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.920]  seen also people are deficient in B as well that's why we have the secret 12
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:12.240]  but I you know I take vitamin B I take the vitamin D and I take the iodine on
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.480]  either a daily or every other day at least a few times a week those are
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:20.200]  essential that you're going to need to function that there's receptor sites for
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:25.640]  every cell in the body and I think that uncovering it's about uncovering the
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.680]  agenda too and when you see and you look up and you look at okay why are they
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.600]  doing geoengineering or why are they taking iodine thank you then you
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.380]  realize that it's a combination of things why are they putting all the
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:43.280]  phthalates and all the BPA and all the plastic by the way you go and look at
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.160]  what they're doing to public school children in the sixth and seventh grade
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.880]  when they know they're not questioning fifth sixth seventh it was probably ten
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.320]  years ago we've dug it back up before if anybody's got it rescinded to us it was
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  on the prison planet forums how I found out about it and then the listener
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.080]  mailed me the textbook so it's somewhere around this giant office area and
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:10.280]  back there in storage the mainline national one of the most popular science
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.240]  textbooks used for sixth graders in the United States this was sent to us from
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.160]  Kansas City a KCXL listener still on that that fine affiliate and I'll never
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:26.000]  forget I mean I covered it for weeks it was in there telling the kids yes we
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.120]  added to the jet fuel barium salt some dioxide to block the UV rays it's going
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.840]  to give you cancer as to stop global warming and it's a project so the
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.440]  textbook government approved admits it then they tell us it doesn't exist we
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.320]  can go out and find the government funding for the program I mean there's
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.640]  just so much incredible secret stuff going on is what I'm getting at and then
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.360]  they'll sit right there I remember Time Magazine for Kids again about 12 years
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.080]  ago a listener mailed in it was Time Magazine for Kids and it said your
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.160]  parents are from a bygone age they don't know what they're doing you're smart
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.560]  you're gonna take chips under the skin you understand it was written like satire
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:08.760]  to an adult that it was just naked propaganda but that's targeting a sixth
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.880]  grader again like you're rebelling against your parents you're gonna get a
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.080]  chip knowing that when they're then 20 and then the chip comes out which is
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.200]  now happening they'll be subconsciously subliminally at that point when
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:26.040]  something's that old it's subliminal conditioned to accept taking the
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.480]  microchip that's how cold-blooded there I mean it's so systematic doctor group
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.400]  that's why they come out with all the movies too and all the cartoons and
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.000]  everything else they could just start at an early age to you know condition the
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:44.520]  minds I mean but on the positive note of that that's why you figure out okay
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.080]  what's going on with geoengineering I look at it as how is that affecting
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:53.360]  everybody's health okay it's blocking the UVB rays it's going to suppress vitamin
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.440]  D production every cell needs vitamin D that must mean that there's an agenda to
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.080]  block vitamin D and that's exactly what's going on because you can even
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.040]  trace that agenda back to the creation absolutely I meant to cover this for two
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.840]  weeks I forget what they're called but I was on the elliptical two weeks ago in
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:17.680]  Europe and I thought I was looking at a science fiction movie it looked bizarre
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:22.040]  of these lakes in California where they put like six million plastic spheres in
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:28.680]  it and it reduces something like 300% the amount of evaporation that's an
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:33.320]  example of a mass geoengineering program and maybe during the break we can show
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:36.720]  some footage of that but that's what these globalists are into they're
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.360]  terraforming the planet right now but to some new weird freaky design with
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:49.200]  aluminum in the soil that plants can't grow in I mean it is just crazy that all
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.160]  of this is happening and that all of this is unfolding we'll be right back
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.480]  stay with us Dr. Grim's my guest more calls straight ahead
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:03.280]  communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US

[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.640]  Dr. Gribut amazing individual good friend of mine we hang out my wife and
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:19.320]  he and family whenever he comes to town his wife and he gets me so excited the
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:22.560]  topics he brings up that I constantly interrupt it's very rude I apologize for
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.640]  it I've gotten better overall but we get into science discussions I start
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.880]  hyperventilating we're gonna hold him 15 minutes to the next hour and then get
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.720]  talked plumbly on with his breaking news I'm Benghazi so that he has time to
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:35.760]  take your calls because I'm always trying to get him in on topics he goes
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.200]  yeah I want to come into Austin but I want to talk to your listeners you know
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:43.040]  about their questions so we're going to go to your phone calls but on the
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:52.600]  shade ball issue they're putting 300 million they're saying these can save
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.720]  300 million gallons of water annually at one Los Angeles reservoir alone and
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:04.680]  they're putting millions of the shade balls in to the lake and when we show
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.200]  this video I'm sure you've all seen it already it's been out for weeks the
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:15.280]  entire lake is covered with the black balls and I just wonder what type of
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:19.600]  VOCs what type of bisphenols it's putting in the water now it's supposed to
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.560]  stop this algae that is linked to cancer okay great but this is an example of
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:31.280]  geoengineering when you talk about chemtrails the layman parochial term
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:38.960]  there is a giant quasi-secret program going on that the Arabs I can do by
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:45.680]  admits going on so just like harvesting babies organs is being kept secret you
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.680]  need to understand folks it's only quasi-secret it's only secret enough on
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:54.040]  the surface to have you not investigate it the Department of Energy admits they
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  spend five billion a year in geoengineering testing that's in close
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:06.360]  quotes because under US Code Title 30 chapter 32 section 1528 paragraph B any
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.280]  testing is legal as long as it's for research including lethal that's key
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:15.320]  don't read it for yourself US Code Title 50 chapter 32 and the other subsections
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:21.400]  I mentioned it says it's only legal unless for research purposes so who what
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:25.520]  we know about is so fantastical it makes my head spin dr. group we're gonna go to
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.720]  bright come back and take calls but what else do you think's going on we don't
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:35.080]  know about if what we already know is beyond science fiction well there's
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:39.080]  one thing that I know and that's to focus on the figuring out the solutions
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.040]  for each individual thing and you know you know that you have bad air that
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.240]  you're breathing so there's solutions to cleaning up the air quality by putting
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.320]  live plants in your home increasing the oxygen getting a good air purification
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.960]  system we know the water is bad so we can just make sure that we drink clean
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:57.200]  water with organic apple cider vinegar added to get the nutrients and the
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:02.600]  probiotics and the enzymes we know we can take a vitamin D supplement to combat
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:08.240]  the geoengineering scenario with the UVB rays and that's going to protect all
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:12.960]  of ourselves we know that we can take iodine to combat and decalcify the
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.480]  pineal gland and get rid of all the fluoride and the chlorine and the bromine
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:22.840]  that is toxic and that we're that they're exposing us to on a regular basis we
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.080]  know we need to clean our intestines on a regular basis and put the good
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:32.240]  probiotics in so it's really about yes we are being bombarded there are trails
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.480]  of these things going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper could you imagine
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:41.800]  being able to have the top globalist master plan and I admit they have these
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.640]  and actually see what the in-game is I mean we already see a lot of it a reduced
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:52.480]  population robots a new engineered planet with all these supply species it
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.680]  sounds like something the devil would do I don't think anybody that would is good
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.440]  it would be doing this that's for sure I mean there is a lot of negative and a
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:05.400]  lot of evil with also super dangerous it's extremely I mean what we're
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:11.240]  seeing is a sick and diseased planet a sick and diseased universe sick and
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:15.400]  diseased animals sick and diseased humans everything is sick and diseased
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.320]  and they're not trying to stop entropy they're trying to accelerate it that's
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.600]  right I mean but more and more people are figuring it out and there are
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.880]  solutions to it you have to learn how to live with it you have to learn how to
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.480]  come body you have to learn how to prevent it from affecting you and your
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.880]  family no I could write a science fiction book where aliens run the planet and
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.960]  this is all like a big test to like create the superhumans that are gonna
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:44.160]  survive what comes out of this and the ultimate prison planet that would make
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:49.720]  the prison planet from Dune look like a heavenly place Salusa Secundus introducing

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:11.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:19.440]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:26.720]  alex jones guys let's roll the footage of the millions of black balls that
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:32.320]  they're dumping in to LA reservoir and I saw this a few weeks ago I meant to
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.400]  cover this example of geoengineering be the hashtag black balls matter because
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.040]  they do we were talking earlier and dr. group said that's the worst color ever
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.400]  black it's gonna make bacteria grow under it it's gonna heat the water up and
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:51.640]  cause more of it to go into the air they claim us to stop bacteria and algae
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:56.360]  again I'm no rocket scientist but algae grows under stuff like that maybe they
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.880]  totally cover it they're right and I'm wrong but even Fox News and Nico just
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.640]  ran in with this and said LA black ball reservoir rollout potential disaster in
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:10.480]  the making say other experts and they say that the thirty four point five
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.840]  million dollar a tiny black plastic balls they're pretty big balls like
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:21.080]  anyways the point is like the baseball size a little bit smaller are saying
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.080]  like she grow bacteria and heat up the water same thing we said we're not I
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.880]  guess you're a scientist I mean any idiot could say why don't make the balls
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.840]  white that'll reflect the light back up what a reflectors white it ain't black
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:38.560]  black absorbs right he's the worst thing you can do is start messing with
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.640]  nature what you need to start doing is supporting nature plant but I mean we're
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:47.840]  not rocket scientists why aren't the balls white because over you don't even
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.520]  need balls in there all you need to do is just look at other solutions planting
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:02:00.760]  more trees do black balls matter that was a setup I'm not even gonna hashtag
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:08.080]  black hey Richard came up with it in my air just now people I think they pop
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:13.840]  it occasionally sorry yeah the guy that's like one of the front runners the
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.600]  campaign isn't even real do you hear about those things yeah I'm not trying

[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:38.800]  air go ahead Alex that was so funny man you can you can tell that you guys are
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.480]  good friends and I really appreciate it I refer to use the dynamic do I have a
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:49.440]  question for Dr. Group and I have a comment for you sir sure brother go
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:58.120]  ahead first of all okay good there is an agenda underway as you regularly state
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:04.160]  and depopulation and with regard to at least putting the population growth into
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:13.240]  remission and so I asked Dr. Group what does he feel is the purpose behind the
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:20.600]  introduction of dietary supplements such as this nicotinamide riboside which
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:29.240]  involves the dealing with a yeast cell manipulation of the DNA there and and
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.240]  advertising it as weight reduction anti-aging and libido enhancement
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:40.680]  cardiovascular health etc why are they doing this when we know that that's
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:48.240]  exactly the opposite of what they intend for us well always tell you the
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.360]  solution at least a treatment to the problem they've helped create I don't
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.880]  know what company you're talking about they may be great I'm not a you know
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.440]  chemist or expert like folks that Dr. Group works with Dr. Group do you know
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.920]  what he's talking about there's always some sort even though they make it look
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.400]  good out here in the marketing and everything there's always some alter
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:10.360]  ulterior motive that you have to look at and it might be as simple as some sort
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:14.680]  of a filler ingredient that they're putting in there it all comes down to
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.760]  simplicity though anything comes to you know when you look at all the stuff and
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.480]  all the research that I've done everything comes back to you have the
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:28.440]  ability to heal yourself prevent aging prevent stress everything if you just
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:32.640]  put a little bit of time and effort into your own body and that is the really
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.880]  the simple solution of reactivating your body's own self-healing mechanism and
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.160]  of course you do need some supplements and some things that they're just not
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:45.760]  available to help yourself you know preserve yourself and prevent
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.000]  degenerative illness all right hope that answers your question Brad God bless

[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:07.680]  security specialist saying many people in government believe the journalists
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.400]  who receive stones material are not capable of protecting it from a

[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:35.600]  then in the last segment of the broadcast I had asked McBreen and dude to
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:39.280]  put together something tied into red dawn they've kind of rushed this out but
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.000]  it's good they'll probably polish it up for next week but we're gonna air a
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.280]  special little red dawn intro that dovetails and ties into how our society's
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:55.120]  becoming like that movie itself many parallels in films that were showing
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.840]  dystopic tyrannies you now look around you it's become reality in many ways and
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:05.960]  we're here trying to reverse getting into the position where tyranny
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:10.160]  completely takes over really there's two parallel tracks liberty and tyranny
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.440]  and there's still a lot of freedom because we exercise it but the tyrants
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.040]  are trying to train us to get rid of it and to follow whatever order they say
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:24.280]  the largest homosexual group in the country just came out so used to I'd
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.480]  be nice and go if it makes you feel better I'll say gay I don't have anything
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.600]  against anybody but it's a political agenda using the fact that we're nice
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:35.840]  to go okay don't use the term husband and wife or boy and girl now and you're
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.840]  gonna go in a bathroom with women and your daughters are gonna go in bathrooms
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:42.440]  with men and you're gonna use the words we say well you know what I'm gonna use
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.440]  the word homosexual then how's that sound it's scientific just like had a
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.560]  bisexual it isn't attacking you and if I wanted to attack you I could it's my
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:53.080]  first amendment they're trying to get rid of free speech folks these people are
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.960]  totalitarians using different fake civil rights movements as they take all of our
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:03.080]  basic liberties I want to go to Adam I want to go to Andrew I want to go to
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.560]  James and others that have been patiently holding for dr. Edward group to
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.920]  answer your questions but any comment you talked a lot about the attack on the
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:15.520]  genders I mean again this is like a twilight zone episode that it's getting
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:19.840]  this naked do you think it's desperation by the system accelerating their
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:25.000]  timetable we've always known brave new world is a blueprint a owners manual not
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.800]  a fiction book in Huxley's own words his brother ran the UN Julian Huxley are
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:36.160]  they accelerating it because they're in trouble or because they're arrogant both
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:42.160]  probably it's all about money and power and control and you know if you have a
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:48.840]  whole society in a whole world that depends on credit cars and fake currency
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:54.440]  and the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies and the oil and gas industries
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  and is relying upon the government then you know that's the situation that they
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:06.960]  want I mean you're easily controllable you're sick all the time you can't think
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.480]  for yourself you're non-motivated I mean it's so hard to even find somebody to
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:16.760]  work these days you know the people we're interviewing you know half the
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:21.800]  time they'll show up in flip-flops and they'll want to dictate the hours to us
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:26.920]  so it's it's really a combination of things I think it's getting but at the
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:30.200]  same time they also know people are waking up and they know that people are
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:34.840]  turning away from medications they're also taking control of their health
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:41.960]  they're realizing what's going on so it's kind of you know it an attack against
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.440]  each other positive and negative right now and I think it's accelerating on the
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:51.320]  negative side but it's also accelerating on the positive side and we're caught
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.720]  right in the middle of these times right now especially with you know all these
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.560]  things leading leading up to financial collapse and all the other stuff and so
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:03.640]  it's real important I think for people to understand what they can do to help
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:06.880]  protect their bodies and help protect their families because you have to know
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:13.600]  the truth and then you can understand how the solutions to the truth so you can
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.600]  protect yourself sure who have we had holding the longest is it Andrew or
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.840]  Adam Andrew in New York thanks for holding her on the air go ahead hey
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:29.560]  Alex how's it going good brother all right well thank you for taking my call I
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:33.520]  really appreciate it thank you my question is for Dr. no thank you guys
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:39.280]  my question is for Dr. group you know that I'm really calling for my wife here
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:44.480]  and just so happens that she developed a cyst on her ovary a couple of months ago
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:50.080]  and it really had been affecting her right side as it's on her right ovary what
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:55.480]  recommendations do you have the health detox or to minimize the effect of the
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:00.040]  six we already been to a doctor and gave her some hormones it really messed up
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:03.880]  every her whole balance of everything so you know we're a little concerned about
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:08.600]  the process here and what we can do well obviously he can't sit here and engage
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:11.360]  in medicine or whatever or his recommendations over the phone because
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.920]  he hasn't examined your wife and that's probably not his particular area but
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:19.560]  what would you do yourself with your wife what would your wife do dr. group well
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:25.640]  what I always look at is what is the root cause of a woman getting any type of
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:32.600]  ovarian cysts and the root cause of that is toxic food toxic water toxic beverages
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.800]  toxic air but really what we've noticed over the time is the accumulation of
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.040]  phytoestrogens estrogen dominance that's why the medical profession with
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:45.360]  hormones most of the time it doesn't work and their only solution is to go in
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:50.640]  and do a hysterectomy or do surgery and take the the cysts out what I would do
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.040]  is I would address the root cause of the problem which is most likely iodine
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:02.680]  deficiency you can link that to practically 99.5% of all ovarian cysts and
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.160]  for that matter any cysts in the body can be linked to an iodine deficiency so
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:12.440]  I know when cows and horses won't get pregnant they up the iodine in their
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.600]  range cubes or in their candies they call them candies or cereals but they're
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:21.000]  basically just mineral and and vitamin bars sometimes with some molasses in
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.720]  them as a treat right so what you want to do is get rid of all the fluoride
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.480]  intake that's coming in get rid of any type of chlorine exposure a lot of skin
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.440]  care products believe it or not can cause ovarian cysts because they're high
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.880]  in fragrances and phthalates and plastics and those are endocrine
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:42.080]  disrupting chemicals so so all the weird hormones that are artificial get in
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:46.240]  there and then just jack with it and then they want to mask the fact that
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:48.800]  that's happening with more hormones it's like when five-year-olds go into
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:52.800]  puberty now I hear they give them hormones to suppress it not hey get your
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.560]  kid off the GMOs you know why is your five-year-old going into puberty now
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.560]  it's over leave you more hormones to suppress that right it's not that hard
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.520]  when you just look at the problem and then the root cause of the problem and
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.480]  work on it that way instead of addressing the symptoms which is what
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.200]  standard medicine does you address the root cause and that's cleaning up her
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:18.000]  diet drinking pure clean water and supplementing with iodine vitamin D
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.880]  also vitamin B and utilizing the body self-healing mechanism to eradicate that
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:29.320]  cyst over a period of time God bless you sir hope your wife gets better I mean
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:33.200]  they admit ovarian cyst thyroid problems in women I see the studies the
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:37.280]  articles they're just off the charts and you go to medical doctors most of them
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.680]  some are good and they just say oh here's this here's that they don't even
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:47.720]  ask why is this increasing they don't ask why is breast cancer up right they
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.360]  don't want to know I mean the reason is they're making too much money treating
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.320]  breast cancer and they're making too much money from all the people out there
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.680]  that are contributing thousands of dollars to all these pseudo organizations
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:03.960]  like the walk for breast cancer millions of dollars they make millions per
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:09.200]  event and all this other stuff which all they're doing is feeding the problem
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.040]  and it's going around in a circle and why is it always find the cure great how
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:19.360]  about find why it's exploding and stop it exactly about find the reason that's
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.920]  how you really stop it the cure is find out and be like a cyanide was in a
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:26.760]  well in a water supply and half the town was dying you wouldn't say let's find a
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:31.320]  cure to cyanide you'd say stop drinking the water there's been many a people that
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.000]  have come up with the cure including us when we were shut down in 1998 when we
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.520]  had our cancer and degenerative disease clinic and many doctors killed over it
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.280]  because they don't want the information out to the public member and member in
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.240]  Australia about four years ago the headline came out that big pharma
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:54.200]  plan to kill doctors and and people that were criticizing vaccines and drugs and
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:58.200]  it said stuff like we need to take this person out in the memos well that's what
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.720]  happened take them out from the 20s to the 50s they pretty much burned all the
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.720]  natural books they took out all that they outlawed all the natural springs
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.120]  across the nation which people used to go drink the water and and bathe in the
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.240]  springs to restore their health they the AMA is actually just now launching a
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:21.960]  whole attack against medical doctors that are using any type of natural methods
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:24.800]  so I mean there's a there's a there's always been an attack and there's a
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:28.920]  continued attack except now that we have the internet people are actually
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.640]  waking up and they're seeing the reviews from third parties where we half the
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:37.120]  time we can't even post the reviews of all these people up there that are
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:41.760]  getting such good results and it's changing people's lives and we have the
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:45.680]  opportunity every day to go home and say we made a difference in absolute life
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.720]  today let's go to adam in colorado thanks for holding her on the air hi Alex
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.080]  doctor group welcome my question when my question for doctor group was about
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:59.920]  gallbladders I don't have one and I was just wondering what I'm in for and Alex
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.320]  I was going to humbly ask your permission to use your voice and my
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:10.600]  Kickstarter campaign for in for the game well I'd have to see what you're
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.440]  planning and I'd have to sign off on it I can't just you know I can't just give
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.080]  people permission to this or that but I'll tell you you have fair use rights
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.600]  because I'm a public figure to use samples of me in a video game a movie
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:29.400]  whatever without asking it's just it can't be a huge substantive part because
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:32.680]  then if I say people can do that I've had them actually then say oh really I
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:38.240]  own your show David Ike had that happen to him we said oh yeah people can you
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:41.600]  know copy this or using they said oh guess what you can't now it's not yours
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:48.200]  either so there's a double side to that but what's your commoner question for
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.600]  group my friend well he was asking about his gallbladder removed let me just
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:55.520]  touch on that again it's one of those things where if you have problems with
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:59.160]  your gallbladder and you're having the pain is that have one medicine takes it
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.480]  out exactly what happened to him set of doing the gallbladder cleanse so what
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.000]  you want to do is you want to do a liver cleanse and now that you have a gallbladder
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.920]  removed your liver has to take on all the jobs of the gallbladder so it's
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:17.080]  even more important to keep yourself doing eating clean drinking clean
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.280]  breathing clean and also doing at least two to three liver cleanse if you have
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:26.840]  the money what about a glutathione IV well any IVs from a from a qualified
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:30.720]  natural practitioner always going to be good if you have the money for that
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:35.600]  that's great but it's still not going to purge the liver it's like oil pulling
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:39.480]  when you do that oil on day five or day six whatever liver cleanse you're doing
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:43.640]  that I can actually grabs and pulls all those toxins out and yeah I mean if you
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.280]  look what's in your gallbladder giant green and black balls almost everybody
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.160]  has an imagine not having that where does all that stuff go it goes in the
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:54.720]  liver it's stored in the liver that's good lord some people hey we're out of
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:58.640]  time Tosh Blumlee coming up great job Dr. Group thank you so much you're gonna

[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:09.600]  protect you from electronic pick pocketing ten years ago I created a way
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:12.640]  to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:16.840]  talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:20.520]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:25.080]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:30.080]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID it was
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:33.560]  then I formed ID stronghold to share my inventions and blocking RFID signals
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:37.520]  with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:42.200]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected please go to ID stronghold

[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:51.280]  whistleblowers in the congressional hearings with Frank Church then in the
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:57.400]  Iran Contra hearings in the 80s and he could not lose his job because he was a
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:01.960]  legitimate whistleblower continued to fly clandestine aircraft for the CIA and
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:07.120]  the Defense Department around the world he retired two years ago Facebook.com
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:12.520]  Robert.plumbly.5 will take you directly to his Facebook or just Google
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:16.600]  Robert.plumbly and one of the first things that comes up is his Facebook
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:26.320]  will tweet out his Facebook at real Alex Jones and he joins us now because he's
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.440]  the first person to name names and come out from his Pentagon and NATO source
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:35.360]  exactly what Hillary was doing the weapons transfer how she was using the
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:39.680]  State Department to ship weapons so that the Pentagon and others couldn't have
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:43.560]  control and Congress couldn't see it we now know she had third world dictators
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.360]  giving her money at her foundation that made two billion dollars two billion
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:53.480]  dollars to then take export bans off we know she sent the weapons to al-Nusra
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:26:02.560]  al-Qaeda that's now ISIS I want him to condense and just focus in on the time
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:07.720]  we have the day I appreciate him coming on now Hillary and the secret emails is
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.000]  coming out and he's got questions for her specifically that we'll get to in the
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:17.320]  next segment only had a few minutes left in this short one but Robert I got to
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.440]  tell you it's good news that Clinton's in so much trouble and I think they want
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.160]  to bring her down because they know Benghazi's coming out but that would end
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:29.720]  up bringing down the whole government so they want to burn her for smaller stuff
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:33.840]  ahead of time what do you think well I think I think you're right there Alex
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.400]  and again thanks thanks very much for having me on I appreciate that thank you
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:43.640]  sir for your courage what I think about that yeah I think there's getting ready
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:47.520]  to be a big explosion not just on the Hillary thing but all the way back to
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:54.960]  Benghazi and prior to Benghazi where I come in if you remember we talked about
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.800]  this on your program about two years ago from information received about
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:07.000]  Stinger missiles about weapons from the direct commercial sales program and
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.640]  also weapons being pilfered from Libyan bunkers they were going back into the
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:20.480]  CINX at that point during that time frame that was partially vetted but
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:25.720]  not completely vetted like it has been over this email scandal with Clinton
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:32.440]  there's much more than just this email scan scandal with Clinton in reference
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:37.560]  to the international gun running that has been going on which eventually
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:43.160]  involved Ambassador Stevens and the death of massacre of Ambassador Stevens
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:51.640]  and the other of his crew were the information that I had received was
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:55.720]  covered on your program and other programs and also posted on my Facebook
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:01.240]  page under the heading of international gun running it was alleged at that point
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:04.680]  that there were Stinger missiles that had gotten into radical hands out of
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:12.400]  Syria and that was a question that was being asked to the State Department at
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:18.720]  that time through a series of dispatches by the ambassador on what to do about
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:26.240]  that information about what what they should do I mean you know so so now
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:30.760]  what I wanted to bring up here and I'm trying not to ramble we're trying to
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:36.560]  work into this and be a little more concise there's a thing called skiff and
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:41.160]  that's in the Pentagon and and basically what it is it's like a clearing house
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:49.040]  like a fusion house it's a skiff see SCIF is a sensitive compartmented information
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:57.160]  facility all information for instance like emails from ambassadors intelligence
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:02.400]  gathering from where they'd be NATO or France or Germany or whatever all this
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:06.480]  information goes into a skiff or a clearing house like a clearing house
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:11.520]  those things are in the ball you on the Pentagon the White House situations room
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:16.680]  all this kind of stuff goes into what they call a skiff those things are
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:23.160]  extremely sensitive I mean if you take any information out of the skiff
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:28.880]  outside that facility you're in violation period it's a felony it's
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:32.560]  espionage stay there you've got experience with this walk us through it
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:37.240]  18-minute segment coming up you're gonna have the floor completely Tosh to lay
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:42.080]  this out from the inside so people understand exactly how criminal Hillary
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:47.080]  is and now we know what you said two plus years ago here it's all Hillary out
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:52.840]  of the State Department we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:56.800]  and the GCN radio network
[02:29:56.800 --> 02:30:07.000]  is America ready for D's nuts well if the polls are any indication a 15-year-old
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000]  high school sophomore from Iowa going by the moniker D's nuts is polling better
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.920]  than most Republicans in fact D's nuts who takes his name from a punk band is
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:21.640]  the most popular independent candidate since Ross Perot also known as Brady
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:26.560]  Olson D's nuts says his mission is to give Americans an alternative to the two
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:32.400]  party system in 2016 D's nuts is more popular than Fiorina Huckabee and Walker
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:36.000]  and there's been no word from the candidates on how it feels being beaten

[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:15.080]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:29.680]  this is big news ladies and gentlemen I mean I look back on some of the guests
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:37.760]  we've had on Tosh Plumling in the top 5 or 10 biggest whistleblowers ever not
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:42.880]  just on this show but in the country's history I mean we've had almost all the
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:51.720]  top NSA whistleblowers on in some cases first and I just think God I'm still
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:56.680]  alive but it shows how many good people there are in governments in companies
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:34:01.000]  out there most people in the government are very thankful for what Tosh
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  Plumling is doing and for what we're doing that's why we end up getting the
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.680]  information the problem is there's bad guys in government the higher you go the
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:15.520]  more of them there are and they don't like us the safety because a lot of people
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.200]  been killed we that I've interviewed this I mean flat out murdered the safety
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:24.960]  is in getting more people to speak out and tell the truth and then they can't
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:28.920]  stop us that's why they've been persecuting whistleblowers going after
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:33.440]  the press so bad the last six seven years is to create a chilling effect very
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:37.320]  bold move but because of political correctness Obama got away with
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:41.000]  persecutions of the press and of whistleblowers that Bush could have never
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.640]  gotten away with I mean it's been unprecedented so Tosh Plumling Robert
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:51.200]  Tosh Plumling has laid it all out in articles and documents on his website
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:55.680]  but here it is foreign governments gave millions the foundation while Clinton
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.840]  was the State Department and man I mean they'd give a million bucks they'd give
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:04.120]  two million dollars two billion total and the next week she'd take an export
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.760]  ban off now who'd ever heard of this export import you know section of the
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:12.080]  State Department for weapons well you heard it if you listen here and Plumling
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:17.360]  said that's how she was doing it not just allowing the shipments she was doing
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.160]  it so who knows what's in there and that's why Hillary thought she could get
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:28.360]  away with this is that so many companies and others are involved in all this arm
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:32.960]  smuggling that they're not gonna want this to come out so what does it mean
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:36.960]  that it is coming out I'm gonna give Mr. Plumling the floor now for the next 16
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.640]  minutes we have left this segment to walk through how this works how these
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:45.240]  documents go into these clearing houses what it means she had a second set of
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:49.720]  books remember the head of the EPA had a step down over fake email this is all
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:54.840]  illegal wiping her server is is obstruction of justice now she's saying
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:59.760]  oh it was classified retroactively all the State Department internal
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.360]  communications are secret they're all restricted so again she's playing on the
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:09.240]  public's ignorance Tosh Plumling I go ahead and lay it out for us okay well
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.720]  thank you Alex I appreciate all those nice comments I have been blessed in
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:19.120]  some cases I've been cursed sometimes we know sometimes we don't want to know
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:24.000]  the things we know they're just given to us one of the reasons that a lot of
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.440]  people are coming forward in the past few years is because we have watched us
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:33.880]  intelligence sources have watched a slow steady infiltration political
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:39.640]  infiltration implementing gatekeepers within places like skiffs and and now
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:47.280]  DIA and various places to suck up and make sure that the general public does
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:51.520]  not find out the illegal stuff that's going on in reference to international
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:55.720]  gun-running there's more money and heard me say this before on your program
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:01.320]  there's more money and and gun-running than there is in drug-running I've been
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:06.160]  blessed as you say to be on both sides of the fence now when we went on break
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:11.240]  before we were getting into a skiff when I came on your program back I think it
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:17.320]  was 2013 or 2012 you were one of the first programs that I made the allegation
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:22.320]  that there were stinger missiles missing from our arsenal I made the
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:26.960]  allegation that there was high impact weapons and and Libyan bunkers that
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:32.920]  were not secure I made the allegation at that point in time that and it's
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:36.840]  recorded before the fact and I did that for my own protection before the fact
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.800]  because sometimes sunshine is the best defense people like me and others have
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:46.560]  but at that point in time the ambassador was also aware of this
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.880]  information and was sending a series of emails back and forth but to the State
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:58.480]  Department now the information that I had given to your program was obtained
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:04.080]  from a very sensitive NATO or three very sensitive NATO sources in Ukraine
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:11.400]  around Ukraine and it involved these Libyan weapons that were getting pilfered
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:17.520]  onto the black market and involved some of the stinger missiles I publicly went
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:23.720]  out and said that before the fact now the way it works that information had
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:29.640]  already been filtered back to the proper agencies and it was within what they
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:35.840]  called a skiff now skiff is like a fusion center of a civilian fusion center
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:41.400]  except a skiff is a DIA Pentagon military whatever and it's like a clearing
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:47.360]  house where all the information worldwide goes into different compartments
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:55.880]  and skiff simply means it's SCIF and it's a sensitive compartmented
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:01.400]  information facility it's a facility it's an intelligence gathering facility
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:10.640]  now those facilities are so secure that even if you misplace your badge and you
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:16.240]  can't swipe to get into that that deal you've got to go through hoops I
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:21.880]  unimaginable hoops from different people in security well as you've got to go to
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:25.360]  the security office you've got to talk to this guy you've got to do that you've
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:28.760]  got to explain to them why you don't have your badge you got to explain why
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:35.200]  that badge does not work I mean before you can even launch and get inside that
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:41.360]  skiff now also when you get ready to complete your tour of duty for that day
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.440]  that hour at that skiff you are cleared out of that skiff if you take I mean
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.120]  they look in your bar I mean they look in your your pants in some cases you've
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.920]  got to unzip your pants to a security agent if he wants you to do that to make
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.000]  sure that you're not stuffing like a fond whatever of putting stuff in her
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.560]  brazier when they were working in the hernality and all the north were working
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:11.480]  inside the Pentagon so you can't get stuff out of a skiff if you do or you even
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.120]  attempt to you're immediately in violation of security and if you have a
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:20.120]  security clearance even without due process of going to court that security
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:25.000]  clearance is immediately pulled at that point in time until you can
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.720]  substantiate and prove to security that you're not doing espionage or you're not
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.800]  taking that information out to sell it or divulge it to the media or whatever
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:40.920]  oh it's if they even suspect that that's what you're doing your security
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:47.320]  clearance at that point is suspended now what does this mean in far as Hillary
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:52.960]  Clinton I have no axe to grind grind against the Clintons otherwise I'm not
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.520]  political I could care less you know I mean I you know I mean I could talk
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:00.560]  about it I could so but that's not what I'm here for I'm gonna try to stay
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.960]  focused on this one thing information came to a skiff now I'm gonna pull it
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:12.000]  back to you and I I came on your program and I released information that was
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  currently going to skiffs but it hadn't got there yet I was I jumped the gun I
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.840]  got the Nato information before my source he said hey we're gonna make our
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:26.240]  classified field reports and you know what happens from there yes I do you
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.920]  won't believe what's going on over here Tosh we have C-130s on a daily basis
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:35.520]  coming in with tons and tons of arms and ammunition that are being assimilated out
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.080]  into bunkers in Libya wow I thought there's a lot thought they were already
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.000]  in bunkers they're telling me that this information is going to CIA safe houses
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:51.520]  and Jordan Turkey and Pakistan I'm thinking wow man I can't I can't report
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:55.800]  this until I know specific you've got to give me more than just what you say
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:05.360]  well a few days later it came out I came on your program and it was not
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.800]  released at the skiff first you were the skiff that that information was
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:15.160]  released to you and three other alternative media programs that
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:21.720]  information was released at that point in time if I had still had a security
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:27.240]  clearance at that point right there my clearance would have been lifted I was
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:30.960]  I would have been in trouble I would have I would have to stand in front of the
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:38.640]  Attorney General and explain my actions of why I talked to you now that was an
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.760]  allegation it was not some of it wasn't proven at that point in time that's
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:46.640]  to you that's two years ago now I don't want to run your overtime there and I
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.680]  don't know keep going it's more than two years ago you you're on record but
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:54.440]  please continue because getting into okay now Hillary's House of Cards is
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:57.160]  coming down it's now in the news that Obama is
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.920]  carpetoing her campaign there's in fighting going on all right now at the
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:08.760]  same same time that this information was going the Attorney General and the DOJ
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:15.400]  was persecuting people for misplacing emails so classified emails were being
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:22.280]  misplaced or sections of those emails were being recapped to friends just in
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:26.240]  general conversations and they were brought to trial one of them is doing
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:29.880]  three and a half years in prison because he released a sensitive email that was
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:42.720]  that had been classified by a skiff now if I had taken servers home during my
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:48.360]  career and put them in that deal I was immediately supposed to notify security
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:52.400]  and they were supposed to take the secret service out to my house and make
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:58.920]  that house classified as a skiff in order for me to be able to have that
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:03.640]  information in my possession at that particular house whether it be on a
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.880]  non-classified server or even a government server which security had to
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:16.480]  be set up at my house in order to have that information at that location my
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:21.080]  question I'm leading up to is why is there a double standard in the security
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.760]  apparatus of this country that allows people and I'm not going to say just
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:31.280]  Clinton I'm going to say others Petraeus got in a lot of trouble because he took
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:36.600]  a bunch of printed documents and put them in a drawer and they used a
[02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:42.440]  sexual scandal and those deals to bring that man down and destroy his whole
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:49.920]  career for the rest of his life over what he had a few papers maybe a hundred
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:55.200]  maybe 500 maybe a thousand maybe a whole damn book or maybe just one paper but
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:02.600]  the point is he had them in a non-secure facility they were not in a
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:09.760]  compartmentalized security they were scattered now we come up here and we've
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:17.400]  got a very high echelon a secretary of state that now is sort of claiming
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:25.880]  someone else did this she didn't know look I'll testified and I was warned Mr.
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:32.400]  Plumlee if you discuss this outside this room you will be charged they even tried
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:36.280]  to file a charge on me when I was going to write a book and that was way many
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:40.720]  years ago in 1980 and I was going to write a book called the Black Knights of
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:44.400]  Cuba and then I was going to write a book called Deep Cover Shallow Graves I
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:49.280]  was and then I was notified you've got to turn that manuscript over to them so
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.400]  that they can review it and redact because you're giving up methods and
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:55.680]  procedures and you've taken things out of the skiff that you wouldn't
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:59.840]  authorize to do Mr. Plumlee you're going to go to jail if you continue on this
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:05.600]  road now I don't want to get all hypered up here but also got IRS down on me for
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:10.000]  a total of 10 years because I was messing with skiff stuff classified
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.760]  information I was I testified to committees I was in the committees had
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:18.840]  kind of classified my testimony top secret committee sensitive and that meant
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:23.920]  that when I went back to review a year later to review to make sure and
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:27.840]  initially each paragraph that that information was right they told me I
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:31.200]  couldn't see that information because it had since been classified and I didn't
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  have a clearance so therefore I was a gag if I went out and talked about what I
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:40.960]  had done through Iran Contra the tail numbers the aircraft numbers working
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:44.280]  with Barry Seale working with all kinds of different people talking about
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:49.520]  San Alina Costa Rica I just violated a whole bunch of them just now so you know
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:53.760]  I mean what was all that man it means Hillary Clinton thinks she's above the
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:58.260]  law but obviously she isn't and when you talk about the State Department and arms
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:03.680]  smuggling and that Hillary was involved that is now years later all come out this
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:09.240]  is a big big deal and then you've got questions for Hillary we should go over
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:13.320]  some of these questions talk appreciate that yeah you do them I don't have my
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.280]  copies here because I can't get on their Facebook let's go over some of these
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:25.720]  some of these questions miss Clinton while you were Secretary of State were
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.120]  you aware that the U.S. weapons were being obtained from U.S. arsenals and
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:33.160]  Libyan bunkers and being transferred to CIA contract employees in Jordan and
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:37.640]  Turkey number two were you Ambassador Stevens the U.S. State Department
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:45.120]  aware U.S. weapons it continues were you Ambassador Stevens in the U.S. State
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:49.640]  Department aware U.S. weapons were being pilfered from those stockpiles and
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.120]  being sold on the black market in Libya effectively falling into radical
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:57.840]  factions operating in and out of Syria number three were you aware that
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:02.000]  Ambassador Stevens was concerned about the loss of American weapons and if he
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.240]  mentioned this in a series of dispatches the U.S. State Department while you were
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:09.680]  Secretary of State you go on to say these are some of the main questions why
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:14.040]  are these the most important questions Tosh well those are questions that are
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:20.200]  embedded within that skiff that I made reference to you so a question if she
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.600]  says yes or she says I cannot answer those those are a matter of classified
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.000]  that's classified information or just a flat standard answer I can't answer that
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:35.560]  I can't answer that I can't answer that why did you take that questions home
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:40.280]  with you why did you take that sensitive information that you just admitted by
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:44.960]  not answering yes or no to those three questions let alone the 11 Benghazi
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:52.560]  questions why is it that you can't answer those three simple questions yes or no
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:58.160]  did you know that Ambassador Stevens had contacted the State Department
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.240]  requesting what he should do with the information that he had received that
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:10.960]  radicals out of Syria had just received 400 stinger missiles from the U.S.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:17.200]  arsenals that were shipped on C-130s to the Middle East now if they say oh well
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.160]  that's an allegation get the flight plans of the C-130s and the refueling from
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:26.480]  the 339th or whatever I just did something there I shouldn't have done
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:33.320]  but there were a lot of things I shouldn't done but get asked those
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:39.960]  questions if she said no and later we find out through the emails when they're
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:42.720]  going to be scrubbed I mean they've been scrubbed but they're going to be found
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:45.800]  there's going to be enough information come out that at least will point in
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:51.240]  that direction that she did know and she took that information home so she can't
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:58.080]  answer that as a classified did she make the judgment but that question is a
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:02.800]  classified question if she had that kind of sense then she can't how well
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:07.600]  obviously that's why the head of the EPA had to resign was using a dummy email
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.680]  and and known to plumes I mean Hillary did the same thing with code names she
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.600]  was doing illegal activity and who knows that these are even all the emails that
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.000]  they say they've turned over and it's all scrubbed I mean right there she is as
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:25.600]  guilty as a cat caught in the canary cage let me ask you this when we come
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:29.480]  back to us we got to go to break okay why do you think they're going after I
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:33.480]  mean I think they're going after on smaller things you agreed because they

[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:48.440]  my way where we had a case and cancer they call it so part of it is we have to

[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:30.480]  people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:37.440]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques these people
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:41.000]  are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.840]  disloyal to the United States it's our right and our obligation to segregate
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:49.280]  them from the normal community
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:56:01.280]  this is what we're doing here unless not a kid about it we're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens

[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:50.560]  understand that we're under social engineering and that it's classical

[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:32.520]  nightly news tonight she just ran in here in second you asked Robert Tosh
[03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:37.000]  Plumlee who got cut off by the break to you know repeat that so there's not
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:42.280]  music playing over it absolutely you know to restate what he said I had asked
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:46.240]  the question and I'll do it again right now and go to him Robert they're
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:51.280]  clearly throwing Hillary under the bus now now they're saying in the Washington
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:56.200]  Times Obama is quote torpedoing her campaign I think she's a vile horrible
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:00:59.720]  person but clearly you're non-political you've said you want the truth of
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:04.560]  Benghazi to come out a do you agree with me that it looks like she's in deep
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:09.560]  trouble they may be getting ready to flusher and then be why would they be
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:15.200]  doing that right now Tosh Plumlee well okay we're in a diversion right now
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:19.640]  zeroed in on Clinton and emails emails that were taken classified emails that
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:23.840]  were taken out of the deal the reason that they're zeroing in on this dog and
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:28.520]  pony show and and the Trump and all this and stuff is simply for one reason my
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:35.800]  opinion and also documented the Benghazi murder massacre was only because the
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:40.400]  ambassador found out about a very secret international gun-running operation
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:46.000]  that had involved us stinger missiles and he had the opportunity to purchase
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:52.960]  those stinger missiles back to get them off of the the international market so
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:56.680]  he could buy those stinger missiles back this is classified information that I'm
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:01.000]  talking about this is the kind of information that is in those gifts now
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:06.280]  he had an opportunity to buy that at that back so they were told to stand down
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:10.920]  shortly after that he's dead the reason that she's being thrown out of the bus
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:16.080]  and the reason for this diversion is that they will not let us get into the
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:20.960]  fact that the ambassador had uncovered this a gun-running operation and was
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:26.240]  asking the state U.S. State Department how he should handled it what should he
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:30.760]  do with this information that he had received from on the ground boots on
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:35.360]  the ground informants some of them American some of them NATO if you
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:40.680]  remember NATO went into those Libyan bunkers to clear them out where did that
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:45.840]  where did that where did those weapons go and what were those weapons this is
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:51.240]  what they don't want us to know and you also use the term secret government
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:57.320]  repeat that talk about the secret government and how it operates well we
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:02.360]  have a segment and I don't want to get into conspiracy stuff and so on like
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:08.720]  that but we have a situation this goes all the way back to before Kennedy that
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:13.880]  has been gradually I call it the American slow coup d'etat we have a an
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:18.800]  element whether it be international whether it be whatever and I don't get
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:23.600]  into all that kind of stuff but we have a situation that has been developing for
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:30.440]  years a slow and gradual infiltration into the CIA into various political
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:36.880]  organizations and it is like a secret government within itself they manipulate
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:41.240]  they are the gatekeepers they stop information like what I'm talking about
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:46.040]  they've tried to stop me for a lot of years you know but that's the problem
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:51.840]  right now so now this situation of exposing this gun-running operation
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:55.880]  that goes all the way back to at least Iran Contra and that's what Iran
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:04:01.440]  Contra same MO you get an operation going you operate it you tweak it you
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:05.120]  dust it off you put it on the shelf and then at the proper time you bring that
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:09.080]  operation back you modify it a little bit and you put it back out in the field
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:14.400]  for operatives like me to carry out or others so again back to what you asked
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:17.840]  me what they're doing they're throwing Hillary under the bus they're giving us
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:23.160]  a dog and pony show they're contaminating they work if I knew sources they won't
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.760]  let senior editors ask certain questions the three questions that you did that I
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:31.880]  just asked to ask Hillary Clinton why doesn't our mainstream media just ask
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:35.920]  her those three sure this is obviously the scandals tied to Benghazi why won't
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.760]  they put the horse with the carriage so so to sum it up what you just said to
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:43.640]  sum it up in one sentence the cover-up is international gun-running into
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:49.120]  Benghazi that got an ambassador murdered mass not murdered massacred massacred
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:53.480]  all right stay there Tosh we're coming back with phone calls straight ahead in

[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:33.920]  just a moment former CIA contractor whistleblower on Benghazi other points
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:38.200]  you'd like to add before we go to these calls Robert well just other than the
[03:08:38.200 --> 03:08:42.720]  summit up that we talked about this as an allegation what three years ago two
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:47.200]  and a half three years ago and now it's all those allegations from two and a
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:51.080]  half three years ago that was out here on your program have now been confirmed
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:55.920]  from more than one source from multiple sources and including mainstream media
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:00.320]  who has been extremely reluctant over the years to even touch this stuff
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:04.960]  because of gatekeepers that imposed upon them the senior editors that keep
[03:09:04.960 --> 03:09:09.480]  good reporting reporters from doing their job reporting this stuff this
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:14.200]  information that I'm talking to you on your camera eyeball eyeball about has
[03:09:14.200 --> 03:09:18.320]  been out there it's been out there for three years it's been vetted it's been
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:22.560]  vetted by military sources and pilots that actually blew those guns and
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:29.320]  ammunition to Jordan and Turkey and CIA annex and Libya Jim Mars a good friend
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:34.160]  of mine has written about it he was on your program we talked about it the
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:39.400]  direct commercial sales program has been a cash cow for political interest in
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:42.520]  this country a lot of people don't know what the direct commercial sales program
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:46.440]  is it's got to be great for her she runs the State Department that's third
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:49.600]  world countries foreign countries dictators pay her money to her
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:53.080]  foundation and then she takes the restriction off or secretly ships the
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:58.360]  weapons well here's the field right and that she uses that as a or they
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:04.120]  somebody uses that as a cutout but the point being is those weapons are and
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:07.720]  the direct commercial sales program and the blue lantern report that authorize
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:12.600]  the weapons sales to foreign countries is controlled and monitored by the US
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:17.120]  State Department so therefore when when someone makes an application to ship
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:22.120]  high-impact weapons from the US arsenal they have to get approval this forms to
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:25.720]  fill out the foreign interests are involved they have to make sure they're
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:30.200]  not tied with the foreign country in order to get approval by the State
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:33.760]  Department to ship those arms out of this country or take those arms out of
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:38.280]  our arsenal in this case we ship hundreds of thousands of arms to Libya
[03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:43.200]  when the Libya fell those arms are in bunkers we sent according to the
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:48.880]  Washington Post confirmed what I told you we sent CIA contractors to those
[03:10:48.880 --> 03:10:55.880]  safe houses to the bunkers and the safe houses to remove those weapons what
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:59.480]  were they trying to remove them for I mean why didn't they did why didn't they
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:04.760]  same C-130s why didn't those C-130s fly those weapons back to this country
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:09.680]  instead of taking them to the CIA annex and then also putting them on a ship
[03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:17.600]  from Libya from Tripoli and going into radical hands for instance John McCain
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:20.440]  and I have nothing against John McCain real fast I know we were on time
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:25.280]  elementary he's attacked you yeah he attacked me right out saying something
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:32.000]  about I said when a when the question was raised about missiles oh yeah he
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:37.280]  also said pigs fly and the Sun rises in the West okay I didn't attack that man
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:42.600]  oh so why did that man make a statement but two weeks here's the facts two weeks
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:48.560]  after that photograph and brand-new Toyota pickup trucks with a 50 caliber
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:54.080]  machine gun mounted on the back slinging us a US-made stinger missile over
[03:11:54.080 --> 03:11:59.760]  their shoulder flying the ISA flag now wait a minute come on I didn't never say
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:06.240]  pigs flying the Sun sets in the West I said simply this ISA has stinger missiles
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:10.840]  and they got them from Libyan bunkers period now that should have been
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.120]  investigated what by the US State Department well it just shows that they
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:19.120]  think if you're the Attorney General or the Vice President or the President or
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:22.040]  the Secretary of State you're allowed to commit crimes out in the open and
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:26.760]  they're not invincible it's it's like Nixon said well when you're President
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:29.840]  something's not illegal when it's normally illegal well that was proven
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:33.920]  wrong right there and I think if Hillary falls it's gonna spread to others I
[03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:36.560]  don't think they're gonna be able to compartmentalize it but I think they
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:40.720]  want to discredit her in case she shoots her mouth off but we'll see what
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:46.840]  happens let's go to some calls let's talk to wild man in Texas you're on the
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:53.200]  air with Tosh Plumlee go ahead thank you for taking my call and God bless you both thanks to y'all both for what you do and
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:58.440]  as a matter of fact I think the United States is in the toilet bowl and vortex of
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:02.440]  the toilet bowl flux as we speak and that it's like a giant alcoholic and
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:06.640]  it's not going to get any better until we hit bottom but my question for Mr.
[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:12.760]  Plumlee is in the Benghazi murders at the hand of behest of Hillary Clinton and
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:16.040]  all the weapons that were took from those warehouses a few months ago you's
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:20.320]  on Alex's show and you said he was going to go investigate the two training camps
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:25.600]  that ISIS has across the southern border in Mexico and I was wondering do you
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:29.640]  think that any of those weapons that was took from them warehouses ended up down
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:35.320]  there it will end up across the border here to be used against us well okay
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:40.640]  I'm a wild man from Texas you're not one of my relatives are you
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:48.360]  so yeah okay back when we had this great big other diversion about little kids
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:51.920]  coming across the border and all this kind of stuff that was a diversion to
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:57.560]  take us away from fast and furious the training camps what what I meant about
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:02.160]  that was more than actual training camps is that there was infiltration from
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:07.280]  Somalis coming across to the southern borders from Mexico and Guatemala and
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:12.440]  they were bringing some of these pilfered weapons in through Mexico into
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:18.680]  the United States into CIA safe or into ISO safe houses that was operating in
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:23.400]  Atlanta, Georgia and Las Vegas that was the story at that time if you notice it
[03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:27.720]  did not go anywhere because it was overshadowed about little kids that was
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:31.320]  bringing hooping car and by the way Joe Biggs got visited by the FBI or a
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:35.120]  reporter they said they find the reports of judicial watch who has the
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:41.000]  documents very credible that there are ISIS bases over the Texas border like
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:46.760]  you said to fund operations with human smuggling as a business and weapons
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:51.840]  smuggling because ISIS is an organized crime system well that's that's that's
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:57.960]  what's happening we have breadcom isa has breadcom strategic places throughout
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:02.560]  the world that is just like the underground railroad back in the Civil
[03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:09.760]  War days you pass on pass on pass on you break weapons down you send them by
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:13.160]  piecemeal through little kids and backpacks you send them with the drugs
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:16.840]  I well I take that back you don't send them with the drugs because there's
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:20.320]  zeroed in on those drugs so much they tell them by other ways they just drive
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:24.320]  them across the border you can't get a 50 caliber machine gun out of the United
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:28.840]  States and drive it across a Mexican border in the Mexico but you can get a
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:33.680]  50 caliber machine gun out of Mexico into the United States extremely easy Joe
[03:15:33.680 --> 03:15:39.760]  Biggs and our reporters were down there just in on July 23rd and they were down
[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:44.200]  there right on the Texas border and a truck with like ten different packages
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:48.160]  probably marijuana but it could have been weapons anything huge boxes just
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:52.720]  loaded in a truck and drive away and right as the drug truck comes up the
[03:15:52.720 --> 03:15:56.960]  board patrols parked a hundred yards away they drive off the other way and Joe
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:02.640]  Biggs said it looked completely staged well there's there's all kind now we're
[03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:07.040]  getting off into other things that but yes there's all kinds of the border
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:11.640]  patrol is they have their hands full there's damn good people in border
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:15.240]  patrol in fact no I know there is but we also know some have been paid off y'all
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:19.600]  yes yes yes sir and there's a lot of them right here out of Los Cruces and
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:23.560]  around in Santa Teresa and others that are damn good and there they weed out
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:27.360]  their own and there's also down to Peters-Nigolas and Falcon Lake situation
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:32.200]  they know what's going on down there they understand that exactly we had a
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:37.240]  meeting with intelligence unit here for the sectors two years ago it was written
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:42.880]  up in Salem news dot com about having a meeting with them to talk about exactly
[03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:47.360]  what we're doing right now we warned them at that point that drones at that
[03:16:47.360 --> 03:16:51.960]  early date three years ago was carrying weapons across the border dropping them
[03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:56.840]  they wasn't carrying just drugs on and dropping them they were using ultralights
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:00.920]  and all kinds of different things to pick them up and drop them across the
[03:17:00.920 --> 03:17:05.240]  border we lost a very good border patrol guy by the name of well we know
[03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:14.080]  who Terry was and well it's and the Peck Canyon massacre I call it I mean
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:17.640]  good guys we could go on and on and spend hours and hours and days of talking
[03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:21.320]  about what's been going on on that border and then that leads us into the
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:24.960]  political side of it and building great big walls and all that kind of stuff but
[03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:29.080]  the point is this weapons have been coming not going from Mexico I mean from
[03:17:29.080 --> 03:17:32.960]  the United States to Mexico they've been weapons coming from the Middle East
[03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:36.520]  through Guatemala through Mexico
[03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:41.960]  distraction yeah small arms from the US going into Mexico the drug cartels mainly
[03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:45.040]  for whatever reason have a fetish with German weapons is what I've read and
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:48.240]  that's what they're buying is full auto they're not buying German full auto at
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:53.560]  gun shops here in the US the point is this they're stashing these things and
[03:17:53.560 --> 03:17:57.480]  they got training sites or if you want to call them training sites it could be
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:02.880]  or their flop houses or their safe houses and they're getting ready to do
[03:18:02.880 --> 03:18:07.880]  it whenever it is intelligence will tell you that the information that I'm
[03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:11.600]  telling you right now is being assimilated in those skiffs that I
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:15.640]  mentioned earlier on your program this is not supposed to be out to the
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:20.080]  American people you know why oh they can't handle the truth that's right
[03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:24.160]  we're skipping this break going to the bottom of the hour in overdrive Frank in
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:27.360]  Florida thanks for holding your on the air with Tosh plumbing thanks a while
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:30.200]  man I'm sorry I didn't mean to get off on that no you answer this question well
[03:18:30.200 --> 03:18:34.920]  go ahead Frank yeah mr. Tom Lee I definitely want to tell you it's a great
[03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:39.840]  honor I do have a question for you and then I have some major intel I wanted to
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:44.240]  go over off air with somebody from your staff Alex the question I am for you
[03:18:44.240 --> 03:18:51.440]  mr. Tom Lee is miss plumbing excuse me in my upbringing in New York I had the
[03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:55.600]  chance to run across several people that on various levels have been in close
[03:18:55.600 --> 03:19:00.800]  contact with the Clintons over the years what I'm getting from somebody very
[03:19:00.800 --> 03:19:05.640]  deep inside close to them is that the most potential damaging information
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:09.960]  within the emails that have been seized or at least what they're looking for
[03:19:09.960 --> 03:19:15.680]  has been satellite imagery as well as drone footage that followed the
[03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:19.480]  importation of the weapons into the Benghazi area as well as everybody
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:23.760]  involved in the handling of them as well as what they doubled later on as being
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:28.960]  the protesters which did lead to investors Stevens unfortunate end I
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:35.320]  just was curious near circles if you've heard anything of the same well we're
[03:19:35.320 --> 03:19:41.080]  getting into civilized SI satellite imagery there was a lot of satellite
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:45.480]  imagery about weapons shipments going back and forth across the borders into
[03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:49.640]  Benghazi in fact the ambassador was responsible for alerting the State
[03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:54.640]  Department to that satellite imagery that's what in a way is what started
[03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:58.840]  all this stuff and so that's why they sent the local security force that they
[03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:02.480]  admittedly had hired al Qaeda to kill him to get rid of the evidence because they
[03:20:02.480 --> 03:20:07.000]  wanted to launch the next phase bringing down Syria he was told to stand down on
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:10.040]  the information that he was passing to the State Department and I don't whether
[03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:13.320]  a question is who in the State Department told him to stand down I wonder
[03:20:13.320 --> 03:20:17.600]  who was heading up the State Department well and also weapons shipments and then
[03:20:17.600 --> 03:20:22.040]  also you look at the campaign content well campaign contributions that may I
[03:20:22.040 --> 03:20:25.600]  slit a little quality and slip there maybe I shouldn't have done that but
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:33.280]  follow the money if a person can get two and a half million dollars for talking
[03:20:33.280 --> 03:20:37.920]  why aren't I getting two and a half million dollars for talking to you you
[03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:42.240]  know I mean a speaking engagement and all this kind of stuff why is it the
[03:20:42.240 --> 03:20:48.480]  secret monies and slush funds and secret bank accounts being filtered and cut
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:51.880]  out and going like that what I'm what I'm trying to say and again I'm going to
[03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:56.280]  qualify I don't have anything acts to grind against the Clintons I was it's
[03:20:56.280 --> 03:20:59.640]  an operation it's been an operation that's been going on for a long time
[03:20:59.640 --> 03:21:04.000]  there's more people involved in this than just the Clintons are and then
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:10.520]  Hillary Clinton the point being is that there's corruption at the highest levels
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:16.360]  highest levels and they will sacrifice their own just like a wolf or gnawing his
[03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:20.440]  leg to get out of a trap I was that's where we're at right now with the
[03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:26.280]  Clintons we got we got them fighting among themselves gnawing at her leg to
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:30.960]  put her under the bus in order to save one thing what's the motive follow the
[03:21:30.960 --> 03:21:35.920]  money and also to stop what the ambassador had already reported to the
[03:21:35.920 --> 03:21:41.600]  State Department through proper channels that there was stinger missiles going to
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:47.840]  the radicals and Libya out of what are they going to do when the Al Qaeda people
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:52.720]  who we know are wind-up toys of the shadow groups they use to take our
[03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:56.120]  liberties they use the threat to take our liberties what are they going to do
[03:21:56.120 --> 03:21:59.120]  when they start shooting down Western airliners how are they going to cover
[03:21:59.120 --> 03:22:03.960]  that up claim the Russians did it or something well sure that can be another
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:09.400]  diversion to that I mean that could happen anytime now I mean look a
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:12.480]  stinger missile shot down one of our helicopter and a lot of good men got
[03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:17.120]  killed okay that's pushed under the rug it wasn't a stinger missile as an RPG
[03:22:17.120 --> 03:22:21.520]  wait a minute anybody that's been in the military that's ever fired an RPG knows
[03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:24.840]  as damn near impossible to shoot a moving target especially a helicopter
[03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:29.360]  helicopter with an RPG even if the helicopter is flying 200 feet off the
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:33.840]  ground I mean I said that that's some phenomenal feet and would take someone
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:38.240]  that has been highly trained on an RPG in order to be able to pull that feed off
[03:22:38.240 --> 03:22:43.160]  so it was shot down by a stinger missile and then Bassister knew it he reported
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:50.280]  it it went to quote quote a skiff like a clearinghouse to be evaluated was it
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:55.360]  had it did it have any merit was it was was the missiles were were there any
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:59.720]  missing missiles how come the missiles were photographed in the back of trucks
[03:22:59.720 --> 03:23:04.120]  these are things that intelligence officers and intelligence people how
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:09.080]  come this is in US special forces toyotas fitted here in the United States by
[03:23:09.080 --> 03:23:13.960]  the hundreds how come they're driving around in US made m-raps which the
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:17.600]  Iraqis didn't even have how come they've been photographed with the stinger
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:22.640]  missiles in the back of trucks exactly they were supplied by the State
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:28.840]  Department to be the army of the Saudi Arabian takeover well the State
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:32.800]  Department would use a cutout on that alerts but the point being it was
[03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:38.000]  approved by the State Department to go to a subcontractor or a series of
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:42.440]  subcontractors to carry out an implement to get those deals in there it's a
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:46.240]  money deal it's not that they're saying okay we want to support I said to
[03:23:46.240 --> 03:23:51.560]  overthrow and cut people's heads off no we can make $500 million if we let them
[03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:55.800]  have that toyotra truck and if we let them mount that 50 cal or if we give
[03:23:55.800 --> 03:23:59.240]  them those stinger missiles the ambassador wanted to buy back those
[03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:04.520]  stinger missiles for $50,000 a missile and he was denied otherwise he'd stand
[03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:09.660]  down no I hear you that is just insane I mean and who did that the State
[03:24:09.660 --> 03:24:14.440]  Department did that now did Hillary Clinton do that I don't know but ask
[03:24:14.440 --> 03:24:19.640]  her those three questions and it sure says yes or no or they're classified then
[03:24:19.640 --> 03:24:23.840]  I want to know why the ambassador was killed let's move quick now thank you
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:27.320]  Frank good points Anthony in Florida you're on the air quick question I want
[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:34.800]  to get a lot in now okay I'm sorry I know you're great go ahead yeah I just
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:39.760]  have a question for Josh Plummery what is his thoughts on the fact that Nate it's
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:45.760]  pretty obvious that NATO is trying to pick a fight with Vladimir Putin trying
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:50.120]  to start it they're trying to basically reigniting the Cold War because as far as
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:55.280]  I'm concerned they they can't sell us this fake war on terror and so I was
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:59.720]  wondering what is his thoughts on the on them trying to take a fight with sure the
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:03.560]  new Cold War with massing troops and weapons all around Russia right now
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:08.560]  that's official thank you Anthony good question Tosh very good Anthony
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:13.680]  everybody right now international saying is jogging for position that's a
[03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:18.400]  whole thing why are they jogging for position again it's a money deal of the
[03:25:18.400 --> 03:25:23.920]  IMF whatever you want to call it so is Putin starting a war with NATO as a
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:29.720]  Ukraine I mean is but when you get all through whatever their motives are the
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:35.720]  bottom line is follow the money Russia is broke the United States is broke the
[03:25:35.720 --> 03:25:42.840]  only way to solve being in poverty as a nation is to start a war start a brush
[03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:48.040]  war sell the weapons that's where the money comes from in other words the
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:51.760]  reason they got into weapons and drugs is that there's a lot of money in drugs
[03:25:51.760 --> 03:25:56.160]  that can buy the weapons but when you can buy the weapons and triple your
[03:25:56.160 --> 03:26:00.160]  money on the black market it doesn't matter politics doesn't play in that
[03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:04.960]  it's one thing to sell AK-47s al Qaeda that's bad enough to give them
[03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:08.640]  stinger missiles just shows this elite is completely out of their minds they'll
[03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:13.840]  never cover that up thank you so much Tim great question or just hang up a
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:18.960]  little caller is Tim next Tim and FEMA region 9 go ahead you're on the year
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:26.080]  hello Tosh and Alex I'll make this quick I was in Israel from 74 to 80 and I
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:34.000]  just saying that I was working there when we came across information on red
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:38.480]  eye and stinger missiles close to 10 to 15,000 of them that had been brought in
[03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:46.120]  to Libya which subsequently wound up in in Afghanistan when when the Russian
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:51.320]  forces were there and we turned all that information over to the Mossad and she
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:56.120]  bet at that particular time but it was so this has been going on for close to
[03:26:56.120 --> 03:27:01.440]  30 30 years or more and if I can state one more thing is that we're not gonna
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:06.520]  stop this there's no way it can be stopped the only thing that we can do is
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:10.640]  inform people so that was basically my my comment where do you think all this is
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:15.320]  going and what is the point of giving al Qaeda under all these new names 400
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:22.560]  stinger missiles what it's Alex what it's about is you see in order to
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:28.280]  understand what's taking place in current events today we must keep our eye on
[03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:34.720]  Israel and what's going to take place there because this all ties into biblical
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:39.000]  prophecy as to bringing this because you know God is not going to allow this
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:46.080]  thing to go on forever and his prophetic time clock is winding down this is
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:52.000]  bringing us up to Ezekiel chapter 38 the Battle of Gog and Magog and the other
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:56.200]  nations Gomer and all of her bands which is Germany the European Union and so
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:28:02.960]  forth but they are marching towards this in order to bring in to facilitate a
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:10.280]  new order a one-world government which is satanically controlled I agree with you
