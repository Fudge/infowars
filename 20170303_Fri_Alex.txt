[01:49.680 --> 01:55.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:03.360 --> 02:09.760]  coming to you from the former united states of america deep in the heart of texas it's
[02:09.760 --> 02:17.120]  alex jones i hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this country
[02:17.120 --> 02:26.400]  here we are folks
[02:29.840 --> 02:35.920]  friday the third day of march 2017
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.080]  less than a month and a half in since president trump became the 45th president
[02:42.080 --> 02:50.880]  and every criminal force on the planet is basically working against trump and the american people
[02:50.880 --> 02:58.720]  it is simply staggering a few days ago i thought of this and i remember driving the
[02:58.720 --> 03:04.160]  work in the car thinking when i get there i need to tell my writers and researchers to google
[03:04.160 --> 03:14.000]  to search engine hillary clinton with putin john mccain with putin chucky schumer with putin
[03:15.360 --> 03:22.400]  and i didn't write down the note and i didn't do it and that was even before this latest
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.760]  session things began it was like the day before but they just kept hyping and hyping and hyping that
[03:28.480 --> 03:32.880]  flan had met with the russians over the phone and that trump was going to meet with the russians
[03:32.880 --> 03:38.240]  and you just don't do that i was thinking how important it was to show these people saying
[03:38.240 --> 03:44.480]  this and doing this against trump meeting with the russians and then i thought i should show ronald
[03:44.480 --> 03:51.600]  reagan meeting with garbachev ronald reagan meeting with other russian leaders i should show
[03:51.600 --> 04:00.400]  george herbert walker bush with boris yeltsin i should show george w bush with putin but then
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.320]  i thought no let's go for the let's have the leading democratic leaders like schumer meeting
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.400]  with the russians and sure enough look at drudgerport.com today i never told the crew to do it but
[04:10.400 --> 04:15.040]  the great part about the internet is somebody else thought of the same thing pure common sense
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.240]  schumer and the russians they're schumer with ol vlad
[04:22.960 --> 04:27.600]  but that's what you're supposed to do i mean russia is trying to reform itself
[04:27.600 --> 04:34.960]  trying to work with the west inviting in business fighting radical islam promoting christianity
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.600]  of course hollywood and the globalist here are doing the opposite we talked about disney putting
[04:39.600 --> 04:45.680]  out on their tv network an image of a bunch of boys kissing boys girls kissing girls but a boy and
[04:45.680 --> 04:52.080]  girl about to kiss feeling weird about it just like the cover of national geographic shows all
[04:52.080 --> 04:59.680]  the other genders accept the female well now russian ambassador serjay kisslock
[05:01.680 --> 05:08.400]  it turns out visited obama 22 times well that's what you're supposed to do yeah and of course it's
[05:08.400 --> 05:15.040]  coming out he visited his democrat counterparts in the senate more times than he visited just one
[05:15.040 --> 05:24.400]  counterpart uh in the arm services committee more than he visited then senator jeff sessions
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.640]  but nobody cares about that because the media is not going to talk about it the control corporate
[05:28.640 --> 05:34.640]  press but here it is russian ambassador serjay kisslock appeared as obama's white house visitor
[05:34.640 --> 05:42.000]  at least 22 times isn't that just special and of course there's flashback chuck schumer meets with
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  putin in new york city the great jim hoft over at great gateway pundit and then russian ambassador
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.800]  kisslock attended trump congressional speech tuesday but sat with democrats before it broke on
[05:58.480 --> 06:05.120]  wednesday and thursday there is suey sat with all of them why my gosh they've all got to recuse
[06:05.120 --> 06:11.360]  themselves from any committees they're on in fact i want to identify all these democrats that are in
[06:11.360 --> 06:17.680]  that photo and i want movements i want calls them to recuse themselves from committees that have
[06:17.680 --> 06:26.400]  anything to do with russia period everyone he sat next to everyone he talked to i want the cameras
[06:27.840 --> 06:34.640]  reviewed and i want hell let's just arrest them all they're all russian spies oh trump on dim
[06:34.640 --> 06:40.400]  session sessions hate fest he calls it a witch hunt they lost the election and now they've
[06:40.400 --> 06:46.560]  lost their grip on reality tucker carlson even kind of grilled him yeah fox is out to get trump
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.400]  and then we've got more articles uh dealing with all of this we're gonna be
[06:52.400 --> 06:57.920]  breaking down coming up and you know it's a big mistake my sessions he's recused himself so now
[06:57.920 --> 07:03.600]  a top democrat's gonna run the russia investigation mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to
[07:03.600 --> 07:09.280]  the top of the 30-foot mexican-american border fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule
[07:09.280 --> 07:15.760]  trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated it would be simple for me to jump into the united
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.600]  states which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall it shows how
[07:21.600 --> 07:28.400]  unnecessary this project this political rhetoric from donald trump is however all this proves is
[07:28.400 --> 07:34.560]  that the fences on our border right now are too easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.080]  the top of the fence would be a solution to keep people from lounging on top of our border wall
[07:40.080 --> 07:46.400]  the irony here is that the only thing this mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how
[07:46.400 --> 07:52.960]  unsecured our border fences currently are which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a
[07:52.960 --> 08:01.120]  better more secure wall is the solution this is millie weaver for info wars dot com today we call it
[08:01.120 --> 08:06.320]  bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to

[11:18.400 --> 11:24.880]  enemy would attack without provocation if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.640]  we're in russia's is still denying everything sir we have soviet submarine watch detection
[11:30.640 --> 11:44.400]  i wish i didn't know about any of this i wish i was like anybody else things again the only winning
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.840]  the only winning move is to not play to not engage the globalist in a discussion of their
[11:51.840 --> 12:00.160]  false paradigm they set the rules they set up a cultural construct that breaks the social contract
[12:00.160 --> 12:11.840]  and he is anti-human eugenics based slavery based technocracy based throughout its entire system
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.560]  and that's the big secret the globalist got the best and brightest to join them in the last 60 70
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.360]  years in the west to construct the planetary world government they claimed would be a utopia
[12:23.360 --> 12:28.960]  to empower humanity but in the last decade they've gone public and been very arrogant that the
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.720]  decisions have been made to wipe out humanity and merge the machines and become gods an extreme
[12:34.720 --> 12:41.280]  power trip and that some nightmare battle of the gods scenario has to take place first
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.080]  before the elite can transcend there's a big article i mentioned yesterday
[12:47.360 --> 12:56.240]  out of the neworker magazine and it ties in with several other big reports we're going to be
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.680]  getting to one out of bloomberg
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.000]  where AI scientists gather to plot doomsday scenarios and solutions
[13:15.920 --> 13:21.680]  as the so-called elites themselves scurry away and begin living generally more than half the
[13:21.680 --> 13:28.480]  year already out of europe out of the united states out of australia out of asia in again places
[13:28.480 --> 13:36.800]  like hawaii hawaii and of course tazmania off the coast of australia and of course new zealand
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.120]  i told people about this a long time ago now it's in bloomberg yesterday it's in
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.320]  new yorker magazine they are throwing at your face it's very very serious they've been preparing
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.360]  a worldwide economic collapse and then organize crises they believe would bring them absolute
[13:53.360 --> 14:00.720]  control over the nation states and individuals they will then accelerate even more crises in
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.520]  the next wave which will be used to reduce population even more i've always said they'll
[14:05.520 --> 14:10.720]  have a primer bio weapon that kills 10 to 50 million people gates came out last week and said
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.000]  it'll be about 30 million in the next pandemic that will then train us to all live under a medical
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.120]  tyranny they've announced a world government to be run to quote counter the medical tyranny they're
[14:21.120 --> 14:27.040]  rolling out and then they will continue to just tighten the news as each successive crisis
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.400]  becomes more intense and larger and then the mega deaths will go from the millions
[14:33.680 --> 14:41.680]  into the billions a mega death is one million or larger what is a billion deaths we should
[14:41.680 --> 14:47.200]  we should search that term i don't know what is a what is the term for a billion deaths giga
[14:47.200 --> 14:55.520]  dead death giga death so you got mega death you've got giga death so they kill seven million of us
[14:55.520 --> 15:01.840]  now ted turner says he only wants to kill 80 so that means there'll be hundreds of millions left
[15:01.840 --> 15:06.400]  which i think is quite gracious of him and of course as the culling takes place the next few
[15:06.400 --> 15:12.480]  decades you'll be able to grovel to them properly and show them that you've been subservient perhaps
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.800]  you'll be allowed to uh you know live or be given some of the uh some of the cures for the diseases
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.160]  they've been dumping out and pouring out upon us by the way their whole program is in great crisis
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.920]  it's being blocked across the world people in their own system are aware of the plan and they're
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.960]  speaking out against it and saying no the globalist response has been to just be more public about
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.960]  their plan and kind of publicly inoculate everyone psychologically to hide it in plain view and go okay
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.600]  well humans are ugly and fallen and bad there are too many of us so if you don't merge the machines
[15:45.600 --> 15:51.280]  we'll just step on you you'll be obsolete elon musk two weeks ago and they've all made the same
[15:51.280 --> 16:05.360]  statement rake her as well all of all of all of bill joy list goes on and on bill gates all of David
[16:05.360 --> 16:11.440]  Rockefeller and look at the clinton's look at their attitude towards humanity a total elitism a
[16:11.440 --> 16:16.720]  hardness a selfishness of hate to steal two billion dollars from the Haitians give them less than four
[16:16.720 --> 16:22.400]  percent of the money raised keep it for yourself and be praised as being liberal it's like bono
[16:22.400 --> 16:25.760]  he was caught giving less than one percent to african aid when he was raising billions of
[16:25.760 --> 16:34.400]  year for it so he upped it to 1.8 1.8 imagine you run a charity for starving kids and you keep
[16:35.040 --> 16:41.120]  98.2 percent but as long as you kind of wear a scarf around your neck and kind of walk like
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.920]  you're liberal and non-threatening and act beta and wear you know red tinted sunglasses and talk
[16:45.920 --> 16:55.680]  real soft and get awards then it's okay but they're raving snakes they are ravenous wolves they are
[16:55.680 --> 17:03.840]  just foaming at the mouth with absolutely total greed and a satanic spirit towards humanity
[17:03.840 --> 17:17.600]  completely and absolutely turned over to it and their actions are pure hate so they tell us that
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.880]  speak out against them with anger that we're the hateful ones no other people who are informed
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.880]  and who are horrified to know we're right to have stacks of documents you know rooms of documents
[17:28.880 --> 17:35.760]  rooms of videotape rooms of books with all of you bragging to yourselves how beautiful and powerful
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.720]  and perfect you are and how profane and ugly and fallen we are and how you can't wait to
[17:40.720 --> 17:45.200]  live in a utopia of the elysium fields once we've all been exterminated
[17:49.760 --> 17:56.480]  and in comes donald trump that believes in workers that believes in people and says there is advanced
[17:56.480 --> 18:01.520]  technology that has not been rolled out of the public we're going to start curing cancer curing
[18:01.520 --> 18:08.800]  disease curing death we're going to walk on foreign planets we're going to break the secrets of the
[18:08.800 --> 18:15.280]  universe he already knew before as a billionaire and a smart guy dialed in plus the at least write
[18:15.280 --> 18:22.400]  books about this there's a breakaway civilization now in its middle stages i mean they're they're
[18:22.400 --> 18:28.800]  far along here but once they break away it's going to be really hard to deal with them they know
[18:28.800 --> 18:35.520]  there's a coming war between the breakaway civilization and us not just left here on earth
[18:35.520 --> 18:43.200]  that's a metaphor the movie elysium forget first world old world third world forget those fights
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.240]  this is globalist playing it's all off against each other with high tech highly controlled
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.880]  called literal bubble cities they're already announcing and designing and rolling out
[18:53.600 --> 19:00.400]  peter teal you name it floating cities to get away from us underground mountain redoubts
[19:04.480 --> 19:10.400]  and corporate city states that are tax exempt above the law where all the wealth is piled up
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.840]  and kept where they announced that they're exempt from the vassal governments they've shut up
[19:15.840 --> 19:26.400]  for 99 percent of the earth's mass 99 percent of the earth's surface which oppress us ship the
[19:26.400 --> 19:33.600]  resources the ideas the culture the money but it's all digital to them in their central
[19:33.600 --> 19:39.600]  combats and i said 20 years ago they're going to move back to nation states i could see the model
[19:39.600 --> 19:49.760]  or city states because i could understand what feudalism already was so they said they wanted
[19:49.760 --> 19:56.320]  feudalism well i said that's the city state it's a de-evolution for us an advanced accelerated
[19:56.320 --> 20:03.600]  evolution for them and i don't mean that in the sense of evolution came from a monkey fish frog
[20:03.600 --> 20:10.880]  or a man bear pig i mean evolution of technology automobiles genetic engineering you know advancement
[20:12.800 --> 20:16.400]  and this is their plan and imagine reading books where they were admitting this 20 years ago and
[20:16.400 --> 20:29.040]  wanting to warn people and now it's not just academic books it is public it is not just in
[20:29.040 --> 20:34.240]  the pop culture it is not just in the popular science it is in the movies and the culture
[20:34.240 --> 20:43.280]  and they are just readying us to adapt and to accept the new reality because that's the secret
[20:43.280 --> 20:52.960]  that the social engineers know about humans if you're not conscious of the fact that you're
[20:52.960 --> 20:57.840]  artificially having your environment manipulated and that you're artificially being bent and twisted
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.200]  in a different direction you will automatically begin to serve that and begin to love that and
[21:03.200 --> 21:09.920]  you will adapt into the new smaller cramped oppressive system that you've been put into
[21:10.640 --> 21:15.600]  but if you demand more from yourself and from your neighbors and from your culture and from
[21:15.600 --> 21:21.280]  your children and from your spouse and from your institutions and you want to rise humanity
[21:21.280 --> 21:28.480]  in a real direction then
[21:32.320 --> 21:34.880]  no it's fine it's fine i wasn't telling this hit the break but i'm not going to
[21:34.880 --> 21:38.960]  notice i want to go to some special reports but but but we'll go ahead and skip it it's just what
[21:38.960 --> 21:45.280]  you're hearing is not my opinion not baloney not garbage but the reality of what they're building
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.440]  and what they've created and i'm gonna explain it after i play this report from the president
[21:49.440 --> 21:54.640]  his weekly address and then i'm going to get into the sad situation with senator sessions now
[21:54.640 --> 21:59.440]  attorney general sessions and just how ridiculous all this is and where this is going next and how
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.480]  the republican establishment with the democrats and the media are all ganged up as a trifecta
[22:04.480 --> 22:10.960]  to try to block trump and his trifecta of the executive the legislative the judicial and the
[22:10.960 --> 22:15.600]  american people and so that's really the battle lines and i should just talk about what's really
[22:15.600 --> 22:20.880]  happened here and then also the cost but let's go to the president's weekly address
[22:21.760 --> 22:26.480]  and then we will come back and get into the situation with sessions but it's always important
[22:26.480 --> 22:30.640]  to set the table so folks know exactly what we're facing i'm alex shones and this is the info
[22:30.640 --> 22:36.480]  war here's the president my fellow americans i'm joining you today from the deck of what will
[22:36.480 --> 22:44.160]  be our nation's newest aircraft carrier the soon to be commissioned gerald r ford and as you can see
[22:44.160 --> 22:50.720]  i'm wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me not really used to it but it feels awfully good
[22:50.720 --> 22:56.320]  i'm very proud of it actually our carriers are the centerpiece of american military might
[22:56.880 --> 23:03.760]  projecting power and are totally unparalleled strength at sea this beautiful new warship
[23:03.760 --> 23:10.560]  represents the future of naval aviation and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense
[23:10.560 --> 23:18.640]  for decades and decades to come a famous aviator once wrote that to build a truly great ship
[23:18.640 --> 23:26.480]  we shouldn't begin by gathering wood cutting boards or distributing work but instead by awakening
[23:26.480 --> 23:35.040]  within the people a desire for the vast and endless sea so true in the same way we must
[23:35.040 --> 23:42.160]  continue to renew the american spirit in order to rebuild our country and rebuild it we will
[23:42.880 --> 23:49.760]  on tuesday before a joint session to congress i laid out a version i hope you all watched
[23:49.760 --> 23:57.760]  for how to accomplish that national rebuilding my vision includes the elimination of the defense
[23:57.760 --> 24:05.760]  sequester which has imposed steep cuts on our military we must give our sailors soldiers airmen
[24:05.760 --> 24:12.960]  marines and coast guardsmen the tools equipment resources and training they need to get the job
[24:12.960 --> 24:22.080]  done and get it done right especially in these very dangerous times the active duty army has
[24:22.080 --> 24:33.040]  been reduced by more than 85 000 men since 2009 and we have over 18 000 fewer active duty marines
[24:33.920 --> 24:44.240]  air force it's the smallest it's been since 1947 and their planes are on average nearly 30 years
[24:44.240 --> 24:51.840]  old if you can believe that our navy's fleet is the smallest it's been since world war one
[24:51.840 --> 24:58.000]  and that's a long time ago frontline navy and marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.360]  to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky we cannot afford to continue down this path my
[25:05.360 --> 25:11.440]  budget will give america's armed forces the resources they need to achieve full and total
[25:11.440 --> 25:19.200]  military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges and meet them we will
[25:19.200 --> 25:26.640]  go investing in the military means investing in peace because the best way to prevent war
[25:27.360 --> 25:34.960]  as george washington said is to be prepared for it most importantly an investment in the
[25:34.960 --> 25:41.040]  military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform
[25:41.760 --> 25:47.280]  they are the best of us they are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever
[25:47.280 --> 25:56.080]  known and we will support them every single step of the way these are truly exciting times amazing
[25:56.080 --> 26:03.680]  opportunities are unfolding before us to strengthen our military to reboot our economy and to bring
[26:03.680 --> 26:11.440]  back our jobs if we all work together and put our country first then anything is possible let us
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.280]  seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal
[26:18.080 --> 26:26.000]  may god bless the men and women of our military and may god bless the united states of america
[26:26.000 --> 26:41.520]  the country we love we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you the people
[26:41.520 --> 26:50.400]  americanism not globalism will be our credo this is the heart of 1776 yes i have thought
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.200]  an awful lot about blowing up the white house huge nationwide protests erupted once again
[26:57.200 --> 27:08.000]  on president donald trump's second weekend in office when you open your heart to patriotism
[27:08.560 --> 27:17.840]  there is no room for prejudice when america is united america is totally unstoppable donald j
[27:17.840 --> 27:26.720]  trump is now president of the united states and most importantly we will be protected by god
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.520]  from the bloodlines of the info wheel it's alex jones
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.120]  oh my goodness poor white people please almost stop
[27:41.120 --> 27:48.480]  trump knows that the globalists have decided to build a world based on slavery
[27:48.480 --> 27:53.360]  a world based on oppression and a world based on believing that humanity's trash and is
[27:53.360 --> 28:00.400]  basically needs to be thrown out burned up and he's aware of the globalist model and so is
[28:00.400 --> 28:06.000]  steven bannon i know that for a fact and so is senator jess sessions and they're all making
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.240]  a real attempt to really build a world based on the common person and based on common dreams
[28:12.240 --> 28:18.240]  and open free societies and that's why every criminal element every slimy group every
[28:19.680 --> 28:23.600]  mercenary organization every dishonorable
[28:23.600 --> 28:35.680]  world belief system is against trump because trump is for the people trump is real
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.720]  and that's why i am so committed to defending the 45th president of united states is because
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.760]  he stands for everything we stand for sovereignty family values
[28:47.760 --> 28:57.520]  the right to keep and bear arms building a world for people not letting special interests come in
[28:58.480 --> 29:05.040]  and pick the winners and that's why the special interest in the goldman sacks and the jp morgens
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.920]  and the corrupt catholic church and the communist chinese and the saudi arabians and the eu bureaucrats
[29:09.920 --> 29:17.120]  they all absolutely hating and they've all combined forces globally but also here in the united states
[29:17.120 --> 29:24.320]  with the democratic party and the republican party leadership to come out and to take the completely
[29:24.320 --> 29:30.960]  normal activity of the ranking member of the arm services committee in the senate to routinely meet
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.480]  with foreign ambassadors head ambassadors the head russian ambassador to the united states
[29:39.120 --> 29:43.600]  and to turn that into some type of dirty thing when al franken in the confirmation hearing
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.400]  clearly setting him up for the future knowing he's a lawyer knowing lawyers are obsessed with
[29:48.400 --> 29:55.360]  answering questions exactly as they're asked it's the religion of lawyers franken had that written
[29:55.360 --> 30:01.200]  for him clearly by a lawyer he's not a lawyer he's a bad actor a comedian he's looking down at the
[30:01.200 --> 30:06.080]  question he's going yes so we've heard a lot in the media this big story out about surrogates
[30:06.720 --> 30:11.200]  for the campaign and you've been a surrogate meeting with the russians and getting directives
[30:11.200 --> 30:17.200]  from the russians and well sir i am a surrogate with the campaign and i've not met with the russians
[30:17.200 --> 30:24.000]  about the campaign and i've not seen that happen they call that deceptive if he'd have said as a
[30:24.000 --> 30:29.600]  u.s ranking senator on the arm services committee as the ranking republican have you met with the
[30:29.600 --> 30:34.080]  russians well absolutely i've met with one of their top generals i've met with their ambassador
[30:34.080 --> 30:39.520]  several times just this year i've met with uh some of our generals some of their military
[30:39.520 --> 30:45.120]  people at a at a at a base inspection i attended a few months ago yes there's a whole list of that in
[30:45.120 --> 30:53.360]  my um file you can see my itinerary for the last a few years i posted at us.gov you know senate
[30:53.360 --> 30:58.800]  sessions boom it's all right there these are public meetings these are completely about board
[30:59.920 --> 31:06.320]  i looked it up chuck schumer's met with the very same person and we're trying to find photos of
[31:06.320 --> 31:10.320]  them together right now all of them have but they're gonna say well i know we've met with them
[31:10.320 --> 31:18.080]  he lied about meeting with them and the republican party told trump and pence told trump they said
[31:18.080 --> 31:24.000]  just let us have flinn and and then this will get him off your back and before trump could even get
[31:24.000 --> 31:30.080]  rid of flinn just resigned and said i'm not gonna be part of this and now they're going after sessions
[31:30.080 --> 31:36.960]  that matter if sir j kisslock sat with the democrats during the speech and is a known
[31:37.760 --> 31:42.800]  handler of democrats for decades doesn't matter they'll try to blame a guy from alabama
[31:42.800 --> 31:48.400]  who's as patriotic and americana as basically john wane because the scum hates real americans
[31:48.400 --> 31:58.800]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[32:00.400 --> 32:06.320]  mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot mexican american border
[32:06.320 --> 32:13.280]  fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated it
[32:13.280 --> 32:18.640]  would be simple for me to jump into the united states which shows that it is unnecessary and
[32:18.640 --> 32:24.480]  totally absurd to build a wall it shows how unnecessary this project this political rhetoric
[32:24.480 --> 32:31.040]  from donald trump is however all this proves is that the fences on our border right now are too
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.560]  easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to
[32:36.560 --> 32:42.400]  keep people from lounging on top of our border wall the irony here is that the only thing this
[32:42.400 --> 32:48.960]  mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border fences currently
[32:48.960 --> 32:56.080]  are which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a better more secure wall is the solution
[32:56.080 --> 33:02.000]  this is millie weaver for info wars dot com hey everyone pharmacist ben fuchs here host of the

[35:34.880 --> 35:43.040]  rough to mine the main reason we went into iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.280]  mass destruction it turns out he didn't but he had the capacity to make weapons of master but
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.680]  also talked about the human suffering in iraq hello boys and girls i have a special message for you
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.880]  from the president of the united states i salute the boys and girls who are buying united states
[35:58.880 --> 36:03.840]  saving stamps and bonds and they're giving important support to the cause of freedom
[36:03.840 --> 36:11.680]  and the men who fight for us in vietnam congress gave us this authority in august 1964
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.520]  to do whatever may be necessary that's pretty far reaching
[36:18.800 --> 36:23.280]  that's the sky is the limits as an american citizen you have to respect our president
[36:23.280 --> 36:27.920]  whether i like it or not it's really not not my decision but i do respect my president
[36:27.920 --> 36:46.480]  and i will support whatever decision he makes music it is a hard fact that us strikes have
[36:46.480 --> 36:59.360]  resulted in civilian casualties
[37:00.560 --> 37:08.000]  he didn't even say goodbye he didn't take the time to lie the united states knows
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.560]  that iraq has weapons of mass destruction well the first things they told me was
[37:12.560 --> 37:18.720]  you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists renewed
[37:18.720 --> 37:25.200]  hostile actions against united states ships on the high seas and the Gulf of pumpkin
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.280]  have today required me to order the military forces of the united states to take action
[37:33.280 --> 37:44.320]  and reply that reply is crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn
[37:44.320 --> 37:50.320]  radio network that's right and when we've got presidents doing corrupt things and lying and
[37:50.320 --> 37:53.600]  getting our military into fraudulent wars it doesn't mean we're against the military to
[37:53.600 --> 37:56.720]  speak out against it means we're for the country and for the military
[37:56.720 --> 38:03.040]  and our military's been sent into these last few set of wars should he stabilize the middle east
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.040]  as far as a long-term plan to then bring in the wahhabists and the saudi arabian jihadis
[38:09.040 --> 38:14.560]  and take over not just the middle east but much of central asia much of the country's
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.840]  bordering russia much of europe and to then even colonize the uk
[38:19.840 --> 38:28.240]  today there's an incredible video that we've had to bleep that's up on info wars dot com
[38:28.240 --> 38:34.560]  in england and i personally have experienced this with the radical muslims that live there
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.400]  where i'll be videotaping the entrance of a hotel that i'm going into interview an mi6
[38:40.960 --> 38:48.960]  you know agent that particular time a whistleblower and there's some muslims in their garb
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.040]  across the street i mean they look like they're about two inches tall from 100 yards away walking
[38:53.040 --> 39:00.000]  the street and before they even get close they're screaming and cussing at me to turn my camera off
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  and not to videotape them now there's government cameras all the place videotape and i noticed
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  that the brits all start bowing down and groveling to them but they come over to my face and i
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.240]  start yelling back i say number one you're in a public place i'm videotaping this building as a
[39:16.240 --> 39:23.120]  cutaway shot and i said shut up stop yelling at me i've got a tv show i'm getting a cutaway of the
[39:23.120 --> 39:30.800]  building you know so i can go in and say i went to interview such and such and it shows a cutaway of
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.760]  where i interviewed them people like that it's called making a film i made 20 something of them
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.200]  but the point was i wasn't even videotaping them and they came and got in my face and that's the
[39:41.200 --> 39:46.800]  attitude when you run into the muslims in france in germany or in england and this was their attitude
[39:46.800 --> 39:56.240]  10 years ago first time i went to england was seven seven that was about 10 years ago been there
[39:56.240 --> 40:03.280]  many times since and i just had muslims all over coming out of their way to get in my face and she
[40:03.280 --> 40:09.360]  shut up because they didn't like seeing a brit uppity see the brits have already been given
[40:09.360 --> 40:12.960]  imperial conditioning to be submissive to the government submissive to the crown or they'd
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.800]  get killed it was one of the most rambunctious rebellious groups ever in fact the romans could
[40:16.800 --> 40:21.840]  never conquer them one of the few groups they couldn't but hundreds of years of mind control
[40:21.840 --> 40:28.480]  and conditioning they are very very cowed slowly american people i'm not bashing people in england
[40:28.480 --> 40:38.560]  that's where my name's welsh but the point is that they have fallen quite a bit there's a video
[40:39.360 --> 40:44.160]  you know since i mentioned it let's just play it now let me go ahead scroll back over so i could
[40:44.160 --> 40:52.240]  see it on info wars info wars dot com yes as it's called you look like pork uh shock
[40:52.240 --> 41:03.440]  shock video and this is the exact thing i've run into in england and my crew ran into it in
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.720]  france last year when there were more terror attacks and bombings and truck attacks people would come
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.200]  over 100 yards away and stomp up and say you get out of this neighborhood you get out of here you
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.680]  turn your camera off and guys in cars would start following i mean these are no go zones
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.200]  and what happens is especially in england when the muzzles move into your neighborhood then they
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.680]  start burning your cars at night i'm not saying this guy or his family but this has been on the
[41:27.680 --> 41:33.360]  news they start burning your cars if you're a native person until you move out of the area
[41:33.360 --> 41:39.760]  that then drives down prices in the houses and then more folks can move in so it's a deliberate
[41:39.760 --> 41:49.760]  scenario to drive down prices and to lower the cost in the area this is a strategy
[41:52.480 --> 41:54.000]  yes i heard you open the mic up go ahead
[41:58.640 --> 41:59.360]  yes tim pool
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.880]  absolutely he comes on he's in link me a no go zone he gets video of it it's incredible
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.520]  in fact there are when i say hundreds that's conservative there are thousands of videos
[42:15.520 --> 42:20.480]  in england alone in the no go zones where you just walk down the street politely and people come
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.400]  over and punch you right in the face journalist forced to leave migrant suburb in sweden after
[42:24.400 --> 42:30.640]  being followed by mask men and you see the bbc gets gets beat up and the point is this is what's
[42:30.640 --> 42:36.720]  being imported but if you want to import it you first got to blow up the country destabilize them
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.240]  and then fund the most radical groups to come in and force the islamic nations to convert to an
[42:42.240 --> 42:52.560]  even more barbarous hardcore form of jihadism it's truly truly sickening you have to ask yourself
[42:52.560 --> 42:57.920]  what are the social engineers doing well they admit in sweden and germany and france everywhere else
[42:57.920 --> 43:03.120]  they're bringing in groups that are quote anti european anti white anti christian and the pope
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.320]  says he doesn't want to hear about christianity and european disgust him so so again this is meant
[43:08.320 --> 43:14.080]  to put people in their balkanized groups so everyone actually retreats into their racial
[43:14.080 --> 43:20.240]  or religious enclaves then the government controls all these ghettos that they have basically set up
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.720]  it's the prison model of management and look i know all of you know this but one reason this
[43:26.720 --> 43:32.080]  broadcast is successful changing the world is at least a couple times a week i spend 10 15 minutes
[43:32.080 --> 43:38.480]  exposing the globalist model and how it operates and how it's feudalistic and anti-human so people
[43:38.480 --> 43:42.480]  know who are new lester's what they're facing and can recognize it when they see it being pushed on
[43:42.480 --> 43:48.080]  the news or we come back and break down the divide and conquer and and the big goals and then we give
[43:48.080 --> 43:53.920]  you new examples as it's happening and then cover all the latest factoids also want to get into what
[43:53.920 --> 44:02.400]  i think uh trump and session should do at this point coming up here in a few minutes but since we
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.400]  have this video and i'm talking about it i should go ahead and play it now but it's fascinating
[44:06.400 --> 44:18.800]  how the white guy that the muslim bully is trying to intimidate is looks like he's about
[44:18.800 --> 44:26.640]  six four six five 260 270 pounds and the guy's got big shoulders he's big and he fights back
[44:26.640 --> 44:31.040]  with political correctness and says no you are being racial because you're attacking my religion
[44:31.040 --> 44:38.400]  as well and this guy knows that that's how he's gotten europe to lay down and submit to him so he
[44:38.400 --> 44:44.480]  does kind of shift gears once he's called the racist because he understands this is the power
[44:44.480 --> 44:53.040]  that's made the lion lay down to the mouse he understands that just like the mayor of london
[44:55.440 --> 45:01.280]  so he then runs over to attack the woman to try to spit on her and to try to hit her and does hit her
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.400]  and it's a short clip but it just illustrates everything of this guy anywhere in the united
[45:08.400 --> 45:15.120]  states unless he was in berkeley or other areas where they only have chicken necks for some reason
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.200]  this guy would have been laid out his jaw broken just like that his his his nose would have been
[45:21.200 --> 45:27.280]  smashed in really fast when he hit a woman but see men have been trained whether it's in germany you
[45:27.280 --> 45:35.200]  name it to allow women to be attacked to be you name it because the new culture of being a western
[45:35.200 --> 45:41.760]  male i don't care if you're white is spanish what you are is to be a cuck is to be a coward that lays
[45:41.760 --> 45:48.400]  down unless you're a mass of other liberals then you attack women so you will know them because
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.600]  they attack women whether they're islamist whether they are trendies whether they're black bloke
[45:53.600 --> 45:59.040]  whether black lives matter anarchist doesn't matter they revel in attacking the blue cat cafe
[45:59.040 --> 46:05.280]  cat sanctuary and protesting every week and knocking the windows out and putting super glue in the um
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.280]  keyholes and stuff so that people can't get in and the cat starved to death they revel in bullying
[46:11.280 --> 46:18.640]  whatever's weakest because they that's their spirit and so this is what the government of
[46:18.640 --> 46:26.160]  england thinks it needs more of here it is yeah yeah have you gone how in this country a prick yeah
[46:26.160 --> 46:37.920]  you know that yeah you're not allowed yeah you're not allowed to move you're fucking fine on my face
[46:37.920 --> 46:45.040]  before hey wait a minute guys you said you had that blames now there's to the problem is we have to
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.680]  delay that all of its cussing so we can't play it can we get the part where he talks about you
[46:49.680 --> 46:56.400]  you look like pork all right we're gonna we're gonna see what's going on we got it let's go
[46:56.400 --> 47:03.200]  and try again here we go pork you can't do yes you're big you can't see this is yeah how's that
[47:03.200 --> 47:17.840]  reason i call your pork bastard your wife or really really really really yeah yeah yeah your mom's a
[47:17.840 --> 47:28.960]  gangster your son of the bitch you stupid bitch it's in your country you don't even you don't even try
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.560]  to do that did your move it and then he starts attacking the woman and i'm not gonna play any
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.520]  more there's too much cussing it's hard to bleep it whenever other word is a cuss for but we we
[47:39.520 --> 47:46.240]  caught that right oh good okay we caught it good we're on a bunch of FCC stations all these people
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.560]  on the internet go out why do you care about it cusses on the internet we're on over 200 radio
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.160]  stations so we don't let cuss words go out we're still under FCC regulations obama wants the FCC
[47:56.160 --> 48:02.320]  to run the internet but oh guess what he's not president anymore and so we enter into the next
[48:02.320 --> 48:08.800]  problem and that's that we had hold her yesterday in three different articles in fact you guys pull
[48:08.800 --> 48:13.680]  those for me because i didn't cover those enough there was a info wars a zero hedge a washington
[48:13.680 --> 48:20.080]  times and then like even a washington post or five of them it was obama is coming close quote
[48:20.080 --> 48:26.240]  he's ready to roll he's got a bunker compound with valerie jared in it filled with all these
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.240]  activists and operatives and george soros money and they say they admit they want to overthrow
[48:30.240 --> 48:44.000]  trump it's just mind-blowing obama handler valery jared moves into his dc bunker daily mail sources
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  obama and co working to house trump well i guess if obama's coming holder does that mean he's coming
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.680]  in between four months of vacationing and playing golf almost every day and having
[48:55.680 --> 48:58.560]  65 000 dollars worth of hot dogs delivered to his hotel room
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.040]  if you're a new listener i'm not kidding that's in the wiki lakes we're not talking about regular
[49:05.040 --> 49:15.120]  hot dogs here we did some investigating high dollar mail escorts two thousand dollars an hour 65 000
[49:15.120 --> 49:23.680]  of dollars worth delivered in one day to an obama party i mean that is that is quite an orgy and the
[49:23.680 --> 49:30.960]  point is is that this is how disconnected this guy is arrogantly still trying to be president when
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.040]  he wasn't president for eight years and all he tried to do was run the country in the ground in
[49:35.040 --> 49:43.200]  between playing golf and enjoying succulent hot dogs obama's goal to house trump from presidency
[49:43.200 --> 49:48.800]  via impeachment or resignation paul joseph Watson wrote about the quotes yesterday where obama admitted
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.840]  it all in the new york times but guess what it gets better just a week before they attacked
[49:53.840 --> 50:00.400]  trump saying i believe obama is behind the movements to block my administration and kick me out of
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.400]  office and the media said trump's crazy look at him attacking a fellow president there's no such thing
[50:06.400 --> 50:18.320]  going on while it's all been organized that leads us to the next issue obama administration
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.960]  rush to preserve intelligence of russian election hacking that means saving it outside the
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.240]  administration they go on to say transferring to the media illegally remember trump said these
[50:30.240 --> 50:34.960]  are illegal leaks from obama it's criminal and guess what obama didn't pardon himself for that
[50:34.960 --> 50:41.680]  he illegally gave the couple phone calls made legally and the transcripts by flin to the media
[50:41.680 --> 50:48.080]  to start this thing going and then now see you fed the pirate trump your smart guy but you tried
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.960]  to appease pence and other republicans the same republican establishment on the hill that's out
[50:52.960 --> 51:01.120]  to get you to show that you were going to be tough on russia and to show you throw flin overboard
[51:01.440 --> 51:08.400]  and now sessions is asked specifically we are told about surrogates in the campaign
[51:10.480 --> 51:14.400]  that are talking to the russians on a daily basis and you're a surrogate do you have any
[51:14.400 --> 51:18.880]  knowledge of this no senator i don't he said in the confirmation hearing we played this yesterday
[51:18.880 --> 51:25.760]  no sir i don't and i'm a surrogate we're not talking to the russians none of us that i know
[51:27.120 --> 51:31.600]  well clearly as a lawyer he was asked as a surrogate in the campaign have you talked to
[51:31.600 --> 51:35.120]  the russians they'll tell you the first thing you're talking to lawyers is answered the question
[51:35.680 --> 51:40.640]  not well i haven't talked to him as a surrogate in the campaign but i've talked to him my capacity
[51:40.640 --> 51:46.960]  as a senator they would say objection non responsive to a lawyer i didn't ask you about
[51:46.960 --> 51:51.200]  as a senator i asked you is about a surrogate in the campaign and a lawyer you can see how
[51:51.200 --> 51:55.440]  frankin wrote that knowing how to trick another lawyer that's why lawyers kind of getting a
[51:55.440 --> 52:01.040]  rut kind of in a brainwash mode i've noticed of their own brainwashing their own soup they've
[52:01.040 --> 52:05.520]  been cooked to their own juices and that they just get so robotic about answering the question
[52:05.520 --> 52:10.560]  exactly as it was answered that then they sit there and give answers like they're in a deposition
[52:10.560 --> 52:15.280]  when they're in front of the senate and they use the fact that they answered it so truthfully
[52:15.280 --> 52:21.920]  and so exactly against him sessions laugh said it says look i answered exactly as i was asked
[52:21.920 --> 52:27.040]  don't expect lawyers speak i and they go oh but you met with the russian ambassador twice
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.520]  he goes well yes in my capacity as a senator still answered like a lawyer exactly right i'd say
[52:33.520 --> 52:39.840]  everybody meets with him this is outrageous this is baloney this is a joke but see he's a lawyer
[52:39.840 --> 52:46.960]  and a good one but he's damned if he does he damned if he doesn't when we come back though
[52:46.960 --> 52:52.160]  turns out this ambassador is up the rear end of the democrats the meetings we're going over

[56:38.320 --> 56:43.040]  an idea and then i sit on it i don't even care if we break all this i want other people to i had
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.400]  this idea three days ago before this controversy broke to go show hillary and chucky and obama
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.360]  with putin and and with the russian ambassador and all the rest of it just to show how dumb it is
[56:53.360 --> 56:59.280]  so people understand trump's gonna meet with putin that's normal we're gonna show ronald reagan
[56:59.280 --> 57:06.960]  meeting with gorbachev or other american presidents meeting with russians this is normal
[57:07.600 --> 57:13.040]  they're not russian agents as the head of the the ranking member on the arm services committee in
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.920]  the senate of course sessions met with him twice and he's not being deceptive when he says on the
[57:17.920 --> 57:23.120]  campaign we didn't meet or talk to the russians that's specifically answering the question
[57:25.200 --> 57:32.240]  all that comes out of law how judges lawyers and police inspectors what you'd answer the question
[57:32.240 --> 57:37.840]  he's the attorney general he knows how the attorney general wants the questions answered
[57:37.840 --> 57:46.240]  absolutely the way they're asked it's a religion of these lawyers and they got him with it it's sick
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.640]  because they know the public doesn't talk like that did you meet with the russians in the campaign
[57:50.640 --> 57:56.080]  no i didn't oh look he lied he met with him in the campaign no he didn't he met with them as a us
[57:56.080 --> 58:00.960]  senator who is supposed to meet with the russian ambassador who do you think ambassadors meet with
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.880]  and i know i'm stating obvious facts here but we've got the videos russian ambassador serjay
[58:06.880 --> 58:13.680]  kisslock appeared at the obama white house visitor at least 22 times he met with chucky schumer
[58:13.680 --> 58:21.120]  that's on the record too oh flashback chuck schumer meets with putin in new york city russian
[58:21.120 --> 58:28.080]  ambassador kisslock attended trump congressional speech Tuesday and sat with the democrats all
[58:28.080 --> 58:32.080]  of them need to be investigated i mean i think it's a joke we should just say it's not even fake news
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.760]  because they're saying investigate trump i say investigate all the democrats for me
[58:35.760 --> 58:40.240]  even the russians but you know hillary took money from putin and so did both podesta brothers
[58:40.240 --> 58:46.160]  and she was a chinese communist spy that's what she was really on the payroll for so trump needs
[58:46.160 --> 58:50.640]  to call for those investigations and strike back because they're actually foreign agents
[58:52.400 --> 58:59.120]  not jeff sessions it's incredible trumps on dim's sessions witch hunt they lost the election
[58:59.120 --> 59:05.040]  and now they've lost their grip on reality hucker carlson i watched it last night grilding kept
[59:05.040 --> 59:09.200]  going back saying i get what you're saying but why didn't you disclose it disclose that it was on the
[59:09.200 --> 59:15.840]  record on his senate daily record that he met with the russian ambassador there's nothing to disclose
[59:16.720 --> 59:23.360]  that's his job before i go any further i want to thank all the listeners for their prayers their

[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:39.040]  we've got david night with key intel dealing with a whole session situation
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.720]  popping in at the 24 after short segment that oan shroyer is coming in to look at the dehumanization
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:50.320]  of our population with key intel and how to counter that in fact we just put me the article
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:54.240]  there was another article out just this week about i i meant to get to it on monday about
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:59.920]  screen time causing brain damage and and causing children to have all sorts of neurological
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:03.920]  disorders i mean everybody already knows this it was a new big study i meant to add that together
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:10.720]  with it and then darin mcbreen yesterday said uh i'm doing the news tomorrow and i'm gonna have a
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:17.440]  special report the nightly news on friday night he said i'm gonna have a special report was something
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:23.040]  that i don't think anybody's aware of and it was actually in mainstream news and government documents
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:29.920]  but it didn't get any attention and it's huge i mean when i say huge i have tendencies to drop
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:35.680]  bombshell after bombshell and just not say hey this is really big or this is literally the future
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:46.240]  of humanity but that's that's what we're dealing with here uh my head is spinning at this point
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:53.920]  because i over prepare at home when i get down here there's so much to cover and then i had two
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:59.120]  big articles i wanted to get to as well that dealt with how the elite are preparing for total collapse
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.960]  and mass crises and mass die-offs i need the bloomberg article guys you you may have brought it
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:12.000]  in here i don't see it the one about how they're preparing for doomsday scenarios that's going
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.120]  to tie into oh and shroyer there is ai scientists gathered to plot doomsday scenarios and solutions
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:24.240]  this is all really serious to see again everything i've told you for 21 years is now coming true
[1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:30.080]  because it was already true everything they've basically got now they had in the laboratory
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:35.600]  20 25 years ago they're now just decided it's going to be rolled out and deployed to the people
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:41.680]  and then they're trying to form this whole in-game cosmology with the public's mind so that when all
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:49.680]  this basically comes into place we will accept it culturally believing that it's a foregone conclusion
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.080]  and trump is like a giant
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:05:05.920]  hammer being thrown into this huge crystal structure this viral structure of human extremism
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:15.040]  and he's already blown giant holes in it and all of us now are beavering away to expose
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.760]  it and bring it down when i say burn this global system down i don't mean burn a single building
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:27.200]  down or kill even a single person i mean the political systems of control and deceit and fraud
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:32.720]  and crony capitalism that are designed to dumb the population down and transfer wealth the elites
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:37.040]  and just burn and destroy wealth to consolidate control
[1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:50.800]  is the true public admitted enemy and they've worked so hard to hide this thing and we don't need
[1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:55.680]  to sit here and let them dominate the future again the average person is really gets obsessed
[1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:01.920]  about football games or having a better car and somebody they don't like at work or they get into
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:07.200]  arguments with their neighbors then they neighbors will hate each other for you know a decade it's
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:14.560]  all stupid chicken you know what stuff chicken crap the globalists are openly manipulating our
[1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:20.000]  dna they're giving us cancer they're poisoning us they write books about it they write documents
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:29.600]  about it they're super uncool and i feverishly want to beat them i want to see them defeated
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:40.000]  i want to see them destroyed with every ounce of my will and i know that if we set those brush fires
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  in the minds of men and women everywhere and they research what we've seen they don't believe me
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:51.920]  but actually go and see that i'm telling the truth that we together will burn this thing down
[1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:58.400]  i'm alex jones this is the info war the web science info wars dot com have you spread that url today
[1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:06.160]  mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot mexican-american border
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:13.040]  fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:18.480]  it would be simple for me to jump into the united states which shows that it is unnecessary and
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:24.320]  totally absurd to build a wall it shows how unnecessary this project this political rhetoric
[1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:30.880]  from donald trump is however all this proves is that the fences on our border right now are too
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:36.400]  easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to
[1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:42.240]  keep people from lounging on top of our border wall the irony here is that the only thing this
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:49.520]  mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border fences currently are
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:56.000]  which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a better more secure wall is the solution
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:03.360]  this is millie weaver for info wars dot com this is alex jones i want to tell you about a way to

[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:09.680]  i don't know what i'm going to do because he's so good on trying to get the economy going

[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.440]  ground trying to cause riots and trying to stir up the trevon martin tragedy to create the whole
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:38.080]  racial division that we've now saw peak in the last year but ladies and gentlemen fox news is

[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:14.240]  clip in a moment billions of dollars that is so illegal to have the justice department give money
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:20.960]  to groups secretly period political groups to have the government funding its own party
[1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:25.520]  the party in power funding its own party and then to give it to activist groups that are
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:31.600]  running around saying kill cops and overthrow government this is the government forming sedition
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  against local and state governments to cause a civil war and it ties in with everything i covered
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:47.120]  yesterday holter foretells the return of obama he's coming and he's ready to roll
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:53.040]  this is announced in politico the new york times you name it like he's god
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:14:01.280]  obama's goal to oust trump from presidency via impeachment or resignation mounting insurgency
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.960]  paul joseph watson quotes the daily mail reports and the new york times with them admitting they
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:13.920]  leaked the intelligence documents with them admitting they gave the new york times the made
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:21.120]  up russia dossier stuff with some real leaked illegal intelligence in there confirming what
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:26.960]  trump said weeks ago that he believes it's obama leaking the illegal information well now it's
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:32.320]  admitted and that's illegal as well they're completely committing crimes doing whatever they want
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:39.840]  and sessions has recused himself from the made up russia investigation so he can't expose the real
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:48.480]  crime of the leaks and a prosecutor appointed by obama whose anti trump is gonna lead it now
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:56.400]  can you believe that trump is allowing himself to be absolutely encircled because he's a businessman
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:01.280]  he understand how it works he's trying to flood you with prosperity so that you'll get off the
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:06.000]  poisoned tit of the new world order but it's going to be too little too late if they've picked off
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.600]  his whole cabinet and are moving forward to killing or impeaching as the former president admits he
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:20.480]  wants to do whoa the obama administration funneled billions of dollars active as organizations
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:26.000]  through a department of justice slush fund scheme and of course he just exposed they
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.440]  had a slush fund of a hundred something billion hundred eighty something billion
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.200]  a fanny man freddy mac they stole for obama karen actually gave to select corporations that were
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:40.080]  over it i mean this is incredible it's clear partisan politics played a role in the illicit
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:46.320]  actions elicit how about illegal that were made representative john ratcliffe of texas told fox
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:52.320]  news the doj is the last place this should have occurred wow but it's so criminal they're even
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:56.800]  timid about it see you wonder why the globals are so arrogant they've already committed so many
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:00.640]  crimes they've already gotten away with so much they think they can push the american people and
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:05.840]  trump everybody else around they can meet with the russian ambassador and do all they want but if
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:11.120]  anybody with trump does it's the end of the world they just do whatever they want because nobody has
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:17.520]  ever knocked them on their ass politically they're like the punk bully in some small town that's
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:22.640]  been beating up kids half his age for you know six seven years and and then finally somebody
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:27.120]  gets off at the bus stop to visit grandma on you know the bully comes over and punches them in the
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:31.680]  face and the bully two seconds later has got their head bouncing up and down off the concrete
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:36.800]  that's the metaphor i don't literally mean bash nancy plosie's head in the ground the point is
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:41.600]  is that all these arrogant people are writing political checks they can't cash
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:53.920]  if we simply stand up to him i am blown away right now my head is spinning huckabee's come out and
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:58.720]  railed he says it's worse than a mafia shake down absolutely good job huckabee saying it's criminal

[1:17:52.640 --> 1:18:01.680]  let's go to the club go ahead and go to well somebody ought to get a prison for this i mean
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:06.720]  this is worse than a mafia shake down because at least if the mafia shakes you down for protection
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:12.320]  your store doesn't burn down but this is a case where the liberals have played robin hood they
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:17.760]  by the way we want it the transcript of huckabee is another article
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.920]  i didn't even know huckabee came out and said somebody should go to jail for this
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:30.560]  because that's exactly folks this is open and shut illegally transferred money by the billions
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:36.640]  it was worse it wasn't just soros it was them the whole time the obama saying let's have racial
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:40.880]  unity while he was pushing all the black lives matter groups and the rest of it and cops getting
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:44.720]  killed everywhere and the strong cities initiative with the un they thought they were going to have
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:49.680]  some you know uprising of the minorities once hillary got in and a big race war and that the
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:53.760]  feds would come in and he'd be the new lincoln and they'd secure order it didn't happen like that
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:59.600]  trumps in now but they're going ahead with their whole program despite that and obama's moved in
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:06.400]  down the street and says well they don't even say the new york times turns out trumps right
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:16.880]  right obama is behind the plan to overthrow him there's a new survey out 98 percent of news
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:21.840]  coverage is anti-trump when it's mainstream yeah but then they have seen in say on monday
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:28.560]  we never have any biases we don't root for a president these people think we're idiots
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:35.440]  i mean it's incredible they're delusional they've lost control of themselves and everything else
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:39.520]  but what's dangerous is they don't get it it's like a chemistry reaction when you pour through
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:45.440]  two things together or three things together and they blow up this is so dangerous and huckabee
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:52.640]  absolutely gets it i mean i know the federal law i know bush almost got indicted for just you know
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:58.960]  money being transferred to the media to put out pro drug reform ads this is directly to activists
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:05.520]  to go burn stuff down findings period about the judiciary committee point to a process shrouded
[1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:09.680]  secrecy whereby monies were distributed to a labyrinth of non-profit organizations involved
[1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:15.920]  with grassroots activism and remember they wouldn't give one 501c3 in the last four years of obama's
[1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:20.800]  administration to a conservative or libertarian or veteran or gun group but all to their groups they
[1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:25.440]  gave it there is a and then they give them the money there is a recent ever by the republicans
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:30.480]  who eliminate the practice eliminated arrest their ass which many believe was widely abused
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:34.640]  during the bomb administration with big banks are being sued by the government for discrimination
[1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:41.120]  or mortgage abuse they can settle the cases by donating to third party non-activists but they
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:47.440]  call them you know non-activist victims the settlements do not specify how the third party
[1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:52.800]  groups could use the windfall so far investigators have found and accounted for three billion paid
[1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:58.240]  to non-victim entities critics say banks are incentivized to donate the funds to non-profits
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:02.800]  rather than giving it to customers yeah golden sacks and jp morgan are the biggest funders of
[1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:08.560]  black lives matter google it and facebook and twitter because they're the big mega banks and
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:14.560]  big mega tech overthrowing our country they're the globalist they're the global power pointing
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:19.760]  at the russians that can hardly get up on their knees and saying they're running america and running
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:27.760]  trump baloney let's get the break i mean i knew black lives matter got a hundred million this year
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:37.440]  from you know foundations those are tax exempt globalist cribs wow so obama admits he wants to
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:41.920]  overthrow trump does the media say wow trump was right last week when he said that oh no he's still
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:50.240]  wrong we're gonna bring they've been not in here right now you go ahead and bring his chair and
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.640]  give us a mic up i'm gonna go ahead and just take a pause just for a minute it's just so outrageous
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:22:00.720]  that if we don't finally do something about these people if they don't start going to jail if some
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:06.320]  political heads don't start rolling they're going to set the precedent to do anything and their
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:13.120]  minions are already emboldened where the outgoing head of the cia three days before the president
[1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:20.400]  is sworn in says you ought to watch your mouth you better watch your mouth to the president
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:27.840]  of the united states what type of crazy out of control arrogant loon does that but see he's
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:32.560]  got the big banks and all the elites and the foreign governments and the republican establishment
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:38.000]  and the democratic establishment and all these scumbags get together and their traitorous councils
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.840]  and they believe that they can do anything together because they see trump as isolated
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:50.560]  he's not isolated scumbags let that be a warning to you the american people in the military and
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.280]  most of the intelligence agencies and most of the people in the fbi and other groups know now
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:59.840]  that they've got to choose a side that the globalist are about austerity they are about sexual
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:06.480]  exploitation of children they are about all these forms of corruption and weirdness and just bad for
[1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:14.960]  business bad for prosperity and men who aren't even perfect but have some humanity left must
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:20.240]  absolutely go after these people people like well they're dangerous they're a mafia they kill people
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:25.200]  look they're killing all the russian you know what at some point people got to stand up around here
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:31.360]  this is the battle for the republic our men will go and fight and die most of the time just so
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:36.640]  globalist corporations can come in we go take iraq out the chinese and the french get all the oil
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:42.800]  and then they blame us and say we did it for the oil we did it for globalism
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:47.200]  and and to take down that country for saudi arabia i'm not against the troops that were
[1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:51.520]  manipulated into that war they followed orders it's the globalists that did that but i'm maccha
[1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:56.080]  valiant enough to go read their own documents to know what they're doing this isn't my opinion
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:04.800]  they think you're so stupid they admit it all let let let's get that out right now the globalists
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:11.600]  are public wesley clark 10 years ago in two different speeches who was the head of nato at
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:16.640]  the time he just had retired went public and said there's a plan to topple these countries
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:21.280]  and then destabilize europe and flood everybody and it's not a good idea and wesley clark's no
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:29.680]  no goody two shoes these plans are so diabolical so evil that even corrupt people don't want to
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:33.360]  be part of it because they're like we already rule the world we're already going to get all
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:37.360]  the lives extension why would we want to do this well you're just not twisted enough like the

[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:11.840]  you know on the claims these meet with the russians and he's bad but what do you just make of
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:17.520]  three billion through the big banks through the just department fenced given to all the
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:22.000]  black lives matter grips we knew the justice department was running it but while funding it
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:26.720]  this is illegal well you know alex we've seen air colders justice department say that they're
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:31.680]  not going to prosecute the black panthers who were threatening people of baseball bad new
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:36.080]  black panthers well yeah the new black panthers just recently with the obama election well we're
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:39.680]  not gonna do that you're gonna stand there at a polling place and threaten people who are white
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:43.520]  to come in there and you're not gonna prosecute that so we knew where they were we knew this kind
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:49.040]  of stuff was going on and alex i gotta say too as we see these continuing revelations coming out
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:54.240]  where do they always start the stuff about flin the stuff about sessions all these accusations
[1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:59.200]  about russia this looks like watergate doesn't it's coming from the washington post the people who
[1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:04.880]  have a connection now in the ci if open financial connection 600 million exactly 600 million we have
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:09.600]  and that's what we know about yeah three billion to the commies you see running around the streets
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:14.160]  everywhere they're all paid for that's right they all think like little punk college kids
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:18.880]  they're about to take over and actually rule us that's why they're on power trips they tell me
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:23.680]  we're taking over we're going to kill everybody no you're not dumbass you better hope you better
[1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:28.720]  hope we take this thing back peacefully you little punks are looking for a fight you don't have any idea
[1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:35.200]  go ahead we know we've got with the washington post jeff bezos buys it for 250 million dollars
[1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:40.320]  and immediately he gets a 600 million dollar contract with a cia to run their data services
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:45.680]  and dwarfs what he just paid for the washington post and where does all the we're all these leaks
[1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:50.160]  from the surveillance state attacking the trump administration's illegal leaks exactly trump
[1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:54.160]  said it was obama the media said he was insane and these are the new york times yesterday it ball
[1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:59.200]  obama admitting he did it there's no trumps gonna bring it out so they hide it in plain view this
[1:30:59.200 --> 1:31:06.240]  watergate is absolutely on target yeah but i'm not mad at trump but he needs to go on offense now i
[1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:09.520]  mean you know it's his duty right that's right and so we're gonna talk about when we come back
[1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:14.160]  briefly i want to talk about mccain why isn't anybody looking at john mccain the fact that he
[1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:20.240]  just had another secret meeting with isis rebels okay this is in he didn't not the one four years
[1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:25.280]  ago doesn't not the one to he just went back to meet with the opposition of our military
[1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:30.080]  and we believe from the intel he's the one that leaked the human raid to make trump look bad
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:33.680]  exactly let me tell you trump take the gloves off the american people are going to back you
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:38.720]  a hundred percent these these are inside traders these are seditious these are benedictarnals
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:43.920]  take the gloves off and i mean all the way off they want to sedition and overthrow a civil war
[1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:48.480]  it's the president's duty to cut the head off this thing for the republic right now
[1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:55.760]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:06.240]  mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot mexican american border
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:13.120]  fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:18.400]  it would be simple for me to jump into the united states which shows that it is unnecessary
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:23.920]  and totally absurd to build a wall it shows how unnecessary this project this political
[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:30.000]  rhetoric from donald trump is however all this proves is that the fences on our border right
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:35.760]  now are too easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a
[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:41.840]  solution to keep people from lounging on top of our border wall the irony here is that the only
[1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:47.680]  thing this mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border
[1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:54.480]  fences currently are which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a better more secure wall
[1:32:54.480 --> 1:33:01.120]  is the solution this is millie weaver for info wars dot com it's not just our water we need to

[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:29.440]  that we've got admissions hiding in plain view coming up the next hour that i had no idea
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:35.920]  with dovetail into what just broke from a congressional judiciary committee that's
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:42.960]  investigating all this the democrats and then you look at what just came out of the judiciary
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:52.640]  to the white house to drum coursey where obama care stole 189 billion dollars that we know of so far
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:58.720]  out of fanny may freddy mack of private investment and then just told them their investment failed
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.080]  when people invested in the government housing market deal thinking it'd be a good investment
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:09.040]  like government bonds to get money back they just stole it from investors and alluded it
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.760]  to prop up obama care that's a bunch of insurance companies and banks robbing everything i mean
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:20.000]  got more coverage from what your own that was amazing investigation that that course he did
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.640]  and it was outright criminal act they were taking preferred stock they were supposed to get 10%
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:28.720]  off of these fanny and freddy mortgages instead they took all of it swept it in the journal fund
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:32.880]  then moved it into obama care because obama care that's a bail in that's how they do i'm here
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:36.480]  you know in greaser wherever they just grab it out of your bank account or cypress but let's expand
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:39.440]  this is what we're starting to learn this is what the white house is leaking out the folks so i guess
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:43.920]  trump is fighting back the problem is it's not even getting out there in the conservative media
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:49.680]  then let's expand then we learn that obama's moved into a bunker he wants to overthrow trump he's
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:54.880]  the leaker all that's illegal they hide it in everybody's you know uh face just again plain
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:37:03.600]  view nothing's done and then we learn the latest doj obama's doj funneled billions to liberal
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:09.440]  activist groups illegally and here is fox news contributor former governor of arkansas mike
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.840]  huckabee breaking it down let's start from the beginning because he says they need to go to jail
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:19.680]  absolutely here it is somebody ought to get a prison for this i mean this is worse than a mafia
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:24.480]  shakedown because at least if the mafia shakes you down for protection your store doesn't burn
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:30.960]  down but this is a case where the liberals have played robin hood they've stolen from the government
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:37.120]  the taxpayers and they've given it to their pals it's really outrageous and i think that
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:43.920]  part of it that is so frustrating imagine for example if under a republican department of justice
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:48.800]  the department of justice had allocated money to the national right to life or if they'd allocated
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.240]  it to the n r a can you imagine how that would have gone over with the democrats i don't think
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.320]  very well first amendment congress can't be involved for a moment and then back in 10 seconds
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:02.000]  think about that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.920]  prohibiting free exercise thereof or free him of the press or the right to peace this symbol
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.560]  read us agreement says government cannot get involved in funding the speech it wants to hear
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:16.720]  that means religious or political or anything else okay it's all protected and the government
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:24.720]  doesn't have jurisdiction and so instead they're illegally funding anti-american globalist groups
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.840]  this is unbelievable and what's unbelievable is we just keep learning more and more and more
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.960]  and more meanwhile the big scandal we'll go into this now i'm gonna finish the clip or part of it
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:42.960]  and we're gonna get to this is sessions as a senator as the ranking member of the arms
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:48.160]  services committee publicly met it was on his record on the senate site that he had a meeting
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.760]  twice with the russian ambassador i went and looked it up tumor had many more last year than that
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:58.400]  it's on there it turns out this guy likes the democrats sat with them in the inauguration
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:03.520]  it turns out he's buddies with pelosi it turns out he's buddies with everybody it turns out
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:10.080]  obama had 20 plus meetings with him last year as well but sessions has two and he's a russian
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:14.400]  agent and lied when he was asked specifically frankin read it obviously by a lawyer frank is not
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:20.880]  that smart knowing sessions as a lawyer we're told that in the press that surrogates on the campaign
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:24.880]  met with russians about the campaign he said no i'm a surrogate i'm one of the top surrogates
[1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:30.480]  nobody met about the campaign with russians they go oh you lied you met with a russian
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:37.840]  not in the campaign capacity you ask a lawyer you asked the head of the doj that's right
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:44.160]  at that time being confirmed and he gives you the perfect lawyer answer the judge or a detective
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:51.120]  wants he gave you the absolute boom spot truth that in the campaign in that function no meeting
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:57.920]  with the russians that they turned that total truth into a lie while hillary and our people
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.800]  are all the russian and communist chinese payroll and i had former congressman ranking member on
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:07.840]  the house or vice head of the armed services and homeland security committee telling you he saw
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:12.800]  the secret documents and hillary's basically a russian agent and a chinese agent and he's
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:17.680]  getting ready to bring it out now he hadn't come back on yet he kind of blew up on air he stomped
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:23.280]  out during the break like he was just angry and said i'm going public alex well okay kurt welden
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.760]  we need you because i heard that they're threatening him going don't you really set classified hearings
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:32.160]  they had classified hearings and they decided it was too bad for the country to come out that hillary
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:37.040]  was a chinese communist agent she was paid off by the russians but they weren't running her i've had
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:41.440]  former high level and current ci people say yes alex you're right hillary is a chinese agent
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:47.280]  and it's come out though it was in the news they're chinese communist agents forget the russians
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:52.400]  okay the russians have a lot of great science they're great people they got a lot of corruption
[1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:56.560]  though they they have the gdp of idly folks the russians aren't the threat the chinese
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.360]  communists are out of control and they've bought off our government and this whole thing about trump
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:06.240]  is to restore america do you understand that the intelligence agencies or branches of them
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:11.120]  that are patriots are the ones that rebelled against this alliance with china and the communist
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.920]  and the wahhabist islamists and said that's too far we're getting behind the people and trump was
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:21.520]  put in by the voters and the patriots in our government not the russians trump was put in by
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:28.560]  alex jones and the listeners of this broadcast and matt drudge he was not put in by the russians
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:34.560]  go ahead david i'm sorry alex when they did this to flan i said what they have just done
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:38.000]  is a self-inflicted wound while they're swimming and water with sharks and they're
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.840]  going to come after them again and that's precisely what they're doing trying to twist this
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:46.240]  into something that it wasn't as you point out he said yeah i'm in washington there's a russian
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:51.120]  ambassador in washington i meet with him a couple of times who didn't talk about the campaign and i
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:55.040]  think the same thing is true of flan when this was he's talking same thing it's all admitted
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:58.560]  once he stood down they go of course it was no big deal yeah and then they talk about oh the
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:02.160]  logan act the logan act you're trying to undermine obama's foreign policy you know who's trying to
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:07.120]  undermine that's meeting privately for business in a non-governmental capacity right but the logan
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:12.960]  act is trying to change uh the foreign policy working against the official foreign policy
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:17.600]  mccain is not the secretary of state mccain is not the president we just had him go at the end of
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:22.160]  five he doesn't have the authority on his own mission not sanctioned by congress to have a
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:26.640]  secret mission to meet with al nazar isis and al qaeda promising that they're gonna you know hold
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.440]  on we're gonna get you a block the american and russian operations sanctioned by the president
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:36.160]  of russia and the us together to destroy this al qaeda force that's the name the real name
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:40.880]  this little trader runs over there runs back we they put photos up with him with the leaders
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:44.800]  you know show let's show tv viewers tell folks that's right here so forget him meeting with a radical
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:52.320]  islamists that are fighting our military that's okay that's okay go ahead and show it tv viewers
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:56.320]  going back to when uh this is back in 2013 he tweeted out pictures of himself there with
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:02.480]  him we said look these people are not moderate uh rebels now whether or not these are al qaeda
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:07.040]  uh they're all the al nazar people that's the same group the fact is afterwards he came back
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:11.280]  and talked about ram paul he says has ram paul ever been to syria has he ever met with isis
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:16.000]  has he ever met with any of these people no no no in other words i have and what are you saying is
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.560]  that uh he went and met with a free syrian army he said there's about 70 who are still
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.600]  free syrian army well other people who defense consultants say no that was only about 30 at
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:32.080]  the time that's a generous measure but look we know that they were giving weapons to isis has been
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:36.640]  revealed over and over again now whether or not he was working against obama's policy you can say
[1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:41.440]  maybe he wasn't maybe he was secretly putting that policy in no he was became behind it that was admitted
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:45.680]  but what we have now was there behind the whole thing yeah exactly and what we have now i'm saying
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:50.560]  in the most charitable interpretation but we already have now yeah we know that he was working
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:56.560]  to to create isis what he's doing now he just went february 28th another secret trip now this is
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:00.480]  clearly there's no way by any stretch of the imagination that you could he's going to work
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:05.680]  against us military forces the word is he's the leaker and this is what people are looking into
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:11.040]  you better watch out oh yeah he's the leaker on the last target so that our people would get
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:15.200]  caught to embarrass trump just like the cia and the bay of pigs that's right so he goes there they
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:20.560]  get weapons we know he's meeting with isis back in 2014 snopes in the last day he's meeting with
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:26.000]  our enemies right now working against president trump exactly what he did on the 28th he goes
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:30.400]  there and as abc points out this is a secret trip that he made and then talked about it afterwards
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:36.800]  and he is criticizing trump's uh policy towards this at the same time and then the right after
[1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:43.520]  he leaves turkey cuts off syria's water supply look you have to understand that regime change is
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:48.240]  not the same as defeating isis and he's still criticizing trump's policy but he's working
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.640]  against trump's absolutely why is this okay for him to meet with isis and undermine trump
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:57.920]  and it's not okay for jeff sessions to talk to somebody and sure because we keep having real
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:02.800]  debates with msm like they care like they're rational like they're listening they're just there to
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:09.200]  spew lies disinformation and garbage and basically try to brainwash the american people uh into going
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:13.200]  along with us but i don't see it working uh but i gotta tell you they're very bold when you show
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:19.920]  people drudge report dot com info wars dot com to show uh serjay kisslock who's met with hillary
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:25.520]  uh who's met with obama scores of times who's met with uh schumer who's met with them all
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:29.680]  to now say it's bad that the republicans meet with them and then there's schumer with latimer
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:36.240]  putin i mean they really think we're stupid to now say that the trump government can't ever talk
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:43.440]  to the russians uh i mean to see this weird hyper mccarty ism because real mccarty ism wasn't what
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:48.320]  they call mccarty ism this is true authoritarian blacklisting shutting down the news calling
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:52.400]  people foreign agents of foreign power a few minutes on that that we're going to owin schreuer
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:58.080]  well you know alex are you absolutely right the real threat is china and we all know that this is a
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:01.760]  smokescreen we all know that this is not really you know about china you've been to china your
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:06.240]  daughter's adopted from china your engineer that works with chinese yeah they're they're even talking
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.400]  now about changing the one-child policy because they've they've created this massive demographic
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:16.160]  time bomb they have so many young men who are coming of age who don't have wives because they've
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:22.160]  they've had this one child policy and so china has got a time bomb they need a war and they
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:25.840]  need to have something to distract against this they're very adventurous you see this in the
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:30.240]  south china see they are ramping up their military spending well you know they're spending their men
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:33.920]  they're setting up giant colonies in africa they're marrying african women and they're just everywhere
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:37.600]  yeah i talk to special forces people all the time that are in africa you see it in the news too and
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.720]  it's like everywhere you go there's chinese men with their african wives and it's i mean a huge
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:49.360]  colonization i mean millions of chinese men military yeah are going in running farms mining they are
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:55.360]  taking over africa africa is being absorbed by china as its industrial base and its food base
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:47:01.200]  and as its mineral resource space africa is so heavily involved with with minerals that you
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:07.520]  need to understand that that is a strategic move by china to get these precious metals that they
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:12.400]  can't get in large quantity elsewhere so but how dare how dare trump try to come in here and try to
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:16.160]  restore our republic and actually get americans around america and have a few things to help our
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:20.880]  workers and try to stop all the social engineering to make us disintegrate we've known obama was trying
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:25.360]  to balkanize america and try to try to race war now we know three billion dollars was given by the
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.160]  justice department illegally to do it that's now on info wars dot com thank you david night thank you

[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:45.920]  huge story that's not getting any attention that ties into all this it turns out i'm gonna give you
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:53.600]  a little tidbit right now mainstream newspapers and mainstream hollywood firms are the main group
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:48:00.080]  and i've always suspected this putting out the truly fake news websites that put out incredible
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:06.160]  disinformation against myself against uh ron paul against uh president trump and others over the
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:14.320]  years and then they even point themselves and say look at how horrible this fake news is saying this
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:19.200]  person was dead or this or that happened and get this they're also making money off of it
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:26.160]  so it's worse than we even knew they literally run the fake news sites they then use the worst
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:32.400]  examples have people from the fake news sites that they fund go on npr and say i'm a fake news guy
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:42.800]  like alex jones and then speak for me man this is such a deceptive manipulative thing we've gotta
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:46.160]  we've got to stop this we've got to do something about this these people have got to be stood up
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:49.920]  against i mean they've been caught lying over the years so they're just quadrupling down now
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:53.760]  speaking of dehumanization i've got several articles i want to get to here coming up the
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:58.080]  start of the next segment that really ties into what owens about to hit on and we and we've got
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:01.840]  the article that we're going to be showing on screens we can scroll through that uh for tv viewers
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:07.840]  but they're not just degenerating the family they're not just saying there's a hundred new genders
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:11.600]  and if you're male or female that's bad because that hurts people that are the other genders so
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:19.440]  the original gender is hurtful so that can exist they're now having body augmentation or uh changes
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:24.080]  that's going past people getting all these uh face surgeries and things that really look like the
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:32.880]  cat lady it's now saying oh i'm an alien i'm not even human i'm i'm i'm a celebrity it's turning
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:38.960]  yourself into a carnival show barker a carnival show freak show so that that's how you quote make
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.680]  a living is not being part of the human system so humans look at you and think there's something
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:48.240]  wrong with you and what the system's doing is taking mental illness in many cases and also
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:53.440]  making it fashionable and cool this is another psychic psychological virus they admit that they've
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:58.560]  injected into society to confuse everyone then they have the corporate media hold it up as if
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:03.760]  it's something beautiful and powerful to further accelerate the downfall of civilization but humans
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:08.640]  can organize together recognize the disease and the filth the poison grapes the poison berries
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:14.000]  and teach others not to eat of them and and go away from the poison fruit we're right back in the
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:19.040]  garden of Eden we had the knowledge of good we weren't dumb it's the knowledge of evil is the
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:25.520]  virus of mental illness oh and shroyer break down this latest story well the story that i think
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.400]  you're referencing is the guy who turned himself into a genderless alien and he had a bunch of
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:35.920]  surgery to make himself look like i guess an alien he's got weird facial construction surgery and
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:42.640]  weird body surgery and you know alex i got a lot of flak hosting the fourth hour of this show
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:49.680]  earlier this week because i was quote unquote fat shaming a woman but no what i was actually
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:54.720]  upset about is exactly what you just alluded to look if somebody wants to go out and mutilate their
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:59.840]  body and transform into whatever it is that they think that it is they want to be and that's going
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:03.600]  to make them happy and there's a doctor out there that's going to do that surgery then you know what
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:09.120]  it's going to happen and as far as i can tell they have the right to do that my issue is exactly
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:16.000]  what you just said it's the corporate media it's the yahoo's the google's the facebook force feeding
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:21.520]  this to our kids every new disney movie comes out says you know if you boys and boys are kissing
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:27.200]  girls and girls are kissing it's a force feeding so it's like instead of instead of covering the
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:31.440]  story and being like well this is a little weird is this really what we want people doing is this
[1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:36.960]  healthy why is this person doing it they're like wow look at this it's original it's cool it's hip
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:41.520]  and the kids will be like wow that's cool that's hip i want to be a genderless alien or the story on
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:47.200]  yahoo that i was referring to this girl puts on a bunch of weight and yahoo promotes her saying look
[1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:51.120]  at her she's not ashamed of being fat she's standing up for the fact that she put up weight she's
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:56.480]  proud of it or this woman had the state paid for her to have bleach dumped in her eyes she identified
[1:51:56.480 --> 1:52:03.360]  as being a blind woman or this you know 60-year-old guy identifies as a four-year-old girl you can't
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:07.760]  even script this stuff alex and it's like you said earlier on the show it's everything that you've
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:14.400]  talked about over the last two decades all coming in at one time and it's like how do you even possibly
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:19.440]  cover all of this stuff i've got all of this news on my desk showing the double standard of all of
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:25.280]  these russian claims that russian is influencing trump's presidency or russia's influencing
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:30.000]  sessions but then of course you got to fight the battle that barack obama is moving billions of
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:35.920]  dollars throughout the government you've got to fight the fact that they're pushing alien genderless
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:40.720]  people on the youth putting it on the front page of these news publications so it's like what how
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:44.240]  do you even pick your battle they're coming at us from all angles and meanwhile they're saying don't
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:49.520]  show images in campus of a normal gender woman or man because that's hurtful or national geographic
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:55.040]  a woman doesn't exist i mean i mean this is on folks this is a full assault on humanity by the
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:02.160]  globalist zuckerberg schmidt all of them are your enemies in these uncertain times it makes sense to

[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.640]  and chuckie schumer and everybody else meeting with putin meeting with the russian ambassador
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:28.160]  drudge has got the big piece up there with uh
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:36.640]  putin and schumer it's incredible here's a new one wikileaks hillary clinton bragged about
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:42.240]  being invited to putin's inter sanctum meeting with him secretly putin urges voters to back bush
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.280]  lot more putin calls john mccain nuts just some of these reports i've got here
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:56.400]  it's just crazy how they're playing on the public significance acting like sessions has to go but
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:03.280]  the big issue is why did sessions recused himself from the russia investigation now a prosecutor
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:09.360]  appointed by obama he's going to be over it so that's why the state department's just ignoring
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:17.600]  tell us his orders by the justice department's been ignoring attorney general sessions orders is
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:22.800]  because they're planning on kicking trump out folks they just knew they couldn't do it day one
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:26.560]  because there was a landslide and they knew the public was awake and angry and knew what was
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:31.920]  happening they had to bring trump in and then start the discrediting start the lying start the
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:38.640]  false reports trump hit him super fast accelerating when he could do to try to turn the jobs back on
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:44.080]  and stop the economic implosion they admittedly tried an implosion but they failed so this is just
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:48.880]  an incredible battle and trump has to come out with sessions and everybody else and say you're
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:53.040]  the russian agents you're the chinese agents have press conferences with kurt welden and others
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:59.840]  bring out the documents and point out that you know that obama's given illegal leaks to the news
[1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:06.400]  that are even fake information it's just all there this is so incredible the level of this has gotten
[1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:13.680]  so unbelievable and then they're caught giving three billion dollars of stolen investor money
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:21.360]  to activist groups against the country the justice department the water a little better
[1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:26.240]  lynchmen illegally on that plane with obama when uh with uh clinton when he was under investigation
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:32.080]  because because they just they're crooks oh and shroyer getting back into this i've got some news
[1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:35.840]  i want to cover in the next hour i haven't gotten to it yet the ties into the elites meeting
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:40.480]  for doomsday scenarios yeah doomsday scenarios they're planning that's bloomberg we talk about
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:44.400]  this but everything we've talked about i'm not bragging it's crazy it's now front and center
[1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:51.920]  i mean if it keeps getting this wild every day what where does your gut tell you this is going
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:58.800]  well we've talked about this before and i think that despite all of the madness that we have in
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:03.120]  this political cycle right now despite all of the madness we have in the news i think that's
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:08.080]  still the number one thing to me and it's obviously what the elite are thinking that's what they're
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:13.040]  meeting with i mean this is all real for them too all this russia stuff all the news cycle
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:17.440]  they're in this world too but they're having meetings about biotech weapons they're having
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:22.240]  me you know bill gates is coming out warnings about 10 tens of millions that could possibly die
[1:59:22.240 --> 1:59:26.880]  from some guy on a computer screen making you don't expect global corporate private
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:34.400]  uh government based on quote a medical tyranny so let's just focus on this double standard with
[1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:39.760]  the russians real quick though alex because you you know you came in today and you were like hey
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:43.360]  we know that they're they got all these double standards go find some stuff for me so so we
[1:59:43.360 --> 1:59:50.960]  got this news i mean look at these headlines russia uh obama meets with latimer putin russian ambassador
[1:59:50.960 --> 1:59:57.840]  surge kisslock appeared as obama whitehouse at least 22 times it's obama russian agent i mean i
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:02.800]  don't hear any claims that obama is a russian agent how about this russia ambassador and chuck
[2:00:02.800 --> 2:00:09.440]  hagel visit the university of nebraska is chuck hagel a russian agent i mean this was a guy that
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:14.880]  had a lot of power where are the stories on that you're supposed to talk to ambassadors and diplomats
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:19.280]  and we've already covered those exactly but what i want from the crew because i went and looked it up
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:27.520]  and saw it is i want to go show all the other times democrats were with putin or with this ambassador
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:32.720]  because they're showing photos of republicans with them thinking the public's stupid and thinking
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:38.080]  that's illegal or they're claiming sessions lied when he told the truth saying not in the capacity

[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:47.920]  retroactively say you were raped there was a court case where they just no build it with the with the
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:53.200]  da here in austin where that went on and the girl got mad and you know said i'm gonna say you rape
[2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:58.240]  me reportedly and so they've dropped the case i mean this is scary folks this is this is social
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:03.120]  justice warriors for you oh and shroyer what do you make of this i mean this is just coming to a
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:09.920]  a head uh cnn's brand continues to plummet it's being reported their their numbers are just tanking
[2:04:10.640 --> 2:04:15.520]  starbucks is tanking uh lost like something like 20 of its businesses the last few months
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:19.360]  because of all their globalist activity every metric shows the mainstream's dying
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:23.600]  so that's why they're fighting so hard they're fighting for their life aren't they well that's
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:27.920]  interesting you bring that up because right now there's an interesting kind of paradigm shift
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:34.000]  happening at fox where you've got people either going towards nationalism towards trump and then
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:38.720]  you've got the shepherd smiths and of course you got meghan mccain on there too who you're just kind
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.560]  of feel like they aren't going with the grain they're gonna go against the grain they're gonna go
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.200]  against trump they're gonna be that voice of resistance at fox so i kind of see that struggle
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:51.600]  happening at fox it'll be interesting to see what happens there but back to the point you just made
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:55.840]  about rape real quick you know this is another thing and i know you want to talk about dehumanization
[2:04:55.840 --> 2:05:02.240]  this is a total disenfranchisement of men in the court well they're making sex and the act of procreation
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:07.520]  always rape yeah uh when in many manual species it's aggressive not really in ours i don't like
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:11.920]  aggressive sex myself but the point is it's not epidemic in the west it is in some cultures
[2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:17.120]  the more barbarous they are uh and so it's making that like we're men aren't even supposed to the
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:20.880]  woman puts her arms around you know supposed to put your arms around her right so they ignore
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.600]  what's happening in sweden but in america now there's courtrooms that won't even let a man testify
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:32.160]  against a woman who accused him of rape because they're saying it might be too traumatizing to
[2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:38.320]  the woman think about how dangerous that is there was a bill proposed in missouri it didn't it didn't
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:44.400]  get through thank god um i voted against it it was amendment saying that if you get charged if
[2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:49.840]  somebody just accuses you of sexual misconduct it sticks on your permanent record so look at what
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:54.560]  they're trying to open this up all you have to do is accuse a man of rape and now that's on his record
[2:05:54.560 --> 2:05:58.960]  for the rest of his life even if he's completely innocent and then he might not even get to voice
[2:05:58.960 --> 2:06:03.440]  his opinion in a courtroom because it might traumatize the woman think about how dangerous
[2:06:03.440 --> 2:06:08.000]  that is especially when you've got some of these crazy women out there we've seen them many of them
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:13.040]  hate trump i i video taped them you've seen them in the video they hate men i could see they've been
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:17.360]  brainwashed against their own species i mean they're killing the species that's the admitted plan
[2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:23.040]  and by the way oh and you are the archetypal you have young white male red tie american flag navy
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:29.840]  blue uh sports jacket i mean they absolutely you get so triggered by you and they're mainly white
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:35.360]  women they've been totally disenfranchised it's so sad oh and shroyer nightly news coming up with
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:39.600]  yourself any other tonight seven o'clock great job covering uh trump's uh address to the country

[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:55.840]  hard proof that msn is behind the fake news stay with us in fours dot com
[2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:06.080]  mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot mexican american border
[2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:12.960]  fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:18.400]  it would be simple for me to jump into the united states which shows that it is unnecessary and
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:24.240]  totally absurd to build a wall it shows how unnecessary this project this political rhetoric
[2:07:24.240 --> 2:07:30.800]  from donald trump is however all this proves is that the fences on our border right now are too
[2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:36.640]  easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to keep
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:42.720]  people from lounging on top of our border wall the irony here is that the only thing this mexican
[2:07:42.720 --> 2:07:49.440]  congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border fences currently are
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:55.920]  which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a better more secure wall is the solution

[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:35.120]  it's friday lord well and i'll be back this sunday 4 to 6 p.m central hosting the sunday
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:39.760]  transmission i'm coming to you from austin texas our investigative journalist and one of our amazing
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:46.080]  graphics uh and uh video editors and reporters darin mcgreen is here with us he pointed something
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:52.080]  out hiding in plain view some of it we've reported on some of it we haven't i wasn't aware of how
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:58.640]  open and obvious this is but that's a new tactic they've got trump comes out and says i know obama's
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:03.280]  leaking this stuff illegally and they're mixing in disinformation it's criminal there should be a
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:08.640]  probe obama denies it for two weeks and then comes out in the new york times with eric holder and says
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:16.560]  yeah i'm behind the leaks of classified intelligence and then it gets worse msm comes out
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:22.400]  and says yeah we run fake newspapers online to discredit our enemies and discredit the press
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:29.840]  and discredit uh alternative news and to make money i mean i could have secret servers and
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:33.840]  run fake sites i would never do that because i want to have credibility when we make a mistake
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:39.520]  we come and we tell you when we're angry i get angry you know we're a hundred percent bona fide
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:44.560]  and they know that and people know what we're talking about is happening and coming through
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:48.000]  the admission of global government the admission that they want to break up our families the
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.360]  admission they want to make us poor and then this i knew the justice department was behind
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.680]  the black lives matter and letting soros fund them to call for the killing of police and overthrow
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:01.760]  government and attacking christians and the communist groups marching in the streets
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:06.400]  billions of dollars last few years funded i didn't know and now congress has come out
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:12.560]  it's on associated press fox news you name it obama doj funnel billions to liberal activists
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:18.320]  groups illegally three billion dollars of it through big banks and then through the justice
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:24.800]  department when banks pay fines they would then tell the banks to pay it to these private
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:34.160]  non-profit groups now that is simply amazing so this shows this whole artificial system
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:39.120]  then he signed a bill two weeks before he left office in the defense authorization act a section
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:44.560]  to federalize all media and put the cia and foundations over the board of governors the
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:50.160]  fcc and begin countering and blocking and banning fake news three years ago they announced that they
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:54.880]  legalized the cia operating domestically in deception well the problem is trump has got control
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:59.840]  of the cia but they've got their people in there trying to block trump that's why brennan was so
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.880]  arrogant he said watch what you say watch your mouth to trump a few days before he was out
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.720]  and was shocked that trump got rid of him like he just rolled over and chuck sumer and chuck sumer
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:15.120]  we're gonna talk to chuck sumer said watch yourself the intelligence agencies could take you out so
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:21.440]  we're gonna break that down but here breaking this is on info wars dot com paul joseph watson
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:27.440]  man arrested for jewish center bomb threats is an anti-trump muslim convert trump proven right yet
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:32.800]  again and these things were being blamed on trump and then trump comes out and says whoever's doing
[2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:38.080]  it it's terrible it's horrible on monday's speech to congress and the media said oh he's a conspiracy
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:44.320]  theorist like alex jones new york daily news washington times vice so many i couldn't read them all
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:54.400]  said uh jerusalem post uh uh haritz uh the forward came out and said that i love hitler
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:01.600]  that is total defamation but they don't care anymore i love hitler and i love trump
[2:14:01.600 --> 2:14:11.040]  but it gets better i believe that these jewish centers are false flags i didn't say that i said
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:15.440]  almost all the time when somebody burns a cross in a yard or carves a thing in their face
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:19.520]  whether they're black or white all the time you know black woman says white guys raped her
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:23.280]  you know the whole across thing wasn't true a white woman says black guys raped her it turns
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:28.160]  out it's not true many cases because there's a certain type person who's racist and wants the
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:34.640]  attention and their mo is the same way turns out that's exactly what happened we googled his name
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:38.880]  and i guess they're already on it this is not broken yet and i like the intercept by the way
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:45.120]  statement from the arrest of former intercept reporter won thompson and it says that he worked
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:53.360]  for them so statement on the arrest of former intercept reporter and so the intercept green
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:58.400]  wall formerly with a guardian this guy worked for them probably an infiltrator is believing we
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:02.400]  double this too they were like is the intercept behind it hell no they're not they're trying to
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:07.280]  expose false flags agent provocateur i mean who knows who knows but this is what this is the stuff
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.480]  i can't talk about on air folks but we go through this too okay it's it's this is not a game this
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:17.920]  isn't a movie about spies and stuff this is the american people in solidarity with others around
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:24.080]  the world trying to throw the globalist off of us so just department funding radical violent groups
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:33.680]  illegally with illegal money obama stealing 180 plus billion dollars out of investors money put into
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:38.800]  fanny man freddy mac just saying you they lost it to give to megabanks through obama care i mean
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:43.200]  you talk about criminal looting it's over they should all be arrested this is crazy that's why
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:47.120]  they're so desperate to stop trumpet sessions because they know this new info is coming out of
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:51.920]  the winehouse to the press right we got the stuff from the winehouse the documents no one was covering
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:57.680]  nobody said they weren't true nobody tried it was directly federal register about the rulings about
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:04.000]  obama stealing the money so this is what's happening this is why they're so scared and it's a crazy
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:09.840]  time now mcbreen said alex to me yesterday after the show because do you think this is big and he
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.360]  usually just runs whatever he wants i don't make brains really smart and i said when he said that's
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:19.280]  huge i didn't know that he's got two pieces of news that are mainstream that admit like it's no big
[2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:24.160]  deal what they're doing sees that is they're normalizing what they do yeah we find the kill
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:28.960]  the cop groups yeah we steal the money of people that invest you know you know via the markets in
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:32.400]  fanny man freddy mac yeah we just take you know almost 200 billion dollars of it and give it to
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.640]  other people yeah we do whatever we want yeah we hope the borders don't let people in with syphilis
[2:16:36.640 --> 2:16:43.600]  here or whatever it's okay and yeah we run fake newspapers to attack our enemies make money and
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:49.600]  put out this info and then use that to discredit all the new media and call for it to be shut down
[2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:53.280]  you'll be doing the nightly news tonight darin i want you to come in spend some time and break down
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:58.000]  your findings well you're exactly right the mainstream media has been caught red-handed
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:04.880]  creating fake news websites and and they're complete with made-up stories that were spread online and
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:09.840]  and these stories were shared by millions of people on facebook and twitter because alex they
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:15.440]  look and feel like the real thing they look like traditional mainstream media websites check out the
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:21.360]  names of some of these websites salt lake city guardian the houston leader sacramento dispatch
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:26.400]  new york morning post in the indianapolis gazette like i said looks and feels like a legitimate
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:33.200]  website here's some of the headlines bombshell trump and putin spotted at swiss resort prior to
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:41.200]  the election and this was from the sacramento dispatch a news organization that does not exist
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:46.560]  there's no such thing here's another one trump refuses to provide california federal support
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:52.320]  in midst of a natural dot dot dot that's their clickbait and so what happens is you go to these
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:58.080]  websites and i saw these personally i saw these on facebook and twitter these these were popping
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:03.360]  up a lot of people were sharing them totally oblivious to the fact that they were sharing and
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:10.000]  spreading fake news and it turns out that these websites were created by 20th century fox
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:16.880]  wow now let's be clear you've got the report we're gonna go over it let's get this break this is so
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:21.600]  big and there's a bunch of others because i keep seeing these stories about it so that looks like
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:27.360]  major papers the russians have invaded alaska the russians run drudge report the russians run alex
[2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:32.480]  shones the russians run jeff sessions the russians run nigel forage and then they're in german too
[2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:36.720]  but they get translated in our news and remember that's what they were saying the cia in foreign
[2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:42.480]  countries puts out fake news that was illegal until and we could pull up the uh washington post
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:47.200]  article until a few years ago when they quote legalized it because the cia is like this is
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:51.120]  illegal and they're like we're going to legalize it they even had press conferences at the pentagon
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:54.480]  saying well now we're going to have domestic propaganda but don't worry we'll tell the truth
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:19:00.640]  the u.s repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans so again that's out of the
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:07.920]  washington's and uh post uh publication there that deals with public affairs so well this this
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:13.280]  could even go all the way back to operation mockingbird in the early 1950s because the cia even back
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:20.640]  then had 3000 plus cia agents embedded in mainstream media listen listen growing up in texas and
[2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:26.000]  dalis you couldn't swing a stick without hitting people that were auxiliary in the cia and that
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.520]  was supposed to assume that was how you beat the russians supposedly they've got all these spies
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.840]  it wasn't electronic back then you had to have actual people to be watching everything to see
[2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:37.200]  you know if this was going on and that's how they got the best and brightest if you were in
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:43.200]  the top of your class the cia came and tried to recruit you uh and my dad had family and
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:45.920]  stuff that had been in it and they were all like oh we kill people we bring drugs in you
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:50.560]  don't want to be part of this and so i mean i grew up knowing what was really going on and that
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:56.160]  was a cia that was more pro america than you can say now i mean they're into brazinski has
[2:19:56.160 --> 2:20:01.520]  written books where he admits the shadow state is behind child trafficking everything his argument
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:06.240]  is they they're in control of it to manage it and not let it get out of hand we manage criminals
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:12.080]  by running all the criminal operations and now the cia is just one of the bigger agencies 1947
[2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:18.160]  national security act they're just running rampant domestically filled with all the liberals and
[2:20:18.160 --> 2:20:22.800]  social justice warriors that have been packed in there under obama and under bill clinton and
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:28.320]  under even george w and they literally are waging war against us with this info so tell folks where
[2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:35.120]  you learned about this 20th century fox putting up fake newspapers to run lies against trump
[2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:41.120]  doing what they claim russia did against hillary when they didn't their excuses they're promoting
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:47.120]  a new movie that's coming out called cure for wellness but like i said this is i think it's
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:51.760]  more than that because it's slander it's defamation holding out a fake article not telling you it's
[2:20:51.760 --> 2:20:57.840]  sat there at the bottom if it's a lie absolutely now again who reported on the mainstream well
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:01.760]  new york times covered it washington post covered it yeah no no that's why i mentioned that because
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:05.840]  washington post is right there on screen yep to promote film 20th century fox created fake news
[2:21:05.840 --> 2:21:12.400]  site with fake anti-trump story see so they then admit it but it's okay when they put out fake news
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:18.880]  well the washington post a month ago put out the fake list uh of hundreds of names that they said
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:24.240]  were fake news some were fake like the onion info wars was not fake people threaten lawsuits because
[2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:29.120]  it is defamation they pulled it and said we don't know where we got it you got it from the cia we
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:34.000]  know where you got it okay that that later came out in fact trumps ordered the cia and people to stop
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:39.360]  it there's they're not following his orders one group is all the soldiers all the operatives all the
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:46.960]  humet all the men that actually do stuff the real muscle are all from but they're in there with all
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:51.280]  the analysts and chicken necks and they're total scum i mean i've told people that were there in
[2:21:51.280 --> 2:21:55.680]  the meetings when trump comes in and they're so sir here's all the targets obama won't let us hit
[2:21:55.680 --> 2:22:00.720]  these are all the ones where the al-qaeda and al-nasar bases are uh says such trump looks it over he
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:07.200]  goes hit them all and then literally analysts were like we're gonna get him or and he gave him all
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:11.920]  presence nobody knows this he gave him all presence of wood carved american flags and literally right
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:15.680]  if he walked out they were hopping around going we're gonna get him that was government money a
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:21.120]  bribe and a trump guy's tape behind he goes he knew you'd say that pulled out the letter with
[2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:26.720]  trump that paid for it and the receipt and handed it right to the rat that another you folks you're
[2:22:26.720 --> 2:22:31.520]  here i shouldn't even tell these stories that happened inside the day he went and spoke with
[2:22:31.520 --> 2:22:35.920]  the stars behind him that's where they said they wanted him to speak and one group knew it was a
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:38.960]  setup to then claim why he's standing in front of the stars other group said it's all right but
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:43.680]  the point is it's literally all the foundation people all the little aster kids and Rockefeller
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:47.280]  type kids you know they're better everybody they're better they all hate the men they all hate the
[2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:52.400]  tough guys they hate america and they they hate christians they just they're scum and they hate
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:56.640]  beautiful art i mean these are trash everybody knows it and and the people in the cia that are good
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:01.520]  they just want to get rid of them but they're the ones in there by the way i didn't get that from
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:04.880]  trump the media is going to check into that i'm going to crap themselves because nobody knows
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:09.520]  about that well there's civil war going on within the u.s intelligence agencies but we're talking about
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:15.920]  the cia embedded with mainstream media jeff bezos who who's the owner six tell him this is mainstream
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:23.440]  news jeff bezos he owns the washington post he's also the founder and ceo of amazon amazon just
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:29.600]  got a 600 million dollar contract with the cia all right so there there you go for that's that's a
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:33.280]  major conflict of interest yeah they announced five years ago that they were co-locating their
[2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:39.120]  servers together amazon google apple all these have been intelligence agency fronts that's the
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:44.000]  globalist model is to have intelligence agencies control the corporations and vice versa then
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:47.920]  transfer the power through the intelligence agencies from the nations to the globalist they've
[2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:53.840]  written books on this amazon the washington post and the 600 million cia contract and it's beyond that
[2:23:54.640 --> 2:23:58.160]  well i could say what happened as a result of that well let me give you this flash the washington
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:03.280]  post as its founding has been a naval intelligence operation and then it's been transferred to the
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:10.400]  cia but go ahead well as a result of the cia's contract with amazon amazon has all these servers
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:14.800]  and what happened during the run up to the election during the huge all the wiki leaks right but
[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:23.360]  that were wiki leaks emails and hillary clinton and all that amazon blocked all links to wiki leaks
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:28.880]  they just wouldn't allow it during that time oh remember bozo uh blomo blomo said on cnn you're
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:33.440]  not allowed to look at wiki leaks only we can he talks to you like your prisoners you're not allowed
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:40.880]  to read books where's the only ones allowed son of a crapper sorry go ahead well and i think it's
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:46.240]  i think this is a result too when you put out all this fake news on social media everybody gets
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:54.000]  confused and then they're afraid to to share news stories and and i think at in a as a result the
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:25:00.320]  mainstream media starts to look legit again that's right they're poisoning everything themselves
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:06.640]  mm-hmm to then go out and call for shutting everything else down or where you won't share
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:10.800]  information or they create blacklist and they've all done it they're announcing it but here's the
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:16.080]  deal nothing will put you back together cnn nothing will put starbucks back together notice
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.640]  they're all ganged up on us but every company waiting into the culture war is losing we're
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:24.640]  winning and that's not rhetoric and we're winning because our listeners and our viewers and our
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.520]  president and our resistance worldwide is only growing and we actually care about humanity we
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:35.200]  want prosperity we care about telling the truth i will not tell lies about my enemies to defeat them
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:40.720]  because i won't lower myself to their level our enemies are so bad i cannot even stop researching
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:46.480]  all the evil there's so much of it that i can't even hardly sleep i don't need to make stuff up
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:51.120]  about them they've got them oh here's another i do baby one out of a hundred interviews that i'm
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:56.640]  asked to do i am no longer doing print interviews with the media unless i'm at a public event and
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:00.160]  the camera is rolling because i've read that there's being a article i had actually read the
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:03.120]  whole thing i should people say look at the end of this it says you want to suck a sausage or
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:09.280]  something they i didn't say want to suck a sausage they say they're gambling slot machines in the
[2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:14.160]  office kind of just rated or something but see they always come in here acting so nice and that
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:18.720]  they're just friendly and and it's oh we love you alec but the point is that it's always a hit piece
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:22.800]  well he also says you know it's just credited that they aren't vetting the muslims and the whole
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:30.160]  article is a damn lie mm-hmm oh and he says in there i love trump like hitler and then the
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:33.680]  juror and then the herettes picks up that i love hitler and trump see how they just you
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.480]  like they take his fake news story then they add more to it this works in our favor there aren't
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:43.600]  slot machines here okay this works in our favor because anybody that tunes into this program
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:48.800]  and live for any amount of time that they just know they could see the what pinball machines
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.680]  yeah they were no we have pinball machines but he says slot machines well pull it up pull up the
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:27:00.640]  new spiegel article meet trumps propagandist speaker their spiegel i mean i just makes my
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:06.320]  head spin recap the whole story for everybody see see that slot machines trumps propaganda arm
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:12.320]  and you read the article and it's like everything in it is a distortion or a lie
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:18.240]  keep going well you got some notes go but recap everything because i was interrupting look just
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:24.800]  to recap the mainstream media was caught red-handed publishing fake news websites and i can't tell you
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:32.000]  how big this is because i mean i noticed when i was on facebook and twitter i saw these articles
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:37.520]  for myself again and again and again so these these articles got spread and shared by millions
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:42.480]  and millions of people all right and this that it was all anti-trump and but they had everything
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:49.280]  from lady gaga to donald's no no i remember seeing it i remember seeing he met secretly
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:52.640]  in switzerland knew it was horseman or to begin with because trump hasn't gone to switzerland
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:57.440]  in years i just knew it was bs when i saw it see it and i thought oh there's a newspaper lying
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:01.360]  because they're the fake news they lie all the time anyways but they're pretty slick alex because
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:06.160]  they really do look legitimate i'm telling you i mean look at the like i said the names salt lake
[2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:11.920]  city guardian the new york morning post indianapolis gazette they had advertisements they had links to
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:17.040]  other websites it absolutely looked and felt like traditional mainstream news media and people
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:21.600]  unknowingly that they just hey it looks real they share it with their friends but it was massive
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:28.000]  massive fake news massive scythe and um i don't know you know millions of people look at this
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  and this is how they call us fake news this is hand in the cookie jar without a doubt busted big
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.280]  time well they know they have low information people that get their news from entertainment
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:42.720]  co-bearer mainly older folks and we're out at these rallies they run up and scream and yell
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:47.840]  things like trump wants to deport black people or trump wants to cut funds to california i've
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:52.960]  had them and seen the reports you've had them uh millies adam uh i mean everybody's had them
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:29:00.480]  scream at them things that we know they put out that were fake and again they're saying we're fake
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:04.960]  they put out fake news and the washington post reports aren't like it's cute hey they also put
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:10.880]  out fake facebook pages that have to do with alex jones and info wars you know there's those
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:14.640]  those are out there as well i'll see you know somebody will say let me take another campaign
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:18.720]  they did well go ahead and finish your story and i'll tell you well somebody sent me a link and
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:25.440]  said look alex jones is talking about uh flat earth now alex jones is a flat earther and it
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:31.520]  was a link to some crazy conspiracy website about flat earth and it came from a bogus alex jones
[2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:35.840]  facebook page but then you read some of the comments and they're like oh he had figures coming
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:40.960]  from alex jones oh now he's a flat earther so there's a lot of bogus information out there
[2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:45.360]  no even the comments are fake in many cases to make it's been admitted to make you feel alone
[2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:49.680]  hey speaking of comments notice on the mainstream media web pages they don't have comment sections
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:52.880]  anymore that's right because they want you to come there and only get their view and they said
[2:29:52.880 --> 2:29:55.840]  two years ago they were getting rid of them even though it drives most of their traffic they said
[2:29:55.840 --> 2:30:00.560]  more than half the traffic they paul wrote about it they said in their big uh the media meetings
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:03.920]  they had that were public uh one was in chicago they said we got to get rid of them
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:08.320]  because you know we're losing our info war that's it they're at war when trump said the
[2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:13.360]  fake media that is the msm is the enemy of the american people they are the enemy of humanity
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:21.120]  folks and it's just a prima facia truth well they're losing control of the media because of
[2:30:21.120 --> 2:30:26.880]  independent media and because of the internet so i mean these you know six big corporations that
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:32.320]  control 90 of everything you read and these are death rows and they need they need to capture
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:35.840]  the internet they need to gain control of the internet so that's what they're trying to do
[2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:40.640]  with this as well that's right let me tell you what they've done to us again we don't even list all
[2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:46.720]  of our affiliates anymore of sgc and not to because the old tried and true tough ones we put them up
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:49.440]  because they don't mind they know somebody threatened them or whatever just a bunch of bull
[2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:53.520]  hundred you know hundred times out of whatever uh you know they don't very very rarely serious but
[2:30:53.520 --> 2:30:57.600]  new ones we learned so they don't get boycotted or threatened we just don't list our affiliates
[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:01.520]  they're in their local area everybody's hearing them the words being spread by our listeners
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.840]  and then the globalists can't even find out who to go after because they don't have the intel
[2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:10.560]  and that's how we've gone over 250 affiliates now from like 170 180 be in our top was not
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:14.160]  listing the affiliates i had that feeling a few years ago we started doing that it's really
[2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:18.320]  worked great we talked to the affiliate managers at the stations they get it they understand it
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:21.360]  they understand what's the point of me nationally saying who you are does nothing for you i just
[2:31:21.360 --> 2:31:25.600]  say local support the stations for the word there the enemy never knows and they can't go after them
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:30.000]  again this is a war folks this is hardcore the other thing they do i'll tell you when we come back
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:34.080]  Mcbrane stay with me because i want to get into some carbon tax news congress had hearings and
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:38.800]  confirmed it's all about shutting down american industry by the way you look super sharp in that
[2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:42.400]  blue suit thank you sir i mean i'm not like hitting on you or anything but i'm telling you you look
[2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:51.360]  good sitting in my chair too you look super sharp there we'll be back we're on the march the empires
[2:31:51.360 --> 2:32:03.920]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is what mika burzinski said on msnbc he could
[2:32:03.920 --> 2:32:10.240]  have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control right exactly what people think
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:15.520]  and that is the that is your job is this mika burzinski admitting that the mainstream media and
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:22.480]  msnbc's job is to confuse and trick the american public into not knowing what is actually going on
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:28.160]  she can't stand the fact that you might listen to the president donald trump instead of what they
[2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:34.240]  say on msnbc is mika burzinski freaking out because the mainstream media's stranglehold on
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:40.480]  reality is starting to slip away from their slippery sneaky slimy hands the reason why donald trump
[2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:45.520]  goes to the ground and goes to twitter is so he can reach out directly to you without the
[2:32:45.520 --> 2:32:52.080]  filter of the fake stream media so there it is folks mika burzinski admits the mainstream media's
[2:32:52.080 --> 2:32:57.760]  job is to undermine the message so that they control what you think for info wars dot com

[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:46.560]  the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence i'm a long
[2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:51.360]  way from the caveman my ancestors were but i'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence

[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:16.480]  kind of like my lines getting clear if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:24.160]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones i don't know if you tell a story about
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:34.160]  yesterday every time turn a little song for a second all these lines my face
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:39.920]  the past has come the past is
[2:35:39.920 --> 2:35:50.800]  cool the born we live we die join our ancestors isn't that the way
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:36:02.880]  i was talking to a former army psychologist just yesterday here at the office
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:08.400]  and he was telling me he goes the same thing that that had one of the big four banks
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:12.640]  he's the guy was the head of the fourth largest bank right that was a conversation i had for
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:16.240]  three hours on a plane from austin to new york on american airlines going to be on the view
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:23.280]  and he said alex you think people will adapt and overcome to fight the new world order in our
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:28.320]  system they're going to adapt and overcome to submit they're going to give into whatever we do
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:32.160]  as long as it's incremental and and the governor said listen to show he was here visiting his dad
[2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:38.080]  that was a retired general and he said this is off the record talk so we talked about an hour and a
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:41.040]  half and he couldn't convince me and then he did one talk to me more was arrogant at the end but
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:45.040]  that's the whole way of these guys and i to get it he got up in the suit was perfectly still crisp
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:48.080]  got his black trench coat looked totally perfect i don't know how he did it and you know it's how
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:54.000]  these guys do this stuff you know just he had it all down the arrogance all of it but you know
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:58.960]  what he's getting his ass kicked now but i was talking to this army guy and he wasn't arrogant
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:06.720]  about it he said you know our military loves to fight and loves to kill but he said they don't
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:10.720]  do that because they're bad they didn't do that because they started out that way they have to
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:15.040]  you have to adapt to it and get to where you like it or it destroys you and the men that weren't
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:18.560]  destroyed were the ones that got to where they liked it and the ones that are destroyed are the
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:25.040]  ones that never adapted to it and he said and that's what they do with the public is they basically
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:30.000]  do bad things to us and then get us to adapt and accept it so it's like with really smart people
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:35.360]  that's the highest knowledge is that those of us that see all the stuff we are not submitting
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:39.920]  we're trying to adapt to actually overcome it for people and build a better system but a lot of
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:44.000]  people think they're cool they just roll over or go along like i don't care if they shut down half
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:47.440]  the coal power plants i don't own coal stock well neither do i
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.080]  quite frankly my my family would make more money if if there wasn't coal
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:01.440]  my mom's got some oil wells out in west texas now that grandma died and my dad's got oil and gas
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.880]  wells they don't make that much money where oil and gas are but you know in case it's a lot for
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:11.520]  some people but let me tell you there wasn't coal there keeping the price down my dad would be filthy
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:18.720]  rich but my dad goes around lobbying to turn the coal on you know why we're not pieces of crap
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:24.000]  and that's a clean resource we've got that helps poor people it helps industry
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:28.240]  so i don't ever want to hear i'm for coal because i work for the oil companies i always see that
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:33.760]  hey dumbasses the oil companies have been lobbying to shut down coal i hate stupid liberals
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:39.120]  they're so ignorant they don't know anything we're going to a special report that's why i wanted you
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:46.320]  here makes me so angry so let's continue on along these lines
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.600]  ah it doesn't even matter the point is is that
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:59.680]  pop at any time darin it's just that it makes me so angry when i see this mindset where people
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:04.480]  think of things two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally about what at this moment gets me ahead
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:10.080]  okay let's go say you steal all the money in the world the world collapses now you've got piles of
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:15.120]  jewels and Rembrandt's and everything else but you're in the middle of nowhere and society's all
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:20.560]  collapsed and it's a hellhole that's not a good world well we'll just break away and have our own
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:25.040]  segregated area that's what elites always think that brings you down as well you cannot screw
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:34.160]  humanity over and transcend humanity must transcend and that's through free will if humanity decides
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:37.840]  to merge the machines and goes this whole process then that's what we've decided but that's what
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:46.240]  individuals decided not what you decide and so there's a report a clip from congressional hearings
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:51.840]  that matt put together the phony social cost of coal washed in times the war on fossil fuels
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:55.520]  ignores carbon's benefits and see it's never sophisticated in these news articles
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:01.200]  the fossil fuel industry is a bunch of different groups and countries and combines
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:07.120]  and oil and gas tend to give money against coal coal is always bullied around and just
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:13.120]  fights for survival i only promote coal because it's so much cleaner than oil not cleaner than gas
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:17.440]  and there's so much more of it hundreds of times more and obama said he was going to bankrupt
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:22.560]  the coal industry and what he did was bankrupt our our industry that's right because listen
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:26.000]  let's say you're a guy worth a hundred million dollars you've got a factory in the u.s if you
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:30.320]  go to mexico and have energy twice as cheap or three times cheaper in china no environmental
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:35.760]  standards the workers cost one tenth of what they do here and you can have profits that are say 15
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:42.800]  times bigger do you build in mexico or do you build in china well that's exactly what it's not a
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:47.520]  question of to even build the u.s exactly what trump's going to change all that but exactly but
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:53.040]  but here's the issue you can't build in the u.s with all those regulations you can't sell into
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.160]  the market because competitors will go to china or will go to mexico and so you can't even do it
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:04.400]  it's exactly right so see that's why i harp on coal all day folks we have enough coal for thousands
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:10.160]  of years it's totally clean it's not in mexico and places because they don't want to build the
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:16.240]  scrubbers that are super expensive to make it clean so matt you're really into this report you
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:19.760]  made some great points if you want to pop in because you've been you know pushing me to play this i
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:24.080]  mean it's kind of prima facie as i say for five minutes we know it was the shutdown american
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:28.480]  industry we know it helps china other countries in their industry to have power much cheaper than
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:32.720]  ours we know it makes business here prohibitive but uh you didn't know you were going on air but
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:37.920]  matt i mean i guess you wrote the description here for me here let me go ahead and read what
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:43.120]  you said about this at what cost examining coal and the cost of carbon house committee on science
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:49.440]  space and technology met on february 28 to examine the social cost of carbon which was the basis for
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:55.440]  the obama administration's extensive push for carbon regulation obama's team disregarded economic
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:42:00.720]  factors where they were imperative to reaching an accurate cost benefit analysis on carbon
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:06.240]  regulation but the house committee chairman andy biggs concluding that was far overreaching the
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:11.200]  committee was confirmed with the majority of benefits from domestic carbon regulations in the
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:17.120]  u.s. were conferring to foreign countries are moving the benefits uh to foreign countries you
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:24.960]  want to say something matt yeah um like those benefits um that the chairman discusses mr biggs
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:31.840]  um you know a lot of it is um in regard to competition right like you've been saying
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:36.960]  since i since before i started working here you know it's the fact that uh you know if our
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:41.520]  energy is more expensive companies are going to go to other countries it is a no brainer it's a
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:46.480]  mathematical equation oh it sure is and he's going to get into um some of the specifics here but one
[2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:53.840]  of the main um pieces of data that they disregarded was a discount rate which basically looked it
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:43:00.480]  basically helps calculate the cost of regulating carbon so without any further ado i think we
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:04.800]  should get to the cliff that's right then let's tie into the background obama caught in lawsuits
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:09.280]  confirmed federal government confirms the documents looting almost 200 billion out of fett
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:14.720]  franning may fett fett won't say for fett he said that you always have a tongue twister uh
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:19.200]  fanny and franning fanny and franning and franning matt yeah that's right i mean it just drives me
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:25.040]  crazy stealing from private investors in it to then give it to megabanks through obama care in a
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:30.160]  giant scam and then we catch them three billion darin you want to comment on this matt you were
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:35.920]  the one that brought me the article three billion to the social justice warriors of fines that banks
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:41.120]  paid for corrupt stuff they were involved in so the banks steal hundreds of billions of dollars
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:45.840]  in some cases was 386 billion uh that two banks got caught will covey and wills fargo laundering
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:51.360]  drug money so they got a 111 million dollar fine so first they get a slap on the wrist for billions
[2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:56.720]  stolen then they take that money and they give it to social justice warriors to overthrow the
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:01.840]  country take our guns and teach our kids that'll be sexually active at five so so just think about
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:07.680]  it crime upon crime upon crime upon crime they shut off almost a thousand of our power plants
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:14.000]  our power prices almost triple uh in the last uh nine years because bush started it all this hell
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:19.200]  goes on don't forget obama care oh then there's obama care thank god the public's dumb doubling
[2:44:19.200 --> 2:44:24.080]  tripling prices you can keep your doctor i mean this is all a mass raping of america
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:30.960]  and trump says it stops now and then i'm a policy wonk i study this stuff 10 hours a day probably
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:37.760]  used to do it more and i know everything he's doing is so smart and so good and then it pisses
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:42.480]  me off because it ain't about trump it's about me and my family and your family and these crooks
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:47.600]  not getting away with it so what's 20th century fox do they go start hundreds of fake websites
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:55.520]  with fake news about trump and then dumbasses read it and come tell me i'm fake news i'm about as
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:45:00.880]  fake as you don't get i'm the opposite i'm the anti-fake i mean i'm pissed off i can be here right
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:05.360]  now it's quite outrageous that they commit all these crimes during every front and nothing's
[2:45:05.360 --> 2:45:09.360]  being done i agree with governor huckabee that they need to be put in prison or there should be
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:16.080]  investigations what do you think about them only shutting down european and us coal what do you think
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:21.040]  the plan is if china and other countries have dirty coal and then we shut off our clean coal
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:25.440]  doesn't that add to actual emissions of dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere
[2:45:27.200 --> 2:45:33.040]  my good man tell me don't you think we're so lucky that there's the internet though because i'm
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:37.520]  thinking a lot of that a lot of what we're seeing right now is backlash for for trump being a
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:41.520]  seeing news that's that's why they're going after info wars because we were definitely instrumental
[2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:47.920]  in getting trump elect oh trump knows and i think if it wasn't for the internet that we'd probably
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:52.320]  be looking at a jeb bush presidency or god forbid no no but they're gonna agree with you but let's
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:57.360]  not let's not start you know what you're like the wolf says in pulp fiction you know in the car
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:02.080]  he says we can't celebrate yet let's not start oh no no hey revolution has just begun but i mean
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:06.000]  you know inauguration day what i'm telling you is we're in the war now absolutely michael savage
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:10.880]  said no a lot of people they they you know they celebrated of course we all celebrated as soon
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:15.040]  as trump was elected but no the battle has just begun that was getting the troops on the beach
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:19.680]  in hormondy yep i mean with a big fight we got a long way to go and hopefully we'll have eight years
[2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:23.280]  but we've got the initiative we've got the superior firepower we got history but they could set a
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:27.600]  nuke off they could shut the web off everybody's got to save these shows they've got to remember
[2:46:27.600 --> 2:46:31.280]  they've got to do their own research they've got to know folks you wanted to resistance it's here
[2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:35.040]  but the enemy's having to show itself that's what's beautiful about trump and they're not just
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:39.680]  fighting america countries everywhere breaking away from the globalists yeah let's go to this report
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:47.120]  uh from the committee on science and technology here it is to today's hearing entitled at what
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:52.560]  cost examining the social cost of three days ago i recognized myself for five minutes for an opening
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:59.520]  statement welcome to today's joint subcommittee hearing entitled at what cost examining the
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:04.400]  social cost of carbon today we will examine the previous administration's determination of the
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:11.520]  social cost of carbon or sec and explore why the calculated value is flawed energy is the bedrock
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:16.960]  of our society and yet the sec estimate of the previous administration has killed jobs limited
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:22.400]  innovation and resulted in higher energy costs for american families all in exchange for benefits
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:28.880]  that are negligible at best and not existent at worst the obama administration's interagency working
[2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:34.480]  group which ultimately established an enormously high sec of 37 per ton of co2 emitted into the
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:40.160]  atmosphere relied on an outdated economic model and failed to take into account the white house's
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:44.720]  own office of management and budget or it was written up by ken lay at enron as a republican
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:48.960]  scam just admit it by simply the working group used numbers that got them the results they wanted
[2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:53.280]  in order to advance the republicans come up with the scams like obama carrying carbon tax
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:56.880]  the democrats do it because that it's the republicans behind the scenes that are bad that's why
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:01.280]  they hate trump the establishment republicans are the worst because the republicans can at least
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:06.560]  talk stringent and i mean policy and waters don't know what planet they're on sorry go ahead as we
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:12.480]  will learn today the sec working group ignored two major omb recommendations for federal agency
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:19.360]  rulemaking first it failed to use a seven percent discount rate and instead relied on rates of 2.5
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:25.200]  percent three percent and five percent and second it ignored the guideline to report cost
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:30.720]  benefit analysis from a domestic perspective if nothing else is taken away from what will be a
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:37.680]  very technical hearing i hope it will be these two very basic flaws the low long-term discount rate
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.160]  established by the previous administration fundamentally disregards the notion that the
[2:48:42.160 --> 2:48:46.800]  american economy is resilient and can respond to potential future threats with technologic
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:52.640]  technological development and innovation as to the flaw of the previous administration's decision
[2:48:52.640 --> 2:48:58.160]  to focus on co2 emissions from a global perspective this approach leaves the us footing the bill for
[2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:03.760]  costly regulations that are based on benefits conferred to other countries it is simply not
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.000]  right for americans to be bearing the brunt of cost when the majority of benefits will be conferred
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:14.960]  away from home by ignoring omb guidelines the current sec models leave critical components
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:20.720]  out of the discussion if the omb guidelines would have been followed the social cost of carbon
[2:49:20.720 --> 2:49:26.240]  would have been significantly lower the previous administration disregarded scientific integrity
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:31.440]  by overestimating climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions in order to push an
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:37.280]  expensive regulatory agenda the administration inflated the sec to justify costly regulations
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:43.600]  in response to the allegedly terrible co2 emissions uh terrible damage co2 emissions will
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:49.200]  cause in the future the sec is nothing but a one-sided manipulation of parameters to fit the
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:56.800]  policy driven agendas of the previous administration these alarmist tactics need to stop today's
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.480]  hearing is intended to uncover the real truth and deception behind the scc america's strength
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:07.760]  emanates from our resilience and flexibility attempts to justify government regulations over
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:13.120]  industry innovation hinders growth and development i look forward to working with the trump administration
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:18.400]  to renew faith in american ingenuity and technological development that's why the
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:24.080]  stock markets had three trillion dollars now official today um is because they announced
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:29.360]  we weren't open for business we were to be sold off scientifically it's in all their documents
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:33.920]  and so that sounds like a good report but that's milk toast i mean it's stating the facts that
[2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:39.920]  this shuts us down industrially but that's because the globalists sit over it and then get control
[2:50:39.920 --> 2:50:45.360]  in the countries over the sell-off of america they are unbelievable criminals darin Mcbrain
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:48.720]  don't you think that the globalists are pretty much scrambling right now because i still think
[2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:53.520]  they have a trump hangover they really did expect hillary clinton to win yeah but i agree they're
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:59.440]  freaking out but they're super arrogant and so they've never given up and so yeah junker the head
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:02.560]  of the eu commission that's unelected sort of cussing and flipping out in parliament saying
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:06.320]  everybody's running against us all the countries are voting to pull out what are we gonna do well
[2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:10.320]  you're unelected man you're a dirtbag so the country's never had a vote they're like how are we in
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:16.080]  this we never voted we're pulling out they're like we'll march in the uu army we'll go ahead then and
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:19.520]  they always have you know we'll march in black lives matter to shoot you well they just get it

[2:51:24.080 --> 2:51:28.800]  all the paid protesters and then you have the media that covers this like it's a good thing and
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:34.240]  so i mean we do have a fight on our hands folks and i'm saying i'm not giving up and you see where

[2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:13.440]  it's a recruitment arm for liberty it shows the msm the real power it shows the trump people the
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:19.520]  real power to keep them honest and it also exercises free speech in the face of the bullies
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:24.320]  but also people that are scared see all the signs and they see all the shirts and they
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:28.400]  see the bumper stickers and they see what you're saying they see you wearing your colors they don't

[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:40.240]  because they want to make being excited look weak because it's what they're actually threatened by
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:44.000]  is people getting up getting their blood flowing getting focused knowing what's happening

[2:58:11.200 --> 2:58:15.760]  the dream and take action it'll be a hundred 18-wheelers it will be saying after we sell a
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:20.400]  million t-shirts let's put 10 million on the street let's bring these people to their knees
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:25.200]  they think they can deceive in the fake cyberspace they can put up fake news sites and lie about us
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:30.160]  and lie about god lie about jesus and lie and you'll say christ didn't exist and say there are no
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:36.960]  good people in the world but if you go get this t-shirt and everybody wears this t-shirt and it's
[2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:41.920]  seen everywhere and other people pick it up and paint on the side of their barns and put it on
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:47.200]  billboards on the backs of their cars it's a message of these bullies even if they kill trump
[2:58:47.200 --> 2:58:53.200]  the vision and the idea of restoring our republic and cutting taxes and believing in people again
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:59.520]  and not selling out the communist chinese is unstoppable i don't want to see 10 000 orders

[2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:26.320]  hell are we doing think about how great those people are that already changed the world that are

[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:45.840]  democrats with the very same russian ambassador their lies we knew trump made a mistake getting
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:51.600]  rid of flin blood in the water i'm not bashing the president but wow the traitorous activity is
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:59.200]  absolutely insane and then trump is just delivering so hard on his promises but i believe he needs to
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:03.840]  take the gloves off the new report out from fox news confirming that three billion dollars was
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:08.160]  transferred illegally by the justice department from fines they got from banks and given to
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:13.360]  social justice warrior groups huckabee says they got to arrest people uh they want to
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:17.440]  make sessions look embattled so he doesn't have the authority to go after him that's why i kept
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:22.320]  saying they're going to cook up session scandals weeks ago with you on air i said he must right now
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:26.560]  and i don't know what the hell's going on i know trump's delivering on the economy
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:30.640]  which they want to stall almost three trillion in the stock market so trump's great on those fronts
[3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:35.360]  but look when you're being attacked by globalist enemies it's his he's got to take the gloves off
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:41.840]  uh roger stone what do you think alex i'm in total agreement um first of all i i got to urge you to
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:48.000]  to stop mincing words and tell us how you really think yes sir i will you are you're on fire today
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:53.920]  really on fire and i congratulate you and i couldn't agree more people need to buy these t-shirts
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:59.040]  and wear them on the streets distribute them to your friends and your allies because it is the
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:06.480]  single best way to break through the mainstream media blackout of the facts regarding russia
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:11.600]  the facts regarding the recent election the facts regarding the corruption in the obama
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:19.200]  administration uh this is guerrilla politics uh it's over the top and it works the new news the
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:24.240]  washington post goes oh 20th 20th century fox and a bunch of others have all these hundreds of fake
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:29.520]  websites attacking us by name trump ui putting fake words in our mouths total defamation but
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:34.400]  it's okay because it's for movie production no it's not it's totally fake while they accuse us of this
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:39.120]  i mean this is just insane they have gone to levels of criminality never before seen
[3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:47.280]  well this morning congressman eric swahwell of california i called for a special prosecutor
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:55.360]  to look into roger stones extensive russian business connections i have a better idea congressman
[3:04:55.360 --> 3:05:02.000]  why don't you weigh your congressional immunity so that i can sue you and prove in a court of law
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:10.480]  that i have no russian business contacts and that you are a stone cold bald faced liar a pussy a
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:17.280]  coward hiding behind your congressional immunity to make half-baked and let's expand just last week
[3:05:17.280 --> 3:05:21.280]  the chairman of the intelligence committee said they gave them all the evidence there's not even
[3:05:21.280 --> 3:05:27.680]  freaking phone calls it's completely made up yeah they have nothing look new york times has reported
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:35.920]  on january 20th and more recently that the intelligence services have uh emails financial
[3:05:35.920 --> 3:05:43.920]  records of transactions uh in telephone intercepts that prove that that top trump aides including
[3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:50.720]  yours truly were in touch with the russians this is really simple put up or shut up and you keep
[3:05:50.720 --> 3:05:54.560]  saying i want to have the committee hearing which they said they'd have them they poisoned you
[3:05:54.560 --> 3:05:58.160]  well i gotta go because you gotta go to have your guests come up but what about
[3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:02.560]  trump said weeks ago obama's behind these leaks obama came out in the new york times instead he
[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:08.320]  was that's illegal and he's not president he doesn't have immunity anymore i mean that he is a piece
[3:06:08.320 --> 3:06:14.560]  of arrogant craziness well and we know that the second and third levels at the central intelligence
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:21.600]  agency are leaking like a sieve leaking about surveillance of general flin a felony leaking
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:30.720]  that i myself have uh i've had uh a fisa court warrant a secret warrant to monitor my communications
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:38.000]  for the last year think about that every email every text message uh every phone call listened to
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:44.160]  by the phone calls with donald trump my phone calls with alex jones it's an outrageous by a
[3:06:44.160 --> 3:06:50.640]  rape violation of my civil liberties and while they may now have my grocery lists they don't have
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:56.240]  any contact with the russians this is this is a witch hunt the intelligence committee admits it so
[3:06:56.240 --> 3:07:01.280]  they just put out more bs in the fake news new york times roger stone coming up mexican congressman
[3:07:01.280 --> 3:07:07.360]  bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30 foot mexican-american border fence near tijuana
[3:07:07.360 --> 3:07:13.840]  in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall guillera stated it would be simple for
[3:07:13.840 --> 3:07:19.840]  me to jump into the united states which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:26.960]  wall it shows how unnecessary this project is political rhetoric from donald trump is however
[3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:33.200]  all this proves is that the fences on our border right now are too easily climbable and perhaps some
[3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:38.400]  barbed wire at the top of the fence would be a solution to keep people from lounging on top of
[3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:44.400]  our border wall the irony here is that the only thing this mexican congressman accomplished is
[3:07:44.400 --> 3:07:51.440]  demonstrating just how unsecured our border fences currently are which then proves that donald trump's
[3:07:51.440 --> 3:08:15.440]  idea to build a better more secure wall is the solution this is millie weaver for info wars.com

[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:31.440]  roger stone thank you very much i'm roger stone uh helping out my good friend alex jones here on
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:40.240]  info wars i am outraged by the chain of illegal activities and leaks by the obama administration
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:47.680]  specifically our intelligence community leaking that general flinn was under surveillance is a
[3:10:47.680 --> 3:10:55.840]  felony punishable by 10 years in jail leaking that roger stone and paul maniforte um had secret
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:05.040]  fisa court warrants authorizing the uh surveillance of our emails our uh phone calls our text messages
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:14.160]  that leak is a felony punishable by 10 years in the break so it is time for the trump justice
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:22.720]  department and those honest folks that are still left at the fbi to begin enforcing the law my advice
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:29.520]  to the president very clear can the entire second level at the central intelligence agency but not
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:38.320]  before you authorize the fbi to review their emails their text messages let us find and prosecute
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:46.160]  the leakers and in fact if barack obama has given multi millions of dollars in violation to the law
[3:11:46.160 --> 3:11:54.560]  to left-wing advocacy advocacy groups he too should be prosecuted now uh joining me here on info wars
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:12:03.120]  is one of my favorite people len coladney len is the author of silent coup which is the definitive
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:10.160]  book on what really happened uh in watergate len is also i think one of the foremost experts
[3:12:10.720 --> 3:12:18.080]  on the journalist bob woodward now i read recently len that bob woodward is now going to
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:26.640]  write uh the definitive uh insider account on donald trump and that the trump white house is
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:34.560]  giving bob woodward access not a very good idea based on what i know but let's see what you think
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:42.480]  len had an idea and starting about three weeks ago we started to see a narrative build in the
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:51.520]  media they were using watergate as the model for trump and this was very very dangerous it went
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:13:00.080]  from cnn plucking bernstein carl bernstein woodward's cohort out and putting him on and there were
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:05.680]  many many illusions to things in watergate which included leaks by the way roger you well know
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:14.000]  and last night it was drips drips drips and uh hillary rosen uh this is clinton's person
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:21.040]  brought up that hero that they're waiting for named john dean so we're beginning to see the
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:28.080]  makings of a narrative that's very dangerous because we can't keep forcing presidents out of
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:34.880]  office with you just can't do it we have protections in the constitution that if you've got something
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:41.440]  against president trump file the charges with the house judiciary committee let's have a hearing
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:48.000]  a vote and a trial in the senate that's the way you do it but that's not what's building out there
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:55.360]  and that's why we see woodward on cnn and on fox and it would be sad if if president trump
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:14:04.240]  gave him any access uh i didn't talk in new orleans were you and i met and i produced the big lie
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:11.120]  that you have on page 520 of nixon's secrets i asked woodward what do you did in the navy
[3:14:11.120 --> 3:14:19.360]  did he brief alexander hey did he brief anyone and you can hear in this talk and on my website
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:26.960]  you can hear woodward say no never briefed anyone i defy you to find anyone and i did
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:33.760]  i found the secretary of defense velvet lair who uh confirmed that woodward was briefing al haig
[3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:41.600]  in 1969 and 70 and then admiral thomas more chairman of the joint chiefs who was woodward's boss
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:50.480]  also confirmed it so if you have someone lying about who they are they're fake he's a fake reporter
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:58.880]  producing fake news in fact he produced a fake history i think generations who weren't around
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:06.560]  for watergate uh you got to push back uh silent coup is a roadmap get silent coup read it and look
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:14.240]  for the signals and push back don't let them do it again this is a very very dangerous game they're
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:24.400]  playing and uh i think uh it's very important i saw on msnbc uh felony larry o donnell or whatever
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:30.800]  had a whole show with ejb on trying to figure out how they could remove trump with the 25th
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:37.680]  amendment this is serious business and you're spreading serious word so learn about watergate
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:45.120]  look for the the symptoms and push back because if donnell trump is forced from office any other
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:53.360]  way but constitutionally this country is headed toward a civil war it isn't necessary and the
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:59.200]  media should know better well and i must tell you i'm very impressed with larry o donnell
[3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.520]  because i don't know how anybody conducts an entire television show while they're that drunk
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:12.000]  in all honesty uh he is among the most dishonest journalists you can see on television uh you also
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:17.920]  kind of set me up to announce uh my next book which will be available in may it's called the lies of
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:24.720]  bob woodward uh and you'll be able to get it at amazon it is uh it's a shorter book but i think
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:30.960]  more and more people building on the incredible research that you have done building on the
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:38.240]  oral histories that are now at texas a and m in which uh both john dean and bob woodward
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:47.360]  lie repeatedly uh and this is important historical information that people uh need to to know now
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:54.480]  you have raised the question of john westley dean all one would need to do is to look at his
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:17:01.760]  sworn testimony to the watergate special prosecutors in depositions in his sworn testimony
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:09.520]  before the senate watergate committee to find multiple discrepancies and lies better known as
[3:17:09.520 --> 3:17:17.120]  perjury mr dean is the man who planned pushed and then covered up the watergate break in
[3:17:17.760 --> 3:17:27.840]  and lied repeatedly to president uh uh nixon about exactly what had transpired in his most
[3:17:27.840 --> 3:17:35.520]  recent book as you know which he claims is the definitive book on watergate in which he reproduces
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:43.280]  his many of the transcripts of uh taped conversations in the oval office um he seems for some odd reason
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:52.960]  to exclude it his conversations with the president on march 16 17th and 22nd the reason for that i
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:59.360]  believe of course is that it will show him coaching his client on how to perjure himself
[3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:07.920]  in misleading the president about the facts of watergate so letting a quizzing letting a rat
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:15.440]  this close to the trump white house is indeed incredibly dangerous i would suggest to the
[3:18:15.440 --> 3:18:23.440]  president that it is not wise to allow him any kind of access because the book he writes
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:31.760]  as the book he wrote about former cia director bill casey will be rife with falsehoods lies
[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:39.680]  and fake news what is uh your assessment here at len on john dean because it appears to me
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:47.760]  that he's moving far left as a protection against any re-examination of his true role role in
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:54.400]  watergate and by the way mr dean if you're listening please sue me because you like to sue people who
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:19:00.320]  can't fight back but i will fight back and i will prove in any court of law you want to choose
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:09.360]  that you sir are a liar and that you sir are the perp in watergate len well they brought the
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:15.600]  specter of john dean as you know john dean is more democrat today than he is anything else maybe
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:22.320]  even further left than that but john dean has been reduced in history because he was used
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:30.960]  by al xander hay and he was used by bob woodward and and uh thread was hard as they moved to force
[3:19:30.960 --> 3:19:40.480]  dixon out but he was the rat that that testified uh under and perjured himself so he's important
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:47.040]  but he's not as important as al xander hay he's not who became by the way president for 15 months
[3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:53.840]  there's a great book called nixon's gamble uh that will take you in and you'll see in great depth
[3:19:53.840 --> 3:20:04.240]  uh exactly the role that nixon made a bad call uh this is a situational conspiracy when i say that
[3:20:04.240 --> 3:20:11.920]  it isn't a true conspiracy because nixon appoints general hay to be his chief of staff he didn't
[3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:18.400]  know that general hay was going to drive him from office but general hay working with bob woodward
[3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:25.120]  and and for example bob woodward went to the senate watergate committee twice once he's in
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:32.960]  may of 73 and he said call alex butterfield and he went a second time in july and said call alex
[3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:40.640]  butterfield that's how the taping system got released his fingerprints are all over uh
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:48.160]  this this watergate the real watergate story in november of that year he published a story that
[3:20:48.160 --> 3:20:54.400]  said the deep throat said they're deliberate erasures on the tape and then shortly thereafter
[3:20:54.400 --> 3:21:00.240]  there was an 18 and a half minute gap which which i believe was put there by al xander hay and friend
[3:21:00.240 --> 3:21:08.080]  bizarre so silent coup is the other version but it's the real version and younger people younger
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:16.560]  than me it's 79 but certainly isn't who missed the thrill of watergate yet a copy of silent coup
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:21.840]  read it as though it were a playbook for what the media is going to do right now who is going to be
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:28.960]  the next john d who is going to be the next bob woodward and that's what we're going to find
[3:21:28.960 --> 3:21:36.960]  in the in this and uh this is uh to buy watergate dot com site and you can hear it all for yourself
[3:21:38.240 --> 3:21:44.080]  well there's another lesson here it seems to me uh len and that is um a lesson that's important
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:51.120]  for president trump one of nixon's greatest mistake was hiring the alexander butterfields of
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:21:58.880]  this world hiring uh a group of young men largely who were not loyal to him or his vision thanks for

[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:59.840]  revolution because you see it was the info wars the breitbart news is the daily callers and so many

[3:32:00.320 --> 3:32:05.760]  mexican congressman bryulia guillera scaled to the top of the 30-foot mexican american
[3:32:05.760 --> 3:32:11.680]  border fence near tijuana in an attempt to ridicule trump's plan to build a border wall
[3:32:11.680 --> 3:32:16.960]  guillera stated it would be simple for me to jump into the united states which shows that
[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:23.280]  it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall it shows how unnecessary this project this
[3:32:23.280 --> 3:32:29.680]  political rhetoric from donald trump is however all this proves is that the fences on our border
[3:32:29.680 --> 3:32:35.440]  right now are too easily climbable and perhaps some barbed wire at the top of the fence would
[3:32:35.440 --> 3:32:41.760]  be a solution to keep people from lounging on top of our border wall the irony here is that the only
[3:32:41.760 --> 3:32:47.680]  thing this mexican congressman accomplished is demonstrating just how unsecured our border
[3:32:47.680 --> 3:32:54.400]  fences currently are which then proves that donald trump's idea to build a better more secure wall
[3:32:54.400 --> 3:33:01.280]  is the solution this is millie weaver for info wars dot com hey everyone farms has been fuchs

[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:34.080]  attorney general jeff sessions and the witch hunt over russia uh josh thanks for joining us here today
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:38.640]  well roger thank you for having me and before we get started like to congratulate you on your
[3:37:38.640 --> 3:37:44.320]  phenomenal book and your upcoming documentary premiere well thank you very much so what's
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:51.040]  your assessment all of washington today seems to be a twitter about jeff sessions and this
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:58.640]  move to recuse himself from anything russian uh i don't buy the current narrative that the
[3:37:58.640 --> 3:38:05.200]  democrats and the media are seeking the removal of the attorney general because of some uh uh what
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.800]  i appears to be innocent contact with the russian ambassador what's behind the scenes here what's
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:18.080]  really going on well the russian issue is one of the great wedges i think of the trump era at least
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:25.520]  the early uh segment of his presidency uh we see that jeff sessions is one of five as i call the
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:32.800]  horsemen of the anti-globalist coalition we have sessions bannon miller trump and formerly flinn
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:40.000]  and what we're seeing here now is the democrats attempting to oust yet another member of this
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:46.880]  confederate to move forward what i believe is the democrats cornerstone platform
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:54.480]  which is open borders jeff sessions has been on the front lines against illegal immigration and
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:59.920]  also immigration associated with h1b visas he's fought against mark zuckerberg's lobbying group
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:07.840]  forward dot us and he's also fought soros who's attempted to decimate our southern borders to me
[3:39:07.840 --> 3:39:13.680]  in my purview this is the root cause of the new political witch hunt against jeff sessions
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:20.080]  you know it's interesting if we just had to content with liberal democrats and other globalists
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:25.760]  but my fear here is there's a lot of rhinos uh in the mix there are a lot of establishment
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:33.280]  republicans who never supported donald trump who are unhappy with his presidency uh who are
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:39.120]  nonetheless trying to infiltrate the nation uh you're upset about leaks in the white house this
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:45.520]  is really simple don't hire people who aren't loyal to you and you'll have no leaks you know
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:52.400]  what a stone's oldest rules go to bed with dogs wake up with fleas this is seems to me uh what
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:58.320]  it precisely what has happened len colad and he said it in an earlier segment who will be the john
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:06.960]  dean of the trump administration is it rince previs perhaps we'll we'll find out but uh i see
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:13.680]  the rhinos the coke brothers and other bad actors here in the establishment wing of
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:21.120]  the republican party trying to move this narrative against jeff sessions against steve bannon against
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:28.800]  steve miller uh and against others like general flinn uh who are indeed i think the key players
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:36.800]  in the effort to restore this country to greatness reverse the decline of america and above all
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:43.120]  clr borders roger you're correct there are a number of rhinos that have been pushing the
[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:49.680]  narrative alongside the democrats that what jeff sessions had did wrong collaborating in a very
[3:40:49.680 --> 3:40:57.600]  short meeting with ambassador kissley act we have jason shavits who said that he wanted sessions to
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:04.240]  offer further clarity on his testimony we had majority leader kevin mccartney who said that
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:11.200]  he too would like to see more clarity and that sessions ought to recuse himself from any probes
[3:41:11.200 --> 3:41:17.200]  concerning the russians and then of course uh to no one's surprise we have members of the deep
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:24.640]  state john mcgloughlin who was the former act uh the former acting head of the ci i saying that
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:32.720]  kissley act was quote a an experienced information collector uh insinuating that a meeting taking
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:39.840]  place between jeff sessions and him may have been an opportunity to spy well that's interesting
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:46.160]  jeff sessions was of course a member of the senate foreign relations committee uh a meeting between
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:53.920]  the senator and the russian ambassador would not in any way be illegal or improper uh the same case
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:42:00.080]  could be made uh in the in the flinn matter a phone call between general flinn and the russian
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:08.400]  ambassador would be well within general flinn's job description and in fact the purpose of the call
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:15.760]  as reported by the uh new york times was to arrange a telephone conversation between our president
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:24.400]  and the russian president nothing inappropriate about that so i am perplexed as to why general
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:32.320]  flinn would mislead the vice president if that has been reported accurately and why uh senator
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:39.120]  sessions who i think is a great man and a great attorney general with the exception of his position
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:45.680]  on uh marijuana because you can't be for states rights uh in the states that have legalized
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:52.480]  medicinal marijuana but not before states rights in the states that have legalized recreational
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:43:00.560]  marijuana doesn't work that way uh but putting that issue aside they want to remove sessions
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:07.120]  because he is the strong right arm of donald trump they want to remove remove sessions
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:14.960]  because he has been the leader in the congress to close our borders against terrorists and other
[3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:23.680]  criminals who would come here and don't mean us well who mean us harm i have said repeatedly
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:30.240]  that the real danger to this administration is not liberal democrats it's establishment republicans
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:38.960]  better a snake in the grass than an ass in the bosom now uh the other big uh
[3:43:38.960 --> 3:43:46.720]  uh brouhaha in washington now appears to be obama care so many in the establishment
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:53.040]  believe that the president would not follow through on his commitment to replace the obama
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:44:01.440]  health care system with a better system that would cover more people at a lower cost based on
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:09.680]  free market principles yet we have not yet seen the bill senator ran paul complaining that there's
[3:44:09.680 --> 3:44:16.560]  a game of keep away going on that he can't seem to see the bill that is being considered now i know
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:22.640]  your ear is very close to the ground what's your assessment on obama care and where this is headed
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:30.960]  well there is a fisher right now that is created on capitol hill we see the tea party wing of the
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:37.520]  republican party in the senate led by cruise lead and rent and then in the house we had a
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:45.840]  enjoyed in a coffee just today ran been somewhat of a de facto leader on trying to get a conservative
[3:44:45.840 --> 3:44:51.520]  solution to the repeal and replacement of obama care has said that the uh conservative members
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:59.120]  of that coalition are inclined to decline uh wanting to go forward with this uh plan that
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:04.880]  has been shrouded in secrecy as you had alluded to just a moment ago ran paul went on a hunt of his
[3:45:04.880 --> 3:45:11.680]  own tried to obtain the bill in room h 157 of the capitol building and was denied access to reading
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:17.520]  the bill he even brought a photocopy machine along with him just in case he was able to get a glimpse
[3:45:17.520 --> 3:45:24.080]  of it so what i see occurring right now is somewhat of a storm brewing between the rhinos the
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:29.920]  conservative wing of the party and where donald trump plays out on this is going to more or less
[3:45:29.920 --> 3:45:36.000]  define him early on as the either the deal making president as he has been a proponent of for quite
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:42.480]  some time throughout his campaign and through his presidency or is he going to be able to come
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:48.160]  together with both of these parties and offer what many say is obama light which i think the base
[3:45:48.160 --> 3:45:53.760]  would be quite upset about this is where donald trump solidifies himself early on legislationly
[3:45:53.760 --> 3:46:01.040]  as a dealmaker yeah i would bring your attention to a terrific article published in the new york
[3:46:01.040 --> 3:46:07.680]  post last week by charles gasparino one of their business reporters where he speculates
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:14.480]  about the administration's intention to move forward on their their tax reform proposal
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:21.360]  i am one who believes that if the president can revitalize our economy can begin to show
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:29.760]  an increase in job opportunities and show a more vibrant economy that it would not only buy him the
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:36.960]  revenues to solve a number of our other problems but would would would expand his political coalition
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:45.200]  would move him an additional 10 points to have a governing coalition that is both intact intense
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:54.320]  and vibrant yet i have very deep concerns the chief the president's chief economic advisor gary
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:47:03.120]  cone is a liberal democrat a lifelong opponent of tax reduction and he comes from uh goldman sacks
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:11.680]  uh now i have put my faith in the president uh and i don't deny that the folks from goldman sacks are
[3:47:11.680 --> 3:47:19.200]  are enormously capable individuals but i would like to know whether they intend to pursue
[3:47:19.760 --> 3:47:27.440]  the president's agenda or are they going to pursue the agenda of the left wing of the democratic party
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:35.680]  and thus guarantee the continued decline of our economy and our nation tell me josh what do you
[3:47:35.680 --> 3:47:44.240]  think well i think that the the uh infrastructure bill is a very smart play by the president not
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:50.640]  only because from a policy prescription standpoint the country needs a infrastructure bill many of our
[3:47:50.640 --> 3:47:56.720]  roads and bridges are falling apart but it offers an opportunity for president trump to
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:48:02.960]  provide sweeteners to senators that might have issues with some provisions in either the obama
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:11.280]  care replacement or repeal act or in tax reform so much like we saw in 2008 when barack obama and
[3:48:11.280 --> 3:48:17.440]  harry reid got together and offered the famous hundred million dollar uh koren husky kickback
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:25.440]  to senator nielsen of nebraska we see here that the president has an opportunity to get tax reform
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:32.960]  and obama care repeal and replacement through using sweeteners embedded uh inside of this infrastructure
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:36.960]  bill so i think it's possible this is where the deal making is going to come into play
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:42.880]  and i think in august is when we'll start to see real tax reform uh debates kicking off and then in
[3:48:42.880 --> 3:48:48.720]  terms of obama care replacement or repeal within uh rand paul had alluded to today that within the
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:55.120]  next three weeks we're going to see uh the house uh take begins a table of bill and uh as he said
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:49:00.240]  today to the washington times it's going to be up to the conservative wing of the republican party
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:09.040]  to either take it or leave it i think that's a good analysis a look down from maybe the toughest
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:15.760]  negotiator i've ever met uh it's easy to underestimate him uh he has been underestimated
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:21.840]  from the beginning in this sense it reminds me a lot of ronald reagan another president
[3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:28.880]  who was both very great and underestimated at every turn by his opponents throughout his
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:34.160]  political career i agree with you that the infrastructure bill could be the greatest
[3:49:34.160 --> 3:49:41.600]  christmas tree of all time in terms of providing opportunities to do some horse trading with
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:47.840]  team members of the house and the senate to get them on board i do have a concern that
[3:49:47.840 --> 3:49:54.320]  the infrastructure bill is going to incur debt beyond what is necessary and i'm hopeful the
[3:49:54.320 --> 3:50:01.120]  administration will look at some more innovative and creative ways of financing a restructure
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:08.720]  and a revitalization of our bridges our tunnels our roads our airports and our public facilities
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:17.280]  i do think through the use of insured bonds and other financial instruments there could be a better
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:26.000]  way to do this but it does fulfill one of the central tenants of trumpism which is it's time
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:34.160]  to reinvest in america i also think this backs into the russian question in an odd way the president
[3:50:34.160 --> 3:50:42.800]  has a very difficult choice he can incur debt in order to pay for more missiles and bombs
[3:50:42.800 --> 3:50:51.040]  and offensive weapons to use uh in a war in syria where in all honesty we have no friends
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:59.440]  Assad is a dictator propped up by the russians contributing to hamas and hezbollah funding them
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:05.920]  and on the other side you have isis propped up by the Saudis so here's the conundrum for president
[3:51:05.920 --> 3:51:14.240]  trump do we incur debt to restructure and revitalizes our bridges our tunnels our highways our schools
[3:51:14.240 --> 3:51:22.640]  our hospitals our airport facilities or do we borrow that money to pay for bombs to uh to use
[3:51:22.640 --> 3:51:32.400]  in a expanded proxy war in syria seems to me like the president has made his choice he has no illusions
[3:51:32.400 --> 3:51:40.960]  about vladimir pat pooten he knows he's kgb he knows he's a bad guy he knows theirs is a rotten
[3:51:40.960 --> 3:51:49.680]  totalitarian system but if richard nixon can negotiate strategic arms limitation with brezhnev
[3:51:49.680 --> 3:51:57.280]  then surely donald trump can negotiate peace uh over the question of syria in the middle east
[3:51:57.920 --> 3:52:06.880]  with vladimir putin so i say give peace a chance maybe that should be our next t-shirt alice jones
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:13.440]  give peace a chance i put my faith in donald trump he's the greatest negotiator perhaps
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:20.960]  whoever lived i'm reminded of my friend roi kohn who once said when it comes to the negotiation
[3:52:20.960 --> 3:52:30.160]  table donald trump pisses ice water he is tough as nails and that is the guy i want negotiating
[3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:37.440]  for the united states josh i agree with you 100 roger and the issue at hand that you were talking
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:42.720]  about the conundrum between uh the infrastructure plan and then building our military is that going
[3:52:42.720 --> 3:52:48.080]  to negatively impact the deficit donald trump has promised from the very get-go-way balance budget
[3:52:48.080 --> 3:52:53.600]  if he's able to bring a balance i'm gonna have to cut you off there because we're going to the break

[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:18.400]  I'm Roger Stone back with you on info wars and glad to be here helping my good friend Alex Jones
[3:56:18.400 --> 3:56:25.120]  who is without any question one of the MVPs in the election of Donald Trump and the effort to
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:32.480]  make America great again I ask you how you would feel if you knew that the government had been
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:39.840]  looking at your email your text messages and listening to every single one of your cell phone
[3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:47.200]  calls or your home phone calls over the last year would you feel violated would you feel that your
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:54.000]  privacy rights had been destroyed would you feel that your civil liberties had been trashed well
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:57:01.760]  that's how I feel and it is not an easy feeling because although it's now clear that the federal
[3:57:01.760 --> 3:57:08.640]  intelligence agencies and the justice department have access to my grocery list and my back and
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:17.280]  forth emails with my wife my members of my family my business associates my conversations with Alex
[3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:25.200]  Jones my conversations with president trump and president elect trump but I'll tell you what the
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:34.640]  intelligence services do not have any proof whatsoever that I had any contact with the Russian
[3:57:34.640 --> 3:57:42.960]  state Russian intelligence or any russians or anyone fronting for the russians there are no
[3:57:42.960 --> 3:57:52.240]  weasel words here though there are no attempts to deceive this is a witch hunt it is a lie
[3:57:53.200 --> 3:57:59.920]  and it is beneath the dignity of the federal government if they have any I also want to
[3:57:59.920 --> 3:58:06.720]  tell you that if you want to stick your thumb in the eye of the political establishment please go

[3:58:40.400 --> 3:58:50.160]  out to you that the books in positions 14 and 15 on the list have a lower nielson book scan rating
[3:58:50.160 --> 3:58:56.800]  than this book does meaning that there's a high probability that the book has in fact qualified
[3:58:56.800 --> 3:59:04.640]  for the new york times list but her perhaps has not been listed for political reasons so go to the
