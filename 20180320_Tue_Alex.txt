[00:00.000 --> 00:18.480]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.520]  here we are ladies and gentlemen Tuesday the 20th day of March 2018 I'm
[00:46.520 --> 00:51.240]  alex jones your host and we have an unusual overload of critical news and
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.920]  information first off out of the gates one of the live feed names that we sent
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.080]  over the internet today on Facebook YouTube and Twitter has the headline in
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.680]  it learn exclusively why Facebook stock has dropped nearly 40 billion dollars
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.440]  and it's not because of the one company over in the UK that's involved in
[01:14.440 --> 01:20.960]  hundreds of elections a year with its analytics and scraping names to attach
[01:20.960 --> 01:26.480]  them to email lists for the different parties it's because by the mainstream
[01:26.480 --> 01:34.000]  media finally reporting on what Facebook does it then brings down the whole
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.640]  house of cards so they were so desperate to try to act like Trump stole the
[01:38.640 --> 01:50.320]  election that they gave away the farm by admitting that Facebook is a giant
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.760]  datamating operation and sells your information and now the former head of
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.880]  Hillary's campaign has come out and said oh yeah we own Facebook of the
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.080]  Democratic Party but I say yesterday I said Facebook is a Democratic Party
[02:04.080 --> 02:11.280]  globalist weapon system and what the British company did who by the way get
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.280]  hired by leftist conservatives you name it and then there is a lot of evidence
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.400]  of corruption going on there so these companies do that banning came and culled
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.360]  five million names off of billions on Facebook so they could email them now I
[02:27.360 --> 02:32.160]  said that Sunday when it broke I said that yesterday Snowden's come out and
[02:32.160 --> 02:38.560]  said that Hillary's former manager has come out and said that because I'm not a
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.600]  tech guy but I read the tech publications and this is what these
[02:44.600 --> 02:53.280]  companies do and this particular company over in the UK is small in the
[02:53.280 --> 02:57.800]  overall business but the media thought the control court media that they could
[02:57.800 --> 03:05.200]  dynamite Trump and make it look like Trump had committed all these crimes but
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.800]  then once people go wait a minute Facebook was involved oh wait a minute
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.400]  Facebook doesn't on a scale billions of times bigger because they're doing it
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.720]  every day how Trump consultants exploited the Facebook data of millions
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.800]  millions New York Times Cambridge Analytica responds at the CEO film
[03:24.800 --> 03:30.600]  discussing bribery and entrapment of politicians around the world they're
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.840]  just mercenaries authority seek warrant to rate of offices of Cambridge
[03:34.840 --> 03:42.360]  Analytica amid Facebook data showdown this is what big data does you think
[03:42.360 --> 03:48.800]  Facebook's bad alphabet in Google make Facebook look tame like us like a
[03:48.800 --> 03:56.200]  freshman in Google it has a master's degree so the left thought it could limit
[03:56.200 --> 04:00.440]  it limit just showing you the big brother control grid but only a small
[04:00.440 --> 04:04.400]  little snapshot of you like we're at a 30,000 foot view and we're seeing all
[04:04.400 --> 04:07.600]  the different globalists and operations and thousands of companies they zoomed
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.840]  in with a microscope down and went look this is the entire universe the entire
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.200]  universe is nothing but Cambridge Analytica they invented this they are
[04:17.200 --> 04:20.920]  the reason it's like saying the big bad Russians can steal all the elections
[04:20.920 --> 04:27.160]  when there's all these other people and players it's like saying one high school
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.720]  team is the only football team in the world when you pull back and there's
[04:30.720 --> 04:35.360]  thousands of high school teams there's hundreds of college teams there's dozens
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.800]  of NFL teams they just focus in though with deception so you're looking right
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.760]  at the fine print and you pull back and it's like whoa and it's that pullback
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.280]  that's devastating Facebook as everybody learns what we told you a decade ago
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.840]  it's there to control dumb efforts run your life scam you manipulate you sell

[06:18.160 --> 06:28.660]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones well we've
[06:28.660 --> 06:36.160]  got another big important broadcast lined up for you today Facebook has seen
[06:36.160 --> 06:41.080]  it stock go down 40 billion dollars because the cats out of the back the
[06:41.080 --> 06:45.560]  Democrats saw one little thread on the Christmas sweater and they reached out
[06:45.560 --> 06:52.640]  and grabbed it and began pulling back and pretty soon the whole sweater was in
[06:52.640 --> 07:00.680]  a big pile of yarn because Facebook Amazon Google YouTube Twitter they're
[07:00.680 --> 07:10.600]  all giant snooping systems they're all giant psychological warfare systems to
[07:10.600 --> 07:14.520]  create false realities and then to control you and to use bots to manipulate
[07:14.520 --> 07:19.120]  your political cultural and economic views to consolidate power and wealth
[07:19.120 --> 07:23.840]  they are looting operations and the fact that the media the control corporate
[07:23.840 --> 07:29.080]  media the London Guardian tried to act like Trump stole the election because
[07:29.080 --> 07:36.600]  one company Cambridge Analytica was legally allowed by Facebook to go in
[07:36.600 --> 07:43.120]  and data mine they thought they bought what 200 something thousand and they
[07:43.120 --> 07:47.040]  said they got into five million using that they leveraged it out to 50 million
[07:47.040 --> 07:50.560]  people they reach from the campaign well if you look at the reach in fact we
[07:50.560 --> 07:57.720]  go ask Lewis to give you a screenshot or or John we Facebook says we reach
[07:57.720 --> 08:01.720]  billions of people a quarter now that just means they get on a screen and see
[08:01.720 --> 08:05.200]  our information doesn't mean they read it doesn't mean they watch the video but
[08:05.200 --> 08:11.320]  it means billions of people just on our Facebook platforms see info wars
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.960]  material every quarter I mean last time I saw it was a couple billion a quarter
[08:14.960 --> 08:21.880]  so when you hear numbers like 50 million reach that is nothing and I'm not
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.960]  defending Steve Bannon I'm not even defending that back when he was at
[08:25.960 --> 08:29.000]  Breitbart that he was trying to get a mailing list of people to come to
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.440]  Breitbart that's what you should do but I'm not even defending him I don't like
[08:32.440 --> 08:39.160]  Steve Bannon I'm defending reality and so as soon as they began to look at how
[08:39.160 --> 08:44.280]  Facebook let this company in to do that they're trying to say this one
[08:44.280 --> 08:52.800]  company with Facebook was the person that basically destroyed the virginity of
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.960]  the pure driven snow that is Mark Zuckerberg no Facebook is a giant gang
[08:58.960 --> 09:04.240]  raping operation and thousands of companies can go in and by whatever
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.960]  data they want law enforcement private companies private investors there are
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.280]  hundreds of companies in Austin Texas that mine Facebook where I sit by the
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.880]  way a new bombing today now a fifth bombing blew up at a FedEx facility in
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.720]  San Antonio an hour south of where I sit and it was a another shrapnel bomb on
[09:25.720 --> 09:33.040]  its way to Austin so the police said that it was a bomb that was being
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.040]  constructed right there on the site I've confirmed from another law enforcement
[09:36.040 --> 09:41.000]  source that they exactly what we're told are individual at least with the first
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.520]  bombs was using a mousetrap so that when it flips it then powers the little
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.400]  capacitor and then detonates the bomb that's what they call a tripwire in the
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.680]  woods or the other things is a pressure release bomb a mousetrap and then now I
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.240]  guess they've changed tactics again or it's more than one individual Paul Watson
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.640]  makes the point that the Unabomber is being glorified on Netflix the left
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.600]  unifies the Unabomber I said that last week I said that theodore Kosinski's
[10:11.600 --> 10:17.120]  like a poster child for the left he's kind of worshiped by the left and it's
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.520]  kind of a prototype of the Antifa in many respects and so I said that could be
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.360]  it also the bombing looks like a circle I was talking to some law enforcement
[10:25.360 --> 10:28.520]  sources this morning and they said but maybe they're just putting a circle
[10:28.520 --> 10:33.520]  around Austin or maybe it is kind of fight club-esque where they're gonna
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.480]  make a smiley face or that was fiction but somebody tried to recreate that a
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.240]  few years later blowing up mailboxes or perhaps it is a zodiac killer type deal
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.040]  where there's gonna be some codes in this because these loans tend to like to
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.280]  feel powerful to feel important and you know have a code then that everyone
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.800]  looks at a lot of times it's kind of an occultic ritual they believe enough
[10:57.800 --> 11:02.080]  people look at it or see it that it becomes powerful gives them power it's
[11:02.080 --> 11:08.360]  like the maniac that poisoned the treaty oak that was in central Austin big giant
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.360]  oak tree where they signed the you know the treaty basically creating Texas and
[11:13.360 --> 11:17.480]  he was a devil worshipper and that night he dug into it with a jackhammer and
[11:17.480 --> 11:25.640]  poured hundreds of pounds of weed killer on the tree so there's never any
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.040]  telling I mean the purse is crazy or the group is out of their minds but there's
[11:32.040 --> 11:36.200]  a lot of permutations in that but you are getting exclusive information that
[11:36.200 --> 11:40.520]  it is a pressure bombs they're individuals using mousetraps that when
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.920]  you pick it up it flips the mousetrap then that flips the switch that detonates
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.920]  the bomb and from this law enforcement source it's a separate one from the other
[11:48.920 --> 11:57.000]  two more of a bomb expert I'll just say that that they don't understand you know
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.640]  they're saying it's primitive they're saying it's dangerous but it's not
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.480]  because they're attaching the wire after the mousetrap is set it's still
[12:07.480 --> 12:14.600]  dangerous but not like a mercury switch so it's a big big giant crazy
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.120]  dystopic soap opera and we're all living right in the middle of it so pray for
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.760]  folks pray for everybody and you never know randomly this is the type of lottery
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.400]  you don't want to win where you go out to get that package and it blows your
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.320]  arms off I was talking to one source and they talked about the poor 17-year-old
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.760]  man it was a second person to be bombed that it blew his arms off almost blew
[12:38.760 --> 12:44.000]  his head off because he blew up right in a v-shaped doorway so he got the full
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.240]  force but he felt no pain blew his arms off little big hole in his chest and
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.720]  almost blew his head off his shoulders so that's what's going on there
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.080]  prayers go out to the family and those folks I got a bunch of other just it's
[12:59.080 --> 13:08.040]  so much news today but let me get back to the whole Zuckerberg thing this
[13:08.040 --> 13:14.960]  company Cambridge Analytica has hundreds of clients and the new news is that now
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.280]  there's attention on them there is Channel 4 report with undercover video
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.560]  of Alexander Nix well that sounds like a James Bond super villain Alexander
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.480]  Nix telling undercover reporters posing as perspective Sri Lankan clients
[13:29.480 --> 13:32.480]  they'll do Republican Democrat they don't care liberal conservative
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.240]  communist whatever that his company could potentially entrap politicians by
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.000]  setting them up with attractive women and filming the encounter and that
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.600]  they're mainly just former MI6 spies well that's it you graduate out of
[13:43.600 --> 13:48.320]  these out of the military and then out of college or vice versa and then into
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.320]  the CIA or other agencies and then into the private operations I keep
[13:53.320 --> 13:59.880]  explaining this to everybody and they're just mercenary groups that's all and
[13:59.880 --> 14:06.440]  that's why 80% of the Russian bots were pro-Hillary because it was just three
[14:06.440 --> 14:11.000]  different companies we now know of that just took money and in elections you
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.880]  get around the Federal Elections Commission of your corrupt by going to
[14:13.880 --> 14:19.440]  foreign companies to do it so of course there was Russian-based collusion very
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.160]  very small less than half percent even congressional reports admit of overall
[14:23.160 --> 14:28.440]  bot activity but it was some effective botting Michael Moore out at anti-Trump
[14:28.440 --> 14:33.160]  rallies during the election after the election from the Russian bots because
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.840]  it was an effective company and you pay him money they'll go do it I don't do
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.240]  that type of advertising is a lot of its legal but I still don't go there you can
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.800]  go pay companies to bot your stuff everywhere you can go pay companies to
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.040]  push your but you go by fake Twitter followers and Facebook likes and all
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.200]  that everybody knows about that but they're trying to act like only Trump and
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.640]  only Bannon did this and they're trying to conflate it with other stuff this
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.960]  company did with you know something that Trump supposedly did when Trump did
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.720]  nothing and I'm not defending Trump I'm defending reality and that's why
[15:04.720 --> 15:07.880]  Facebook stocks down right at forty million dollars today because they're
[15:07.880 --> 15:11.160]  going to wait you're gonna get this company in trouble for going and data
[15:11.160 --> 15:15.200]  mining millions of people out of here when Facebook is a giant data mining
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.880]  operation and sells it to everybody I can go to Facebook and buy data you can
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.440]  go to be you let me tell you money talks and you know what walks you can't touch
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.440]  my three lock box so we're gonna continue to watch that as it unfolds but it
[15:28.440 --> 15:34.720]  just shows how the left is so savage so mindless so out of control trying to get
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.080]  Trump there's a reason other beggar smarter organizations didn't use this
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.040]  data to try to hurt Trump before because they know at least right back to them
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.520]  and now the head of the Clinton campaign admitting we took cover that we come
[15:46.520 --> 15:55.880]  back they're saying hey we quote oh we own Facebook the Democratic Party owns
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.880]  it yeah they're mad that Bannon tried to scratch the surface heart disease is on

[20:22.680 --> 20:26.720]  on the Alex Jones show
[20:26.720 --> 20:53.880]  so think about how stupid the London Guardian is to put out a big story
[20:53.880 --> 20:58.240]  claiming that a guy with pink hair invented data mining and that's what
[20:58.240 --> 21:04.440]  the USA is and that he invented going into Facebook and pulling names
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.880]  something that's been happening since the day Facebook began and I'm gonna get
[21:09.880 --> 21:13.680]  into a news article about that documenting it in a moment Obama's
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.120]  former campaign director makes bombshell claim Facebook was on our side
[21:18.120 --> 21:26.440]  goes on to say that we own them on our side own them that's the truth anybody
[21:26.440 --> 21:30.160]  been on Facebook knows that they block your pro America stuff they force feed
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.600]  you Hillary stuff I mean that's a fact Facebook YouTube all of them put
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.200]  globalist propaganda in front of our videos and articles they force feed they
[21:39.200 --> 21:42.960]  they shadow band they don't and then they're claiming that Facebook is a
[21:42.960 --> 21:50.400]  weapon of Trump because one company in the UK got hired Cambridge Analytica by
[21:50.400 --> 21:57.000]  Breitbart to try to get more readers that's what you do now they're
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.880]  conflating it with other stuff the company does that's basically mi6 front
[22:00.880 --> 22:07.320]  route put the leftist in putting globalist in again most campaign spending
[22:07.320 --> 22:13.320]  worldwide is for leftist why cuz George Soros and USA aid and the big
[22:13.320 --> 22:17.960]  foundations they fund leftist garbage because it makes people dependent then
[22:17.960 --> 22:22.320]  the globalist set offshore they're all tax exempt Jeff Bezos all of them and
[22:22.320 --> 22:27.880]  they laugh at you when you're paying high taxes as a blue-collar worker sorry
[22:27.880 --> 22:31.960]  I'm digressing into how they operate so here it is Obama's former campaign
[22:31.960 --> 22:35.640]  director makes bombshell claim Facebook was quote on our side a series of
[22:35.640 --> 22:39.280]  Sunday night tweets Davidson explained how Obama campaign was able to use
[22:39.280 --> 22:43.880]  Facebook to append our email list remember what I say Sunday when I was
[22:43.880 --> 22:47.880]  covering all this I said the basic thing the campaigns do is they just get a
[22:47.880 --> 22:54.560]  profile in a group for tailored email tailored mailers to your houses as well
[22:54.560 --> 22:58.440]  and then they hit you with it that's what they're doing they're getting a
[22:58.440 --> 23:03.840]  list getting a list for political or marketing purposes was not invented by
[23:03.840 --> 23:09.240]  mr. mr. pink pink air okay but they pick it is this thing oh he's always kid
[23:09.240 --> 23:16.160]  oh oh oh he did it oh look it's a novelty look look Hawkins is in a
[23:16.160 --> 23:19.840]  wheelchair let's hear what he has to say it's the same thing so since I
[23:19.840 --> 23:24.760]  mentioned that we reach billions quarterly according to Facebook's own
[23:24.760 --> 23:29.120]  analytics we show you internal info wars analytics I'm not gonna say that and
[23:29.120 --> 23:35.960]  not show you here's 2016 and our reach was six billion four hundred and forty
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.400]  six billion and then it goes on from there seven hundred twenty one thousand
[23:40.400 --> 23:47.720]  and then 2017 I told you we grew everywhere oh look nine billion four
[23:47.720 --> 23:52.480]  hundred and seventy six thousand nine hundred and forty four thousand so nine
[23:52.480 --> 23:57.840]  billion plus nine and a half billion over six and a half billion nine and a
[23:57.840 --> 24:03.320]  half billion from six and a half billion see that want to see some other stuff
[24:03.320 --> 24:09.120]  you can really get lost in all this oh by the way this is just one this is one
[24:09.120 --> 24:15.040]  of our Facebook's renters is so so there you go that oh my gosh they got two
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.880]  hundred and something thousand people's names with that they leverage it to five
[24:17.880 --> 24:23.120]  million and then they reached fifty million the devastation of bad and go
[24:23.120 --> 24:30.240]  bad and so powerful in fact we even have a club of people panicking we play that
[24:30.240 --> 24:35.720]  clip I saw him play it on the war room last night where a guy pulls a pocket
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.160]  knife out in a city council meeting like it's no big deal hey look at my pocket
[24:39.160 --> 24:46.680]  knife everyone just just just runs in there it would take the cops three to
[24:46.680 --> 24:53.280]  five minutes to come here probably ten if the traffic's bad
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.720]  oh it's a four inch knife I'm sheathed unopened
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.520]  this is my security call the 9-1-1 they're saying it
[25:07.520 --> 25:17.440]  here in fact stop it I don't them to hear my junk noises actually listen to the
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.440]  sheath he's a nice guy spy language is nice he's saying you take the cops the
[25:22.440 --> 25:25.520]  time to get here what if I did this he pulls out a pocket knife just illustrated
[25:25.520 --> 25:30.200]  totally legal cars or giant weapons you can use chairs they're in a library they
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.480]  got paper cutters right there you kill somebody with but see to them it's the
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.320]  sign of a man with a weapon and so there's something it's like one time
[25:40.320 --> 25:44.720]  the lady was choking to death I was in the bathroom I come out my ex-wife my
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.600]  sons there just takes me back like 15 years ago it's like a year old and this
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.440]  woman's turning blue and they're in there and nobody and they're all saying
[25:52.440 --> 25:58.040]  9-1-1 9-1-1 like a group of parrots so I run over get the big piece of food out
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.800]  of her she lived but they thought it was like miraculous that is a hamlet
[26:01.800 --> 26:04.920]  maneuver and I was like yeah I was on the swim team yeah I was trained by the
[26:04.920 --> 26:10.680]  fire department you should know this too so it's the same deal here it is five
[26:10.680 --> 26:16.960]  minutes to come here probably 10 if the traffic's bad
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.440]  what are you gonna do when somebody's got a weapon there's nobody to protect you
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.520]  he's illustrating why they need weapons why they need designated people in the
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.480]  school and then the kid runs off to get the police and you've got the air raid
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.000]  sirens now coming in
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.880]  the Martians are invading run for the hills we're in danger tell them you've

[33:08.320 --> 33:29.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones we are living in an
[33:29.920 --> 33:34.240]  extremely historic time I think everybody knows that again I am your
[33:34.240 --> 33:37.240]  host Alex Jones with my intrepid team of researchers you can see if you're
[33:37.240 --> 33:40.840]  watching on television backing me up in there and the rest of the crew and you
[33:40.840 --> 33:44.440]  out there across this country and across the world let me just recap some of the
[33:44.440 --> 33:47.240]  top stories that tell you the guests that are coming up because it's it's jam
[33:47.240 --> 33:54.320]  packed today we've got a another bomb that's gone off but this time didn't
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.600]  kill anybody thank God in San Antonio at a FedEx processing center in San
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.440]  Antonio with delivery to an unnamed address in Austin night before that you
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.520]  had a bomb go off of the trip wire in a neighborhood on the edge of a green belt
[34:07.520 --> 34:12.800]  injuring two men about a mile and a half from where I live and then you had
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.720]  three other bombings that killed two other people before that and I've now
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.600]  talked to local state and federal law enforcement including one individual that
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.440]  was directly hands-on and they're saying they don't know why it hasn't been
[34:26.440 --> 34:30.680]  released yet so I'm a lot of it was technical it was over the phone this
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.760]  morning and I should have written it all down but it's mousetraps under the
[34:36.760 --> 34:42.560]  package and then when you move that it's got a wire mousetrap throws and I
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.400]  guess it sends a charge through a capacitor and then that goes in and
[34:46.400 --> 34:51.840]  detonates the bomb so it's more sophisticated than what some of the
[34:51.840 --> 34:54.480]  other people were saying according to this source because yes it's a pressure
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.040]  bomb yes it's dangerous when you place it but because you don't hook the wire to
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.520]  the wire that goes to the detonator until you've already set the mousetrap it's
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.560]  not as dangerous as some has thought and it's more sophisticated so you're kind
[35:08.560 --> 35:12.880]  of getting the perspectives from you know FBI but FBI that's not the bomb
[35:12.880 --> 35:17.600]  folks just there at the scene or from police that are there but not bomb squad
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.720]  or bomb squad so we're getting perspectives here and you're getting
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.480]  exclusives here no one else has this and we first told you was a pressure
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.000]  release bomb that came out on Fox News two days later I mean this is this is
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.800]  directly from every level of the investigation federal state and local
[35:33.800 --> 35:39.160]  on the ground and it's getting more serious obviously two dead four or five
[35:39.160 --> 35:45.520]  what injured you've got just the hysteria it creates because everybody's
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.480]  getting packages pretty much everybody I'd say 98% people get packages get mail
[35:50.480 --> 35:57.120]  and you don't know when it's gonna blow up or when you pick the package up it
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.200]  triggers and blows your arms off blows your face off so it's a real tragedy and
[36:04.200 --> 36:11.520]  it's just totally senseless and a lot of people because of past activity
[36:11.680 --> 36:22.040]  believe that this may be a unabomber type situation and that articles up on
[36:22.040 --> 36:28.720]  info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson article it's linked on drudge report.com as
[36:28.720 --> 36:38.400]  well so we're gonna be looking at all of that getting back into Facebook again
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.960]  they've lost almost 40 billion over privacy scandal Reuters is reporting
[36:43.960 --> 36:50.440]  because it's what the company does and so if they try to make Trump and Bannon
[36:50.440 --> 36:55.480]  look bad for some little company trying to bottom feed off Facebook then that
[36:55.480 --> 37:02.520]  opens up Pandora's box and Facebook is the leftist engine and you got the
[37:02.520 --> 37:06.040]  former head of the Clinton campaign saying that that the Facebook's on their
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.680]  side and the Democrats own it and all this well of course they do so it blew
[37:11.680 --> 37:16.880]  up spectacularly no pun intended
[37:16.880 --> 37:21.440]  because the media had just covered up Facebook surveilling everybody and
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.520]  selling data and trying to keep you depressed and manipulating you and
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.720]  trying to keep you in a little control room of virtual reality with with bots
[37:29.720 --> 37:33.320]  you think are real people manipulating you so it's when you read the Cambridge
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.240]  Analytica article it's like Bannon used this to bully users into supporting
[37:38.240 --> 37:41.680]  Trump and actually they were using it for a database they weren't as
[37:41.680 --> 37:44.720]  sophisticated as Facebook that actually does use it to bully people and you've
[37:44.720 --> 37:48.840]  had Sean Parker go public and others for two years that's what's going on so
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.440]  they basically in this article wrote what Facebook does but then blamed it on
[37:53.440 --> 38:00.520]  Cambridge Analytica and but that's now the breadcrumbs right in to Facebook so
[38:00.520 --> 38:04.840]  yeah they kind of self-emulated Bannon and Cambridge Analytica they they did it
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.440]  themselves they poured gasoline all over them and then the idiots the left went
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.240]  back to Facebook headquarters with the can of gas around their back but it was
[38:13.240 --> 38:17.320]  still had a few gallons in it and it was just leaked with a trail right back in
[38:17.320 --> 38:24.160]  to Facebook headquarters so they just torched Cambridge Analytica and the
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.720]  fire line went right back in to Facebook and I'm sitting back at a distance
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.280]  here watching Facebook have a huge mushroom cloud explosion and a whole
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.400]  side of it blow out and about a third of the company just caved in and I'm like
[38:39.400 --> 38:43.760]  hey let's get some hot dogs here you know the Facebook doesn't change their
[38:43.760 --> 38:48.120]  ways we send everybody to Facebook we put our material on Facebook you put
[38:48.120 --> 38:51.720]  your material on Facebook and then they start ratcheting it down and
[38:51.720 --> 38:54.760]  squeezing it and not letting you talk to your real friends and not letting you
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.240]  have real access to information and then make you pay more and more and more just
[38:58.240 --> 39:01.920]  to talk to your friends that's what Facebook is now and you know what it's a
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.980]  private company if you opt into that that's your issue but when they start
[39:05.980 --> 39:10.120]  restricting us for our political speech and discriminating if you don't want to
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.240]  beg a cake for anybody and you want to close your doors you can do that but if
[39:14.240 --> 39:16.960]  you say you're not going to beg a cake for Christians or conservatives or
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.280]  gays or anybody when you're a big institution under federal law and I
[39:21.280 --> 39:25.840]  agree with it you're discriminating and that's wrong I don't want to walk into
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.800]  some gas station and I got a cross on my shirt and somebody says you get out of
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.480]  here because you're a Christian as long as it's not obscene and a gay couple
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.440]  wants to stick two dudes on top the cake here get your cake now is that $500,000
[39:40.440 --> 39:45.120]  I don't think so but you lie about me in the media and you lie about what I say
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.280]  and then you won't let me respond on YouTube Facebook Twitter Twitter is
[39:48.280 --> 39:51.680]  worse by the way than Facebook and censorship then what is that because
[39:51.680 --> 39:54.440]  you're not just not letting me have access to the marketplace you're
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.640]  discriminating against me while you let other people bully me and then you turn
[39:58.640 --> 40:05.280]  around and say you're a bully David Hogg went on TV and say he's being bullied
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.520]  by the NRA and others that they're scared to debate him and that they can dish it
[40:10.520 --> 40:15.320]  out but they can't take it I guess the other young person said that they're
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.560]  both on the show clips on info wars.com and well why not just play the clip
[40:20.560 --> 40:26.880]  we'll get it queued up but again that's illustrative that's illustrative of how
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.320]  he challenged me to a debate and then he chickened out and the media turned it
[40:31.320 --> 40:36.240]  around and said I was contacting him bullying him and he refused to come on
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.560]  and then the guy that started a fight with my son in the airport he said
[40:40.560 --> 40:43.640]  the same thing stop bullying Hogg and trying to get him on your show and I
[40:43.640 --> 40:50.360]  said man Hogg has to come on my show he's like oh no he didn't these people
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.600]  are in fruitcake land man because everything with them there's no morals
[40:54.600 --> 41:01.640]  it's like okay okay I want to debate you okay I respectfully would like you on
[41:01.640 --> 41:05.200]  no I'm not gonna debate you you're a horrible person and you're a piece of
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.040]  this and that okay someone in the airport how dare you tell him to come on
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.160]  your show you bully actually he has to come on ah whatever see they don't care
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.720]  about reality speaking of that here's David Hogg and what's the girl's name
[41:17.720 --> 41:25.640]  with a shit abracadzalas Emma Gonzalez okay here it is the people at the top of
[41:25.640 --> 41:28.440]  the NRA are no longer working for the people that are in the organization
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.240]  they're working on behalf of the gun lobby the gun lobby and when you talk
[41:33.240 --> 41:38.040]  about the NRA and you make a suggestion like that what do they say to you what
[41:38.040 --> 41:40.760]  does the NRA say to you have they been reaching out to you I know that you know
[41:40.760 --> 41:43.760]  we had a representative show up at the town hall meet you guys participated in
[41:43.760 --> 41:46.520]  but has your organization been reaching out to you guys the way that they've
[41:46.520 --> 41:50.320]  been reaching out to us is basically threatening us they've been instigating
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.280]  things and then we reply they like shy back away like they can just sit out but
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.320]  they can't take it right now that's really let's talk about the fact you can
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.120]  go to both their Twitter feeds both these guys attack this group attack that
[42:03.120 --> 42:07.560]  organization call people pieces of s word call them mass murderers call them
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.320]  killers burn her that's the stuff that goes on with the four kids they've
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.760]  chosen and she's particularly you know called people killers and stuff to their
[42:17.760 --> 42:21.280]  faces and then when they're calling me a piece of you know what when they're
[42:21.280 --> 42:24.000]  calling me a snake all cells when they're calling me a liar I'm like I
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.040]  respectfully like you to come on and clear the air and I'd like to work
[42:27.040 --> 42:29.760]  things out and I do believe people were shot there and I'm glad you survived
[42:29.760 --> 42:36.840]  shut up you piece of SH whatever that then turns into that then turns into Alex
[42:36.840 --> 42:44.280]  Jones of the NRA they bullied me they bullied our little boo boo's by the way
[42:44.280 --> 42:47.680]  it's not the lobby it's called the Second Amendment to right and because it
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.480]  happens to also be associated with property then we can have a lobby which
[42:51.480 --> 42:56.880]  is key rights and property together equal freedom

[47:20.840 --> 47:40.400]  ladies and gentlemen this just broke one minute ago put out by the state
[47:40.400 --> 47:45.680]  sponsored RT Trump to meet Putin to discuss arms race that is getting out
[47:45.680 --> 47:51.640]  of control the president just told the Russian government President Trump that
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.880]  he is going to be meeting with Putin US President Donald Trump said he will meet
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.800]  his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the not too distant future to discuss
[48:01.800 --> 48:09.080]  an arms race that Trump called out of control he also congratulated Putin on
[48:09.080 --> 48:17.080]  his election victory details to follow but this just broke Trump Putin want to
[48:17.080 --> 48:25.720]  talk about arms race North Korea again the full story is on info wars calm
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.920]  also he's set to meet in the next month or so with the North Korean dictator
[48:30.920 --> 48:36.320]  Kim Jong-un forced to come to the table under crippling sanctions that actually
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.720]  affected the communist dictatorship not just the people what Trump called the
[48:40.720 --> 48:49.640]  strategy of maximum pressure so major developments unfolding as Trump's
[48:49.640 --> 48:55.640]  winning streak is now quite frankly starting to scare me because something
[48:55.640 --> 48:59.640]  going this good it's it's just amazing I mean the economy the borders the
[48:59.640 --> 49:07.040]  security the sovereignty the jobs coming back the tax cuts crippling and phasing
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.320]  out Obamacare this is an amazing time to be alive and the globalists are trying
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.840]  to get Trump to be anti-Russian when there's not evidence of Russia involved
[49:16.840 --> 49:20.400]  in anything like communist China is it's communist China that's infiltrated our
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.920]  government that's all confirmed so this just broke minutes ago President
[49:24.920 --> 49:27.960]  Trump is Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to meet the two leaders
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.160]  should set up a possible meeting to discuss the nuclear arms race global
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.200]  terrorism and how to solve tensions in North Korea according to a report the
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.240]  two leaders spoke out in favor of developing practical operation in
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.160]  various areas again they just spoke today including in ensuring strategic
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.480]  stability and combating international terrorism and again the Russian
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.280]  government put out their report it's the New York Post that's buddies with
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.040]  Trump just put this out simultaneously in particular they stress the importance
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.000]  of concerted efforts to curb the arms race toss the Russian State News Agency
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.400]  reported citing a statement from the Kremlin the sides agreed to develop
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.600]  further bilateral contacts including in the context of reshuffles in the US
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.040]  State Department special attention was focused on the issue a possible top
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.560]  level meeting the report said the White House said Trump called Putin after the
[50:15.560 --> 50:21.080]  Russian leader widely expected election win on Sunday giving him another six
[50:21.080 --> 50:26.200]  years he won by 70 plus percent 76% in a victory speech 65-year-old Putin said
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.120]  nobody plans to accelerate an arms race we'll do everything to resolve all the
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.840]  differences with our partners using political and diplomatic channels he
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.840]  went on to say so there you go those reports are all being posted to info
[50:42.840 --> 50:47.960]  wars.com and news wars.com as we speak will continue to watch the ongoing
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.320]  terrible bombings happening in central Texas the fifth such bombing this
[50:51.320 --> 50:56.840]  morning south of Austin and San Antonio in a package being delivered to Austin
[50:56.840 --> 51:02.560]  we also have details exclusively from the bomb squad and others but it is
[51:02.560 --> 51:06.800]  mousetrap pressure switches when the mousetrap gets triggered under the box
[51:06.800 --> 51:11.480]  that then sends an electrical charge detonating the bomb so we're going to
[51:11.480 --> 51:15.640]  give you more exclusives on that Facebook's down by 40 billion as it was
[51:15.640 --> 51:18.840]  learned that they have been involved in massive spying and political operations
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.720]  for the Democrats the Democrats triggered this all coming out by going
[51:22.720 --> 51:28.600]  after Republicans trying to bottom feed and skim off the Democrat operation but
[51:28.600 --> 51:32.360]  that is now spectacularly blown up in their little faces because they don't
[51:32.360 --> 51:35.360]  think two or three or four steps ahead and the former head of the Clinton
[51:35.360 --> 51:40.480]  campaign has gone public saying quote you know they work with Facebook they own
[51:40.480 --> 51:45.680]  Facebook they control Facebook and quote Facebook is on our side that's a
[51:45.680 --> 51:52.240]  zero-hedge article also up on info wars.com now stopping right there
[51:52.240 --> 51:57.680]  ladies and gentlemen we are getting more affiliates and we are getting a lot of
[51:57.680 --> 52:01.240]  new TV stations picking us up but there have been massive cost involved with
[52:01.240 --> 52:04.560]  putting us on more satellites putting in the crew to reach out to the stations
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.680]  and to service the stations and the things that go with that so we are not
[52:09.680 --> 52:13.680]  behind the eight ball financially but with the 12 suits that lawyers for
[52:13.680 --> 52:16.800]  Hillary Clinton and others and Georgetown University and the State
[52:16.800 --> 52:21.520]  Department officials have a filed against us all the suits can be beaten in
[52:21.520 --> 52:26.320]  court in fact they can be beaten very easily but it still takes preparing and
[52:26.320 --> 52:29.040]  going in for the summary judgments then we have to hit them with slap
[52:29.040 --> 52:32.720]  statutes to get the attorney's fees back and then countersue so they stop
[52:32.720 --> 52:36.880]  doing it or they'll just keep doing it until we're destroyed so it is your
[52:36.880 --> 52:40.680]  prayers is your support there's absolutely critical and the reason we're
[52:40.680 --> 52:43.600]  here but I want to thank all the new affiliates picking us up I want to thank

[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:37.920]  youtuber convicted for an offensive joke video faces prison can't make that up so
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.160]  without further ado here's Paul Watson breaking it down from a year ago
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.920]  year old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.080]  video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans my girlfriend is always
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.600]  ranting Raven about how cute and adorable her wee dog is and so I thought I
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.840]  would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of which is a
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:14.760]  Nazi do I guess the juice that's the juice juice
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:34.120]  the video went viral receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1200 thumbs down the
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.760]  vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious but thanks to a small
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.200]  minority of perpetually offended retards
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.440]  Meacham got a home visit from the Scottish police authority said that
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.960]  Meacham's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.960]  will not be tolerated Meacham then prostrated himself pleading that he
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.080]  wasn't a racist and that he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend isn't
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.080]  it interesting that John Cleese recently came out and decried political
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.320]  correctness because under that definition Cleese himself would have been
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:24.120]  arrested for this faulty tower sketch he would have also been hit with hate
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:40.480]  crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch Charlie Chaplin would have
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.520]  been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason if they're now treating any
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.480]  video content whatsoever that causes offense as hate speech then my entire
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.520]  channel is hate speech it's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.040]  the country simply to continue to make YouTube videos they're already arresting
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.800]  people who criticize Muslim immigration on Twitter now satire frigging satire
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.920]  that's not even malicious will not be tolerated and this is by no means a
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.880]  one-off case just a few days ago a Muslim police chief in Manchester said
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.440]  freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture religion or
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.240]  tradition just last month Greater Glasgow police threatened to conduct home
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.920]  visits to harass people who made unkind or inaccurate tweets last year police
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.840]  Scotland announced their intention to investigate offensive comments made on
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.960]  Twitter and other social media platforms cause this is all selectively
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.080]  enforced but the chilling effect is very real this is how political correctness
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.360]  is strangling freedom people are going to be terrified of expressing any
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.560]  political belief even if it's satirical even if it's not even meant to be

[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.400]  in polls but they thought he might get 80% so this isn't some russophile thing
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.920]  I'm involved in where if you're not anti-russia you know you you're a
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.520]  communist agent or something it's the globalists in my view that are acting
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.760]  like the old Soviet Union it's the EU that's unelected and Yulker is
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:44.760]  unelected but then he calls Putin the dictator so Alexander joins us Alexander
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:48.160]  necked us off and I appreciate him coming on he's a former Kremlin and
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.680]  government adviser Russian journalist and broadcaster he's a regular grandson of
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.400]  the famous giant of Russian poetry and a self and nephew Leo Tolstoy he is a
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.440]  frequent commentator on various international TV channels and radio as
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.800]  well as British American and Russian media he's an expert on international
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.840]  relations Alexander first worked at Toss in the Soviet press agency first as a
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.160]  reporter and then it just goes through all the things he's done and we'll put
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:19.000]  up his Twitter on screen for you you can also follow him at Twitter at stirring
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.760]  trouble with two ours so now he joins us now Alexander good to have you on with
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.080]  us good you can go wherever you want first I mean obviously just got an
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.760]  ounce 10 minutes ago that Trump and Putin will finally meet to talk about
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.480]  stopping the arms race and stopping terrorism and we can also get into
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.120]  obviously the big election win in Russia and I guess the kind of the battle
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.400]  going on in Washington in Europe of trying to start a new Cold War where
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.200]  would you like to start first well a few words about the Putin's election
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:09:00.200]  because it just happened and first of all I'd like to say that you know elections
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:06.360]  in every country have problems right for example I live in Britain and in
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.600]  Britain you don't need to show your idea when you're voting now when I say this to
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.280]  people from other countries they don't believe me and you know when anyone can
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:24.800]  take the piece of paper you've been sent to come into the voting center and
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:31.160]  just simply say hi I am this guy or this woman and vote and just leave you
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.560]  must understand there's something wrong with it right now we can go through many
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.360]  elections across the world including the West by the way for example last year in
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.400]  France Macron who nobody knew and I have friends in France my father was born in
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.600]  France my late father and I can tell you nobody knew who he was where his party
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.520]  came from that party consisted of some very strange people and suddenly they
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:05.680]  got two-thirds of parliament and he won very convincingly now you know call me
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:11.520]  naive I don't understand how that works the EU was sort of standing aside and
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.280]  saying well we don't know we don't know it's democracy you see so what I'm saying
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.080]  here of course there are problems with every election in every country and of
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.640]  course there are officials on the ground would like to you know to do
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.160]  something but their finger to put their finger on the scale yeah you know to
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:37.240]  please the bosses upstairs and of course there will be something happening but in
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.800]  Putin's in case of Putin one thing that must be understood Russia is in a very
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.000]  difficult situation now for the first time in many many decades a foreign
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.440]  troops night to troops are on its border on its border this is no you know
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:00.400]  somewhere in Germany on Britain or France they are now on his border all
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:06.520]  along the eastern border there are troops even in Ukraine which has always been
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.840]  seen by the Russians it's basically a brotherly nation and what happened in
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:17.040]  Ukraine I must tell you probably spoiled relations with the West well for the
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.800]  next hundred year I mean I mean sort of Braggs he went in there on said on
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.240]  Farid Zarkaria they spent five million dollars State Department money a
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.440]  billion of his to overthrow the government then to try to take over the
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.480]  oil fields and gas fields and to start a civil war they put admitted Nazis at
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.120]  how Hitler in control the government at first could totally insane but that's a
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.280]  separate issue look I'm just my the research and stuff so I know how the
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.240]  Saudi Arabian government works it's a dictatorship of the Royal House I know
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.760]  how the Chinese Chinese work and it's a Communist dictatorship of the
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.240]  Communist Party just like North Korea Russia has general elections it's a
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.120]  parliamentary system and then and if you dig into State Department reports they
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.360]  admit they thought Putin would win with 80% so he went what he won with 76
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.080]  percent correct so the point is that's not a dictator when you're elected with
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:09.440]  76% well I agree with that but the most important thing of all is that you can
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.000]  have a democratic election like you have in some countries but you must judge
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.640]  the election by the impact that has on the country you know it's all very nice
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.720]  to say well people decided they have this little that leader watch what
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.520]  happens after that is the leader the government the regime is acting in the
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.800]  interests of the people or is it acting in the interest of a tiny clique of
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.040]  people and ignores the rest now that's the real issue and is and so why do
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.680]  Russians like Putin and why do they keep reelecting him in record numbers
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.640]  because my grandpa was said I don't want to hear talk I want to see action
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.600]  judge a tree by its fruit as the Bible says so why do Russians love Putin so
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.760]  much well I think it's not love it's pragmatism I think they understand that
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.440]  Putin probably is the best candidate of them all to provide security for the
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:09.760]  country security is the number one issue on the agenda now secondly the none of
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.040]  the candidates were really strong in offering any new measures I mean the
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.680]  economy nobody offered sure sure so what is the less why does the Western left
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:25.440]  in Hollywood hate Putin so much I mean for me I know why I know them you know
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.760]  the Bolsheviks and things kind of got run out of New York and London that was
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.720]  that's where Bernie Sanders went had his honeymoon and I know you were previously
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.840]  in that whole system but I think it's pretty horrible I think what Putin's
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.480]  doing in many ways is good the Christianity the free market I like
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.480]  the reform so that's why I see Hollywood in the left seeing their little
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.640]  wonderland of stomping Christians guts out being taken away from him well I
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.720]  mean the Hollywood hates Putin hates Russia and hates anybody who is not a
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.640]  liberal let's be honest about it Hollywood and is in a stance as a
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.560]  cesspit of the neoliberalism you know militants you know it's neoliberal cancer
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:08.120]  exactly yes it's a militant now it's it's gone over the top so I wouldn't I
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.640]  wouldn't really judge you know what Hollywood is saying but you know it's
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:19.120]  Hollywood driving the foaming at the mouth Russia hate well unfortunately you
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.360]  know a lot of people in the West are very influenced by film by film movies by
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:29.520]  by television people in the West generally are brought up to believe in
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.880]  things that we you know the Russians yeah we get our image of Russians from
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.760]  Hollywood there's a new movie like Red Sparrow every month where Russians are
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.880]  running around murdering everybody in the US but instead it's the globalist
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.840]  it's Hollywood it's the EU it's the devil pope they're the ones that are
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.600]  trying to destroy me right now there's not any Russians involved anywhere with
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.160]  me except for Daria who worked for army special operations as a patriot that's
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.680]  how sick this is is I judge a tree by my fruits and I have globalists trying to
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.360]  destroy my country the same globalists that want to destroy you well the
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.200]  problem is here is cross because there is a reason why Russia is considered an
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.440]  enemy first of all there is a lot of distraction going on from the problems
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.240]  at home now the economy for example in Britain where the spying scandal is all
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:26.880]  over the pages of the press the economy is in terrible shape the corruption in
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.720]  politics has become such that I would compare to Zimbabwe things are happening
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.200]  that I would I don't believe happened in Russia in the worst times of the 1990s
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.800]  under Yeltsin this is he stay right there I let's explain this when we come
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.560]  back and the fact that even today Russia is in a battle just like America with
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.360]  the very same foaming at the mouth liberals that want our kids our culture

[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:20.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:33.920]  live from austin texas broadcast is a journalist he's in london but when I
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.280]  say the view from russia I mean by russians view on what's going on and
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.400]  again I've never been to russia but I've been a history buff and I do intend to
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.600]  probably go there in the later summer now because I've got to get my killies
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.880]  fixed soon it's 100% blown now and I've been walking on it for four years it's
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.880]  only 80% blown but I'm gonna go to Russia because I want to go see who my
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.920]  bosses supposedly are it's ridiculous and again he's an expert
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.520]  international relations he's joining us he's covered many of the big events like
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.680]  what he was getting into the early 1990s yeltsin attacking the duma and the
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.960]  parliament with tanks when they wouldn't leave and go with the election and then
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.760]  the rise of Putin and just all the things we've seen in our age and then
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.160]  NATO double-crossing and then going up on the Russian borders that's really
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.280]  what happened and again that's from my perspective just looking at what goes on
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:34.520]  our media is so fake that when Georgia attacks out the city and abkhazia on 888
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.280]  our media said Russia has attacked Georgia and I believe CNN when I got up
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.040]  at 6 a.m. until about two hours in I was reading in foreign news and it was like
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.240]  no the Georgians attacked these areas that were UN held killed a bunch of
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.200]  people the Russians just pushed them out and then left so that's that's when I
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:22:00.160]  became the Russofile according to the media when I went CNN lied Russia didn't
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.200]  start that and that's when I realized my god they're really trying to start a
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.280]  new Cold War well if they were communist over there that'd be another
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.080]  thing we need a Cold War with Hollywood with the Democratic Party they're the
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.320]  enemy man get them out of here to stop them culturally they're the enemy not
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.720]  the Russians and the globalist or allied with the communist Chinese who just
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.760]  made him dictator for life with his vice president but the Austin American
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.480]  statesman said elected president elected vice president by the permanent
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.560]  Communist Party Putin was not so I just don't like the lies and if you could get
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.320]  into that I think you've got some of your own issues you want to get into what
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.720]  this meeting with Trump and Putin may look like from your expert perspective
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.480]  Alexander well I think it's not going to be easy because there's going to be
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:50.680]  pressure on Trump and America from people who don't like Russia and don't
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.720]  want to have anything to do with Russia and I can tell you Alex last week in
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:01.040]  New York you had the biggest gathering of experts on Russia you know from the
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.040]  West and guess what they've decided in New York they've decided that Russia is
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.160]  the enemy of the West it should be destroyed and so on and so on so that's
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:16.720]  the experts experts are talking about Russia so you can imagine the pressures
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.040]  on both presidents in Russia there are people who do not trust America I can
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.480]  tell you this even in power and they will say look we can't trust these guys
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.680]  they took over Ukraine they are surrounding us they are meddling in our
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.760]  affairs they're making up stories that we are taking their elections and so on
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:43.160]  and at the same time the budget of the CIA is 20 times more than the budget of
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:47.280]  the Russian intelligence service they're lying to their people that are
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.160]  taking us they're waging a cyber war against us and so on so you can imagine
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.240]  both of them will be under great pressure to basically agree on anything I
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.360]  don't really think it's gonna be a big decision-making meeting but it has a
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:07.000]  big symbol symbolism under it and I think it's very important they need to
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.560]  talk you know these leaders need to talk this is very good that they are
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.160]  gonna meet one-on-one because I don't trust those sons you know they get
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.960]  together they don't do much there they do their own thing there and nothing is
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.280]  decided well I think I think President Trump and President Putin should throw
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.560]  the gauntlet down and statistically expose who's really involved in things
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.480]  and what the globalists are doing and point out that Russia has all these
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.760]  resources wants to be modernized wants to be well we work with us and and and
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.920]  it's set all those signals and helped us after 9-11 and helped us take out ISIS
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.360]  and Trump's very pragmatic I can tell you that I people that know Trump very
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.600]  well and he absolutely thinks this is a load of crap he doesn't want to be in
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.160]  conflict with Russia and it's a lot of the military says we should work with
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.600]  Russia geographically it's a match made in heaven but the globalists the neocons
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.020]  they want to control the chessboard they want to control radical Islam flood
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.880]  Europe with that they want to control Russia cut Russia off and the globalists
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.120]  want to destroy the power of America they want to phase our power into this
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.840]  global corporate system that threatens Russia and the United States I think
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.120]  that's why we have to not be intimidated to have these meetings I agree Trump
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.400]  should have met with Putin first since they made such a big deal about it and
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.840]  kill it right there and say it's not wrong I'm the president you elected me
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:33.360]  I'm allowed to talk and work with whoever I want unitary executive they're
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.200]  saying Mueller and CNN holds the president's fate like he's the fourth
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.280]  branch of government no no even if Trump was caught doing so for the Russians
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.320]  which we know wasn't true he's still his right and the people's right to say we
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.880]  want our president to talk to this group or that group paralyzing the
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.120]  president with his whole Russia gate canard to where we can't work with
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.400]  Russia and then bully us in a new Cold War is the height of criminal activity
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.240]  and instead of giving into the fear and virtue signaling we need to call it out
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.480]  for what it is an absolute fraud by the real enemies of the world and that's the
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.080]  globalist well the problem with the American public is that a lot of people
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.680]  in America believe the media too much and unfortunately the world of
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.800]  entertainment as well I can tell you that a lot of you Americans think that
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.000]  what they see on Saturday night live is actually real politics and they make
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.360]  their decision based on that stupid idiotic I think comedy series where
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.360]  nobody even bothers to act by the way if you notice they can't even remember
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.080]  their lines and the world of entertainment I think there's a lot of
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.760]  responsibility in America I mean for the feelings of some people towards Russia
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.760]  you just mentioned Red Sparrow but isn't just Red Sparrow I mean how many films
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.320]  have depicted Russians as spies killers what about the Russian mafia where the
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.560]  hell is the Russian mafia I have investigated the Russian mafia there is
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.720]  no Russian mafia in the West that's the point but they have those films one
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.400]  after another one after another Russian mafia the killers gangsters they're all
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.840]  of America they're threatening everyone excuse me most of the gangsters come
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.720]  from the Mexican part of the border you know where are the Russians but
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.280]  unfortunately you know from the early age they watch the books they watch this
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:32.160]  films and that's how this distrust this hatred for Russia is developing and I
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.560]  think we should all all tell our children I've been telling my children you
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.760]  know don't trust those things don't trust those films this is all rubbish they're
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:46.840]  all pretending this is not the truth but Americans don't do that and you do some
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.080]  of the most not you personally of course but but the American TV industry and
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:56.360]  Hollywood some of the most disgusting propaganda films against Russia that's
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.040]  why I said Hollywood because it's not just the neoliberals the neocons the
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.280]  engine of the hate and and and the propaganda is for it is Hollywood and
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.080]  that the same people demonizing Christians conservatives libertarians
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.600]  rural communities this is a conquering elite that that sees any form of
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.640]  independence as the enemy and now that Russia has pulled out of a place that
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.080]  Bernie Sanders would want you know vacation that's why Russia is now seen
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.480]  as the existential threat Alex the problem is with America is that your
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:34.120]  conservative movement is very weak is very you know it's weak and you
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.080]  have demagogues pretending to be republicans or conservatives or
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.080]  Christians talking the absolute rubbish and people think they're
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.200]  conservatives there's a lot of problems for example no I agree I'm gonna get

[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.320]  people they harvested to then create accounts and go out and reach out and

[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:47.280]  Trump okay let's go back to Alexander Necrossoff who's a journalist in the UK
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.560]  and he has been a former Kremlin and government insider and just in a few
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.400]  minutes we have left I want to pragmatically then he was getting back
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.200]  to what Russia was like 20 years ago or 15 16 years ago and what it's like now
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:07.840]  and where he sees Russia going and any hopes or ways for the United States and
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:12.160]  Russia to be able to expose this neoliberalism for what it is this
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:16.080]  globalism that's waging war against the nation state against families against
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.880]  Western civilization I'm not putting words in his mouth the globalists say
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.400]  there against Western civilization we can say Russia isn't really Western well
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.760]  it really is Western if you call Christian being a being Western so
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:34.640]  Alexander if you guys just send him the few things Alexander how can we hope to
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.360]  turn this around any other closing comments I appreciate you coming on
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:45.280]  today right I didn't hear the previous yeah I'm sorry I think somebody was
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:51.240]  talking to you how do we short circuit this whole globalist operation how do
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.360]  we how do we somehow get people to realize this whole Russia thing really is
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:36:00.960]  a hoax well it's going to be a tough one because unfortunately as I started
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:08.440]  saying the liberal camp the neoliberals are so united they are so tribal and
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:14.080]  unfortunately conservatives in America and the West generally are so divided as
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.280]  so much confusion there's so many demagogues who pretend to be
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.040]  conservatives but actually drag the people completely in a different
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:28.000]  direction so it will be a hell of a struggle to do this and unfortunately I
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.560]  must accept this as well Alex that Putin and his crowd sometimes do and say
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.760]  things that are not great you know as a public relations exercise I would say
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.560]  and I think there has to be more cooperation in the sense that I was a
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.640]  troubleshooter for the Kremlin and I my job was to fix things my job was to go
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.380]  behind the scenes and basically resolve the problems before the big boys were
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.920]  meeting we don't have those fixes anymore like you know the troubleshooters
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.280]  they need to be more you know involved in this they need to be more people like
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:10.920]  that going back and forth between America and Russia talking you know finding
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.360]  out solutions I don't see that happening I see those idiots from the State
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.280]  Department and those fools from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Russia
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.960]  telling all sorts of silly things you know to their leaders and that's why I
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:30.960]  think there is a problem it will take time unfortunately it will take a lot
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:37.840]  of time but I hope I hope that both Trump and Putin they are strong people you
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.120]  know whatever people say about them whatever you know the lies and so on
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.120]  I think that tough when it comes to negotiations and but they are also tough
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:54.640]  when it when you need a decision and I'm hoping that together they might crack it
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.800]  but it will be a hell of a job I mean honestly Alexander why do you think just
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:07.640]  just as individuals why do you think the globalist the leftist the anti-family
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.240]  crowd why do they hate Putin why do they hate Trump well I've met them I know
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.120]  them they hate families almost none of them have children they tell you they
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:20.680]  hate your children they're just really nasty demonic people and I hate to
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.040]  boil it down to that because I've been on there 23 years until the last five or
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.800]  so that wasn't what I harped on but now when you get down to final equations
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.320]  these are just really really bad people I mean can you give your perspective on
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.120]  why well the whole leftist global movement hates Russia hates the United
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:45.040]  States hates Putin hates Trump well I think you mentioned that point correctly
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.440]  I think first of all the values that Putin and Trump stand for you know the
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:57.480]  God Christianity this they hate because that's that's the thing they hate and
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:02.400]  don't forget that the liberal that the international globalist and neoliberals
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.640]  I call them militant neoliberals because they have gone over the top now I think
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:12.880]  they hate unlike the previous old days you know the Cold War they hate the
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.280]  Russian people not just the leadership but the Russian people big difference
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.080]  with the Cold War why because Russian people do not accept their vile agendas
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:27.640]  that they hate them for that they just want to destroy them for that because
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.840]  they can't understand how somebody you know can't accept you see the problem
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:37.920]  with the Western a lot of Western people they've been brought up to believe
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.560]  that political correctness is part of free speech and democracy political
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.800]  correctness is exactly the opposite of free speech and democracy further on in
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:55.000]  your part of the woods people say liberal democracy we have a liberal
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:01.040]  democracy well excuse me liberal democracy is a contradiction in terms
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:08.120]  liberalism has never been democratic so even the name of those you know systems
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:14.720]  in the West is wrong it is not liberal democracy it is liberal autocracy that
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:20.400]  has taken grip over Europe and is trying to control America but suddenly
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.840]  Trump came out of nowhere and they are terrified they're running they don't know
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.440]  what to do they're making mistakes they're actually clashing with each other and
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.560]  that is why there is a chance still but we have to unite conservatives of the
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.800]  world I'm you I'm using like a Marx's lingo but we have to counter their
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.560]  internationalism as Christians and conservatives of every race color and
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.280]  creed unified around free speech around religious freedom around free market
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.600]  and around the international true brotherhood of humankind and sisterhood
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.280]  to counter their their total tyranny because as you know the proto-globalist
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.000]  went help set up the Bolshevik Revolution liberal elements of the CIA
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.320]  helped put mal into power it's now all declassified it all came out McCarthy was
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.680]  right and so from my research much enough that czarism was good it was all
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.480]  crumbling I know about all that and the white Russians corruption and the czarist
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.640]  all of it but you have that being replaced with like this liberal playland
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.760]  of total social engineering control and and so now they're just mad that their
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.480]  their fantasies falling apart in Russia now their fantasies falling apart here
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:32.280]  I think I think you're right we have that shared enemy that is the deranged
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.880]  militant anti-godly look at Russia under their control couldn't be Christian
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:39.880]  attack families tried to push promiscuity tried to break the society down but
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.600]  they couldn't get Russians to accept as as much of it culturally as they've got
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.120]  us to do and they've almost got us right to the tipping point right where they
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.680]  wanted us and like you said here comes Trump but that one thing I want to point
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.120]  out Alex which is I think very important when you mentioned the free market
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.200]  unfortunately the free market has been disappearing we now have a virtual
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.800]  economy the rule of the financial markets they're going against us they're
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.240]  going against the economy global mega crony capitalist system waging war
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.560]  against the nation-state in real markets we got to have you back Alexander

[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:04.200]  globalist attack because we are over the target we are in the fight we are in
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:09.200]  the thick of it we are at the heart of the epicenter of the battle for the
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.880]  future and Roger Stone I wanted to get him on because he has predicted this all
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.560]  very very accurately that the Trump lawyers were told oh it'll be over by
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.120]  it'll be over by November it'll be over by December we know you're not
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.520]  implicated we know there's no evidence of Russian collusion they're not gonna
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:29.200]  go out into other things or other companies or other groups just the
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.360]  Russians and then now Trump has been told no it's gonna go on forever and it
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.080]  deals with you personally and it deals with it deals with European companies
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.480]  and US companies and your employees and it's never gonna end and Trump knows
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.240]  that Mueller was involved covering up for Hillary covering up for all the
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.440]  crimes Comey's been caught leaking lying to Congress McCabe's been caught and
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.000]  now he's sitting there looking at this and CNN I have the headline right here
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.640]  says that the fate of Trump is in the hands of Mueller and that Mueller has
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:08.280]  him cornered and when you know about the three branches of government and you
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.080]  know about that this is under the executive and this is a rogue group
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.360]  it's been caught being political and being caught making up intelligence and
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.480]  being caught illegally spying that the whole thing has to get shut down and
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:24.560]  Mueller has to get indicted that that's the default but instead the media pushes
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.840]  this like Mueller is God the fourth branch of government well who oversees
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.920]  him you see the president's fate is not in the hands of Mueller it's the hands
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.760]  of the American people he has to be impeached that's what the Democrats
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:40.880]  want to get control of the house we have to buy into their bull so they're
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.320]  selling the idea that if Mueller indicts him for some process thing not Russian
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.720]  related then he has to go that's the big hoax now we know rushing it's a hoax but
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.960]  Mueller is a hoax so they're now pushing that oh he's got him it's like Darth
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.000]  Vader with Luke Skywalker I have you now so where are we really Roger because
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.600]  you've laid all this out you've warned the president you said early on when the
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.400]  president was really strong he's even probably stronger now just get rid of
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.880]  Mueller he's a fraud to start indicting McCabe and all of them the word is those
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:12.800]  indictments are being looked at it's open and shut so what's the answer super
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.000]  offensive indict all these people that are open and shut go after Hillary and
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.480]  then Mueller just falls away or just let Mueller go on forever just looking for a
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:27.560]  crooked toenail somewhere Roger well Alex first of all I think the president's
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.440]  decision to add Joe DeGeneva to his legal team shows a new combativeness and
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.880]  maybe a new awareness on the part of the president Joe DeGeneva is not some
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:45.760]  weak-kneed Ivy League white shoe lawyer he's a street brawler and he
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:51.040]  understands that this isn't really a legal proceeding so much as a political
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:57.000]  proceeding now as you know the special counsel law under which Mueller would
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:03.160]  normally be operating has been expired therefore Mr. Mueller has no
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:10.280]  checks or restraints on what he can do and where he can go under the previous
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:16.320]  special counsel law he would have had to go on to a three-judge panel for any
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.400]  expansion of his inquiry into an area broader than Russian collusion so he is
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:25.280]  he is he is Lord High Protector at this point he is he is just his own branch of
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.520]  government running around well interestingly enough I think this is a
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:34.480]  very key point even though there's no statutory requirement for him to do so
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:39.840]  he has gone to Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general and had him
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:45.440]  approve every single step of his path towards removing the president the
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.280]  expansion the Manafort indictments the Flynn indictment Mr. Rosenstein approved
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.040]  all of this attempting to give Mueller the mantle of some kind of Justice
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:03.280]  Department cover in his efforts that and that alone or that added to the fact
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:10.080]  that Rosenstein also approved the use of the phony dossier to put the Trump
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:16.240]  campaign under surveillance in my opinion is grounds for the dismissal of Mr.
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:20.280]  Rosenstein absolutely isn't he just another ringleader like McCabe well I
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:25.320]  think actually I think in a odd way he's the keystone I think if you if you pull
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.760]  Rosenstein out it all collapses now he's the one that launched the hole which
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:36.560]  are exactly right and therefore I think in the event that you terminated
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:43.320]  Mueller the decision to fire him the order to fire him would go to Mr. Rosenstein
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:47.840]  would he carry out that order so that's a feedback loop so it should fall to the
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.360]  inspector general it should fall to the president actually worse it's actually
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:58.320]  worse than that they Rosenstein and and Mueller did something very clever or at
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.200]  least Rosenstein did early in the Trump administration they got the president to
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:07.920]  sign a change that changes the order of authority at the Justice Department from
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:13.600]  the Attorney General sessions to Rosenstein to the woman who retired
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.120]  recently who was the number three person in the department and then it doesn't go
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.080]  to the solicitor general it goes to the U.S. Attorney in Texas and then a U.S.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:27.440]  Attorney in North Carolina both Bush loyalists so they're trying to rig the
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.680]  house just in case Donald Trump fires Mr. Mueller I would not urge him to fire
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:39.760]  Mueller at this point I would demand that a special prosecutor be appointed or the
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.440]  Justice Department can do this originally that's your idea but now you're at
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:49.040]  all over Congress look at Mueller's involvement in uranium one and
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.680]  specifically the trip that he took to Russia in 09 carrying uranium samples
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:54:00.480]  for Hillary and Bill Clinton exactly we imagine we had Trump on a tarmac with
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.640]  with secret rendezvous with uranium or Loretta Lynch in secret meetings with
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.480]  Bill Clinton we have these crux that's why they're so desperate they're never
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.720]  going to give up and notice CNN and others always change the subject every
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:15.040]  time he goes this is corrupt this person's corrupt and Trump's right they
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:18.800]  change the subject don't fire Mueller you'll get in trouble instead we leave
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.640]  him out there flapping flapping in the wind but at a certain point Trump has a
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.840]  responsibility and Attorney General Sessions does to start firing all these
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.840]  people for the open crimes they've committed I mean I get it makes it look
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.520]  bad but it's still what you need to do I mean you know if Mueller's running
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:38.960]  around setting fires people's houses at night and he's still got our resting I
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.600]  mean it doesn't matter how it looks now I could not agree more the problem of
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:47.840]  course is the president's made his desires perfectly clear including through
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:53.440]  his Twitter feed but Jeff Sessions isn't getting the message the the video
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:59.680]  footage of Sessions dining with Rosenstein you know in downtown Washington
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.680]  so well toasting each other was open contempt of the president of the United
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:10.840]  States so so what is the best thinking on Sessions what in the world is going on
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.960]  with this guy it's very simple the president's chief advisors have convinced
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.920]  the president that he cannot get away with firing Sessions that he would face
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.800]  impeachment I don't think so the president's leverage gets stronger and
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:32.040]  stronger as the economy rebounds if he emerges from the Korean peace talks with
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:38.120]  any kind of accomplishment say the denuclearization of North Korea he
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:43.080]  will have enormous leverage to put this thing away once and for all I agree but
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.520]  I mean why would Sessions be toasting with Rosenstein than having public events
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:51.640]  where he says he's the best ever when Rosenstein is a clear little Clinton
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:59.240]  creature a congressman who's a friend of mine had an extensive meeting with Jeff
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.960]  Sessions and he came away saying the man is doddering that he is that he's around
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:11.000]  the bed that he is no longer well enough to have a clear thought he's had a mini
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.600]  stroke or something something all he does is rage about marijuana arresting
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.040]  all those people on marijuana which is one of the worst things ever for Trump
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.640]  because it just turns everybody off and I mean it absolutely I mean Sessions
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:29.200]  Sessions is his expiration date is over he needs to be put out the pastor in a
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:35.720]  poll by Trump's pollster which we broke on the war room some 69% of Trump
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:41.600]  supporters 68% of Republicans for our four state legalized medicinal
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.920]  marijuana and the number of people who believe the states should decide
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:52.080]  despite their own personal views is in the 80s this is a silent third rail that
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:57.320]  would just shear off libertarian and conservative oriented
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.440]  protocol I stay there I want to come back and briefly ask you Roger what their
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.600]  next moves are gonna be because you've been accurately breaking all that down
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.400]  we'll do five more minutes with you how how the globals are gonna try to derail
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.280]  the economy this is this rush to summit now being announced I guess I'll be in
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:18.440]  Rocky a back or something I'll Reagan and Gorbachev and any other big tidbits

[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:27.480]  breaking in the next few days Roger Stone joins us I'm now shown in the ATX a
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.600]  fifth bomb went off this morning at a FedEx Center they've given people
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.720]  exclusive details on that these are mousetrap bombs I'm explain that it's
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.360]  all coming up third and fourth hours straight ahead so much more tomorrow's
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:42.640]  news today ladies and gentlemen
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:50.560]  info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.840]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.160]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:05.880]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.760]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.440]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:18.960]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.680]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.240]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.320]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.760]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:41.360]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:46.240]  head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:53.520]  tablets it's been sold out for months and now it's back it's Myco ZX plus lower
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:58.080]  price more ingredients because we scaled up signed to your contract with even
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:03.840]  bigger organic manufacturer and producer scalability but now we're able to go at
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:09.840]  50% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off because there's a lot of product and a
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:13.480]  lot of ingredient Myco ZX now it's the other side of the equation everybody
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:17.200]  thinks about probiotics now great they are for your gut because of toxins the
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.920]  environment pesticides herbicides but more importantly than bad bacteria the
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:27.560]  probiotics help display yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.200]  the yeast and the mold and all that get in there it causes all sorts of
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.480]  seriousness well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:39.840]  known to destroy that slime wall don't wait to start any toxifying your body
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:44.640]  until it's too late pick up a bottle of the new and improved Myco ZX plus now
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:48.480]  from the info wars store
[01:59:48.480 --> 02:00:05.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:13.480]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones I
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:22.240]  wanted to ask Roger Stone this question just historically imagine we're
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.200]  looking back 20 years from now what is this period in history the rebirth of
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:31.680]  nationalism the rebirth of free market the rebirth of populism and how can you
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:36.160]  turn away it's so entertaining it's so exciting and then you realize it's real
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.400]  real globalist real socialist real authoritarians shutting down free speech
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:45.280]  top globalist suing us step we've been about announced it happened to Roger I
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:51.360]  mean it's it's like we're the Americans fighting the globalist and we're
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:55.360]  targeted Trump stone myself a few others you the audience backing us and
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.520]  they're so pissed you're there back in us and they're doing everything they can
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.360]  to turn down our reach everything else but it's not working because of you so
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.840]  thank God you're out there folks you realize the fight we're in Roger how
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:08.400]  would you describe the time we're in right now and I'm gonna be joining us
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:11.080]  tomorrow with a bunch of big breaking exclusive news but I just hope people
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:15.680]  realize this is history happening this isn't Netflix this isn't HBO this isn't
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:21.480]  fiction this is real you know Alex I was speaking to Dr. Jerry Corsi about this
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:27.200]  this morning and he really summed it up in a very brief phrase America was saved
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:32.600]  in the 2016 election out of nowhere most improbably an outsider comes who's not
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.600]  beholden to the globalists and the two-party neocons that have destroyed
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:43.760]  the country and now we are in the midst of a coup d'etat they intend to illegally
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.640]  unconstitutionally undo the results of the last election and they will resort
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:54.760]  to every trick in the book whether it is a law fair to silence the supporters of
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.240]  Donald Trump and reform or whether it is phone and these phony lawsuits that
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.200]  are designed to bankrupt us whether it is the manipulation of social media to
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:09.360]  limit our ability to reach other patriots and tell them what's going on or
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:16.000]  whether it is a corrupted legal process in which a special prosecutor who has
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.360]  no constraints on him not constrained by the Congress by the Justice Department
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.560]  I mean Andrew McCarthy wrote an excellent piece on this in the National Review
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:30.920]  this week where I think there are fundamental questions not to putting
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.760]  aside the conflict this is rogue government constitutional crisis stuff
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:40.200]  there's no question that there there's a planned coup d'etat and it's in the
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:45.440]  works but a key element to the success of the coup d'etat is to silence Alex
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:51.560]  Jones to silence Roger Stone to silence because they're gonna shut everybody
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.400]  else down when they're done they've announced it that's why we've got to
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.560]  raise the alarm and then we're so close the problem we don't tend to get how
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.200]  sensational this is for everybody's future they mean business they know the
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:05.600]  genes out of the bottle the only thing they've got is total authoritarianism
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:10.960]  and good luck I don't think the dog's gonna hunt Roger well the irony of this
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.800]  is those pundits who say Mueller's got you know Trump cornered now they
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.560]  misunderstand how much power the president has in fact in all truth Alex
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.000]  sometimes I wonder whether the president understands fully how much power he has
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.560]  to change the course right and this is critical he's letting the mainstream
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:33.000]  media do one thing that's that they're having some success create a false
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.040]  narrative about the separation of powers unitary executive co-equal all the
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.320]  Supreme Court rulings like when he says you can't bring in people with fake
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.080]  passports from terror nations they go he can't do that when the federal laws a
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.480]  hundred percent the Constitution Supreme Court 9 to 0 kill those courts the
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:52.160]  media says he's overriding the courts no the court the real court certified it
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.800]  was the same thing they keep acting like if he just chooses what's on the menu
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:00.560]  at the White House he's a dictator and that somehow it's bad if he controls the
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:05.000]  executive in Cleans House if anything he's in a dereliction of duty letting
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.640]  this Clinton cabal run while the Justice Department he needs to move on their
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:13.760]  ass and I mean like they're calling for extra judicial that's illegal once they
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:17.440]  call the president can do that with covert action and that's the best thing
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:22.920]  for the country well you know it's it's amazing to see the mainstream media
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:29.040]  try to put the best possible face on their efforts to to in reinflate the
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:35.600]  Russian collusion fraud they're really at this point I think just a swatting it
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:41.040]  flies but never underestimate the deep enmity of the political insiders in
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:47.760]  Washington for this president or their resolve to remove him one way or another

[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:35.280]  to be used against the president this weekend another congressman went on and
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.880]  said let's just take him out Phil mud said we're gonna kill him Schumer said
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:44.440]  we got seven ways of Sunday to make you pay in the intelligence agencies the
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:48.360]  New York Times advertises here's where they played baseball in the conservative
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:54.160]  libertarian caucus in the Freedom Caucus boy somebody could attack there they're
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:58.320]  all over the news saying kill everybody kill me kill Roger Stone kill kill kill
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:03.880]  they've whipped the country up into this that's illegal and the president's
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:06.320]  sitting there trying to turn the economy back on proving we were
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:11.680]  artificially restrained which I told you the fact for globalism it's they write
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:14.920]  white papers how they got their foot on our neck and then they're everywhere
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.440]  saying kill the president everywhere say they're gonna overthrow the election
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.800]  they're stealing elections in Pennsylvania and they're stealing elections in
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.320]  it doesn't matter whether they had a better candidate doesn't matter they had
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:27.120]  a better candidate you know of the Roy Moore or whatever they stole those there
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:31.600]  was total evidence in both and the republic is just roll over to it and
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:34.480]  they're running around saying they're gonna end the first amendment once they
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:39.320]  take over and they've got obama's law firms suing him two of Hillary's law
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:45.040]  firms suing me and these these people mean business well here's the thing when
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:51.000]  people start saying we're gonna go kill the president or let's use the second
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.400]  amendment on him we'll get that clip up in that article up in a minute we're gonna
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:08:01.080]  play it when that type of stuff's going on if somebody comes up to you and says
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:06.120]  I've got a gun pointed at you and it's really just their finger in their pants
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:09.800]  you got a right to blow them away but if somebody's a congressman or a former
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.800]  head of CIA assassination operations like mud he did never kill anybody
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.920]  himself but he was over it because the globalist are cowards they put little
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:20.960]  weasels there's always a superwimp over the real killers and they always real
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.840]  scared of super killers and keep them down and you know set them up for
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.880]  special regimens of vaccines to bring damage them after they've done the
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.840]  killing but I'm I'm educating all the all the killers don't worry so that's
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:34.480]  right so what's going on here ladies the killers are with us the Americans are
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.440]  with us by the way and so what all these chicken necks need to understand is
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.880]  this we know what you're doing with all your violence and all your talk of
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:48.200]  violence all your organizing for it so you keep reaping what you sow you sow
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.760]  war you're gonna get big time war and you're gonna get the whirlwind so I'm
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:57.760]  not planning any violence myself okay I'm in the information war we're having a
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:01.880]  big effect but I'm not scared of threats and the president and the people
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:05.000]  around him and the folks that understand the Constitution and where we are we're
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.720]  dealing with globalist operatives outside powers enemy combatants trying to
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:11.840]  overthrow our reboot they're all the payroll the communist Chinese they're
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.400]  only funding group Trump's cut off Saudi Arabia he's cutting off Soros and so I
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.680]  know the president knows what he's doing but he's kicking the moles out big
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.760]  positive news to get the moles out all I'm saying is you look at all this and
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.280]  the big push we're dealing with outside authoritarian powers organizing violence
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.680]  carrying out violence and now trying to get their constituents to be violent
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:37.800]  and we have a right and a duty and responsibility to start public
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:42.080]  discussions of what we're gonna do about it if this escalates even a notch
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:45.640]  more and you can't do it once they go into full attack mode you got to have
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:52.600]  pre-plans triggers late dead switches dead man switches and so it's time I'm
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:56.200]  raising the alarm it's time to have serious discussions because we don't
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.000]  expect to deal with something like this especially a bunch of leftists who are
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.720]  cowards and wakelings and don't even have a good command and control but it's
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.600]  still dangerous and so they're trying to politically isolate bankrupt as
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:12.600]  demonizes ahead of killing us and so here's the deal whatever happens to me
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.120]  that's gonna be alright just so long is they in the end get it in a Roger Stone
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:19.400]  I want to go to Roger Stone and in the next five minutes we'll go to our next
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:24.440]  guest that went about covert action not us but we have a clear and present
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:28.600]  danger we have an outside power we have the globalist pushing all this what
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:33.400]  should we do what should the president be doing right now well the single most
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.360]  important thing I think he can do to set the table Alex would be to order his
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:42.760]  assistant attorney general for anti-trust to bust up the tech left
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.840]  attempts to strangle info wars and Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Mike
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:56.040]  Cernovich and Milo and Steven Crowder and so on I mean I just want to say this
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:03.480]  again a precursor to their entire insidious coup d'etat plan it has two
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:09.920]  precursor steps one silence the advocates of freedom silence those who
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:17.000]  would defend Trump number two take away our guns that's the plan that way the
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.760]  removal of Donald Trump can go peacefully so the most important thing he can do is
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:27.480]  wake up to the fact that whether or not Jared Kushner has a pleasant dinner
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.840]  with the Google executives is immaterial the president's supporters are being
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:39.320]  censored are having their heads chopped off every single day on Facebook on
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:47.000]  Twitter on Google on YouTube and this really must stop that's right let's put
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.200]  the article on screen from info wars calm from Sunday and people want to see
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.400]  it dem congressman uses second amendment to resist Trump and he's sitting
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.680]  there talking to a town hall of your radio listener Tom SU ozzi I guess what
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.160]  it's Tom Swazzy Swazzy yeah makes bizarre statement let's play that clip and
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:07.760]  get your take on it Roger Stone here it is
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.280]  putting a public pressure on the president and making it public which is
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.360]  hard to break through the news cycle and all the different things and it's
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:22.800]  probably about going to the courts as well and then you know I mean this is
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.520]  where the second second amendment comes in quite frankly because you know what
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:34.200]  if the president was to ignore the courts what would you do what would we do
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:48.960]  so I mean look at these helpless looking idiots in this moron trying to
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:51.440]  organize people hey we need to use the second amendment we need to get
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.440]  intimidate the president he's not ignoring the courts he's winning in
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:58.160]  the courts so they're trying to organize this everywhere I've got the other
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.520]  congressman saying take him out remove him I want him gone well they haven't
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.320]  been able to do that yet so they're organizing guns against the president
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:15.000]  and the way this normally works even in the USA a hundred years ago is we were
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.680]  free open country but if you started organizing killing the president or
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:22.600]  killing other people you know usually some bad things happen real fast or you
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:26.880]  went for a canoe and you fell off and a couple people on airplane blows up
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.520]  somebody forgets to turn their car off in the garage I mean a lot of these guys
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.560]  what am I don't want that to happen but here's the deal they're trying to start
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:37.320]  the big one which could hurt my children and other people and I'm getting sick of
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.640]  these wimps running their mouths Roger running their damn mouths running their
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:47.080]  little cowardly ass mouths people aren't gonna take this much longer Roger well
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.600]  Alex the problem here is there seems to be two standards the very people who
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:55.960]  bemoan the fact that there's no stability in our politics who consistently
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:00.480]  say the president is rude and vulgar are the exact same people who are
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:07.040]  constantly advocating violence who were a pain to disrupt Donald Trump's campaign
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:11.360]  rallies we know from the WikiLeaks disclosures that Hillary herself was
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:18.000]  was a dairy air deep in dirty tricks to disrupt Trump's rallies the very people
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.440]  who go on Twitter and advocate the violent assassination of the president
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:29.480]  the murder of his family and worse those are the people who the tech left has no
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:34.000]  problem with Keith Olberman oh yeah he can threaten the president Roger Stone
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:41.040]  hurts Jake Tapper's feelings so we have to take him off Twitter all I know is
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:45.400]  America isn't gonna put up with a violent coup carried out by the left and I
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.040]  just hope they're smart and back off but they don't have any real experience in
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.240]  this of themselves so I don't think they realize how much danger they're in well
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:57.480]  and you saw the in that clip of congressman Swazi whose only previous
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:02.240]  accomplishment is the enormous tax increases in Suffolk County when he was
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.440]  the county executive making life there perhaps the most expensive place on the
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.920]  planet but notice that that Swazi says what if the president refuses to obey
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:17.000]  the courts clearly mr. Swazi doesn't know we have a co-equal branches of
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.160]  government and unfortunately in some cases very much like our FBI and our
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:26.480]  intelligence agencies the courts have become politicized particularly left
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:29.840]  wing judges on the west coast who think they have the authority to block
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.960]  national policy which the president has an authority to assert and to tell people
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.280]  to resist ice when they've got legal awful warrants this is globalist
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:43.120]  insurrection in America it's a foreign multinational power shy combat and I'm
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.200]  telling the military in the present everybody else we I know you're already
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.760]  making preparations for this but it's a clear and present danger and I think we
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:56.200]  should deal with it starting about now Roger thank you so much

[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:29.960]  well this is over a year ago Hitler dog tens of millions of views the guy said
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.880]  I don't like Hitler but I want to freak my girlfriend out and have the dog howl
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.300]  Hitler something that famous comedians have done as well Tom Cleese of course
[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:40.720]  Charlie Chaplin but now gets you convicted he's facing six months in jail
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:44.360]  that was announced by the London Guardian today they're very proud of it but
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:50.200]  here's the offending video my girlfriend is always running Raven about how cute
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:55.240]  and adorable her wee dog is and so I thought I would turn them into the least
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:00.440]  cute thing that I could think of which is a Nazi
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:15.560]  brother do I gas the juice gas the juice juice
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:30.800]  the video went viral receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 12 so there you go
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:36.120]  that was over a year ago now Mark Meachan and of course Tommy Robinson
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:41.960]  joins us to break this down is facing jail time Tommy's been in jail for
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.640]  criticizing Islam and say they were kidnapping little girls and grooming
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:49.240]  him he's not been completely confirmed including his hometown 4,000 plus some of
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:54.960]  which disappeared and were found dead so Mark and Tommy join us Mark now it's in
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:22:01.800]  the news today the story is up on info wars.com that is YouTube
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:07.680]  YouTube are convicted for offensive joke video faces prison UK barely
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:14.560]  recognizable as a free country anymore so Mark this is being announced that you
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:18.600]  been convicted tell us about that happening I guess it's the last day
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:24.800]  and now I guess you're facing prison time for saying I don't like Hitler but
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.560]  I'm gonna do a nasty joke here well even if you liked Hitler the Magna Carta and
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:34.920]  the law says you know you could say that but you're this is next level so tell
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:39.200]  us what's happening well basically the judge turned around and confirmed that
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:43.640]  he was giving me a guilty verdict some of the things that he said alongside it
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:47.520]  were extremely troubling he turned around and says that he completely rejects the
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:53.200]  notion that this video was made as a joke and he says that I made the video to
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:57.680]  be purposefully antisemitic and that the reason that I made the video was to
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:02.160]  spread antisemitic hatred and encourage antisemitic hatred and what works me
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:07.000]  about that so much is I know my intentions I know why I made the video
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.320]  and it was to annoy my girlfriend I know the truth that is the reality of the
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:15.840]  situation and what the judge has done is just completely rejected that and
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:20.640]  instead labeled me as an antisemite and I've been found guilty of it and then I'm
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:24.400]  due to be sentenced on the 23rd of April so they've they've they've they've
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:28.040]  raped your rights already and now they're raping who what you stand for and
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:33.120]  who you are yeah pretty much yes but huge huge attack on my character because I
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:36.360]  don't exactly want to be known as that especially when I know in my heart that
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:42.720]  that's not what I'm like I know what's in my head and but however I'm kind of
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:48.360]  having it dictated to me who I am well mark here's my issue I mean I know UK
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:51.040]  law know ours I know they've passed laws in Europe and there that are in
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:55.440]  constitutional but you you argued hey I didn't mean this in this way and I told
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:58.800]  you a year ago I was like man I'd argue the whole thing's unconstitutional to
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:02.840]  begin with because if somebody now they're saying oh any criticism you know
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:09.520]  they're saying arrest me for you know criticizing young people that are our
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:14.960]  anti-gun I mean you can see the slippery slope here yeah I can see it so
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:19.520]  whenever the government tries to get 1% of control over anything they will spend
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:24.440]  all of their time and money and power trying to turn that 1% any 100% and we've
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:28.480]  seen that all the way through history and it's like any any government in any
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.160]  way throughout history is demonstrated through history who has tried to curtail
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:39.080]  or stop freedom of speech has never ever done so for honest reasons ever in
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:43.800]  history well yeah Tommy points this out Paul Watson points this out these videos
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:47.320]  hundreds of known jihadi saying I'm gonna murder I'm gonna kill and they're
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:50.600]  brought into the country and allowed to go around and preach they're gonna kill
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:56.240]  everybody but then Tommy gets thrown in jail for stuff that even less than you're
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:01.560]  about to be thrown in jail Tommy is that the worrying thing I'd say is that
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:06.320]  they've said because it's a crime to be grossly offensive where does that stop
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:12.000]  if you if I was to say that allows them to define it that's exactly what it does
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.240]  if I was to say to a Muslim for example Lauren Southern who's just been stopped
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.320]  from coming into the country she said Allah is gay if a Muslim finds that
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.320]  grossly offensive is that now a crime are you gonna arrest someone for that if I
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:27.440]  point out a fact that Muhammad was a pedophile will I be arrested for that
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:33.080]  and this this seems to be I'd say that they've gotten through the back door to
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:37.960]  prevent people being able to criticize any religion because that basically when
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.240]  you take if you set this as a president which is what they do now with court cases
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:45.320]  if someone's prosecuted they will bring this case up and say the judge found this
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:48.520]  that this man was sure they're setting precedence they're setting precedence
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.080]  that's saying presidents they're saying presidents that and the thing is it is a
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:57.400]  complete joke he says it's a joke three hundred three million people watch this
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.440]  video more than that none of them and none of them complained none of them
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.400]  complained what I mean what they really fear is humor
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:09.880]  you know what what come out in court Alex was that this wasn't even that was
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:14.480]  that the police went off their own back of their own intelligence to come and
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.000]  arrest mark they also notified the press which was unheard of so that before
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.800]  he'd been interviewed before he'd been even been arrested the press will wait
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.960]  now so I'd to photograph as them as one massive virtue signal and that's
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.560]  basically what they've done yeah but not that virtue signal now resulting in the
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:33.280]  possibility that he's gonna say exactly because under for folks that know under
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:37.880]  common law he was common law US common law Magna Carta all of that people are
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:42.240]  supposed to make the report it's seen as very dangerous when the government
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.160]  itself goes out and does this so they went out they virtue signal they got the
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:50.840]  media involved knowing this would get a big viral attention it was a viral
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.400]  story to set the precedent that even if you're more of a libertarian liberal like
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:59.520]  mark and say I don't like Hitler we're gonna put your ass in prison I mean that
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:02.880]  is so dangerous that's I mean that's like that's like you're living in North
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.640]  Korea or something mark how is this for you to deal with well basically I've
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:11.240]  spent the last part of two years and not been able to actually find a job or
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:14.960]  anything like as soon as I as soon as I get a job anywhere within a week I get
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:18.720]  recognized and they just immediately file me on the spot the only reason that I
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:22.080]  have a job just now is I'm working part time with friends and all pretty much the
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.160]  majority man come comes from YouTube and there's other stuff as well we're like
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.320]  I used to be a bouncer that's what I used to do for a living but I can't I can't
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:33.440]  do that anymore I basically had a employment wise I've had pretty much
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:38.720]  every door closed and it was even about political correctness blackballing you
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:43.800]  destroying you blacklisting you just destroying your life I mean this is
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.160]  authoritarianism it's called social consequences what people who usually do
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.880]  is if they can't get you for your speech under the law they'll do things called
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.480]  social consequences where they get the precious mirror you try and get your
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:58.560]  employers to fire you and then if none of that works what they usually do is
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:02.000]  turn up with masks on and beat you up and try and shut down your talks and
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.160]  deplatform you it's just a classic far-left tactics is pretty much what it
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:10.840]  is well we come back I want to ask you guys how we strike back because I think
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.320]  that they have really really jumped the shark on this in a big big way and I
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:19.400]  want to ask you where we go and what we do I mean I think I think everybody
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:22.480]  should really use your case in solidarity they should go to your
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.640]  Supreme Court they've defamed you saying in the media that they're they're
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.080]  taking this down because you hurt Jewish people they're speaking for you and
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:35.520]  that's a defamation right there these bullies need to pay for what they're
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:40.520]  doing trying to turn the UK into the very same anti-free speech prison that
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.720]  Europe is under the unelected dictatorship of the grandson of the
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:49.480]  richest Nazi family yogurt we'll be right back as we fight true Nazi policies

[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:39.360]  Jaws. Mark Meakin is facing up to six months in jail in a fine he was just
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:45.360]  convicted of hurting people's feelings because he did Hitler dog you know the
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:49.140]  funny thing is I have a video on YouTube called Hitler dog my late
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:55.320]  French Bulldog that died last year captain and he looked like he had a
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:00.040]  Hitler mustache and so I made the point that member JC Penney this is like five
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:07.360]  years ago now JC Penney banned a teapot because the reflection on it might look
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:10.800]  like Hitler that's like looking in a cloud and thinking it's a giraffe or
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:17.360]  broccoli would that be banned as well because it's obviously funny just like
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:23.720]  John Cleese did just like everybody else has done Charlie Chaplin saying you're
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:29.080]  pro Hitler but making a joke but even if the you want to be a Nazi you've got
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:34.160]  that right and to have your dog howl Hitler you could say well YouTube has
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:40.240]  its rules you can't oh but now you're arrested saying that old thing of oh
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.800]  it's their company no it wasn't even YouTube that did it that's where this is
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.160]  going that's the social justice warriors from the colleges in Europe the UK the
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:55.680]  US Canada Australia they then are brought into the police departments and it's
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:35:00.240]  frightening to see now radical Islamists is being put in as police
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:05.600]  chiefs and mayors all over the place by the way I think this was funnier than
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:09.440]  the great dictator Charlie Chaplin's it was just great well done I think this is
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.640]  funnier than John Cleese I think Chaplin's better than John Cleese at the
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:18.560]  Hitler limitations and this is better this is better than John Cleese I'm
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.800]  serious this is better than John Cleese this is better than Charlie Chaplin his
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:28.680]  names Mark Meakin and he isn't getting a show on the BBC baby he's going to
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:32.400]  prison where we know he'll be targeted you said he's getting fired lose
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.840]  everything so Mark I love the fact you have a good jolly attitude about this
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:39.720]  but man people that's the problem of patriots though just normal common sense
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:43.240]  folks we're not wimps we don't grant stand everybody should be decrying this
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:48.760]  my friend I mean you need to be given TV shows for your comedy genius in fact
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.480]  can we where is the original Hitler dog what's the original name where is it
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:55.800]  mirrors all I have is Paul playing the clip of it where do we find this this
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:01.040]  forbidden fruit YouTube removed it I haven't got it re-uploaded anywhere else
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.880]  because the original crime itself was actually me posting the video online like
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:09.880]  me being in the video and stuff like that so maybe I should flat of the UK
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:14.440]  publicly upload this it beakers speakers corner I mean or or John please if you
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:19.280]  notice John Cleese has come out and said this is wrong I didn't know I didn't see
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.560]  that I mean I mean he's come out and said all political correctness is very
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:25.840]  dangerous a political correctness yeah but political correctness is essentially
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.440]  just trying to curtail comedy as a whole is essentially people seem to think that
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:32.440]  we just because they get offended they have some kind of right that immediately
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:36.200]  means that my opinion trumps everybody else's in the rooms because my feelings
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:40.160]  are hot and that that's not how it works but for some reason society like
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.760]  society starting to believe that that is how things work as a case of the viewer
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:47.320]  emotions you manage them don't expect everybody else in the world to change
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:52.920]  just because you can't manage your own feelings well I mean why did the Jewish
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.880]  leader go and say it was grossly offensive doesn't you understand that's
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:00.440]  like Nazi Germany to lock somebody up for their speech well that's his job
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:05.240]  in the position it is that his job is to find the outrage I've got actually have
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:09.680]  a very large fan base in Israel all of them are practicing Jews and one thing
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:13.520]  that they really really don't like being perpetuated is the victim complex
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:18.440]  see if there's something that is like a genuine case of anti-semitism like for
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:21.800]  example there was a Jewish family owned business that get burned down in France
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.400]  and the police suspect that it was a Muslim gang that actually did it that is
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.040]  a clear case of anti-semitism and that's the type of stuff they actually want to
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.400]  bring attention to or if people are actually being attacked then physically
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.360]  attacked for being Jewish then those are the type of things that people in Israel
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:39.760]  want the attention on to but a lot of people from Israel have actually wrote
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:43.480]  to and emailed from browser you wasting your time on this this clearly isn't
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.880]  anti-semitism even if even though they were like we don't we didn't like the
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.160]  joke we thought it was tasteless but a lot of Jews around the world are actually
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:54.200]  very unhappy with what's actually happened with this entire thing even if
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  they didn't like the joke itself all right well we caught both those were on a
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.880]  bunch of commercial radio stations and TV stations so please please don't cuss
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:05.040]  anymore I understand you can in the UK it's no big deal mark you're not bad it's
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:08.560]  just that our delay the next to build back up so we want to do that for our
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:13.520]  affiliates Tommy you've been sitting here very quietly you're a man who first
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.360]  rang the alarm bell they lied about you they put you in prison for you lost your
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:21.320]  house the Muslims tried to kill you I mean what is it like seeing this expand
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:25.920]  and see the UK I mean I'm pinching myself this is this is truly
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:32.000]  authoritarian this is super dangerous in the country where free speech in the
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:39.760]  modern tense 800 years ago began what it's like for me is I know for well it's
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:42.600]  like to go through a court case and to have it hanging over your head which is
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:47.480]  why when I met Mark and I speak to him I'll ask how is it for your mother this
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:50.960]  isn't just a sentence is it even the fact that they put it off for another
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:56.040]  month now that there even the fact that they could have dealt with it today but
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:00.640]  it's still to teach a lesson still for the longer so that this clouds hanging
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.000]  over you you're constantly worrying I watched the day as his misses and they
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.240]  sat in the held hands I watched the panic and the fear on her face and the
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:10.880]  worry on her face and that's what gets to me because I know I know what my
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:13.440]  wife's gone through I'm not my mom's gone through I'm not my children go
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.240]  through so I know when they're doing this to mark they're doing it to his
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:22.680]  family and I know that this attack which is a current attack that we're
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:28.000]  witnessing whilst I say I don't want to sound like I think it's good but anything
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.320]  that highlights to the public and to the world just how far our country shifted I
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:38.720]  think is beneficial in the sense of we need the public to be awake to this we
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:42.520]  need people to realize this because it's like a chip chip chip chip chip they
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.320]  chip away at our rights and our freedoms and it over the last 10 days what
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.040]  with Brittany Pettibone Martin Selna Lauren Southern, Lutz Backman and now
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.960]  Mark it's all there for the world to see everyone can see that we now live how
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:02.000]  we're living under a for authoritarian and the reason it's important is I'll
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.080]  see headlines BBC 5,000 racists arrested police secretly overheard them in
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:12.280]  cafes saying political incorrectness I saw that six seven years ago so it's
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.040]  going on behind the scenes most people get too scared to speak out you guys
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:20.440]  are speaking out that's the final piece of the equation bring this evil this
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:26.480]  creeping death out in the open Tommy. This is to send a message what they've
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:31.040]  done to mark is to send a message and it this message works unfortunately that
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.640]  people who would have been making jokes and making crude comments and having a
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:38.760]  laugh and a bit of banter about religions be it Judaism Christianity or
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:44.960]  Islam will now be scared to they will now be scared to and that's why for the
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:48.760]  last 10 years or for longer people have been walking on their shells and
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:53.120]  treading on eggshells constantly scared and this and these actions by the
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.240]  government and the police only add to that and they know that and they know
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:00.760]  that and that's what this is about this is about silence in the public so that
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:04.560]  no one will challenge what they're doing no one will speak up and no one will
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:08.320]  even be able to joke this is how far it's gone it's gone that far that rather
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:12.480]  than people making crude comments or or speaking online in a negative way about
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:17.600]  religions people having a joke part of being British is what people realize is
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:22.720]  whether it be distasteful or or dark humor that's what British people find
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:28.600]  funny and and that's what they've now made against the law and and I said
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:32.840]  there there is an option to appeal this there is an option to appeal this but it
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:37.560]  costs how much they say I think it was estimated it would be around 50,000
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.440]  so they win again well you need you need to have lawyers and barristers come
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:45.160]  forward there needs to be organizations that are pro-free speech this is out
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.320]  you're having your whole future stolen and again when Charlie Chaplin did the
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.800]  dictator where it looks pro-Hitler and he's bouncing the world off his butt you
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:58.560]  could say someone is offended by that it I think it makes Hitler look like he's
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:02.640]  in a good light obviously it doesn't you can't operate like this this is pure
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:09.000]  tyranny it's just it's actually gotten at the pot the thing that frightens me the
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.520]  most is if I do your intent in context do not matter it's the case of you know
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.720]  exactly what you meant by what you said but another person who's you said I don't
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.400]  like Hitler you said I don't like Nazis so it's gonna be fine to make the dog do
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:27.840]  something bad but you should be able to say I like them even you know it's
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.680]  crazy we'll be right back it's unbelievable it's total authoritarianism and
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.000]  then we get into it go oh we didn't mean mean it like that they don't care they
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.560]  are the ones bringing in the Hitler lovers they are the ones bringing in
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.240]  the Islamists they are the ones crushing the West they are the globalists they
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.120]  are the plague Hitler wanted to get rid of free speech and Christianity they are

[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:27.560]  gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides but more
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.880]  importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help display yeast mold
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:37.940]  create slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that

[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.680]  bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime

[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:20.440]  juice
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.740]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live and I didn't even think to ask I had
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:37.580]  After he's been convicted of being a thought criminal,
[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:42.100]  our guest, Mark Meakin, is here with the great Tommy Robinson
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:43.340]  there in London.
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:46.300]  And I said, where is Hitler dog?
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:48.180]  And I'm gonna out the dog.
[02:47:48.180 --> 02:47:51.340]  Buddha is the real name of his girlfriend's pug,
[02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:53.340]  a very handsome, very large pug.
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:54.500]  Notice his feet were up earlier.
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:55.820]  And I said, get those down.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:58.020]  That's more prison time, a double how Hitler.
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:47:59.900]  But we're joking here.
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:03.100]  So Mark and Tommy introduced the world
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:06.420]  to the dreaded Hitlerian pressure.
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.220]  This is a Buddha, future chancellor of the Fourth Reich.
[02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:16.220]  This is apparently the dog that I was using as a smokescreen
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:17.900]  to quote the prosecutor's own words,
[02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:21.940]  to secretly spread my truly Nazi and anti-Semitic views.
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:25.620]  He says that I was basically trying to use this piece
[02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:28.780]  to turn everyone in Britain into Nazis.
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:30.780]  That's pretty much what the prosecutor said.
[02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:32.820]  By the way, that's critical to the left.
[02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:34.340]  Because they know there's not a lot of real Nazis.
[02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:35.820]  They wanna say everything's coded
[02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:38.060]  and wanna arrest you for the coded stuff
[02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:39.220]  so they can then go after everybody.
[02:48:39.220 --> 02:48:41.020]  And that's what they have said.
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:43.500]  When I said Brian Stelter looks like a demon,
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:46.460]  they said, well, he's not really Jewish, Mr. Jones.
[02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:47.940]  I never said Brian Stelter was Jewish.
[02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:49.300]  It's like mental illness.
[02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:51.180]  I said, Brian Stelter looks like a demon.
[02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:52.500]  And they go, Jones only said it
[02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:54.340]  because he thought he's Jewish, but he's not.
[02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:56.060]  And then I never said that.
[02:48:56.060 --> 02:48:57.820]  I said, who would put out PR photos
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:00.020]  where they have this demonic looking Joker grin?
[02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:02.860]  You know, I'm not saying that, you know, the guy that plays
[02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:06.060]  the Joker, Jack Nicholson's Jewish either.
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:09.540]  I mean, it's like they just, it's like seeing Hitler
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:10.380]  in the teapot.
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:11.620]  Can we see Hitler dog again, please?
[02:49:11.620 --> 02:49:12.460]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:14.620]  Boda.
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:15.940]  Oh, it does.
[02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:17.740]  Hey, you guys call Boda back, sorry.
[02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:18.580]  Boda's a rock star.
[02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:19.740]  Well, you guys have got the floor
[02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:20.580]  for the time we've got left.
[02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:21.420]  I'm ranting.
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:23.540]  What else you wanna impart the listeners and viewers?
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:27.980]  Um, there's not really much I can see, except like,
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:29.460]  all of this is pretty much his fault.
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:31.060]  Like I just held the camera.
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:34.060]  I didn't really do anything to solve him.
[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:35.420]  Look at his face as well.
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:37.420]  Look at his face.
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:38.940]  This is what it's all about.
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:40.900]  He could be going child because of this.
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:41.740]  I really liked that.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:43.180]  That's a good looking pug.
[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:44.020]  It sure.
[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:45.580]  Well, you know, he's actually Japanese in English
[02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:47.940]  because French Bulldogs originally got bred down
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:51.060]  by the lace makers there and then exported to ladies
[02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:52.060]  the night in Paris.
[02:49:52.060 --> 02:49:54.860]  That's how they got popularized 250 years ago.
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:57.340]  But the pug I guess is, you know, from China and Japan
[02:49:57.340 --> 02:49:58.620]  are like a part of what it is.
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:50:01.420]  So this, this is not a Nazi dog here.
[02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:05.460]  No, a lot of people, a lot of people especially media
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:08.100]  don't seem to realize that a dog can't exactly choose its place
[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:09.340]  on the political spectrum.
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:13.100]  Yeah, that's a good little animal.
[02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:14.900]  I bet your girlfriend likes Poodle.
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:17.700]  Oh, she likes him more than me.
[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:19.100]  Yeah, easily.
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:20.380]  Which is what the dog was about.
[02:50:20.380 --> 02:50:21.980]  Yeah, that's pretty much was that.
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.460]  I just wanted to piss her off.
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:24.980]  I might be going to jail for it.
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:27.620]  What does your girlfriend think about this now?
[02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:31.780]  She's just, well, she's not angry at me anymore.
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:33.500]  She's kind of angry mostly at the justice
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:36.300]  that the last two years, she just really wants us to be over
[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:37.900]  and just wants it to move on.
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:40.820]  Nazi pug as a whole has been pretty much a dead meme
[02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:44.620]  for quite a while now, but the calls are keeping it alive
[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:45.980]  for some reason.
[02:50:45.980 --> 02:50:47.620]  But I just kind of want this.
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:49.860]  I'm hoping they'll finally come to an end, you know,
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:53.740]  next month, better for worse, hopefully for better.
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:55.180]  Well, I've seen a lot of cute pugs,
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:56.980]  but that's a particularly cute pug right there.
[02:50:56.980 --> 02:50:57.620]  He looks really sweet.
[02:50:57.620 --> 02:50:59.100]  Is that, is Buddha a boy?
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:02.140]  Yeah, he's a boy.
[02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:03.820]  He's not happy being up here.
[02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:06.060]  We just used an improper gender pronoun, actually.
[02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:07.900]  You can get some prison time for that in California.
[02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:09.860]  Z. Z.
[02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:11.300]  Missed gender in my dog.
[02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:13.340]  That's actually a cat.
[02:51:13.340 --> 02:51:14.980]  What if your dog identifies as a cat?
[02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:20.860]  I don't know how to ask him.
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:25.500]  But seriously, they're talking six months fines.
[02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:28.660]  What do you, I mean, I guess if you grovel to them
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:31.300]  and apologize, they might not let you get prison time.
[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:33.340]  But if you don't roll over and get down on your knees
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:35.220]  before the authoritarian judge and people,
[02:51:35.220 --> 02:51:37.140]  I guess they're going to throw the book at you.
[02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:39.300]  Yeah, it's up to a year.
[02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:40.700]  I could actually get in prison.
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:41.700]  It's up to a year.
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:43.780]  I got to let Paul change his article a year.
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:44.780]  Wow.
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:45.780]  Yeah.
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:48.100]  Yeah, but like, it's a case of,
[02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:49.780]  I have absolutely no idea at this point.
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:51.140]  They're basically deferring sentence
[02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:52.140]  for background reports.
[02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:54.540]  But one of the things that I would need to do as well
[02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:57.140]  is I need to visit a court social worker
[02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:59.140]  so that I can get an assessment to see
[02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:02.220]  whether or not they should slap a restriction of liberty.
[02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:04.740]  I can't remember the full name of it,
[02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:07.140]  but it's a restriction of liberty order on me,
[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:08.820]  which basically means that I would need to wear
[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:12.460]  a GPS tracker tag and I would be under house arrest
[02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:14.620]  until I'm sentenced in April.
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:15.740]  So that's something that I need to do
[02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:17.260]  in the next few days as well.
[02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:19.300]  Well, so they want to silence you, punish you more.
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:21.300]  This is the vicious authoritarian left
[02:52:21.300 --> 02:52:23.540]  when they get full power, always shoots you
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:25.820]  in the back of the head and shovel you into graves.
[02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:27.820]  That's where this train ends.
[02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:30.620]  We know where it ends and this is what's coming to the US.
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:32.740]  I'd say the UK is about two years behind Europe,
[02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:34.900]  Germany, Sweden, everywhere that's already there.
[02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:36.900]  Former Stasi hired to run Facebook.
[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:38.020]  Now it's in the UK.
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:39.060]  Now it's coming here.
[02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:40.220]  They mean business.
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:42.460]  So we sit around and we joke about all this,
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:46.460]  ladies and gentlemen, this is deadly, deadly serious.
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:48.660]  Doesn't matter, your ancestors were bombed by the Nazis
[02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:49.740]  or fought the Nazis.
[02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:52.020]  Doesn't matter, it's projected by people
[02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:54.620]  who actually are what I call the cultural
[02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:57.340]  and spiritual children of the Nazis.
[02:52:58.580 --> 02:53:00.940]  Tommy, Mark, any other key points?
[02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:06.980]  I'll just say that this is, it's ongoing.
[02:53:06.980 --> 02:53:10.500]  I know that we had a triumph from day last Sunday
[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:13.860]  for free speech in Speakers Corner in London.
[02:53:13.860 --> 02:53:17.860]  But this is, that's the only positive I'll take from it.
[02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:20.620]  When they make these decisions, when they do this,
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:21.700]  it's for the world to see.
[02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:23.180]  And thankfully for shows like this
[02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:25.780]  and thankfully for the internet.
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:27.980]  Because if it wasn't for that, if they get their way,
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:28.820]  if they get their way,
[02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:30.780]  nobody would have been knowing about this case
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.620]  because everyone will be silenced eventually.
[02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:34.100]  And that's the route we see it going down.
[02:53:34.100 --> 02:53:35.820]  I don't know if it's the source of Deet Kahn last week
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:37.060]  was in Texas.
[02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:38.660]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:38.660 --> 02:53:41.780]  You should probably have her on your show, Alex.
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:42.980]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:44.340]  She's a Muslim lady.
[02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:45.740]  She was born a Muslim.
[02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:47.540]  She was into a forced marriage.
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:48.660]  She was raped.
[02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:52.260]  She experienced all the bad parts from the cultural problems
[02:53:52.260 --> 02:53:53.740]  that were within Islam.
[02:53:53.740 --> 02:53:55.980]  And then she messaged Deet Kahn
[02:53:55.980 --> 02:53:58.060]  and put her tweet out about knife crime.
[02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:59.580]  And she replied saying,
[02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:04.500]  if someone takes a knife and hacks away the vagina of a child,
[02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:07.780]  will the full force of the law come down on them?
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:10.460]  Now, what he did is he spoke in Texas
[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:13.100]  and his speech was about hate speech.
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:14.140]  And it's all about this.
[02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:16.980]  It's all about silencing and stopping people talking.
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:21.260]  And he used her tweet as an example of hate speech.
[02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:22.620]  I interviewed her yesterday.
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:24.340]  She's a gorgeous lady.
[02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:27.260]  So she's born a Muslim.
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.860]  She's now an ex-Muslim.
[02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:31.380]  She fights for Muslim children and Muslim women
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:33.860]  who are still within it for their rights.
[02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:35.500]  And here's to Deet Kahn,
[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:37.540]  putting her up on a pedestal as a hate preacher.
[02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:40.540]  He's actually using one of the victims of these crimes
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:42.340]  to try and silence other people who want to do it.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:43.180]  I saw this.
[02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:44.180]  Tell people the lady's name
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:45.020]  where I can see the interview.
[02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:45.860]  But I saw pieces of it.
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.100]  This was incredible about the leftists and the Islamists.
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:49.420]  They know that it's Islam.
[02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:50.540]  It's cutting the genitals off.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:52.660]  They know the left doesn't know that.
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:55.580]  So he uses this threatening tweet he got,
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:58.420]  saying somebody wants to cut his genitals off or something.
[02:54:58.420 --> 02:55:00.780]  When he knows full well it's a woman saying help us.
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:01.740]  They're hurting us.
[02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:04.980]  He takes how she's been abused and raped and sliced.
[02:55:04.980 --> 02:55:06.260]  And he makes it about him.
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:07.980]  A perfect Islamic man.
[02:55:07.980 --> 02:55:09.860]  A perfect piece of filth.
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:12.380]  Shazia Hobbs, her name was.
[02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:13.700]  And our interview will be going out
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:15.460]  probably today, straight tomorrow.
[02:55:15.460 --> 02:55:17.380]  But she wrote a letter to Salih Khan about it.
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:18.260]  She wrote a letter to him.
[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:21.180]  And then he used it to spin it
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:24.100]  that she was talking about chopping in him.
[02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:28.620]  Yeah, he uses it as a part of the hate speech
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:29.540]  that he faces.
[02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:31.340]  Joe Elsie spoke about one of the things
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:33.540]  he said I get called a pigeon.
[02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:34.860]  So what?
[02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:36.700]  So what if you get called a pigeon?
[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:38.020]  You're a public figure.
[02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:40.820]  Yeah, there's no free speech back in Pakistan
[02:55:40.820 --> 02:55:42.540]  or wherever you came from.
[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:43.660]  Joe, the worst thing is,
[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:45.900]  the most frustrating thing is in these circumstances.
[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:48.900]  When you look at what Marx has been prosecuted of,
[02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:50.740]  if I go through, if I read you this,
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:51.980]  I've received this today.
[02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:54.260]  I receive these every day.
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:56.660]  No one's ever prosecuted.
[02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:59.540]  I hope you are forced to watch as your family,
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:02.580]  as your family have their veins ripped from their arms.
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:03.780]  Yeah, forgot.
[02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:07.300]  But this is a man who's threatening death upon my family.
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:09.740]  Now that doesn't qualify under their hate speech
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:13.100]  because I'm white, straight and working class.
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:17.260]  But anyone who says anything against the minority,
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:19.580]  that's where there's no level playing field.
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:20.420]  It's not like we're just-
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:22.780]  And Muslims are a majority and they're taking over.
[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:25.380]  Tommy, I want to talk to you both as this unfolds.
[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:27.980]  Let's talk about your YouTube, where people can go.
[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:31.500]  YouTube.com forward slash count, Dancula.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:32.860]  Twitter, Count Dancula TV.
[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:33.860]  Mark, thank you.
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:34.700]  Tommy, thank you.
[02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:36.700]  You guys are awesome.
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:37.540]  Thank you, man.
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:39.460]  And I want to bring that lady here
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:42.380]  who Twitter kicked off and who they're reporting on.
[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:44.220]  So it's in the news that they're saying,
[02:56:44.220 --> 02:56:45.860]  if women don't want their genitals cut off
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:47.580]  or to be in slave brothels, they are bad.
[02:56:47.580 --> 02:56:48.900]  I'm not getting that as the left.
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:50.700]  We are not making this up.
[02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:52.620]  Siddiq Khan, what a monster.
[02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:53.660]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.220]  I'm going to come back and host the fourth hour.
[02:56:56.220 --> 02:56:58.700]  I'm going to briefly just to tell you
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:02.420]  that it's critical that folks purchase the products.
[02:57:02.420 --> 02:57:07.020]  It is critical that all of you go to infowarshore.com.
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:08.660]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.300]  I get so focused on the news.
[02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:11.500]  This is how we fund our operation.
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:12.740]  You know, they've taken our sponsors
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:13.580]  and all the rest of it.
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:15.220]  You hear local sponsors support those.
[02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:16.580]  That's local, national.
[02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:18.460]  The network's got some, but I fund myself
[02:57:18.460 --> 02:57:20.060]  for you buying books, t-shirts.
[02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:22.500]  We've got a limited edition t-shirt of the month,
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:25.500]  Trump 2020, and it says Keeping America Great
[02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:26.540]  with a new slogan.
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:28.380]  That's at infowarshore.com.
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:30.180]  $50 off the electric pure breeze,
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:32.220]  home air purifiers that are so amazing.

[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:36.540]  Myco ZX now back in stock.
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:38.220]  Now even stronger, 50% off.
[02:57:38.220 --> 02:57:40.020]  But a bunch of these specials are about to end.
[02:57:40.020 --> 02:57:41.820]  Whatever you do, spread the live links now,
[02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:43.100]  fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:48.940]  The reason infowarse.life has five star ratings
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:51.300]  on major third party sites is because I want products
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:52.340]  I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:53.180]  I take this.
[02:57:53.180 --> 02:57:54.380]  My family takes this.
[02:57:54.380 --> 02:57:55.860]  And then it funds the operation
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:57:57.820]  with the most hardcore, truthful information
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:57:58.660]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:57:58.660 --> 02:58:00.860]  So what you find in our news is the same thing
[02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:03.220]  you find in our products at infowarse.life.com.
[02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:05.140]  If I ever forget to take them,
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:07.860]  like I'm having noticeable difference.
[02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:09.020]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:10.900]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:12.780]  that was life changing for me.
[02:58:12.780 --> 02:58:15.460]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:17.740]  I had a few bottles at my house
[02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:19.340]  and I've been taking it again,
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:21.220]  hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:23.940]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:27.740]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:29.980]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:30.820]  I love it.
[02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:33.260]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:34.340]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:36.660]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing
[02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:40.460]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:42.100]  It's got a five star rating.
[02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:44.620]  It's a win-win infowarse.life.com.
[02:58:47.180 --> 02:58:49.620]  Infowarse Life and infowarselife.com
[02:58:49.620 --> 02:58:52.860]  is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[02:58:52.860 --> 02:58:56.700]  Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:59:00.340]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3
[02:59:00.340 --> 02:59:01.380]  nutritional supplement.
[02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:03.140]  It is produced by extracting oil
[02:59:03.140 --> 02:59:06.140]  from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lycans.
[02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:09.180]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:12.340]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens, simply put.
[02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:15.180]  If you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[02:59:15.180 --> 02:59:17.540]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit
[02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:19.540]  of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:21.900]  The research and development took over two years,
[02:59:21.900 --> 02:59:24.780]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[02:59:24.780 --> 02:59:28.020]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:30.620]  Read the facts at infowarselife.com
[02:59:30.620 --> 02:59:33.100]  about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:36.060]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood,
[02:59:36.060 --> 02:59:38.980]  but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function,
[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:41.180]  something the globalists are targeting.
[02:59:41.180 --> 02:59:46.180]  Visit infowarse.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:53.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:00.220 --> 03:00:04.300]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:04.300 --> 03:00:07.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.180 --> 03:00:10.820]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:13.780]  Run on for a long time.
[03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:15.980]  Run on for a long time.
[03:00:15.980 --> 03:00:18.300]  All right, I want to air part of this Millie Weaver report.
[03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:19.500]  Live in a bubble.
[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:21.500]  Abort your kids who've never done guns or cars.
[03:00:21.500 --> 03:00:22.740]  It's too long for the same.
[03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:23.940]  I'm going to play part of it for Millie Weaver.
[03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:25.980]  It's a good report.
[03:00:25.980 --> 03:00:30.060]  And then I haven't gotten into the rest of the big news
[03:00:30.060 --> 03:00:32.740]  where they're freaking out about the poll
[03:00:32.740 --> 03:00:34.460]  that the majority of Americans know
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:37.580]  that the deep state is operating and is criminal.
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:39.180]  So they don't know how to deal with that.
[03:00:39.180 --> 03:00:41.380]  A bunch of other news I'm going to get into dealing
[03:00:41.380 --> 03:00:44.980]  with Trump announcing a meeting with Putin finally and more.
[03:00:44.980 --> 03:00:48.740]  And I've got a challenge too for David Hogg.
[03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:50.540]  He's challenged to debate me and then backed out.
[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:52.540]  I've got a challenge for him coming up.
[03:00:52.540 --> 03:01:12.660]  But here is part of that report from Millie Weaver.
[03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:16.300]  Today at South by Southwest around 12.30 p.m.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:19.180]  there's going to be a handmade tail panel
[03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:21.420]  called What If Roe Had to Go.
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:25.340]  Essentially what it happens if no longer there are
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.500]  abortion rights laws that can allow these women
[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:31.820]  who want to have multiple abortions
[03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:36.140]  for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:38.820]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially to make it
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:42.660]  so that motherhood having babies is seen as a burden.
[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:44.180]  It's seen as forced.
[03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:46.060]  These feminists believed what would happen
[03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:48.660]  if the laws were to come into action.
[03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:50.620]  The whole point of this right here,
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:54.700]  this show, this panel, this image right here
[03:01:54.700 --> 03:01:57.020]  for people to see when they're walking by
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:02:00.900]  is to suggest and subliminally put it out there
[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:03.660]  that there is a battle of the sexes
[03:02:03.660 --> 03:02:07.740]  and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad,
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.260]  is oppressing women.
[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:10.860]  It's more than that too.
[03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:13.540]  The women wear burkas and full body outfits.
[03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:15.500]  So it's not Islam that's oppressing women.
[03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:17.300]  It's the West that empowered women.
[03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:19.500]  And then femininity and children is a presence.
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:22.380]  So Millie's right, but it's all total inversion.
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:24.500]  But Hollywood, pedophile Hollywood,
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.100]  it's going to take a carry-in gang rapy real good.
[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:30.900]  They don't want to talk about the women in the Middle East
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:31.740]  that are being oppressed.
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:32.580]  There you go.
[03:02:32.580 --> 03:02:35.900]  They'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture
[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:39.300]  that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle East.
[03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:40.500]  And I want to point out this right here.
[03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:42.060]  Resist, sister.
[03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:45.500]  Resist is a common, obviously it's used
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:47.500]  with a lot of Black Lives Matter and-
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:48.820]  Yeah, hit pause again.
[03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:50.740]  I'm going to play the whole report when we come back.
[03:02:50.740 --> 03:02:52.980]  Because this is important and not an eruptor.
[03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:56.420]  Resist, sister.
[03:02:56.420 --> 03:02:58.180]  The big corporations in Hollywood.
[03:02:58.180 --> 03:02:59.460]  We care about you, sister.
[03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:00.620]  We care about you, ladies.
[03:03:00.620 --> 03:03:02.220]  This was all being produced,
[03:03:02.220 --> 03:03:04.020]  like Hillary was going to be president.
[03:03:04.020 --> 03:03:07.620]  Handmaid's Tale was being produced in 2016.
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:11.180]  And then being cut and made and ready for 2018.
[03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:15.220]  Just like the new Homeland was a woman president
[03:03:15.220 --> 03:03:17.140]  in 2016 into 18.
[03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:18.100]  And then it wasn't.
[03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:19.820]  So now it's another president.
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:21.620]  They just had it all lined up where
[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:23.780]  you don't like Hillary, you don't like women.
[03:03:23.780 --> 03:03:26.020]  And then women are supposed to be real dumb.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:26.860]  And go, you're right.
[03:03:26.860 --> 03:03:28.060]  In fact, I didn't play this this week.
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:29.900]  It was one of the biggest stories.
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:32.460]  I'm going to play Hillary in India about, you know,
[03:03:32.460 --> 03:03:34.780]  white women, listen to their husbands.
[03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:38.140]  White women.
[03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:41.820]  The nine richest groups in the US are all Asian
[03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:44.220]  if you rank them by, quote, race.
[03:03:44.220 --> 03:03:45.620]  Whites are way down there.
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:49.780]  But a woman that's with a husband that's successful
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:51.700]  or vice versa, or both of them.
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:54.820]  Wouldn't it be smart to go, my kids are doing well.
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:55.660]  I'm doing well.
[03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:56.900]  I've got a great life.
[03:03:56.900 --> 03:03:58.100]  My husband's smart.
[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:00.100]  I like him.
[03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:01.340]  I like Trump.
[03:04:01.340 --> 03:04:02.740]  He likes Trump.
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:04.660]  The patronizing of that.
[03:04:04.660 --> 03:04:05.500]  I haven't even got into this
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:06.540]  because she makes me so sick,
[03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:08.380]  but I'm going to get into it now.
[03:04:08.380 --> 03:04:09.380]  We come back.
[03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:13.340]  The fact that Hillary says that women
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:17.860]  were made by men in the West to vote for Trump,
[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:19.740]  like, like, like Western men,
[03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:21.620]  like I've got women chained up at home
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:23.420]  and I cut their genitals off.
[03:04:23.420 --> 03:04:25.300]  If anything, the women of my life
[03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:27.460]  are sitting on top pink pillows.
[03:04:28.540 --> 03:04:31.140]  And, and, and it probably isn't even the best thing.
[03:04:32.420 --> 03:04:34.700]  But that, that, that's it.
[03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:35.860]  It's, it's what the West is.
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:38.340]  And I'm an extreme example of that.
[03:04:38.340 --> 03:04:39.780]  Now, if you want to be in a slave brothel
[03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:42.220]  with a hundred guys raping you until you die,
[03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:43.540]  or you want to be sold in a slave block
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:45.100]  onto a slave ship and taken to a brothel
[03:04:45.100 --> 03:04:47.660]  so you're raped to death, Islam's for you.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:48.900]  But again, the left covers that up
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:51.100]  because they love the desecration of women.
[03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:52.220]  They hate women.
[03:04:54.940 --> 03:04:58.340]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life.
[03:04:58.340 --> 03:05:01.300]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:02.300]  and protection.
[03:05:02.300 --> 03:05:05.700]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:08.140]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:08.140 --> 03:05:11.220]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production
[03:05:11.220 --> 03:05:12.860]  by supporting mitochondria,
[03:05:12.860 --> 03:05:15.260]  much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:17.220]  Because when your mitochondria don't run
[03:05:17.220 --> 03:05:19.020]  at 100% efficiency,
[03:05:19.020 --> 03:05:22.340]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:25.540]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused
[03:05:25.540 --> 03:05:27.020]  by cellular damage,
[03:05:27.020 --> 03:05:30.500]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:32.740]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:35.580]  are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:35.580 --> 03:05:37.260]  The stronger the antioxidant,
[03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:39.100]  the better its ability to scavenge
[03:05:39.100 --> 03:05:41.180]  for these reactive oxygen species
[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:43.220]  and other free radicals.
[03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:46.380]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force
[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:48.100]  from Info Wars Life.

[03:05:53.100 --> 03:06:08.700]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:24.580]  born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.580 --> 03:06:26.580]  So Hillary came out, you know,
[03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:30.060]  she said earlier in the week or last week in India,
[03:06:30.060 --> 03:06:32.300]  in between falling down and breaking her arm
[03:06:32.300 --> 03:06:33.820]  and falling down three other times.
[03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:35.540]  But her health is just fine.
[03:06:35.540 --> 03:06:36.700]  She never falls down either.
[03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:38.340]  That's fake news from Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:40.900]  Turned in reports, it was Alex Jones and Paul Watson
[03:06:40.900 --> 03:06:42.580]  put out the rumor she fell down.
[03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:43.540]  She only slipped.
[03:06:43.540 --> 03:06:45.260]  Look, then they cut before she falls down.
[03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:48.420]  I mean, they are the kings of fake news.
[03:06:48.420 --> 03:06:50.500]  And then Hillary came out and said,
[03:06:50.500 --> 03:06:53.500]  white women voted how their husbands told them.
[03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:56.100]  We can put that article on screen for TV viewers.
[03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:58.220]  But that is the craziness.
[03:06:58.220 --> 03:06:59.660]  Like it or not, studies suggest
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:02.380]  that Clinton may not be wrong on white women
[03:07:02.380 --> 03:07:04.180]  voting like their husbands.
[03:07:04.180 --> 03:07:09.180]  See the live from the Washington Posts from Jeff Bezos?
[03:07:09.180 --> 03:07:12.420]  She said her husbands make them vote.
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:18.940]  Not that white women don't vote like their husbands.
[03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:20.180]  See the slide of hand?
[03:07:20.180 --> 03:07:22.380]  Everything with these people is deception,
[03:07:22.380 --> 03:07:25.580]  praying on you, hoping you don't pay attention.
[03:07:25.580 --> 03:07:28.020]  Hillary Clinton brames pressure from men
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:34.740]  for why white women voted for Trump.
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:38.380]  So that's where all this is going.
[03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:41.540]  And then they show handmade and stale.
[03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:43.060]  And they've got all these big PR stunts
[03:07:43.060 --> 03:07:44.900]  were being a mother, having a baby.
[03:07:44.900 --> 03:07:46.060]  That's all Gloria Steinem.
[03:07:46.060 --> 03:07:47.260]  Gloria Steinem had a bunch of kids.
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:49.380]  She worked for the left of CIA, by the way.
[03:07:49.380 --> 03:07:50.220]  She admits that.
[03:07:50.220 --> 03:07:52.660]  To get women into the workforce to break up the family
[03:07:52.660 --> 03:07:55.660]  so the state could raise them.
[03:07:55.660 --> 03:07:57.260]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[03:07:57.260 --> 03:08:01.140]  Hillary Clinton blames pressure from men
[03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:03.020]  for why white women vote for Trump.
[03:08:03.020 --> 03:08:05.460]  What a racist statement.
[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:07.140]  And here's the clip.
[03:08:07.140 --> 03:08:09.340]  Well, I should start by explaining
[03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:15.420]  that Democrats, going back to my husband even before,
[03:08:15.420 --> 03:08:20.260]  but just in recent times, going back to Bill and our candidates
[03:08:20.260 --> 03:08:23.340]  and then President Obama, have been losing the white vote,
[03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:25.420]  including white women.
[03:08:25.420 --> 03:08:28.300]  We do not do well with white men.
[03:08:28.300 --> 03:08:33.220]  And we don't do well with married white women.
[03:08:33.220 --> 03:08:37.340]  And part of that is an identification
[03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:45.100]  with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure
[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:52.500]  to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son,
[03:08:52.500 --> 03:08:54.900]  whoever, believes you should.
[03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:58.220]  And what happened in my election is
[03:08:58.220 --> 03:09:02.540]  I was on the way to winning white women
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:07.180]  until former director of the FBI, Jim Comey,
[03:09:07.180 --> 03:09:11.420]  dropped that very ill-advised letter on October the 28th.
[03:09:11.420 --> 03:09:13.260]  And my numbers just went down because all,
[03:09:13.260 --> 03:09:15.300]  and I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about this.
[03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:18.500]  I'll just shut her up, I can't hear her anymore.
[03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:21.180]  She's over in India trying to preach racism against white
[03:09:21.180 --> 03:09:21.700]  people.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:22.620]  I mean, that's the backdrop.
[03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:25.700]  The whites are just too stupid.
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:28.740]  In India, one of the most racist places in the world
[03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:31.860]  where they worship white people in the caste system.
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:33.500]  And I don't think that's a good thing.
[03:09:33.500 --> 03:09:37.300]  But you go to India, the ruling class is white.
[03:09:37.300 --> 03:09:38.820]  I mean, I'm going to throw up, man.
[03:09:38.820 --> 03:09:42.420]  I can't handle this crap anymore.
[03:09:42.420 --> 03:09:45.460]  I mean, you've got this monster, Hillary Clinton,
[03:09:45.460 --> 03:09:48.980]  that if they'd have run a smart, patriotic woman,
[03:09:48.980 --> 03:09:51.300]  she would have beaten Trump.
[03:09:51.300 --> 03:09:53.380]  But despite all of it, they force fetus
[03:09:53.380 --> 03:09:55.460]  this monster of corruption.
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:01.660]  Let's go to Millie's Handmaid's Tale.
[03:10:01.660 --> 03:10:04.060]  From the start, this is her breakdown.
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:04.540]  Here it is.
[03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:13.340]  Today at South by Southwest, around 12.30 PM,
[03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:16.580]  there's going to be a Handmaid's Tale panel called
[03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:18.460]  What If Roe Had to Go?
[03:10:18.460 --> 03:10:22.020]  Essentially, what it happens if no longer there
[03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:25.020]  are abortion rights laws that can
[03:10:25.020 --> 03:10:28.860]  allow these women who want to have multiple abortions
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:33.180]  for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:35.380]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially
[03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:38.580]  to make it so that motherhood, having babies,
[03:10:38.580 --> 03:10:39.700]  is seen as a burden.
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:41.220]  It's seen as forced.
[03:10:41.220 --> 03:10:43.100]  These feminists believed what would happen
[03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:45.700]  if the laws were to come into action.
[03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:47.660]  The whole point of this right here,
[03:10:47.660 --> 03:10:51.740]  this show, this panel, this image right here
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:54.100]  for people to see when they're walking by,
[03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:57.940]  is to suggest and subliminally put it out there
[03:10:57.940 --> 03:11:00.700]  that there is a battle of the sexes
[03:11:00.700 --> 03:11:04.780]  and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad,
[03:11:04.780 --> 03:11:06.420]  is oppressing women.
[03:11:06.420 --> 03:11:09.020]  But they don't want to talk about the women in the Middle
[03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:10.300]  East that are being oppressed.
[03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:14.340]  No, they'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:17.260]  that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle
[03:11:17.260 --> 03:11:17.780]  East.
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:20.540]  And I want to point out this right here, resist sister.
[03:11:20.540 --> 03:11:23.700]  Resist is a common, obviously it's
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:26.500]  used with a lot of Black Lives Matter and Tifa.
[03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:30.220]  This is a call to resist Trump to women.
[03:11:30.220 --> 03:11:32.940]  This is a call for feminists and women to come together
[03:11:32.940 --> 03:11:36.020]  because see, they're trying to let all the women know that,
[03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:38.940]  hey, these men are trying to oppress you
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:42.060]  and force you to have babies and force you to,
[03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:44.020]  because that's what this whole show is about,
[03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:46.380]  is about women that are in a dystopic future
[03:11:46.380 --> 03:11:47.980]  and they're forced to have babies
[03:11:47.980 --> 03:11:49.980]  and they're forced to be oppressed.
[03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:53.020]  And in truth, the globalists just want you as their slaves.
[03:11:53.020 --> 03:11:56.060]  They don't want you totally isolated, continue.
[03:11:56.060 --> 03:11:59.340]  Ultra-conservative patriarchy.
[03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:01.340]  It's almost as if they're saying that motherhood
[03:12:01.340 --> 03:12:03.860]  isn't powerful enough and that in a sense
[03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:06.660]  that by being a mother, by being a wife,
[03:12:06.660 --> 03:12:08.580]  you're essentially being a slave.
[03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:11.340]  When they don't talk about is how women are actually
[03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:14.420]  being manipulated by the abortion systems every single day.
[03:12:14.420 --> 03:12:15.860]  The abortion systems, what they'll do
[03:12:15.860 --> 03:12:17.940]  is they'll take in a woman and they will hit her
[03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:19.780]  at the most vulnerable spots.
[03:12:19.780 --> 03:12:21.380]  They'll make her feel as if she's not good enough
[03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:22.820]  to be a mother, that she's not fit enough
[03:12:22.820 --> 03:12:24.020]  for anything that she wants to do,
[03:12:24.020 --> 03:12:25.220]  that she can't handle the world
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:27.100]  unless she gets an abortion.
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:28.340]  Exactly, that's what they do.
[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:30.220]  They don't offer a real choice,
[03:12:30.220 --> 03:12:31.820]  usually when you go to an abortion clinic.
[03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:32.660]  They make an empowerment.
[03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:33.820]  They don't give you a choice.
[03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:35.900]  They don't say, hey, we're gonna help you
[03:12:35.900 --> 03:12:40.660]  with your female gynecological issues.
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:42.940]  If you wanna go in and you wanna get ultrasounds,
[03:12:42.940 --> 03:12:44.500]  if you need maternity care,
[03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:45.900]  they don't offer maternity care.
[03:12:45.900 --> 03:12:47.100]  They don't tell you there's people willing
[03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:49.340]  to pay for the baby legally, hundreds of thousands.
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:51.180]  Or are they just for pro-abortion?
[03:12:52.420 --> 03:12:55.660]  Okay, so notice here, you have a sign that says,
[03:12:55.660 --> 03:12:58.020]  concealed handguns prohibited.
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:01.180]  You also have openly carried handguns
[03:13:01.180 --> 03:13:03.300]  being prohibited as well.
[03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:06.220]  And this is a little fence in area,
[03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:09.700]  which inside is the venue for bulletproof,
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:13.100]  a coffee and product that they sell
[03:13:13.100 --> 03:13:15.300]  a bunch of supplements and whatnot.
[03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:18.940]  But notice that the whole idea of the name bulletproof
[03:13:18.940 --> 03:13:20.580]  for this brand, it makes you wonder,
[03:13:20.580 --> 03:13:23.940]  well, is that to subliminally suggest to the public
[03:13:23.940 --> 03:13:27.220]  this idea of being anti-second amendment?
[03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:29.340]  Wanting America to be bulletproof,
[03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:32.700]  meaning free of bullets, free of guns,
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:34.300]  free of the second amendment.
[03:13:34.300 --> 03:13:38.100]  Do you really think that if you had a coffee maker
[03:13:38.100 --> 03:13:40.460]  that was, you know, say to have a name
[03:13:40.460 --> 03:13:43.380]  that was pro-second amendment, for example,
[03:13:43.380 --> 03:13:44.940]  do you think that they would be permitted
[03:13:44.940 --> 03:13:48.380]  to have a venue here at South by Southwest?
[03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:50.660]  Well, I highly doubt it because pretty much
[03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:53.660]  all of the venues and everything that we've been seeing here
[03:13:53.660 --> 03:13:58.660]  at South by Southwest has a very extreme liberal bias
[03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:00.620]  in everything they do.
[03:14:01.980 --> 03:14:04.100]  Oh yeah, it's like double boy.
[03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:06.620]  Or like almost like a hamster wheel or a hamster ball,
[03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:07.460]  I'm sorry.
[03:14:07.460 --> 03:14:08.300]  That's crazy.
[03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:09.620]  Keeping us going in the same pace, same time.
[03:14:09.620 --> 03:14:10.860]  Just like in the prisoner,
[03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:12.980]  the big bubbles that chase you down.
[03:14:12.980 --> 03:14:16.620]  Knowledge is gonna keep us on the hamster wheel, if you will.
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:18.820]  By the way, we always create different flags for our events
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:20.820]  because the left will beat even women up.
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:23.540]  So you can't go out in these areas.
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:24.860]  What's car to go?
[03:14:24.860 --> 03:14:27.860]  It's all membership based and you just use your app
[03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:29.820]  to unlock the car and drive.
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:32.580]  And you can park anywhere you want within the home area.
[03:14:33.540 --> 03:14:34.380]  That's interesting.
[03:14:34.380 --> 03:14:39.380]  So essentially, it kind of is like a rental car,
[03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:41.940]  but instead you subscribe to a membership
[03:14:41.940 --> 03:14:44.660]  where you can use any different car.
[03:14:44.660 --> 03:14:46.940]  You don't get charged extra for different cars
[03:14:46.940 --> 03:14:47.940]  and you have a monthly rate.
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:49.100]  Is that what it is?
[03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:49.940]  No monthly rate.
[03:14:49.940 --> 03:14:50.940]  It's just per use.
[03:14:50.940 --> 03:14:52.260]  You only get charged for what you use.
[03:14:52.260 --> 03:14:54.900]  So are these cars just gonna be parked around cities?
[03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:57.500]  That you can just hop into kind of how those bicycles are?
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:14:58.340]  Yep, exactly.
[03:14:58.340 --> 03:14:59.580]  And they get preferential treatment
[03:14:59.580 --> 03:15:01.340]  and they're allowed to park, but you aren't.
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:02.420]  They're out of the US.
[03:15:02.420 --> 03:15:04.940]  So, I mean, what do you guys think about
[03:15:04.940 --> 03:15:08.620]  how this is kind of like phasing out car ownership in a way?
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:10.100]  Like if everyone just starts doing this,
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:12.980]  people aren't gonna be owning cars anymore.
[03:15:12.980 --> 03:15:14.380]  That's the point.
[03:15:14.380 --> 03:15:15.700]  That's the point.
[03:15:15.700 --> 03:15:18.140]  That's all about markets where you don't have choice.
[03:15:18.140 --> 03:15:19.340]  So we think there's more benefit
[03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.860]  of people sharing cars, not having cars just sitting in the car.
[03:15:21.860 --> 03:15:23.100]  They think it's more benefit.
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:25.580]  Not being used for 90% of the day.
[03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:27.420]  Yeah, car to go is a complete job.
[03:15:27.420 --> 03:15:29.180]  All right, that report's very diverse
[03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:31.020]  because it's in a whole bunch of different subjects.
[03:15:31.020 --> 03:15:33.140]  I don't mean diverse in the LibTar version,
[03:15:33.140 --> 03:15:34.940]  but a lot of different angles.
[03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:38.020]  You see the full report at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:15:38.020 --> 03:15:39.300]  When we return,
[03:15:40.300 --> 03:15:44.140]  the morning Joe flips out that America's waking up
[03:15:44.140 --> 03:15:45.340]  to the deep state.
[03:15:45.340 --> 03:15:47.620]  All that and more straight ahead.
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:49.500]  This is the info war.
[03:15:55.060 --> 03:15:57.620]  ID stronghold wallets are different.
[03:15:57.620 --> 03:15:59.500]  They may look the same on the outside.
[03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:00.340]  They're stylish.
[03:16:00.340 --> 03:16:01.900]  They'll hold your cards in cash,
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:04.740]  but they're hiding something great on the inside.
[03:16:04.740 --> 03:16:06.980]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[03:16:06.980 --> 03:16:09.540]  And it doesn't sing when you open it,
[03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:12.060]  but it does have magical powers.
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:15.060]  ID stronghold wallets protect your critical information
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:17.820]  and identity from thieves standing right next to you.

[03:17:59.140 --> 03:18:03.060]  In a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim,
[03:18:03.060 --> 03:18:06.540]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:06.540 --> 03:18:09.500]  This is a heart and brain pill,
[03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:12.060]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[03:18:12.060 --> 03:18:15.060]  but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:18:15.060 --> 03:18:17.700]  Quite frankly, I just went off
[03:18:17.700 --> 03:18:21.380]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:18:21.380 --> 03:18:22.860]  but it wasn't prescription,
[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:27.620]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[03:18:27.620 --> 03:18:29.100]  and I came up with our own formula
[03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:31.220]  working with some scientists and developers.
[03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:36.180]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:18:36.180 --> 03:18:39.380]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[03:18:39.380 --> 03:18:41.860]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:18:41.860 --> 03:18:42.980]  that your body has to have
[03:18:42.980 --> 03:18:45.420]  to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:45.420 --> 03:18:46.980]  It is amazing.
[03:18:48.180 --> 03:18:51.580]  Red pill, now available at M4warstore.com
[03:18:51.580 --> 03:18:53.460]  and your purchase fuzz the operation.

[03:19:02.620 --> 03:19:05.740]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:09.500]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:12.500]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[03:19:12.500 --> 03:19:15.260]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[03:19:15.260 --> 03:19:17.780]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:19:17.780 --> 03:19:21.700]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:24.540]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:27.660]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[03:19:27.660 --> 03:19:29.980]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[03:19:29.980 --> 03:19:32.700]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:35.300]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:19:35.300 --> 03:19:37.060]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:38.740]  In fact, current research has found
[03:19:38.740 --> 03:19:42.100]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[03:19:42.100 --> 03:19:44.420]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[03:19:44.420 --> 03:19:47.060]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:19:47.060 --> 03:19:49.700]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:19:49.700 --> 03:19:51.620]  Head to infowarslife.com
[03:19:51.620 --> 03:19:54.780]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[03:19:54.780 --> 03:19:57.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:23.780]  Well, folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[03:20:23.780 --> 03:20:27.780]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:20:27.780 --> 03:20:29.780]  And we are here.
[03:20:29.780 --> 03:20:32.780]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:32.780 --> 03:20:39.180]  Reddit user says he's Austin bombing killer,
[03:20:39.180 --> 03:20:42.780]  and it's probably made up, probably not the killer.
[03:20:42.780 --> 03:20:47.020]  But then this person says they were planning to bomb us today,
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:52.700]  shipping the package from San Antonio to our offices
[03:20:52.700 --> 03:20:57.700]  and that it must have detonated or had the switch thrown
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:20:58.980]  by being bounced.
[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:02.140]  And from the police, these are pressure bombs,
[03:21:02.140 --> 03:21:03.860]  but we've already reported that since individuals
[03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:04.980]  would know that, who knows.
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:10.380]  I would not report it except that it's been picked up
[03:21:10.380 --> 03:21:11.980]  by the New York Daily News.
[03:21:11.980 --> 03:21:16.540]  So document Kim shot, please, TV viewers.
[03:21:16.540 --> 03:21:22.620]  And you can see here where they get into all that.
[03:21:22.620 --> 03:21:25.700]  So this is just all part of the hysteria.
[03:21:25.700 --> 03:21:27.020]  It's just like folks think they're
[03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:30.060]  going to win some powerball ticket where people bought
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:34.780]  20 million tickets or 100 million tickets in some cases.
[03:21:34.780 --> 03:21:37.140]  And then everybody just thinks when those balls start rolling,
[03:21:37.140 --> 03:21:37.660]  they can get it.
[03:21:37.660 --> 03:21:40.900]  Statistically, you could have the German Air Force
[03:21:40.900 --> 03:21:43.660]  flying over here with a bunch of German bombers
[03:21:43.660 --> 03:21:47.380]  dropping thousands and thousands of pounds of bombs,
[03:21:47.380 --> 03:21:49.060]  tens of thousands of pounds of bombs,
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:51.500]  and it would still only kill a fraction of the city.
[03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:53.740]  You've got more people dying every week in car wrecks in Austin
[03:21:53.740 --> 03:21:55.820]  than we're dying in a month from these bombings.
[03:21:55.820 --> 03:21:56.780]  But it's still serious.
[03:21:56.780 --> 03:21:58.660]  I'm not taking away from that if it blows your head off
[03:21:58.660 --> 03:21:59.900]  or blows your arms off.
[03:21:59.900 --> 03:22:04.220]  It's just it creates this lottery ticket idea.
[03:22:04.220 --> 03:22:06.940]  But in a negative way, like you think as you own a ticket,
[03:22:06.940 --> 03:22:09.500]  it's probably going to be you.
[03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:15.260]  Even though it's the odds are incredibly huge,
[03:22:15.260 --> 03:22:16.940]  you still have that perception.
[03:22:16.940 --> 03:22:19.300]  Just like great white sharks kill six, seven, eight people
[03:22:19.300 --> 03:22:21.020]  a year on average.
[03:22:21.020 --> 03:22:23.100]  People still tell you, I don't like to swim the deep ocean,
[03:22:23.100 --> 03:22:24.580]  or I don't like to go off the shore.
[03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:27.300]  I'm afraid a great white's going to eat because of the movie Jaws.
[03:22:27.300 --> 03:22:31.940]  And for years after that movie came out in 1972,
[03:22:31.940 --> 03:22:34.060]  in California and New England and other areas,
[03:22:34.060 --> 03:22:38.940]  they saw up to 50% reductions in people getting beach houses
[03:22:38.940 --> 03:22:44.060]  and going out in the water and people going out and fishing,
[03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:45.780]  because they just thought there were great whites out there
[03:22:45.780 --> 03:22:49.300]  to eat them, even though it's one of the rarest ways to die.
[03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:53.620]  So this has created hysteria.
[03:22:53.620 --> 03:22:57.460]  It's what terrorism does.
[03:22:57.460 --> 03:22:58.700]  It's what it's designed to do.
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:02.500]  And generally, it's a mental patient type,
[03:23:02.500 --> 03:23:06.460]  schizophrenic type, that has an education.
[03:23:06.460 --> 03:23:10.020]  Or it's somebody that wants to get attention, usually a leftist.
[03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:11.300]  And that's what most of these people are,
[03:23:11.300 --> 03:23:14.260]  Theodore Kozinski, the unabomber, you name it.
[03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:17.140]  Paul Washingen sent an article pointing out
[03:23:17.140 --> 03:23:20.660]  that Netflix has a hit show about the unabomber, Theodore
[03:23:20.660 --> 03:23:23.420]  Kozinski kind of glorifying him.
[03:23:23.420 --> 03:23:25.140]  And if you say the CIA's involved,
[03:23:25.140 --> 03:23:26.980]  say, oh, get your tinfoil hat, that's
[03:23:26.980 --> 03:23:28.100]  another way to just end debate.
[03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:29.860]  I'm not saying the CIA is doing this.
[03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:34.620]  The CIA is a very diverse, big bureaucratic organization.
[03:23:34.620 --> 03:23:38.220]  But criminal groups use that secrecy to operate.
[03:23:38.220 --> 03:23:44.980]  But if you do think it's Kozinski related as a ode to Kozinski,
[03:23:44.980 --> 03:23:47.260]  as a love letter, as a copycat, then
[03:23:47.260 --> 03:23:52.820]  you've got to bring in the CIA, because Theodore Kozinski
[03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:55.380]  volunteered for the CIA in college
[03:23:55.380 --> 03:23:58.740]  and disappeared into the MKUltra project.
[03:23:58.740 --> 03:24:03.100]  That's on record, LA Times, Associated Press.
[03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:07.420]  And so we're not saying that's the CIA.
[03:24:07.420 --> 03:24:10.140]  We're not saying it's leftists that are doing it.
[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:14.820]  We're saying historically, unless you're
[03:24:14.820 --> 03:24:17.740]  talking about Islamists, it's the same category, cowards.
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:21.780]  It's the left that do most of the bombings.
[03:24:21.780 --> 03:24:23.660]  You can say, well, look what McVeigh did.
[03:24:23.660 --> 03:24:25.900]  I know the names of the feds that carried out the bombing.
[03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:28.220]  I know the names of all the people involved.
[03:24:28.220 --> 03:24:30.260]  It came out in court documents.
[03:24:30.260 --> 03:24:31.900]  I've talked to the cop of the year's family,
[03:24:31.900 --> 03:24:33.820]  and everybody that was tortured to death,
[03:24:33.820 --> 03:24:36.780]  because he saw who did it, wasn't McVeigh.
[03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:40.020]  But look at the weathermen underground
[03:24:40.020 --> 03:24:43.300]  and all the communist groups, and Patty Hearst and on and on.
[03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:44.300]  It's what communists do.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:46.740]  That's what cowards do.
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:49.940]  So I'm not saying that she's done this.
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:51.500]  I'm saying we have a historical fact
[03:24:51.500 --> 03:24:53.020]  from what we've seen in the past.
[03:24:53.020 --> 03:24:58.020]  Now, the fact that we even have something called a deep state
[03:24:58.020 --> 03:25:00.260]  that just means the bureaucracies, the entrenched
[03:25:00.260 --> 03:25:03.420]  unelected bureaucracy, and that interfaces
[03:25:03.420 --> 03:25:06.860]  with the shadow government, which was set up legitimately
[03:25:06.860 --> 03:25:09.380]  for continuity of government during nuclear war,
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:14.460]  asteroid strikes, or other systems that knock out
[03:25:14.460 --> 03:25:18.260]  the legitimate elected government,
[03:25:18.260 --> 03:25:23.460]  you then have a COG that is the shadow government.
[03:25:23.460 --> 03:25:27.500]  And that's the term used in parlance for 50 years.
[03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:30.340]  That then interfaces with the bureaucracy
[03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:33.500]  and the leftist arms of the deep state, which
[03:25:33.500 --> 03:25:36.980]  is pretty much the entire deep state, is leftist by 80%.
[03:25:36.980 --> 03:25:40.940]  And they're now lashing out of America, lashing out of Christians,
[03:25:40.940 --> 03:25:43.580]  lashing out of Trump, lashing out of prosperity.
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:45.060]  Not because they're communist.
[03:25:45.060 --> 03:25:46.540]  They want the average person to be
[03:25:46.540 --> 03:25:50.300]  a slave on a chicken feed diet enough to just barely let
[03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:53.380]  them survive so they can play God.
[03:25:53.380 --> 03:25:58.780]  It's a very beta group of cowardly scum
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:01.540]  directed by a very small, cloistered group of billionaires
[03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:03.820]  and elites that want a monopoly system
[03:26:03.820 --> 03:26:06.100]  so they can have delusions of grandeur
[03:26:06.100 --> 03:26:07.540]  and have a breakaway civilization,
[03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:09.140]  life of citizens and technologies,
[03:26:09.140 --> 03:26:11.540]  and, of course, do what Pinky and the Brain always talks
[03:26:11.540 --> 03:26:14.540]  about, the same thing they always talk about,
[03:26:14.540 --> 03:26:16.380]  ruling the world.
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:18.140]  So that's how this works.
[03:26:18.140 --> 03:26:19.180]  That's the real system.
[03:26:19.180 --> 03:26:21.620]  And they hate me because they sit around and they go,
[03:26:21.620 --> 03:26:23.940]  nobody ever listened to that guy.
[03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:26.900]  He doesn't have a foppish NPR accent.
[03:26:26.900 --> 03:26:28.540]  Boom, they start listening.
[03:26:28.540 --> 03:26:30.940]  Well, what do we do?
[03:26:30.940 --> 03:26:34.180]  Because if they keep listening to him, it's all over.
[03:26:34.180 --> 03:26:39.020]  So here's the morning job flipping out
[03:26:39.020 --> 03:26:42.460]  that people are learning about the deep state.
[03:26:42.460 --> 03:26:45.940]  They sound the alarm, that people
[03:26:45.940 --> 03:26:49.020]  think there's a deep state, and they think the sun comes up
[03:26:49.020 --> 03:26:51.860]  and they think blood, once it's oxygenated, is red,
[03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:55.500]  and, here it is.
[03:26:55.500 --> 03:26:57.540]  In that part, may not have criminal exposure.
[03:26:57.540 --> 03:27:00.020]  Or he could be on to something, attacks
[03:27:00.020 --> 03:27:03.060]  against the so-called deep state by the president
[03:27:03.060 --> 03:27:05.740]  and some Republicans may be taking hold.
[03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:08.820]  More Americans now believe that national policy is being
[03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:12.380]  manipulated or directed by a deep state.
[03:27:12.380 --> 03:27:14.980]  That, according to the newest Monmouth University poll,
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:19.780]  six in 10 Americans believe that unelected or appointed
[03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:22.660]  government officials have too much influence
[03:27:22.660 --> 03:27:24.740]  in determining federal policy.
[03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:27.660]  26% say the right balance of power
[03:27:27.660 --> 03:27:30.980]  exists between elected and unelected officials,
[03:27:30.980 --> 03:27:33.300]  while this view of the deep state looks to be growing
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:34.460]  more prevalent.
[03:27:34.460 --> 03:27:38.540]  Only 13% of Americans are very familiar with the term.
[03:27:38.540 --> 03:27:41.980]  24% are somewhat familiar, and 63%
[03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:43.300]  said they are not familiar.
[03:27:43.300 --> 03:27:46.460]  However, when Monmouth described the term
[03:27:46.460 --> 03:27:49.220]  as, quote, a group of unelected government and military
[03:27:49.220 --> 03:27:52.900]  officials who secretly manipulate or direct
[03:27:52.900 --> 03:27:56.580]  national policy, nearly three in four Americans
[03:27:56.580 --> 03:27:59.740]  said they believe that the deep state exists.
[03:27:59.740 --> 03:28:02.260]  One in five said it does not.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:04.940]  And I think of the Facebook story and Cambridge Analytics
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:07.820]  that we're covering, we'll be doing a lot more on that later.
[03:28:07.820 --> 03:28:11.660]  But Carol Lee, this is real.
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:13.780]  And this president may be on to something,
[03:28:13.780 --> 03:28:15.180]  whether it's right or wrong.
[03:28:15.180 --> 03:28:18.020]  This is, I don't think you can look at that any other way
[03:28:18.020 --> 03:28:20.700]  than that it's a direct result of what we've seen the president
[03:28:20.700 --> 03:28:24.500]  try to do, which is so doubt about people
[03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:27.500]  in the administration, whether it's the FBI or the other.
[03:28:27.500 --> 03:28:28.780]  Let's stop right there.
[03:28:28.780 --> 03:28:31.340]  Look, everybody knows there's dug in bureaucracies.
[03:28:31.340 --> 03:28:32.620]  You got Schumer on TV going.
[03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:34.580]  The bureaucracy will take the president on.
[03:28:34.580 --> 03:28:37.140]  You got Mudd saying it's going to kill him.
[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:39.340]  You better threatening everybody.
[03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:40.940]  You idiots can't have it both ways.
[03:28:40.940 --> 03:28:44.300]  You declared a war on America, and now America
[03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:46.180]  has declared war on you.
[03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:47.860]  So let's go.
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:49.140]  Let's bang heads.
[03:28:49.140 --> 03:28:50.020]  Let's do it.

[03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:58.260]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:29:58.260 --> 03:29:59.980]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:29:59.980 --> 03:30:02.180]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[03:30:02.180 --> 03:30:04.100]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:30:04.100 --> 03:30:05.100]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:30:05.100 --> 03:30:06.620]  It's because it also funds our operation.
[03:30:06.620 --> 03:30:08.940]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:11.340]  Super male vitality was developed
[03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:14.980]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[03:30:14.980 --> 03:30:17.300]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:30:29.380 --> 03:30:32.700]  harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[03:30:32.700 --> 03:30:34.540]  or maximum potency.
[03:30:34.540 --> 03:30:37.620]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff
[03:30:37.620 --> 03:30:39.940]  just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out.
[03:30:39.940 --> 03:30:42.420]  In my experience, where the stuff that gets your glands
[03:30:42.420 --> 03:30:44.740]  naturally going goes right to the source.

[03:31:06.260 --> 03:31:10.020]  to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:31:10.020 --> 03:31:12.580]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener,
[03:31:12.580 --> 03:31:15.580]  I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:17.860]  Anthroplex, my girlfriend would like to say thanks
[03:31:17.860 --> 03:31:18.860]  for the Anthroplex, too.
[03:31:18.860 --> 03:31:19.860]  Thank you.
[03:31:19.860 --> 03:31:22.380]  I use the Biotruce Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste
[03:31:22.380 --> 03:31:24.860]  for you folks who aren't big, normal toothpaste fans.
[03:31:24.860 --> 03:31:28.020]  The Super Blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex,
[03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:29.700]  for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:30.980]  They are quality.
[03:31:30.980 --> 03:31:33.740]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much
[03:31:33.740 --> 03:31:35.620]  for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:31:35.620 --> 03:31:36.660]  Absolutely.
[03:31:36.660 --> 03:31:39.540]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[03:31:39.540 --> 03:31:42.740]  help our other countrymen and women understand
[03:31:42.740 --> 03:31:44.540]  that there's a bigger problems going on,
[03:31:44.540 --> 03:31:46.900]  and if we can get our houses in order
[03:31:46.900 --> 03:31:48.500]  and be good to each other and ourselves,
[03:31:48.500 --> 03:31:49.700]  we can take our country back.

[03:32:20.420 --> 03:32:23.500]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients,

[03:32:40.140 --> 03:32:43.420]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[03:32:43.420 --> 03:32:45.420]  throughout the entire colon

[03:32:57.940 --> 03:33:01.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:01.020 --> 03:33:06.300]  MUSIC
[03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:18.300]  MUSIC
[03:33:18.300 --> 03:33:21.300]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[03:33:21.300 --> 03:33:23.460]  foreign, and domestic.
[03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:25.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.580 --> 03:33:28.020]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:30.060]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:33:30.060 --> 03:33:32.620]  from the InfoWars.com studios.
[03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:37.120]  You know, I was just looking at DrudgeReport.com
[03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:40.780]  and I was looking at just how crazy all the headlines are.
[03:33:40.780 --> 03:33:44.220]  Not from a sensationalist perspective, just because that's what's happening with news.
[03:33:44.220 --> 03:33:48.500]  Austin Grip by Fifth Bombing. Experts look at it being a
[03:33:48.500 --> 03:33:53.900]  unabomber Theodore Kaczynski copycat. And then right next to it,
[03:33:53.900 --> 03:33:57.900]  man faces year in prison for Hitler dog joke.
[03:33:57.900 --> 03:34:04.140]  And then what's even weirder is both articles are ours.
[03:34:04.140 --> 03:34:10.980]  And both articles are true. And it's all unfolding. It's crazy.
[03:34:10.980 --> 03:34:16.060]  Meanwhile, the Hill, McCain rips Trump
[03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:21.620]  for congratulating Putin on his election
[03:34:21.620 --> 03:34:25.980]  as an insult to the Russian people.
[03:34:25.980 --> 03:34:29.380]  And that's the only reason I covered this thing earlier, the whole
[03:34:29.380 --> 03:34:31.500]  Politburo and the rest of it. Let me just do that now.
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:36.620]  No, let me do it next segment because I had a bunch of guests on it. Now I can't find
[03:34:36.620 --> 03:34:41.220]  my stack of Politburo news. I want to show Russia's electoral system versus
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:41.820]  China's.
[03:34:41.820 --> 03:34:45.140]  And just point out that that's not the case.
[03:34:45.140 --> 03:34:49.500]  Russia is not a dictatorship. And that's just because it's a fact.
[03:34:49.500 --> 03:34:55.300]  China is and then our media won't call it a dictatorship.
[03:34:55.300 --> 03:34:57.620]  And it gives me a headache.
[03:34:57.620 --> 03:35:02.380]  You know what else gives me a headache?
[03:35:02.380 --> 03:35:10.580]  Constantly not being able to find my video list. You guys bring me another video
[03:35:10.580 --> 03:35:11.140]  list in here.
[03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:14.020]  Because I want to go over the videos and I was just digging through stuff and
[03:35:14.020 --> 03:35:16.340]  can't find it. Just bring me a video list. Thank you.
[03:35:16.340 --> 03:35:19.260]  I'll tell you what else gives me a headache.
[03:35:19.260 --> 03:35:22.740]  That's people
[03:35:22.740 --> 03:35:26.700]  that continue to say we need free health care. Thank you.
[03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:30.500]  We need free health care just like they got in England
[03:35:30.500 --> 03:35:33.300]  or in Cuba. It works perfectly.
[03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:37.300]  So I get my plastic surgery.
[03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:40.860]  Only thing you get free in England is a sex change
[03:35:40.860 --> 03:35:44.580]  because they want your weenie cut-offs. They don't want to have you have any kids.
[03:35:44.580 --> 03:35:50.500]  Seriously.
[03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:54.180]  I mean, Paul Watson had a cold for like two months. It was about to die and they
[03:35:54.180 --> 03:35:56.420]  wouldn't even let him get antibiotics.
[03:35:56.420 --> 03:35:59.100]  He had to get permission to go to a private doctor for the National Health
[03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.060]  Service.
[03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:03.860]  He has the money. They have a two-tiered system. I might even get into it.
[03:36:03.860 --> 03:36:09.260]  It's like look at Venezuela. Look at Cuba. Look at North Korea. Good Lord.
[03:36:09.260 --> 03:36:13.300]  You know Canadians come here to have their surgeries, right?
[03:36:13.300 --> 03:36:17.060]  And that doesn't mean
[03:36:17.060 --> 03:36:21.660]  we are perfect people.
[03:36:21.660 --> 03:36:23.260]  But compared,
[03:36:23.260 --> 03:36:25.820]  our system is incredible. I know all about it. My dad's been in medical
[03:36:25.820 --> 03:36:26.940]  management my whole life.
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:30.020]  By the way, a little of the crew just Googles what I say
[03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:33.300]  as they find out I'm telling the truth. It sounds crazy. Put that back up please.
[03:36:33.300 --> 03:36:35.220]  Good job finding that so quick.
[03:36:35.220 --> 03:36:38.260]  A lot of states won't pay for a sex change.
[03:36:38.260 --> 03:36:41.540]  You know, it's not because I don't hurt your feelings.
[03:36:41.540 --> 03:36:45.860]  You want to cut your arm off. You know, use a meat cleaver. I shouldn't have to
[03:36:45.860 --> 03:36:47.180]  pay for your medical bills.
[03:36:47.180 --> 03:36:51.140]  Same thing. You want to go have your genitals turned inside out
[03:36:51.140 --> 03:36:55.060]  and all the rest of it and say you're a purple one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple
[03:36:55.060 --> 03:36:56.940]  people eater or whatever you want to be.
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:37:00.020]  That's your life. I'm a libertarian. Yeah, but there's the headline.
[03:37:00.020 --> 03:37:04.140]  So people that can't get free sex changes here,
[03:37:04.140 --> 03:37:06.580]  well where do they go? They go to the UK.
[03:37:06.580 --> 03:37:11.940]  Now how discriminatory is that?
[03:37:11.940 --> 03:37:18.700]  Transgender American Woman 25 who cannot afford gender reassignment surgery
[03:37:18.700 --> 03:37:22.660]  is in the US moving to the UK for free operation.
[03:37:22.660 --> 03:37:26.540]  Because it's a man that says it's a woman, so they even put that up there.
[03:37:26.540 --> 03:37:29.860]  And then they go further. You can't afford it. Well, don't worry.
[03:37:29.860 --> 03:37:33.860]  Tavistock Institute that launched this whole brave new world.
[03:37:33.860 --> 03:37:37.220]  It's going to happen.
[03:37:37.220 --> 03:37:41.540]  Now imagine, and I've watched C-SPAN where they have
[03:37:41.540 --> 03:37:45.420]  Prime Minister's questions on the Parliament.
[03:37:45.420 --> 03:37:49.180]  And I remember watching Tony Blair, and I remember watching John Major,
[03:37:49.180 --> 03:37:52.940]  and I remember watching all these guys get up there.
[03:37:52.940 --> 03:37:57.220]  And they would, they would say, in this area of suffix,
[03:37:57.220 --> 03:38:01.820]  young Billy Johnson waited two years for brain surgery and by then he died.
[03:38:01.820 --> 03:38:06.460]  The surgery was 98% operable in the first six months, but he waited.
[03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:09.220]  And then the Prime Minister said, I understand what you're saying.
[03:38:09.220 --> 03:38:11.780]  Yes, it's too long. We need more funding to get this thing.
[03:38:11.780 --> 03:38:16.340]  And then someone else would get up. I mean, these are real cases by the thousands.
[03:38:16.340 --> 03:38:18.340]  So I'm going to explain this to you.
[03:38:18.340 --> 03:38:24.820]  You are a six-year-old little boy with an operable brain tumor
[03:38:24.820 --> 03:38:27.660]  that they could snip off if it doesn't grow too much bigger.
[03:38:27.660 --> 03:38:33.260]  And you are going to get put six feet in the ground, Jack.
[03:38:33.260 --> 03:38:40.380]  But if you want to go over there and have some abusive, whack-job doctor,
[03:38:40.380 --> 03:38:44.740]  take taxpayer money and chop somebody's genitals, that's what, the left loves it.
[03:38:44.740 --> 03:38:49.180]  Islam's cutting women's genitals off.
[03:38:49.180 --> 03:38:52.620]  And it's cutting, there's just, it's like demon world, man.
[03:38:52.620 --> 03:38:55.180]  It's demon world.
[03:38:55.180 --> 03:38:57.340]  Mutilate yourself, we'll pay for it.
[03:38:57.340 --> 03:38:59.940]  And then if I say you're mutilating yourself, I'm at ya.
[03:38:59.940 --> 03:39:04.580]  Terminally, old boy, and I'd potentially life-saving treatment by NHS
[03:39:04.580 --> 03:39:08.500]  would be given at any US hospital. But let's stop there.
[03:39:08.500 --> 03:39:13.540]  I'm just sick of hearing about how great it is.
[03:39:13.540 --> 03:39:17.460]  I remember sitting there in college, I went two years,
[03:39:17.460 --> 03:39:22.340]  and it was the most dumbed-down dribble in every class, no matter what it was.
[03:39:22.340 --> 03:39:26.420]  They'd go, I have a friend in the foreign service.
[03:39:26.420 --> 03:39:29.780]  Did you know in Cuba, it's always like an American accent, but they try to
[03:39:29.780 --> 03:39:33.140]  anglicize it like NPR.
[03:39:33.140 --> 03:39:37.140]  Did you know that one in ten is a doctor in Cuba?
[03:39:37.140 --> 03:39:41.700]  Education's free, it's incredible, and we're going to have that here.
[03:39:41.700 --> 03:39:44.500]  Now, let me tell you about fundamentally how evil white people are.
[03:39:44.500 --> 03:39:48.580]  Here's an image of a woman in the future. She is brown, she is not white,
[03:39:48.580 --> 03:39:52.580]  she is not black, but one people, and then it was just like, oh my god, in the
[03:39:52.580 --> 03:39:55.620]  next class, it didn't matter. I thought, well, that's the anthropology, or that's
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:39:58.820]  psychology. No, it was the mathematics classes, it was
[03:39:58.820 --> 03:40:03.140]  everything, except for one mathematics class where the
[03:40:03.140 --> 03:40:07.860]  lady was actually from Africa, and she was like, all these
[03:40:07.860 --> 03:40:10.340]  leftists need to actually go to Africa and see what it's like, and all the stuff
[03:40:10.340 --> 03:40:12.420]  you hear at this university, all this leftist stuff.
[03:40:12.420 --> 03:40:15.060]  She's like, I'm not even a conservative, but let me tell you something.
[03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:18.420]  This America-hating crap, all things you hear, it's communism,
[03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:21.940]  and it's what's brought down the country I came from, and all of you that are
[03:40:21.940 --> 03:40:25.540]  leftists, you need to go to Africa before you listen to these people.
[03:40:25.540 --> 03:40:34.660]  And I remember that lady, she was an African,
[03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:42.820]  and she was freaked out. So these universities are mad houses,
[03:40:42.820 --> 03:40:47.300]  they're mad houses, and the more money government puts into healthcare,
[03:40:47.300 --> 03:40:50.820]  it drives down the quality, it drives up the price. That's what it does when
[03:40:50.820 --> 03:40:54.900]  Obama goes, we're going to make everybody buy insurance,
[03:40:54.900 --> 03:41:01.220]  what do you think? The price is triple. Of course it does.
[03:41:01.220 --> 03:41:05.700]  If the government said you've got to buy
[03:41:07.140 --> 03:41:10.900]  X car, what are the sellers of that car going to do? They're going to up the
[03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:16.580]  price. Plus it's going to drive up demand. So
[03:41:16.580 --> 03:41:19.460]  it's the same deal, ladies and gentlemen, you imagine people that are actually
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:21.700]  from Africa, and they get here and it's the best
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:24.900]  little they've ever had, and everybody's running around
[03:41:24.900 --> 03:41:28.020]  bitching and complaining and handing everything, that's why I run to Africans
[03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:31.140]  that are taxi drivers or whatever, or people that
[03:41:31.140 --> 03:41:33.940]  I've met working at a hotel or whatever, they're like, oh I like you Alex, oh I
[03:41:33.940 --> 03:41:37.380]  know what you're saying is right. My family in Nigeria was blown up by
[03:41:37.380 --> 03:41:40.260]  Muslims 10 years ago, my brother was killed, you're right.
[03:41:40.260 --> 03:41:43.380]  God bless President Trump.
[03:41:43.540 --> 03:41:46.900]  And you see spoiled rotten American blacks, spoiled rotten American whites, all
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:50.180]  bitching with their smartphones and fancy jeans and everything. The poorest
[03:41:50.180 --> 03:41:52.260]  persons got more than anybody, most of the country's
[03:41:52.260 --> 03:41:56.900]  bitching and yeah, screw this country, yeah whatever man.
[03:41:56.900 --> 03:42:03.780]  Fascist crap, right wing people, yeah you know white privilege.
[03:42:09.700 --> 03:42:14.420]  Christians failed Africa though, Christians went in there, built industry,
[03:42:14.420 --> 03:42:17.540]  exploited a lot of stuff, but the population exploded because
[03:42:17.540 --> 03:42:22.980]  there was medicine stuff and then now it's out of control.
[03:42:22.980 --> 03:42:25.940]  In Africa's population, depending on what numbers you look at,
[03:42:25.940 --> 03:42:30.180]  like a hundred times what it was 300 years ago.
[03:42:31.780 --> 03:42:34.020]  But
[03:42:35.140 --> 03:42:39.620]  the leaders are corrupt and the people try to come here to get away from that
[03:42:39.620 --> 03:42:43.540]  and the left is waiting, praying on them to get control of them and run their
[03:42:43.540 --> 03:42:47.060]  lives and recreate the hell they came from right here.
[03:42:47.060 --> 03:42:51.540]  Other big clips, other big news, straight ahead, stay with us.
[03:42:53.940 --> 03:42:57.540]  In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product, we're really really
[03:42:57.540 --> 03:43:02.340]  proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber

[03:43:40.260 --> 03:43:43.940]  strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with. It's sold out for

[03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:52.180]  and I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today

[03:43:56.020 --> 03:43:59.780]  fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock in FullWarsStore.com. The first
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:03.060]  shipment of super blue sold out in one week. I thought it would be a six-month
[03:44:03.060 --> 03:44:06.580]  supply for listeners and since then people are beating down our doors
[03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:10.660]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue. Research across the board is
[03:44:10.660 --> 03:44:14.420]  clear. In fact, it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can
[03:44:14.420 --> 03:44:16.900]  enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and
[03:44:16.900 --> 03:44:20.580]  heart attacks. That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health
[03:44:20.580 --> 03:44:24.420]  warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:27.860]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded
[03:44:27.860 --> 03:44:31.140]  with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:44:31.140 --> 03:44:35.060]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to
[03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:38.660]  help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the
[03:44:38.660 --> 03:44:41.860]  ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[03:44:41.860 --> 03:44:45.540]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[03:44:52.740 --> 03:44:56.420]  gums and teeth. We've taken thousands of years of
[03:44:56.420 --> 03:45:00.580]  known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and
[03:45:00.580 --> 03:45:04.100]  testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to
[03:45:04.100 --> 03:45:07.860]  detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic
[03:45:07.860 --> 03:45:11.620]  metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.620 --> 03:45:16.020]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated
[03:45:16.020 --> 03:45:20.260]  with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer. It is a classical 360
[03:45:20.260 --> 03:45:22.900]  win. This is the formula that I personally have
[03:45:22.900 --> 03:45:26.740]  been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[03:45:26.740 --> 03:45:30.420]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You
[03:45:30.420 --> 03:45:34.020]  owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[03:45:34.020 --> 03:45:38.260]  this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as
[03:45:38.260 --> 03:45:42.980]  focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
[03:45:42.980 --> 03:45:46.500]  reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused
[03:45:46.500 --> 03:45:49.300]  as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together
[03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:52.740]  we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield
[03:45:52.740 --> 03:45:57.700]  and in FullWarsLife.com. They use their media to assassinate real news.
[03:45:57.700 --> 03:46:01.060]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[03:46:01.060 --> 03:46:05.620]  Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[03:46:05.620 --> 03:46:09.220]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[03:46:09.220 --> 03:46:13.060]  and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[03:46:13.060 --> 03:46:16.900]  all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream
[03:46:16.900 --> 03:46:20.260]  racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia
[03:46:20.260 --> 03:46:24.660]  to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[03:46:24.660 --> 03:46:29.060]  bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left
[03:46:29.060 --> 03:46:33.060]  is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[03:46:33.060 --> 03:46:37.220]  and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:37.220 --> 03:46:41.700]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country
[03:46:41.700 --> 03:46:45.780]  and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
[03:46:45.780 --> 03:46:51.380]  with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[03:46:51.380 --> 03:46:55.620]  and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[03:46:57.860 --> 03:47:03.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.620 --> 03:47:15.220]  From the front lines of the Information War
[03:47:15.220 --> 03:47:21.460]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:28.980]  Oh it's tell how I find your faith. He left his living in cheap hotels
[03:47:28.980 --> 03:47:36.900]  the desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold. So the story ends we're told.
[03:47:36.900 --> 03:47:44.020]  I sure need your prayers it's true but save a few we're left it too.
[03:47:44.020 --> 03:47:47.060]  All right I've got some final stories to cover and then
[03:47:47.060 --> 03:47:50.580]  Oh Troyer, Roger Stutt and others take over with the war room always power
[03:47:50.580 --> 03:47:55.060]  packed and informative and remember you know all this stuff.
[03:47:55.060 --> 03:47:59.300]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors are just now willing to wake up and see it.
[03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:02.740]  We're at the critical flashpoint, the turning point, the jump point,
[03:48:02.740 --> 03:48:09.300]  the event horizon, the crossroads, the fulcrum, the tipping point and so that's
[03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:12.660]  why we need you more than ever to spread the word so we're not
[03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:16.980]  under the globalist dominion. Much of this for us is not even intellectual
[03:48:16.980 --> 03:48:20.660]  anymore we've won that fight we know the facts it's now just about pushing the
[03:48:20.660 --> 03:48:24.180]  info not bullying not doing like the left does but just
[03:48:24.180 --> 03:48:28.980]  putting out the truth and not bowing to their evil.
[03:48:30.260 --> 03:48:34.180]  They claim data mining was invented in 2013
[03:48:34.180 --> 03:48:40.100]  by a guy with pink hair because he worked and is a whistleblower out of this
[03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:46.260]  analytics deal out in the UK and the big crime was that Facebook just let
[03:48:46.260 --> 03:48:50.100]  conservative groups get in there and organize that's all been shut down now
[03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:52.660]  but they're trying to teach you that that's all that goes on and that it was
[03:48:52.660 --> 03:48:56.260]  just invented there because they think you're more on
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:48:59.460]  utterly horrifying ex-Facebook insiders's
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:49:04.740]  cover data harvesting was it Chinese communist harvesting organs is that
[03:49:04.740 --> 03:49:10.500]  bad oh no of course not no i mean i mean cover data open source
[03:49:10.500 --> 03:49:15.140]  harvesting was routine it must be banned off the big
[03:49:15.140 --> 03:49:18.420]  giants any communication any talking to anyone
[03:49:18.420 --> 03:49:21.620]  any organizing by anybody but the Facebook
[03:49:21.620 --> 03:49:24.500]  that the former head of the Obama campaign says that they owned and
[03:49:24.500 --> 03:49:30.260]  controlled it says you can't allow it you understand me
[03:49:30.260 --> 03:49:36.420]  they think you're so stupid you don't get it now continuing people are ready to
[03:49:36.420 --> 03:49:40.420]  buy some guns in the world's murder capital
[03:49:40.420 --> 03:49:45.140]  Bloomberg has a big detail report about how they have the highest crime rate in
[03:49:45.140 --> 03:49:49.700]  the world even over Mexico and it's because they have a total
[03:49:49.700 --> 03:49:54.340]  zero no-gun policy for over 50 years and now the leading
[03:49:54.340 --> 03:49:57.380]  candidate to be president
[03:49:57.380 --> 03:50:01.380]  is saying it's time to arm the law-abiding citizens he says the police
[03:50:01.380 --> 03:50:04.180]  have become corrupt they work with the gangs that's why everything's he
[03:50:04.180 --> 03:50:06.980]  stabilized and it's time to do it they need a second
[03:50:06.980 --> 03:50:10.500]  amendment in brazil as well and i mentioned countries that are waking
[03:50:10.500 --> 03:50:13.460]  up because i follow it i'll throw brazil in
[03:50:13.460 --> 03:50:16.740]  because it's it's it's it's got a huge libertarian movement
[03:50:16.740 --> 03:50:20.260]  they understand what's going on smart people a lot of resources
[03:50:20.260 --> 03:50:23.860]  really cool culture but they've got no second amendment
[03:50:23.860 --> 03:50:26.340]  and if you don't have that you're gonna have gangs and government ruling you
[03:50:26.340 --> 03:50:29.620]  just like mexico i mean it's an absolute fact that of mexico
[03:50:29.620 --> 03:50:32.420]  but without a second amendment from the beginning it'd be just like the u.s
[03:50:32.420 --> 03:50:36.180]  same thing with brazil venezuela had one argentina kind of had one that went
[03:50:36.180 --> 03:50:38.980]  away the whole the money went it's like opening a
[03:50:38.980 --> 03:50:42.260]  space store a bulkhead in space a portal and like
[03:50:42.260 --> 03:50:47.380]  the oxygen just went out well wow this really doesn't work too well
[03:50:47.380 --> 03:50:51.220]  he wants to make it a citizen's right civilian gun ownership
[03:50:51.220 --> 03:50:54.740]  goes into gun control and they talk about the
[03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:59.140]  overwhelming global tendency towards more restrictions of gun owners
[03:50:59.140 --> 03:51:05.620]  and how it's uh you know wrong so it's very very exciting in the world's
[03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:10.420]  most murderous country gun control is starting to lose its appeal
[03:51:10.420 --> 03:51:14.100]  desperate brazilians are wondering whether they'd be better off armed given
[03:51:14.100 --> 03:51:17.380]  that around 60 000 other compatriots are killed each year
[03:51:17.380 --> 03:51:21.060]  poll shows support for gun ownership gaining ground in an election year
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:24.660]  politicians are paying attention one of the candidates leading the field of
[03:51:24.660 --> 03:51:30.340]  uh october 2018 presidential election hard-line conservative that means he's
[03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:35.140]  right if not so don'ts jar he's pronounced us right
[03:51:35.140 --> 03:51:41.460]  is that hair j i r jair bol sonardo how do you say that i can't even speak
[03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:47.220]  english hardly okay uh has uh promised to allow
[03:51:47.220 --> 03:51:51.060]  law abiding sentences to arm themselves a popular pledge the nation
[03:51:51.060 --> 03:51:55.540]  with by far the most homicides and he goes into very
[03:51:55.540 --> 03:52:02.020]  strict gun control so there you go boom uh let's continue on here ladies and
[03:52:02.020 --> 03:52:07.060]  gentlemen californians fed up with housing
[03:52:07.060 --> 03:52:10.900]  costs and taxes are fleeing the state at record numbers
[03:52:10.900 --> 03:52:14.420]  but see it's like a space door it's like a bulkhead use the same analogy
[03:52:14.420 --> 03:52:18.180]  you open it and the whole spaceship floods out into space
[03:52:18.180 --> 03:52:23.380]  and that's how to see nbc and it goes into the fact that when they come to
[03:52:23.380 --> 03:52:28.500]  texas god love them you got a family they
[03:52:28.500 --> 03:52:31.780]  walk up and say it's weird give your wife it'll be white people doing this by
[03:52:31.780 --> 03:52:34.180]  way they're the weird mental patient minders
[03:52:34.180 --> 03:52:37.380]  i think they're virtue signaling you know through the crowds of
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:40.900]  majority minorities who don't even listen to them in california they're just
[03:52:40.900 --> 03:52:46.260]  there to try to live in america and it's bad if you've got a truck
[03:52:46.260 --> 03:52:49.380]  it's bad if you've got a big car it's bad if you're a conservative
[03:52:49.380 --> 03:52:52.100]  if you've got a trump hat on they hit you in the head with a bike lock i mean
[03:52:52.100 --> 03:52:55.460]  they are fruit cakes you know if i was leaving
[03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:57.700]  something because i didn't like it i wouldn't come
[03:52:57.700 --> 03:53:01.300]  recreate it not a crazy girlfriend or something you know that
[03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:05.460]  say hurt herself uh you know i would not see her anymore and that i would get
[03:53:05.460 --> 03:53:09.220]  another girlfriend that hurt herself
[03:53:09.220 --> 03:53:12.900]  and it just goes into the massive massive record exodus
[03:53:12.900 --> 03:53:17.060]  millions and millions are pouring out and so california's answer is to flood
[03:53:17.060 --> 03:53:21.620]  even more people in who don't have skills
[03:53:21.620 --> 03:53:27.060]  and then it just goes into outbound migration
[03:53:27.060 --> 03:53:30.180]  it gets into the housing problem it gets into
[03:53:30.180 --> 03:53:33.700]  um just the fact that uh it expensive rents
[03:53:33.700 --> 03:53:37.540]  you know welcome to feudalism middle class leaving that that's the critical
[03:53:37.540 --> 03:53:40.820]  part internal revenue service data would appear to show that the middle
[03:53:40.820 --> 03:53:44.180]  class and middle age residents are the ones leaving
[03:53:44.180 --> 03:53:48.180]  hot california is going to just totally implode
[03:53:48.180 --> 03:53:52.100]  a presidential fellow in urban features at chatman university in orange
[03:53:52.100 --> 03:53:55.860]  california we know the actual net migration out of california has been
[03:53:55.860 --> 03:53:59.700]  growing and it just goes on highest taxes in the usa
[03:53:59.700 --> 03:54:02.980]  well i thought that was a good thing
[03:54:03.540 --> 03:54:07.380]  meanwhile the democrats have always been race based since they read the uh
[03:54:07.380 --> 03:54:11.860]  since they ran the kkk and since they lost the first civil war
[03:54:11.860 --> 03:54:14.820]  and so we'll play a clip of demographics with tether carlsson
[03:54:14.820 --> 03:54:18.580]  so they've bet that they can get as many downtrodden third world populations in
[03:54:18.580 --> 03:54:22.020]  here put a chip on their shoulder in high school and college
[03:54:22.020 --> 03:54:25.860]  get them into the democratic party cult keep them poor so they stay disadvantaged
[03:54:25.860 --> 03:54:31.060]  disenfranchised as a permanent underclass and then make it race-based
[03:54:31.060 --> 03:54:35.300]  to then have race-based blocks of voting so people don't vote for second
[03:54:35.300 --> 03:54:37.780]  amendment free market things for themselves
[03:54:37.780 --> 03:54:41.060]  they vote along skin color thus robbing themselves
[03:54:41.060 --> 03:54:45.060]  of actually smartly voting in coalitions with white people you name it for
[03:54:45.060 --> 03:54:48.980]  free market because we don't want to be venezuela or russia or china
[03:54:48.980 --> 03:54:52.100]  see so they just want you to show your birthright
[03:54:52.100 --> 03:54:56.420]  on racism and they think they're betting on minorities being racist
[03:54:56.420 --> 03:54:59.140]  so far it's not delivered like they thought but
[03:54:59.140 --> 03:55:02.580]  they just think get enough in it will so let's play that clip from tucker
[03:55:02.580 --> 03:55:07.700]  carlsson on the demographics a recent piece in national geographic tells you
[03:55:07.700 --> 03:55:10.500]  a lot about demographics in america and about how
[03:55:10.500 --> 03:55:15.220]  bewilderingly fast they're changing without any real public debate on the
[03:55:15.220 --> 03:55:18.020]  subject the magazine profiles a small coal mining
[03:55:18.020 --> 03:55:22.500]  tent of hazelton pennsylvania in the year 2000 hazelton's population was
[03:55:22.500 --> 03:55:26.180]  2 percent hispanic just 16 years later hazelton
[03:55:26.180 --> 03:55:30.580]  is majority hispanic that's a lot of change people grew up in hazelton
[03:55:30.580 --> 03:55:33.460]  returned to find out they can't communicate with the people who now
[03:55:33.460 --> 03:55:35.700]  live there and that's bewildering for people
[03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:39.460]  that's happening all over the country no nation no societies
[03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:45.460]  ever changed this much this fast now before you start calling anyone bigoted
[03:55:45.460 --> 03:55:48.900]  consider and be honest how would you feel if that happened in your neighborhood
[03:55:48.900 --> 03:55:52.180]  it doesn't matter how nice the immigrants are they probably are nice most
[03:55:52.180 --> 03:55:56.180]  immigrants are nice that's not the point the point is this is more
[03:55:56.180 --> 03:56:00.980]  change than human beings are designed to digest this pace of change makes
[03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:04.100]  societies volatile really volatile just as
[03:56:04.100 --> 03:56:08.500]  ours has become volatile and notice where this change is not happening
[03:56:08.500 --> 03:56:13.140]  any place our leaders live they caused all of this right reckless immigration
[03:56:13.140 --> 03:56:15.780]  policies and yet their own neighborhoods are basically
[03:56:15.780 --> 03:56:20.260]  unchanged you look like it's 1960 no demographic change
[03:56:20.260 --> 03:56:23.860]  at all in their zip codes our leaders are for diversity
[03:56:23.860 --> 03:56:27.220]  just not where they live and then he goes over all the numbers
[03:56:27.220 --> 03:56:31.780]  paul to some of the lepis areas in london are 99% white
[03:56:31.780 --> 03:56:34.980]  and that's i've been around lepis man they do not like brown people i mean i'm
[03:56:34.980 --> 03:56:38.260]  telling you they it's crazy if you know how evil they are
[03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:42.260]  and see that's the thing if you're going to bring in mexico that's fine
[03:56:42.260 --> 03:56:45.540]  indoctrinate folks free will into the free market in america
[03:56:45.540 --> 03:56:50.500]  then don't bring the gangs with them and let them now feed on that subgroup
[03:56:50.500 --> 03:56:53.860]  that the left the democrat sits above the mexican mafia and then they sit above
[03:56:53.860 --> 03:56:57.460]  the mexican and then it goes through that for each demographic
[03:56:57.460 --> 03:57:00.980]  it's incredible and and that's the plan it's a race based system
[03:57:00.980 --> 03:57:04.420]  i don't want that i want it to be a political
[03:57:04.420 --> 03:57:08.420]  economic system cultural system based on ideas
[03:57:08.420 --> 03:57:11.300]  and then it doesn't matter what color you are if we're all in the same team
[03:57:11.300 --> 03:57:14.420]  hey free market really gives us a lot of opportunities it builds a lot of great
[03:57:14.420 --> 03:57:16.020]  things speaking of that i didn't plug this hour
