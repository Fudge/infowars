[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  the Info War.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, February 26, 2023.
[00:22.680 --> 00:27.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from the road and some very, very good things are
[00:27.920 --> 00:32.520]  happening right now, extremely positive that I've talked a lot about and that by studying
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.480]  history and a lot of information that I have foreseen, it is the great awakening versus
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.560]  the great reset.
[00:39.560 --> 00:43.400]  And we just saw a few weeks ago Elon Musk about against the world government at the
[00:43.400 --> 00:45.800]  world government meeting.
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.240]  We have seen countless other prominent people coming out against the new order, major corporations
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.280]  coming out against it, attorney generals all over the U.S. and also major leaders of other
[00:55.280 --> 00:56.280]  countries.
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.120]  Shane, we're not going to invest any of the pension funds in BlackRock if they're promoting
[01:00.120 --> 01:06.560]  open borders and gun control and drag queen pedophile time and carbon taxes.
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.240]  And now there's major moves by attorney generals and state governments, not just here but in
[01:11.240 --> 01:16.720]  other nations, regional leaders to say we're not going to invest pension funds with the
[01:16.720 --> 01:21.960]  big global central banks if they continue to wage war against the nation state.
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.680]  There's thousands of examples of this but humanity is really learning through the NMS.
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.040]  Just 10 years ago, almost no one knew about the new order, 20 years ago, a tiny bit compared
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.440]  to that, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, maybe one tenth of one percent.
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.320]  Now in major polls around the world, the most unpopular groups are the globalist, Hollywood
[01:41.320 --> 01:43.640]  and all the major corporations they control.
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.240]  And then Woody Harrelson guaranteed because I know people that work at Saturday Night Live,
[01:47.240 --> 01:55.880]  I know all about the inner workings of Saturday Night Live and everything they say is heavily
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.080]  scripted, heavily controlled.
[01:58.080 --> 02:01.880]  That's why Dave Chappelle, when he came out and talked about Kanye West and said some
[02:01.880 --> 02:06.320]  things that they didn't like, went off script and they got very upset.
[02:06.320 --> 02:10.000]  Well, he talked about going off script, Woody Harrelson, who I know personally been friends
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.200]  with a long time, I've been talking to him for years, he's done some work together and
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.240]  talked quite a bit in the past, I know he's a basically daily listener.
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.080]  And Woody's a smart cookie, his dad obviously very, very an interesting fellow, he knows
[02:24.080 --> 02:26.280]  all about the deep state.
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.400]  And he came out on Saturday Night Live last night, I'm not going to play the full monologue,
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.560]  the full monologue is on N4s.com, and said, man, I'm thinking of a fictional movie where
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.840]  drug dealers, drug cartels, we're talking about big pharma here, make you buy a drug and make
[02:40.840 --> 02:43.000]  you stay locked in your house to take it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.720]  So again, these are direct attacks, these are glitches in the matrix, these are people
[02:47.720 --> 02:52.200]  across the board, knowing that the new owner is going to destroy them and their families
[02:52.200 --> 02:55.280]  and they don't fight back against it, and we're seeing this intensity all the time,
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.240]  very important club here at us.
[02:57.240 --> 03:04.320]  Okay, so the movie goes like this, the biggest drug cartels in the world get together and
[03:04.320 --> 03:09.480]  buy up all the media and all the politicians and force all the people in the world to stay
[03:09.480 --> 03:15.760]  locked in their homes, and people can only come out if they take the cartels drugs and
[03:15.760 --> 03:18.760]  keep taking them over and over.
[03:18.760 --> 03:26.720]  I threw the script away, I mean, who is going to believe that crazy idea?
[03:26.720 --> 03:32.280]  So I can tell you that I got invited to be in a few movies without really even asking
[03:32.280 --> 03:38.320]  and got to know a lot of Hollywood folks like Woody Harrelson and John Reeves and really
[03:38.320 --> 03:43.040]  many, many others, and they were awake to the New World Order when we were having dinner
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.400]  or hanging out 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 years ago.
[03:47.400 --> 03:51.680]  That's how long I've known those guys, I knew those guys both knew it together.
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.800]  But Robert Downey Jr. was also hanging out, he was a big jerk, thought I was an idiot,
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.800]  but the point is that most of the cast of Scandinarkly was awake to the New World Order
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.480]  and hated the New World Order, was having long discussions with me, I was also a consultant
[04:05.480 --> 04:12.200]  on the film, kind of updating Philip K. Dick's book for the script, and they were really,
[04:12.200 --> 04:13.200]  really awake back then.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.160]  So that's why I know Woody Harrelson is so awake that I know him through Woody Harrelson
[04:16.160 --> 04:19.800]  and some other folks, but it's not about name-dropping, it's about the fact that I knew that Woody
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.880]  Harrelson was awake so long ago, but Hollywood was scared to speak out, those that were awake.
[04:26.880 --> 04:31.560]  And I can tell you the majority of folks who aren't producers and owners in Hollywood hate
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.400]  the New World Order, and now you see all this beginning to come out as people realize
[04:35.400 --> 04:38.480]  they have nothing left to lose, but speak up against the system, that's how to destroy
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.480]  them and their family.
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.560]  Folks, we're going to go to break, we're going to come back and get those very serious infrastructure
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.240]  attacks that are taking place that are confirmed, many of them to be sabotaged and what that
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.680]  leads to, more on Ukraine war and more on Alex Jones, infowars.com, tomorrow's news
[04:51.680 --> 04:52.680]  day.
[04:52.680 --> 05:05.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.960]  book that documents the global to their own words, plan for our future, that is the hellish
[05:09.960 --> 05:10.960]  future.
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.480]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.440]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores,
[05:18.440 --> 05:22.680]  Amazon or infowars.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[05:22.680 --> 05:27.400]  book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them
[05:27.400 --> 05:28.400]  right now.
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.920]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at infowars.com,
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.800]  and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:37.800 --> 05:41.440]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[05:41.440 --> 05:43.360]  that you help keep infowars on the air.
[05:43.360 --> 05:46.920]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[05:46.920 --> 05:52.000]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowars.com and
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.600]  get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library or give them
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.600]  to the local school.
[05:57.600 --> 06:24.480]  This is an Info War, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[06:27.600 --> 06:35.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very, very important special, February 26, 2023, Sunday
[06:35.920 --> 06:37.760]  transmission.
[06:37.760 --> 06:46.480]  I can with great confidence and analysis tell you that we reached another major milestone.
[06:46.480 --> 06:55.160]  It was last January, about 13 and a half months ago, in 2022, that I said studying the topography
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.240]  of the media landscape, not sure in the U.S. but worldwide, and the numbers I'm seeing
[06:59.240 --> 07:03.960]  and the different talk shows I see coming out against COVID lie and the poison shots
[07:03.960 --> 07:09.440]  and big pharma and the lockdowns, that they're going to lose not just their current push
[07:09.440 --> 07:16.240]  for forced injections and worldwide ID cards and capsule societies, they're not just going
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.000]  to lose on their forced injections, they're going to lose on the whole thing if we just
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  keep pushing.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.560]  It's kind of like you get in a fight, a guy starts a fight, he punches you, you hit him
[07:25.560 --> 07:30.080]  really hard, break his nose, knock him down and you kind of wait and see if he gets back
[07:30.080 --> 07:33.680]  up but if he starts getting back up, he's going to kick him in the face a couple times
[07:33.680 --> 07:37.480]  and maybe break a couple of ribs and he'll be out of commission and you can kill him,
[07:37.480 --> 07:43.040]  your family and that's the analogy I'm using a nonviolent way for the new order.
[07:43.040 --> 07:49.800]  About 13 months ago, broke their nose really bad and knocked them down and they are getting
[07:49.800 --> 07:54.360]  back up so politically, nonviolently, we got to move in, get a good kick into the end
[07:54.360 --> 08:00.160]  of the jaw, they keep getting up, got to go ahead and start stomping the ribs and that's
[08:00.160 --> 08:01.280]  just what you got to do.
[08:01.280 --> 08:06.320]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen and we got to press the attack 110% so let
[08:06.320 --> 08:11.240]  me make the new announcement, let me make the big announcement here because I mean it's
[08:11.240 --> 08:14.920]  100% that off.
[08:14.920 --> 08:20.880]  The chain reaction has been achieved not just on the poison shots, not just on the lockdowns,
[08:20.880 --> 08:25.000]  it was their big gamble to use that to get full control of us and only in places like
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.560]  China where they able to get a lot of it done but you know it's usually being as a test,
[08:29.560 --> 08:33.720]  did a whole squeeze again last year and it caused an explosion across the country and
[08:33.720 --> 08:35.720]  he had to back off.
[08:35.720 --> 08:40.640]  So he's being basically told or working with the globalists that China will be the leader
[08:40.640 --> 08:44.040]  of the new world order if he can successfully get his population out of their control but
[08:44.040 --> 08:46.080]  notice he failed that task.
[08:46.080 --> 08:50.720]  So some huge things are going on but let me just quantify how big this is.
[08:50.720 --> 08:55.360]  I'm going to give you some of the evidence over here in a moment.
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.040]  Their agenda was completely hamstring and derailing, pun intended, 13 months ago.
[09:02.040 --> 09:06.440]  So I could say they're not going to recover from this if we keep pushing but we got to
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.920]  see how big the chain reaction is and how much courage people have and how much common
[09:09.920 --> 09:13.720]  sense people have to say hey man the new world order is bad for everybody.
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.280]  Let's all be rebels against charity.
[09:15.280 --> 09:23.480]  Let's have 1776 part two in a velvet revolution of intellectual understanding and renaissance
[09:23.480 --> 09:30.120]  and a new enlightenment, a great awakening or we're doomed but I believe in humanity,
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.320]  I believe in the people, I believe it's going to backfire and I have a lot of inside sources
[09:34.320 --> 09:39.080]  but I mainly just gather and tell them across the corporate media government and the listeners
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.560]  and just thousands of spectrum points every week that I've looked at and analyzed.
[09:43.560 --> 09:44.560]  I don't say this lightly.
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.520]  It would take days to track why I say this but I'll give it to a few points in a moment.
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.760]  But I talk about chain reactions.
[09:50.760 --> 09:54.440]  Now there's chain reactions obviously in chemistry where you mix a couple of chemicals together
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.520]  or three chemicals together and it turns into a whole new thing or it explodes.
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.080]  I mean there's different chain reactions but it's where there's a major change throughout
[10:03.080 --> 10:14.960]  the whole construct of the experiment into a new matter, into a new formation, into a
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.560]  new molecule or into a new chain of structures and I said it looks to me like the chain reaction
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.560]  has been reached.
[10:21.560 --> 10:23.560]  It's definitely a devastating blow.
[10:23.560 --> 10:24.560]  Will they get back up from it?
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.760]  Probably but we've got the offense here, we've got the issue.
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.840]  And what I've seen with thousands of different talk show hosts and major prominent ones
[10:33.840 --> 10:37.880]  and Elon Musk at the world government forum two weeks ago saying world government's bad
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.400]  and we'll collapse human civilization and it's dangerous and we don't need a centralized
[10:42.400 --> 10:44.400]  system.
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.080]  When you see that, that's the message of the world that this group's failing, this group's
[10:48.080 --> 10:51.360]  falling and they bit off way more than they could chew.
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.360]  They were either going to get full power and full control out of the lockdowns they started
[10:56.360 --> 11:00.240]  three years ago or it was going to bite them in the ass.
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.560]  Example, Napoleon was either going to take over all of Europe which he'd done and finally
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.040]  defeat Russia or he was going to get beaten and he failed to beat Russia and he failed.
[11:10.040 --> 11:11.400]  Hitler said I'm going to be better than Napoleon.
[11:11.400 --> 11:16.360]  I'm going to do what Napoleon couldn't and he tried and failed again and I bring in
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.800]  Russia just because it's an example not just because it's the current, the occurrence of
[11:19.800 --> 11:22.640]  what's happened in the past, it's history repeats itself.
[11:22.640 --> 11:29.960]  So there's points like Stalingrad with Hitler where if Hitler doesn't win Stalingrad, Hitler
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.480]  loses the war.
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.600]  Now they lost Stalingrad last January in public opinion and it's totally turning against them
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.280]  and it's radically turning against them where something like 2% of Americans are taking the
[11:43.280 --> 11:49.840]  booster poison shots, they can't give the damn things away so they try to put a big $300
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.720]  hashtag on them thinking well some idiots will think it's expensive, they've got to have
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.720]  it.
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.280]  No, even those people because they've got studied like 15% of people will pay for something
[11:57.280 --> 11:58.920]  that has a big number on them.
[11:58.920 --> 12:03.400]  Even those people didn't buy them, the cheese on the mousetrap.
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.040]  So the chain reaction has been reached and the globalists have a lot of things they can
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.480]  do to counter it but every counter they've got blows up in their face but blows up in
[12:12.480 --> 12:13.480]  our face too.
[12:13.480 --> 12:16.840]  So will they hold this hostage, will they overturn the chessboard, will they release
[12:16.840 --> 12:21.800]  a real bio weapon, will they launch even bigger war, will they have a stock market crash, will
[12:21.800 --> 12:27.000]  they do a fake cyber attack, try to maintain control, yeah they don't tend to give up but
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.880]  I have a look down every permutation of every possible operation they can pull and each
[12:31.880 --> 12:33.680]  one is more devastating to them.
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.240]  They should quit for 20, 30 years, they should pull back, have their money, have their power,
[12:38.240 --> 12:41.840]  back off their propaganda, they still basically own and run the planet but they don't own
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.120]  and totally control you yet and run your body and if they backed off we go back to party
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.840]  and they're watching football and go back to sleep but they're not going to back off.
[12:50.840 --> 12:55.960]  So just like when Hitler was losing in North Africa and losing against England, well if
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.880]  I'm losing against England, if he has a tiny army compared to me and I'm losing against
[12:59.880 --> 13:04.720]  you know in North Africa against the Americans, how about I just go attack the Russians, that's
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.880]  a double down, that's a double down and Hitler's argument was for Barbara Rosa that he launched
[13:10.880 --> 13:14.960]  in 42 was well if I don't stall and hit my rear I got to attack him now.
[13:14.960 --> 13:18.680]  So that's really their attitude is they've got to attack all of us, they've got to enslave
[13:18.680 --> 13:22.120]  all of us because now that we figured out they're attacking us, well we're going to
[13:22.120 --> 13:23.120]  attack them.
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.040]  Well yeah, we're going to politically pull back from you, we're going to stop supporting
[13:26.040 --> 13:29.480]  you, we're going to try to get people elected that oppose you, we don't want to war with
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.440]  you, the cops and the military are just like us, they've been hijacked by you as well.
[13:34.440 --> 13:37.960]  We have no desire to have a Connecticut war with the police and military, that's your
[13:37.960 --> 13:42.360]  only hope, not that we wouldn't defeat them but in the end that would collapse the country
[13:42.360 --> 13:48.680]  and then the globalists win, yeah we defeat the cops and the military ourselves, ourselves,
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.440]  we could go take over the government buildings ourselves and then sit there like idiots.
[13:52.440 --> 13:56.120]  No, the government buildings aren't running things, a small group has hijacked all the
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.840]  agencies and the media by discrediting the media, by exposing the hijacking of government,
[14:00.840 --> 14:04.920]  by exposing the censorship, by exposing the state, by exposing how this is a new type
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.200]  of more sophisticated propaganda information war, we then neutralize their attempts at
[14:10.200 --> 14:17.280]  race war and class war and gay versus straight war and all these diversionary issues, all
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.680]  these culture wars they're using to distract us from the fact it doesn't matter what color
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.040]  you are or where you're from, the new world order is bad for you and bad for your family.
[14:25.040 --> 14:28.680]  So I put calls out personally, made a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of folks,
[14:28.680 --> 14:35.880]  done it here and on there, where I reach out to average people and also elites and say
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.040]  listen do you really want to keep going down this road or could you be like the German
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.480]  general staff in 43, when they figured out Germany is going to lose the war, maybe Germany
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.760]  could hold out for two years, they estimated they were dead on, but man if we could just
[14:46.760 --> 14:50.120]  get rid of Hitler, they'd be a lot better for everybody.
[14:50.120 --> 14:52.720]  There's not one guy we got to kill here and I'm not saying kill anybody, we got to kill
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.880]  an idea of the new order, can't you be like the German general staff, which I think Elon
[14:57.880 --> 15:02.040]  Musk is becoming mad and Joe Roland's coming out full anti-new world order now suddenly
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.040]  knows all about it, I told you knew about it when I first made 25 years ago, super smart,
[15:07.040 --> 15:10.880]  but it's up to the bad guys, they see it's safer now to do it and then now the Woody
[15:10.880 --> 15:17.120]  Harrelson's and everybody else, so it's accelerated, so the joke is Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.680]  and everybody else's Alex Jones, look if you're not Alex Jones, you're simply seeing the perspective
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.800]  I've been seeing, because if you're in a locked room with no windows and I'm outside and I
[15:25.800 --> 15:28.080]  see tanks coming down the street and I'm knocking on your door saying hey come out of those
[15:28.080 --> 15:33.560]  tanks out here, you walk out, you see tanks, you see tanks coming out of here, you don't,
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.120]  oh my god I know it shows now, no you just can see what I'm seeing, so we're talking
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.800]  about the chain reaction that's been reached and how incredible this is, but the bad news
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.280]  is the Empire is going to try to strike back, stay with us, we'll be right back, this cannot
[15:46.280 --> 16:00.280]  be more important.
[16:00.280 --> 16:06.080]  Right now I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.840]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[16:09.840 --> 16:15.760]  and your body and keep us on air, I am humbly, head in hand talking to the viewers and listeners

[16:20.960 --> 16:26.360]  vast vast vast vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTour.com and never

[16:30.280 --> 16:33.840]  you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great and I thank you, but

[17:00.560 --> 17:05.920]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.920]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, when we talk about the crew
[17:10.920 --> 17:16.440]  at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the riders, they really have
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.400]  been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.800]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.040]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.080]  you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.

[17:40.280 --> 17:45.560]  but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products
[17:45.560 --> 17:48.680]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[17:48.680 --> 17:52.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.

[18:07.160 --> 18:10.960]  forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.520]  We can't stay on air without your help and I want to thank you all for your past support
[18:14.520 --> 18:18.200]  and I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTour.com

[20:01.360 --> 20:23.960]  Thank you all for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[20:23.960 --> 20:27.440]  I want you to listen to me very very carefully.
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.880]  I have been blessed by God to have your support, I've been blessed by God to have a great family
[20:31.880 --> 20:37.360]  that educated me on the world work when I was very very young and we have a mission here,
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.360]  all of us together.
[20:38.360 --> 20:42.200]  So when I say these things, again it's not about getting my horn.
[20:42.200 --> 20:47.000]  The fact that I know the enemy so well and just instinctively nine times out of ten and
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.320]  estimate whether they're going to do better than anybody else is a blessing but it's also
[20:50.320 --> 20:53.880]  a curse because they hate my guts, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:53.880 --> 20:59.280]  When they've done major Pentagon investigations, major CIA investigations, major FBI investigations
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.400]  into me trying to figure out what agency or foreign group is telling me what to say and
[21:04.400 --> 21:10.280]  now they know that it's coming from me and they know that I am like the equivalent of
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.560]  their top Pentagon futurist but what I do is I study what the globalists are doing and
[21:14.560 --> 21:17.880]  I'm against them and a lot of you call in or just a smart as I am.
[21:17.880 --> 21:20.440]  We have a lot of really smart people to get it.
[21:20.440 --> 21:22.280]  Most of them watch football or baseball.
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.600]  People watch football or baseball, you know everything about football, everything about
[21:24.600 --> 21:30.800]  baseball, you know how much this player weighs, what he batted here, how this kicker did.
[21:30.800 --> 21:31.800]  I don't do that.
[21:31.800 --> 21:37.240]  I spend my time on the new world order and when I get up here and I tell you that they
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.240]  are in deep trouble and they are mortally wounded and I tell you a chain reaction has
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.600]  been reached where people get, whoa, I'm being screwed.
[21:46.600 --> 21:48.440]  This is a real global group.
[21:48.440 --> 21:53.520]  They're out to get me and if I keep going along with it, I'm an idiot.
[21:53.520 --> 21:55.360]  It's over for them.
[21:55.360 --> 21:59.760]  A lot of people because of honor and because they care, because they're Christian, saw
[21:59.760 --> 22:04.440]  this journey 60, 70 years ago and it was really eating up and there were all these incredible
[22:04.440 --> 22:07.920]  people that came before me and came before you and we talk about them a lot.
[22:07.920 --> 22:13.920]  Some of them are living legends like you ever griffin battling since the early 1960s, battling.
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.920]  Very successful corporate executive that decided to just totally fight for America.
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.480]  He wouldn't be here without him.
[22:19.480 --> 22:25.480]  He wouldn't be here without all the work of the John Burke Society and so many others.
[22:25.480 --> 22:28.200]  I don't have time to get the thinking people that came before us.
[22:28.200 --> 22:29.600]  I want to thank you for all you've done.
[22:29.600 --> 22:34.360]  Just let you realize that in this war with all the fake conspiracies and all the fake
[22:34.360 --> 22:40.520]  corporate media and all the fake identities and all the fake stories and this manipulated
[22:40.520 --> 22:46.000]  fake culture garbage, the new world order and its globalist technocracy plan wants
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.680]  to cut off your resources, get full control of you, put you in a castle society and kill
[22:50.680 --> 22:57.360]  your ass and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are just the high level generals of the big corporate
[22:57.360 --> 23:04.080]  consortiums that are doing this and we are now getting massive deep understanding of
[23:04.080 --> 23:08.800]  people that I've been dreaming about for decades on air where I've said I want to become obsolete.
[23:08.800 --> 23:14.120]  I want to become basically not even needed and we're not there yet because I still have
[23:14.120 --> 23:18.920]  an important work to do but now basically everything I say is not just being listened
[23:18.920 --> 23:22.520]  to by millions of you amazing people that boosted it, got it out there.
[23:22.520 --> 23:27.120]  You got the info to the world leaders, to the intelligence agency, to the people that
[23:27.120 --> 23:33.840]  were compartmentalized and didn't fully realize what was happening and now once those people
[23:33.840 --> 23:41.640]  and ecclesiastical and ecumenical and once they all realize what they've been involved
[23:41.640 --> 23:46.160]  in and how they've been manipulated, now they're not part of this big liberal Star Trek style
[23:46.160 --> 23:49.760]  utopia, the globalist claim to their mid-level people they're building.
[23:49.760 --> 23:55.880]  Once they realize they're not building a utopia, once they realize they're building a dystopia
[23:55.880 --> 23:59.240]  and they have no other choice but to learn about it and to build an alternative to it
[23:59.240 --> 24:03.640]  and to fight it, it's game over for the new world order.
[24:03.640 --> 24:08.520]  Now that said, next segment, I'm going to get into the problems and while they're hitting
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.520]  us with asymmetrical fifth-generational warfare.
[24:13.520 --> 24:14.520]  That's coming up.
[24:14.520 --> 24:18.680]  The first, here's Woody Harrelson, last night on Saturday Night Live, again they normally
[24:18.680 --> 24:23.120]  have approved scripts just like Dave Chappelle, it's going to come out, he went off script
[24:23.120 --> 24:32.720]  where he comes out attacks NBC's top show Saturday Night Live that their main sponsor
[24:32.720 --> 24:33.720]  is Pfizer.
[24:33.720 --> 24:39.440]  Their second largest sponsor is Moderna but despite that, Woody Harrelson got up there,
[24:39.440 --> 24:46.160]  fed them what he was going to say and then live on TV, hit them in the cold opening and
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.520]  that took courage and it took focus and it took will for him to do that and to basically
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.600]  expose how a drug cartel took control of our world, locked us in our houses and tried to
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.800]  make us take the drug that didn't get us high but that destroyed our immune system made
[24:59.800 --> 25:00.800]  us sick.
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.320]  Again, I can't list all the examples, you see them everywhere, I can't even keep track
[25:04.320 --> 25:08.280]  of them all but Elon Musk a week and a half ago, all the changes I'm seeing and talk show
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.440]  host everywhere, leaving liberal and conservative, mainly conservative and populist, not distributed
[25:12.440 --> 25:13.600]  around the world.
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.240]  People are talking about the globalist, about the corporations being anti-free market,
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.080]  about the new world order, about Klaus Schwab, about Bill Gates, I mean I remember two years
[25:22.080 --> 25:29.200]  ago when Joe Rogan's show was on and Bill Gates attacked it and Joe Rogan put a clip
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.420]  out of what I've said, being true with Bill Gates saying yeah, 80% of people take my
[25:33.420 --> 25:39.360]  shot get sick and it had 15, 20 million views last time I checked and millions of comments
[25:39.360 --> 25:45.120]  and 99.9% of them, you'd have to read a thousand comments before you found one for Bill Gates.
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.560]  They are losing ladies and gentlemen and a lot of people are kind of asleep still on
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.200]  the fence but a larger and larger group that's basically a majority now gets what's happening
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.600]  and the new world order can't carry out its operations like that so we haven't won the
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.040]  war yet but we're winning major battles and the chain reaction is here, the only question
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.760]  is how big will the chain reaction be and what comes out of this and how are the globals
[26:10.760 --> 26:11.760]  going to strike back.
[26:11.760 --> 26:13.560]  Here's your short clip of Woody Harrelson.
[26:13.560 --> 26:21.320]  Okay, so the movie goes like this, the biggest drug cartels in the world get together and
[26:21.320 --> 26:26.520]  buy up all the media and all the politicians and force all the people in the world to stay
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.760]  locked in their homes and people can only come out if they take the cartels drugs and
[26:32.760 --> 26:35.760]  keep taking them over and over.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.880]  I threw the script away.
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.560]  I mean who is going to believe that crazy idea?
[26:43.560 --> 26:51.360]  Now I can tell you because I've known Woody Harrelson since 2005, known him well.
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.880]  I call him a decent friend, good friend.
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.200]  I know he listens every day as we told me and I'm not a big pot smoker but I have smoked
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.280]  pot a few times with Harrelson so that's what you do, he's kind of with your hand with
[27:03.280 --> 27:05.280]  the hands you smoke piece by piece.
[27:05.280 --> 27:06.280]  He's a really smart guy.
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.280]  His dad was obviously in the deep state and he knows what he's talking about but the point
[27:10.280 --> 27:14.600]  is why is he suddenly doing this, why is somebody that knows as much as I know about the new
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.520]  old order, why is he suddenly coming out against it because he knows folks and he perfectly
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.480]  came out in the way of oh it's just a fiction movie, a script I would never believe.
[27:25.480 --> 27:29.520]  It's so ridiculous no one would believe it that a big drug cartel of different drug companies
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.240]  get together and lock you in your house and make you take their drug but it's bigger than
[27:34.240 --> 27:35.240]  that.
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.680]  It's the global banks above it that were going to use the tracking of who had that drug
[27:38.680 --> 27:46.400]  and who had been injected with that as the new global IV cashless society central bank
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.600]  digital currency, social credit score, carbon tax, universal basic income and they get this
[27:52.600 --> 27:56.680]  in place, it's game over folks and they're launching it now.
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.600]  So I've always believed in you, I've always believed in humanity, I believe we can win
[28:00.600 --> 28:06.720]  a fight if we know we're in a fight but if you're asleep or in a coma or on a bunch of
[28:06.720 --> 28:09.640]  fentanyl in a ditch and people want to beat you to death or stab you to death, you're
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.200]  going to die but if you're awake culturally, spiritually, healthy, you understand what's
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.400]  going on, you're watching your six and others are watching each other's six, they're not
[28:18.400 --> 28:21.560]  going to get away with this, they're not going to get away with the next thing they pull.
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.360]  Anything they openly push is going to be opposed, they can try to hand out free money, people
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.600]  are not going to take it, people know there's a string attack, they can hand out snow cones
[28:30.600 --> 28:35.600]  in hell, ice water in the Sahara Desert, people aren't going to take it because you know these
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.680]  are bad people, so how are they going to strike back is the question and I think you've already
[28:40.680 --> 28:43.920]  seen the answer, most of you know what I'm saying, but for those that don't, I'll explain
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.360]  it when we come back, infowars.com with the coordinates of freedom, infowars.com, band
[28:48.360 --> 29:00.760]  out videos, share those links now if you want to be part of the victory.
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World is a historic
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.120]  book that documents the globalists and their own words, plan for our future, that is the
[29:09.120 --> 29:10.120]  hellish future.
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.920]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[29:13.920 --> 29:17.880]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores,
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.120]  Amazon or infowars.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.840]  book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[29:26.840 --> 29:32.120]  right now, so get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.600]  infowars.com, and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on

[29:40.680 --> 29:42.760]  know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[29:42.760 --> 29:46.360]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[29:46.360 --> 29:51.480]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowars.com and
[29:51.480 --> 29:56.000]  get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.600]  them to the local school, this is an info war, I'm counting on you and thank you for
[29:59.600 --> 30:00.600]  your support.
[30:00.600 --> 30:05.000]  I just want to talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels and coming
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.800]  under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts
[30:08.800 --> 30:12.880]  and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[30:12.880 --> 30:14.680]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[30:14.680 --> 30:16.520]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[30:16.520 --> 30:21.600]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans, I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.040]  I have infowars to thank for that.
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.600]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was
[30:28.600 --> 30:33.200]  so grateful because you know I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.280]  wars team and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to you know get these types
[30:38.280 --> 30:43.200]  of clips because Alex's whole mentality was you know, go where the story is, go where
[30:43.200 --> 30:48.120]  the mainstream media refuses to, so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just
[30:48.120 --> 30:52.240]  addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people and I really do credit
[30:52.240 --> 31:00.400]  Alex for you know really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[31:00.400 --> 31:05.920]  There is a war for the future happening right now, there is a war that will control my destiny,
[31:05.920 --> 31:10.840]  your destiny, our children's destiny and that war is something that we can win but it takes
[31:10.840 --> 31:13.320]  dedication, it takes commitment.

[33:02.040 --> 33:05.800]  assault on the lies of the new world order.
[33:05.800 --> 33:23.560]  It's Alex Jones leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[33:23.560 --> 33:39.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:39.600 --> 34:09.520]  Now
[34:09.520 --> 34:13.960]  they do a lot of things and they've been pre-programming and hyping out of the
[34:13.960 --> 34:17.800]  Davos group and other UN other corporations, the media, a cyber attack
[34:17.800 --> 34:21.640]  and they've already done a lot of cyber attack tasks and Dole just got shut
[34:21.640 --> 34:26.080]  down and the big pipeline last year on the east coast got shut down for a few
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.280]  days. They claim ransomware and there's some Chinese are doing it, Russians are
[34:30.280 --> 34:36.680]  doing it, but when it comes to the west, the EU, the US, the UK, the Commonwealth
[34:36.680 --> 34:40.760]  countries, they've got way more advanced stuff and backdoors and everything with
[34:40.760 --> 34:44.600]  technologies. You know, the Russians have Mach 9 missiles, the US is Mach 20
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.520]  missiles. You know, the Russians have this capability, we've got capabilities way worse.
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.040]  Well, I think we, the people that run our country, have objected for using the same
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.800]  stuff against us. So what are they going to do? Well, I've been talking about this
[34:55.800 --> 34:58.240]  for a couple years. We were some of the first to talk about infrastructure
[34:58.240 --> 35:01.360]  attacks, you know, that's how they would attack us. I had guessed on many years ago
[35:01.360 --> 35:04.960]  warning about tax on the power grid and tax on all refineries and the rest of it.
[35:04.960 --> 35:10.680]  You see Extinction Rebellion funded actually by British Petroleum and some
[35:10.680 --> 35:14.680]  of the big oil companies attacking oil, attacking infrastructure. I'll explain
[35:14.680 --> 35:17.640]  why in a minute. That sounds counterintuitive that oil companies with
[35:17.640 --> 35:22.240]  funding grimp is attacking cars, attacking trains, attacking roads, and he was
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.200]  caught all over the US derailing trains. The FBI won't even investigate it, but
[35:27.200 --> 35:30.600]  the local police catch him right handed and get swept out of the rug. This has
[35:30.600 --> 35:33.840]  been building, building, building, building and they want to post industrial
[35:33.840 --> 35:37.680]  world because the globalists have with brilliance and fake currency. If they
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.080]  destroy the real infrastructure, that drives up prices, it creates control, it
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.600]  creates hysteria, it creates crime, it creates insecurity, then they can pose and
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.960]  bring in their new digital system and their new technologies as the answer
[35:51.960 --> 35:56.000]  why the old system failed. That's a modern version of Cloward and Piven,
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.200]  collapse the old system to bring in your new system. And so they have unlimited
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.520]  credit and currency. They just have to destroy infrastructure so that you don't
[36:03.520 --> 36:06.640]  have your own business or a company you work for that has its own business or
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.800]  your own farm or your own factory. That's why they're at war with anybody that is
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.400]  a fortune 100. It's a consolidation. So how are they going to attack that?
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.440]  They're going to do it by get 5,000 cuts. And so we talked a lot about
[36:20.440 --> 36:24.480]  infrastructure attacks two weeks ago. The federal government came out same week.
[36:24.480 --> 36:30.120]  Some of the big trade federations for manufacturing and food production all
[36:30.120 --> 36:35.120]  came out. The big federation that deals with the private power lines around the
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.880]  country, that federation came out and said, yeah, we're seeing a massive
[36:39.880 --> 36:44.840]  increase in infrastructure attack. And we know a lot of it is deliberate, but we
[36:44.840 --> 36:48.280]  don't know who's doing it because, again, the Justice Department, even though
[36:48.280 --> 36:51.840]  they're probably running the attacks, Justice Department's not a federal agency
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.640]  now. It's global, it's crime, cabal, it's hijacked it. And in many cases, their
[36:55.640 --> 36:59.240]  agents are doing it. They're operatives, they're cutouts are doing it. But they can
[36:59.240 --> 37:02.440]  also just say attack infrastructure, and they caught antifa a few years ago with
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.600]  all the fires in California right before the 2020 election, that they arrested
[37:06.600 --> 37:10.400]  dozens of them setting fires, but we get swept out of the rug, leftist media would
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.080]  say, oh, no, that's conspiracy theory. It's not antifa. You know, leftists aren't
[37:14.080 --> 37:17.360]  doing it. You know, they caught them, dozens of them in different areas setting
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.960]  the fires and saying, I'm doing it to save Mother Earth. So they're not just being
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.240]  directed by the deep state. They just get the message and go out and do it.
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.040]  Bring down the old system to bring in their new system. The average leftist
[37:28.040 --> 37:30.560]  thinks once things crash, they're going to get a free paycheck and all this great
[37:30.560 --> 37:34.480]  stuff. No, they're going to get put the fever camp or kill. They're just the
[37:34.480 --> 37:37.440]  idiots bringing down the system for the establishment, because the establishment
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.800]  can manage that collapse and manage that crisis as an asymmetrical war against
[37:41.800 --> 37:49.520]  the people. So there have been 1000 plus percentile increases in oil refinery and
[37:49.520 --> 37:54.480]  gas processing center disasters, not just here, but in Australia, in New
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.480]  Zealand, in Europe, in Western Europe, in the UK, in Central America, in South
[37:59.480 --> 38:06.200]  America, in Mexico. And what happened Friday? I looked it up. If I could type
[38:06.200 --> 38:11.880]  this in, number of Pemex disasters, number of Pemex fires. Look up. What percentage
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.680]  of oil does Pemex supply to the U.S.? What supply does refined gasoline does
[38:16.680 --> 38:22.840]  Pemex give the U.S.? Between five and 50% depending on the time. And Mexico,
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.800]  that's state run oil and gas company, has been ramping that production during
[38:27.800 --> 38:34.160]  the Ukraine war in the last year. And so under globalist pressure, they announced
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.760]  about a month ago, they're going to cut production to the United States in 2023,
[38:38.760 --> 38:44.920]  which is now begun. So a lot of people are saying, well, if three Pemex factories
[38:44.920 --> 38:50.760]  on Friday blew up, I mean, blue sky high, just like what you saw, but even bigger,
[38:50.760 --> 38:55.920]  much bigger than Ohio. If two in Mexico, that mainly supply the United States,
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.840]  blue sky high, and then one in Texas, blue sky high, all the same day, you look up
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.720]  Pemex disasters, they don't have one a year on average this big. You'll have a
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.320]  small fire, one thing will blow up, but not, or they'll have one of their drilling
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.840]  facilities blow up. There's a lot of that. So these are big refinery facilities,
[39:12.840 --> 39:19.960]  but boom, blowing sky, brick and high on the same day. That's a message. And a lot
[39:19.960 --> 39:25.720]  of folks will say, well, that's probably the Russians because they're mad because
[39:25.720 --> 39:32.280]  Biden and the globalist blew up the Nord Stream pipeline last year. Did the
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.400]  Russians cut off the Keystone pipeline? Did the Russians shut down more than
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.680]  2000 spurs and sub pipelines and dozens of major pipelines in the last two years
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.520]  or 26 months? No. The globalists did. The new order. Are the Russians banning
[39:47.520 --> 39:50.760]  gasoline cars? Are they banning one motors like California and now Minnesota?
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.520]  No. Who is attacking oil and gas? Who is attacking coal? Who is attacking electrical
[39:56.520 --> 40:01.000]  generation? Who shut down over 3000 coal plants? Obama. Trump put a moratorium on
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.320]  it, but opened no new ones. So you have a major infrastructure attack and you have
[40:08.320 --> 40:11.800]  who stands to gain and who's been behind the previous attacks. I don't know the
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.560]  globalist or the deep states or call them specter or chaos or whatever you
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.440]  want. I don't know if they get it, but they're sure as hell the biggest suspect.
[40:21.440 --> 40:26.240]  If you've got a three-time convicted pedophile on your block and then the
[40:26.240 --> 40:28.920]  police learned that a little kid got kicked out of their backyard and
[40:28.920 --> 40:32.960]  disappeared, where are the police going to go first? They're going to go to the
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.600]  pedophile living three doors down. But regardless, we know that a lot of the
[40:38.600 --> 40:42.800]  infrastructure problems are globalist deep state. Most of them just shut the
[40:42.800 --> 40:47.960]  infrastructure off. And this is exactly how they would attack. Because if they
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.280]  push another poison shot or they do all these agendas they've got, they get
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.440]  exposed. People don't trust anything they call for. But if it's just Biden not
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.840]  having the board patrol and force ship people back, more people come and Biden
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.920]  says come. When I win, rush the border. Immediately surge. Same thing with
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.040]  energy. So the facts are, and I was looking at the numbers earlier, I sent
[41:08.040 --> 41:13.800]  some of the articles to the crew that just two years ago Mexico was
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.880]  supplying about 5% of our oil. It's been as high as 15%. They look on a weekly
[41:18.880 --> 41:26.920]  basis. Hundreds of millions of barrels a month to the United States. And now three
[41:26.920 --> 41:32.960]  of their plants have blown up to a Mexico, two in the US. Ladies and gentlemen, put
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.640]  two and two together and understand the only way the globalist can attack us
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.600]  now is hundreds of food processing plants blowing up, factories blowing up. I
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.720]  mean, it's 10, 15 a day. It's all over the place. And then the word goes out.
[41:46.720 --> 41:52.960]  Just Department isn't enforcing arson inspection. They're not. Notice what
[41:52.960 --> 41:55.840]  Biden did. He cut the amount of IRS agents going after millionaires and
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.240]  billionaires two years ago and said go after you'll make him $40,000. Even
[42:00.240 --> 42:03.920]  only raised 6% of the money. Why would you send almost all your enforcers
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.200]  against working poor instead of against rich people? Because they don't want
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.960]  funds either. They want to hurt their working class. They want to drive you
[42:09.960 --> 42:12.360]  under welfare. They want to drive you on the social credit score. They want to
[42:12.360 --> 42:15.200]  make you give up. They want to make you have to spare. They want crime to
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.960]  explode when you're out of a job. All the numbers, all the statistics, all the
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.240]  x-query show that. So they also have not been doing inspections or
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.240]  investigations or any charges for arson. So these owners of companies get the
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.160]  word. But each state doesn't have to blow them up. Hey, the word is you can just
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.120]  blow this factory up and get the insurance money. The companies do it,
[42:38.120 --> 42:43.640]  wink, wink, and then there's less food and water and energy and everything
[42:43.640 --> 42:46.680]  collapses and goes to hell. There's ways to stop this. We'll talk about when
[42:46.680 --> 43:01.080]  we come back.
[43:01.080 --> 43:05.880]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.680]  info or store.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.680]  empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air. I am humbly,
[43:14.680 --> 43:18.360]  hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you
[43:18.360 --> 43:23.360]  for years and never gone to info or store.com. We know the vast, vast, vast,

[46:00.080 --> 46:04.640]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.400]  Applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[46:08.400 --> 46:12.800]  There is a bulletin from CBS News. President Kennedy has been shot.
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.200]  This is a different kind of war.
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.920]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[46:20.920 --> 46:24.400]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.480]  They took the babies out of incubators and let the children to die on a cold spot.
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.520]  It was almost as if there were a plan in full, if you can.
[46:32.520 --> 46:36.400]  We need you to go into the capital, that is that.
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.120]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract.
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.840]  You guys censored Harvard education doctors. You silenced those voices.
[46:44.840 --> 46:48.560]  What we want to do in Davos is to reset that.
[46:48.560 --> 46:52.960]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the soon as these
[46:52.960 --> 46:59.960]  globalists start going to prison.
[47:01.040 --> 47:08.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:08.040 --> 47:15.040]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have been listening for decades, many of you,
[47:24.800 --> 47:27.000]  for five, six years, ten years.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.520]  I do not get up here and tell you stuff to make you feel good and I've been accused
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.520]  by corporate media of the years of, oh, Jones just says stuff for money.
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.280]  If you think I went on air on 9-11, when I heard them on the news and said they blew
[47:42.280 --> 47:46.640]  up building 7 and set it for money, you're grave of a mistake and I didn't even think
[47:46.640 --> 47:48.120]  about stuff like that at the time.
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.640]  Now I should think about what I do. I don't bend what I do, but I think, God, what's
[47:50.640 --> 47:52.440]  going to happen when I say this?
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.440]  Back then I saw it happening. I said it.
[47:54.440 --> 47:59.280]  And I was on 170-something stations and I went down to less than 35 stations.
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.560]  I was going to the next rush limbo. They were putting me on 50,000 waters.
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.160]  We were exploding. We were bringing millions of dollars in. I was expanding operation
[48:08.160 --> 48:15.160]  near 2,999, 2,000. The show was huge, getting huge attention and boom, we lost in a month,
[48:17.840 --> 48:20.760]  70 plus percent of our affiliates, but it was the truth.
[48:20.760 --> 48:26.640]  So I kept saying, so I don't get up here and tell you stuff because I think it's what
[48:26.640 --> 48:28.600]  you want to hear. That's what I really think is going on.
[48:28.600 --> 48:31.320]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect. Doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.400]  When I tell you we're winning and the globalists are in trouble, there are only hopes blowing
[48:35.400 --> 48:41.560]  this up, burning that, turning this off. That's their whole neo-feudalistic fascist, great
[48:41.560 --> 48:46.760]  reset plan. They admit that. Post-industrial world, you'll know nothing and like it.
[48:46.760 --> 48:53.760]  And another big example of this is Q. I lost two and a half years ago during the Trump
[48:54.520 --> 49:00.280]  campaign, about a third of our audience. It hurt us worse than the platforming, but I
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.560]  knew the Q thing was fake. I knew the Pope and you know, hadn't seen really been arrested.
[49:04.560 --> 49:11.560]  I knew that, that Tom Hanks, it wasn't running child kidnapping rings on the ground basis.
[49:11.560 --> 49:15.600]  I mean, it was in the WikiLeaks, but the destas were involved in evil stuff. And then there
[49:15.600 --> 49:21.320]  were a bunch of pedophiles. We exposed that, but they created a fake thing that was cartoonized
[49:21.320 --> 49:27.040]  to make all of us that were serious look stupid. And I couldn't shut up. You know, it was like
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.680]  when they said on January 20th that Biden would be arrested on the dais when he was
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.600]  sworn in. And I said, you watch, he won't be arrested. This is fake. Of course, he wasn't
[49:36.600 --> 49:42.240]  arrested. And so many people, we woke up, woke others up who were babies to this. And
[49:42.240 --> 49:45.840]  then they got mad at me thinking, oh, you don't know about the secret White hats and
[49:45.840 --> 49:51.440]  the CIA. You don't know about the Trump administration and what Trump's going to do. And he's invincible
[49:51.440 --> 49:58.240]  and he's with Q when I know who started the Q thing. But I've not said who because they've
[49:58.240 --> 50:04.080]  asked me not to. And I was approached by US intelligence, a group within it. There's a
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.280]  bunch of factions and people that have been high level in the Trump campaign and some
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.520]  mid level and some speech writers and some people that have been in the intelligence.
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.120]  And I said, we saw what you did. They came and visited me in Austin. I saw how he exposed
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.640]  Hillary and the WikiLeaks and the devil worship and how effective it was. And I was true. They
[50:22.640 --> 50:31.440]  said, the problem is you get the blame. You get hurt. But this can be done through 4chan
[50:31.440 --> 50:40.480]  and 8chan. And then we can do it successfully. That only ran a couple months. And then he
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.760]  got taken away and somehow moved by a more powerful element of that and turned into disinformation
[50:45.760 --> 50:50.320]  operation. And I mean, those are real people, folks. Like, I'm a real person on there for
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.040]  28 years. I'm not some nebulous Q thing. And people said, oh, you're just jealous of you.
[50:55.040 --> 51:06.320]  You exposed the new world order. Oh, no, that was, that was people like, very goldwater
[51:06.320 --> 51:11.840]  in the 60s. Wasn't I didn't expose the new world order. Most people living didn't expose
[51:11.840 --> 51:16.240]  the new world order. It was very goldwater. It was John Birkside. It's not about credit.
[51:16.240 --> 51:19.280]  And if the Q thing was real, I would have loved to have gotten on board with it, but
[51:19.280 --> 51:26.080]  it wasn't. And all that fantasy land crap and people so delusional was America strong and America's
[51:26.080 --> 51:31.280]  good and America could never be evil. And there's the government secretly good at saving us. No,
[51:31.280 --> 51:36.960]  the government's hijacked by globalist and criminals. But admitting how much trouble we're in,
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.680]  admitting we've got a problem is the only way we're going to be able to turn that around
[51:41.680 --> 51:47.200]  and assess the real problems we've got. So I was giving you gloom and doom two and a half years
[51:47.200 --> 51:50.560]  ago said they're going to sell the election from Trump. Robert Stone came on, you know,
[51:50.560 --> 51:55.520]  got a guy to run and said, I think Trump's going to lose. He had a lot of heat for that. He told
[51:55.520 --> 51:59.520]  Trump that you're not spending your money in the right places. The RNC stealing it. You're
[51:59.520 --> 52:06.560]  letting the censorship go on. You're going to lose. Is Robert Stone right? Oh, we don't trust him.
[52:06.560 --> 52:12.160]  He's just the confidant of Trump for 45 years and got him to run. He's just a real person that
[52:12.160 --> 52:18.080]  worked for Richard Nixon was his confidant. We don't believe a real person like Roger Stone,
[52:18.080 --> 52:24.160]  even though everything Roger Stone said happened. And Roger Stone told me on here, he said, I think
[52:24.160 --> 52:28.000]  we might have a tiny majority in the house. They're going to steal the Senate and most of the house
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.160]  victories, but at least we'll have a tiny group so that they can leverage McCarthy to do the right
[52:32.160 --> 52:36.960]  thing. All came true. But see, I interview people that actually know what they're talking about.
[52:37.600 --> 52:42.720]  I respect people that actually have a track record of being right 95, 98% of the time.
[52:43.600 --> 52:48.480]  And so I only raised the Q thing because I had a lady today come up to me and talk to me
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.400]  on the street. She said, I apologize. I thought you were bad. I believe the Q thing, but everything
[52:54.400 --> 52:59.520]  it said wasn't true. And I wish I wish I wouldn't have been so mad at you. And I said, it's okay.
[52:59.520 --> 53:03.680]  Just tell folks, Alex Jones is on the air at infoworks.com. And we're talking about the real
[53:03.680 --> 53:09.920]  world, like the massive infrastructure attacks going on by design and the cutting off publicly of
[53:09.920 --> 53:14.880]  our pipelines, the open borders, the fentanyl, the pedophile garbage that evaluates the currencies,
[53:14.880 --> 53:20.720]  87,000 IRS agents to arrest blue collar workers. I mean, that is real.
[53:21.600 --> 53:26.240]  Majorca is opening the border and letting them shift in kids with 10,000s a week.
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.560]  That's what they estimate. Over 10,000 a week, they can smuggle for sex slavery. You name it.
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.800]  That's real. There's the real child kidnapping. There's the real industrial level,
[53:36.800 --> 53:41.760]  trapping your kids, not Q and underground bases. And the special forces are fighting
[53:41.760 --> 53:48.560]  on the underground bases and all this crap. We have to be honest, but when we do have victories
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.360]  and when positive things are happening, and when the world is waking up and when good things
[53:53.360 --> 53:57.920]  are happening and when people are turning against the new world order and Twitter is getting freed
[53:57.920 --> 54:07.120]  up to a great extent, you have to understand that that's what Q claimed it was. But that's public
[54:07.120 --> 54:12.400]  people like Elon Musk. That's public people like Tucker Carlson. That's public people like Joe
[54:12.400 --> 54:18.960]  Rogan. That's public people like Woody Harrelson. That's public people like Roseanne Barr. That's
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.520]  public people. Roseanne Barr hitting up in her hit comedy show and saying they're hitting us with
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.920]  poison shots. The new world order is evil. Don't trust the globalist. And I'm not mad at Roseanne
[54:27.920 --> 54:31.600]  Barr that she bought an IQ. She wanted to believe we were winning. She wanted to believe that we're
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.520]  people like her and the government and there were people and there are people in the government
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.560]  that are good. The government's not our enemy. It's the criminals that have hijacked it at the top.
[54:42.560 --> 54:45.920]  But they wanted you to believe with the tube movement that it was all handled. It was all
[54:45.920 --> 54:49.040]  taken care of. You didn't have to send emails. You didn't have to go demonstrate. You didn't
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.960]  have to follow lawsuits. You didn't have to run for office. You didn't have to do... No, no, no.
[54:52.960 --> 55:01.920]  It's all handled. Just trust the plan. Just trust the plan. And I don't blame General Flynn for
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.520]  trying to get a huge movement of people that believed in this Q thing. That was Flynn knowing
[55:07.520 --> 55:12.400]  good people had created Q. It had been taken away. That was Flynn trying to get Q back.
[55:12.400 --> 55:20.160]  People say, well, why did Flynn support it? I have challenged Flynn to just explain all this
[55:20.160 --> 55:27.040]  and to say he's the new leader of Q because I would follow him if he was Q. He's not Q. Q is
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.800]  something that was taken away from people in the Trump administration. We did not have Trump's
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.320]  authorization to do that. And that's why the stuff up front was so real because it was real.
[55:38.320 --> 55:43.440]  I got taken away just like that. So that's why I want you to know the victories we're having now,
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.480]  you can see them and the world awakening and then backing off the shots and the globalist
[55:48.480 --> 55:52.080]  in trouble. But the problem is they're going to launch wars. They're going to launch cyber attacks.
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.600]  They are going to kind of launch race war. Look, yes, is there a problem of a minority,
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.080]  of a minority of black people going on attacking whites because the liberal media says whites
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.520]  are evil and deserve to be attacked? And is the media covering it up? Yes. And it's 10,000 plus
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.240]  white people here being brutally murdered by black people wrong. Yes. And I'm against it.
[56:13.360 --> 56:17.600]  But as it compared to millions of us being killed by abortion, millions of us being killed by
[56:17.600 --> 56:23.520]  poison shots, all I'm saying is the same reason they showed you all those videos of cops in bad
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.480]  situations and some of them were wrong and some were badly trained and some deserve to go to jail.
[56:28.480 --> 56:33.520]  But they would show you a few cops here and there doing something wrong out of 350 million people
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.280]  in America and a couple hundred thousand cops and say all cops deserve to be shot. All cops deserve
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.480]  to be fired. All cops deserve to be de-platformed because a tiny minority of police made a mistake
[56:44.480 --> 56:51.600]  or did something wrong. And it's the same thing. It's the same thing over and over and over again.
[56:51.600 --> 56:57.280]  They showed you cops doing bad things. So you would then want to overthrow the police and have
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.600]  society break down and have crime everywhere. So things would collapse. It's the same thing.
[57:01.600 --> 57:07.360]  They're showing you footage of black people viciously attacking white people and pushing it
[57:07.360 --> 57:11.200]  and promoting it. And it should be seen and it should be decried. The people that do it should
[57:11.200 --> 57:16.080]  go to jail. But the reason they're showing it to you, corporate media is blocking it. They want
[57:16.080 --> 57:21.600]  to let them know what's going on. But in right-wing circles, Big Tech actually boosted it. Tech
[57:21.600 --> 57:27.520]  and watched it. Big Tech boosted Q to murder us. Big Tech boosted black people attacking whites.
[57:27.520 --> 57:33.280]  Watch me when I talk about it. See, I know how to watch it. Somebody's fighting this form to come
[57:33.280 --> 57:37.280]  back next hour and then talk about the head of the young Turks talking about sex with animals
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.920]  and then attacking me. He wants my cat. I'm not joking. He starts talking about sex with animals
[57:41.920 --> 57:45.920]  and then he wants my cat. I'm not joking. It's coming up. He's looking to deprave minds of these
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.240]  people. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Hour number two.
[57:48.240 --> 57:57.280]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life. And Info Wars for decades has been at the very
[57:57.280 --> 58:02.720]  forefront of the fight for a pro-human future. We can't stay on air without your help. And I want

[59:50.880 --> 59:56.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:56.880 --> 01:00:11.680]  The film White Noise was released on Netflix in September of last year.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:18.880]  It's about a train crashing, exploding, and burning toxic chemicals off into the atmosphere,
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:25.440]  creating a major health hazard for miles around, reflecting what just happened a few weeks ago
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:32.960]  in Ohio. White Noise was even filmed in the same area, just a few miles from ground zero
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:39.920]  in East Palestine. Some people will call this a coincidence, but these days, believing in
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.320]  coincidence can cost you your life. And there is more. Just three months before the train wreck,
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:53.280]  the city of East Palestine began adopting the MyID digital bracelet system into their local
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:01.920]  emergency services. Being touted as the ultimate ID system, MyID is a digital ID company dealing
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.880]  primarily with digital ID bracelets for the medical industry. Bracelets designed to make it easier
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.360]  for first responders to access your medical profile in the event of an unexpected emergency.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.280]  And just a week before the crash, they began handing these bracelets out to all the residents
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:30.160]  of East Palestine. Also, two weeks before the crash, the CDC updated their page on vinyl chloride,
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.680]  removing their section on how it affects children and raising the safe exposure threshold.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:43.600]  Neil Donald Walsh wrote, There are no coincidences in the universe, only convergences of will,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:50.800]  intent, and experience. Not only does the Ohio train crash appear to be a deliberate attack,
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:57.040]  it appears to potentially be a very deadly attack. Three days after the train wreck,
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:05.040]  authorities called for a controlled release burn, controlled in that they would initiate the spark
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.800]  that will burn all the chemicals and cargo together in a massive chemical fire, potentially
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:18.400]  putting millions of people's lives at risk. The vinyl chloride spill at Camp Lejeune was small
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.320]  in comparison to what happened this month in Ohio, but it still poisoned over a million people,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:31.600]  and it took decades for the effects to materialize. A new federal lawsuit against Norfolk Southern
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:39.360]  alleges that 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride was spilled into the local environment. The vinyl
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:47.200]  chloride metabolite chloroethylene oxide attacks human DNA and can take years to start showing up
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:55.520]  as cancers and other disease. There is arguably no safe dose for exposure. Leading expert in the
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.560]  study of vinyl chloride, Dr. Julianne Baier agrees and says that nobody should be drinking the local
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.760]  water. According to Dr. Baier, vinyl chloride gets transported into homes via the groundwater.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.480]  She says it comes out of the water, into the air, and that's really the major route of toxicity
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.040]  for the liver. It comes through the air. While some argue that burning it resolved these issues,
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:31.040]  that seems to be false. Dioxins are the deadly toxins behind Agent Orange and DDT. They are
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:39.120]  generated when chlorinated chemicals like vinyl chloride burn. In fact, the exact reaction that
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.400]  happened in East Palestine when they decided to burn vinyl chloride and PVC pellets together
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:53.760]  was arguably the most efficient and deadly way of dispersing dioxins into the environment and
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.400]  could equate to being one of the biggest chemical weapons attacks in history. Some are saying that
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.560]  tens of millions of lives could now be at risk and that number will keep growing so long as
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:14.480]  humanity dismisses these attacks as coincidence and continues to do nothing. Reporting for Infowars,
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:24.480]  this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:46.160]  All right, folks. We're going to come right back with T Intel straight ahead on this live
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.640]  Sunday night edition. Please stay with us. Remember, you are the resistance. I didn't hide. You're the
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.280]  resistance. You blew the Death Star. You heard the new world order. We're going to win together. Stay with us.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:07.440]  Infowars, tomorrow's news. Today, this is their big move. So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.960]  address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.960]  president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:30.560]  autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:37.280]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:43.280]  businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.400]  say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.640]  World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.320]  And we say no to your war.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:13.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:24.160]  front lines of the Info War. And we are back on this live Sunday, the 26th of February, 2023
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.920]  transmission on your host Alex Jones. Christy Lee and Owen Shroyer are coming up in Sunday live.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.320]  Oh, it'll be because he will be coming up here in the next segment. But again, I cannot
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.280]  overstate to you because we cover so many negatives. We put out what the globalists are doing.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.680]  The people are aware of us. People understand how it works. But we've got to also take time to say,
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.080]  wow, we're really having some major victories here today. Now that said, the enemy's tactic
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.400]  there is not just to blow up our infrastructure and shut it off and deindustrialize the western
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:00.080]  worlds of the left and make us all poor and control us. And so the third world can't aspire
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.360]  to prosperity in the American idea of freedom and the Renaissance and the Great Awakening.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:09.920]  That's their counter is the great reset, the industrialization, total control. But we have
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:17.520]  to understand the Alex Joneses of the world and the Tucker Carlson's of the world. And I find no
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:24.320]  fault with that man. He's incredible. And now even more and more Elon Musk, but the Woody
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.880]  Harrelson's of the world, the Roseanne Bartels of the world, when they come out and put it all on
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:35.200]  the line and put their wavos on the table, their eggs on the table, you've got to then realize
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.280]  that and champion them and understand they're going to be under attack. Because when they come
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.200]  out and tell the truth, when I come out and tell the truth, if I believe in you, you've got to
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:48.000]  believe in them. Even if Elon Musk is a perfect, I don't even trust him. The point is he's going
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.240]  in the right direction and he thinks humanity's going in the direction against the world order.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.440]  So he's flipping sides because we're winning. George Washington in the six year war,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:05.760]  he started in 1776 to found this country, kicked off on July 4th, 1776, lost the first five years,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:12.320]  every battle, except for Trenton, New Jersey, this sneak attack on the Russians and Germans.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.520]  But he persevered and at the end, one of our top generals, Benedict Arnold,
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.960]  flipped to the British the last year, thinking that America was going to lose, but he failed.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.640]  So we need to look for their generals to flip to us. And when they flip to us,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.480]  we don't trust them, we watch them, we track what they're doing. But as they do more and more,
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.240]  as they fight the new world order, we give them more and more support. This is a war,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.280]  you've got to study how wars work. Now that said, one of the most disgusting groups out there
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.120]  that's called me the worst person in the world that's on the George Soros payroll on record
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.120]  is the young turds and Sink, Uygur or Harribe pronounced his name. They're named after the
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:09:01.360]  Armenian genocide, Gestapo or Hitler Youth of Turkey. He constantly attacks me, constantly
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.080]  lies about me, constantly twist things. But he's also made was our statements in the past about
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.000]  if he was the dictator of the world, he would legalize sex with animals to pleasure them.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.240]  And I'm not going to make a claim like that without playing the clip. But this is the guy,
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.640]  and I can't play the whole hour long show. In fact, I couldn't bring myself to watch it. I made
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.160]  the crew watch it. But they said stuff on their life. We should take his children. We should
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:32.640]  take his dog and his cat. We should destroy Alex Jones. That's all they've got is picking out the
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:39.040]  leaders of the resistance and then saying, no holds barred, destroy them, sue them, find them in
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.360]  default. Don't give them a jury trial. Tell the jury they're already guilty. Don't let the jury
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.040]  decide whether they're guilty. This is the type of beta test they're doing for info. So when you
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.520]  support us and you spread the word and you pray for us, and you buy the products in 4.com, it
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:59.920]  allows us to stand against the enemy in this key fight. Look, I could bow out now and know that
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.520]  I've given them some good looks. But man, our best work I know is to come. Thanks to glory to God.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.720]  So here's it. Again, I don't even want to play four minutes. That's how long it is.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.160]  Here is St. Juger saying he wants to legalize sexual animals a pleasure. And then the same guy
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.000]  then attacking me and saying all these horrible things about coming to show. And it really did
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.040]  happen last Wednesday, last Thursday. I'm in a bankruptcy. Corporate bankruptcy for free speech
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.440]  to reorganize, personal bankruptcy to show them how all these hidden tens of millions, hundreds
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.520]  of millions of small lives. And so the Justice Department can get involved if they want. And
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.400]  they have gotten involved. And I've already had some hearings with them. And so they said be 30
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.200]  minutes long, three hours long. That's why I went on the first hour of the show, started at 9am,
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.320]  went from 9am to noon. And that was Thursday. And they get bringing up my cat asking how much
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:58.480]  it was worth. And I'm not into a fancy breed stuff. I'm not even a cat guy. But my daughter,
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.720]  when she was three, wanted a cat. I thought, okay, let me Google. And it was true, actually,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.160]  Google said that isn't controlled yet. He could go like great answers. Now it doesn't.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.760]  What is the smartest cat? What is the most dog like cat? And all of them came up ragdolls. And
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.120]  then Joe Rogan, a friend of mine, has ragdolls for many years. His wife's been a ragdoll person
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:23.280]  one of my decades. He said, no, they're amazing cats. They're incredible. And I say I'm a dog guy.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:30.000]  But man, this cat is incredible. And he's amazing. My name's Mooshu, my daughter named him. He's not
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.400]  named after the Disney character from Mulan, but she just named him Mooshu. She liked that word.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.160]  He's got a blanket. She calls Wiggly. She just comes up with funny names. And like you said,
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.800]  blanket, she has a blanket she loves. She sleeps with all Wiggly. She named the cat Mooshu.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.040]  So if you can name the cat, we don't know her name is Mooshu. And so they want their,
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.040]  I must say the Sandy Good family's want Mooshu. I'm saying the Justice Department just wants
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.160]  to harass me and bring up the cat. So this was the young turds response to that. Just to show
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.160]  that they have no limit. They want to be over the top here at us. I believe that I am going,
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.760]  I, if I were the rule, the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.080]  be shallity where you are giving.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.160]  So I hope they take everything from him. And so this guy, I mean, get a little of this guy.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.240]  He's like, well, oh my God, I can't believe they're trying to take all my stuff. I mean,
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.840]  I've got no money left. I don't know what they're trying to take. They're trying to take my cat.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.280]  But I got to spend $100,000 a month. I mean, that's a bare minimum.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.400]  Really? $100,000 a month. Let's think about it guys. That's post taxes, right?
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.440]  So that's 1.2 million post taxes per year. That means tax pre taxes. He's making two,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.360]  two and a half million that he's saying it's just a bare minimum for the upkeep of his goddamn cat
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.520]  and other things, right? And so, and he's like, this is next level.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:13:04.800]  Plus, back it up. I'll play some of the next segment we're going in. Do you understand if you read the bankruptcy filings, I'm paying $100,000 a month in lawyer's fees.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.600]  We've told the court we can't pay these. The court believed early on that I have hundreds of millions of dollars. Now they know that's not true.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:18.160]  Because of the fake filings that the other side put in. That I made $60 million in 2021. Total lie.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.680]  Total lie. Made like less than a million and a half dollars, which was paid to lawyers.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.800]  I am living on like $20,000 a month. I'm living great. I don't need a bunch of money.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.280]  I don't care. I got a car, I got a house. I don't care about that. The trees all fall in my house.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.800]  You've got to pay $10,000. I haven't cut up during the, during the ice storm. That's a problem.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:43.520]  But the point is, is that they know the judge ruled that I'm supposed to pay 40% of free speech legal fees.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:50.160]  Dozens of lawsuits, multiple bankruptcies. And then the court has appointed two different outside groups.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.000]  That are paid $400,000 to $600,000 respectively, just during the bankruptcy for auditing me.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.800]  So I'm not just audited by the outside groups that I come that audit me, not normal bankruptcy.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.800]  I'm being audited by the, by the justice department that does it separately and then by two other groups.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.800]  So four groups, the private group I hired to do it was highly respected, the justice department,
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.960]  and then two other groups. So that's where the money's going. So I want to pay that to them.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.040]  Well, it's a war to keep us on air. It's, it's not a problem. That's why you buy the product,
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.000]  you support us. So we put the budget. Well, here's what my legal fees are. And we're filing new stuff
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.920]  telling the judge, Hey, Mr. Jones, he's more money. He's fighting multiple appeals. He's fighting
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.920]  involved in multiple bankruptcies. And then they sit there with these headlines, Jones makes $100,000
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.680]  a month. Well, I mean, Tucker Hurlson makes, you know, $500,000 a month. If I was, that'd be great.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.120]  But I'm not, it's all eyes, ladies and gentlemen. I'm trying to make money, making you take a
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.000]  Moderna or a Pfizer shot. Am I trying to enslave you? And am I trying to drag me in storytime
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.840]  with your kids? Am I trying to ship fentanyl in? Am I putting borders? But the point is,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.240]  is I never did all this for money. I did this to fight the world order, but I built an infrastructure.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.080]  And then as we get bigger and bigger and attacked, you need money to take Trump. He's got hundreds of
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.280]  lawsuits against him. Reportedly, he spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.840]  just the last two years as he was kicked out of office through fraud on these. And he has billions
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.560]  they want from him in multiple billion dollar lawsuits for challenging election fraud.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.920]  So no, I'm not Rupert Murdoch, folks. I don't have millions of dollars. So go to infoworkstore.com
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.720]  by the products. It's back at stock, prebiotic fibers, subgroup, your whole body, infoworkstore.com.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.480]  But I want to finish this when we come back, then I'm sure he's going to come in. But this,
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.520]  and Christie Lee as well, but this is just insane how they misrepresent to you and how they lie to
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.640]  you in between talking about how he wants to legalize pleasuring animals. He was dictator of
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.520]  the world. First thing, don't cure hunger. First thing, don't stop war. No, pleasure.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.520]  Animals. A dude that wants to pleasure animals.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.520]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.280]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.920]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.680]  What we want to do in Davos is to reset button.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:17:04.240]  As soon as we start exposing the great preset, it's hard to believe that we're already going into March
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.680]  2023 and the world is an insane place. World War three has already started.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.120]  Biden is a puppet and this is all bring our borders. There's mass censorship.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.200]  James O'Keefe been removed from project Veritas. The list goes on and on of the bad things that
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.360]  are happening. But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.160]  It's away. But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.800]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,

[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.360]  planned for our future, that is the hellish future. Now, you'll be always, while they still allow
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.960]  books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.840]  and the War for the World at bookstores, amazon or infowarstore.com. But you will never be able
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:25.040]  to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.000]  thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.120]  a signed copy at infowarstore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.280]  to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.120]  you'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.240]  have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.360]  haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.240]  donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war, I'm counting on you
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.960]  and thank you for your support. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.080]  Alex Jones.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.640]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the attacks from ABC News, New York Times,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.320]  Washington Post, ABC, The Unturned, it's all don't give money to Alex Jones and we need to
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.880]  sue Tucker Carlson, we need to sue Fox News, we need to shut them down. They want money,
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.480]  they're bad, don't give them money because if people support local businesses and independent
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.720]  media and patriots that are fighting for the future, we're going to win. That's what they want
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.680]  a universal basic income, but they want the social credit score to penalize you for your support
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.880]  of freedom because if you ever just get that, 1% of our incredible listeners ever buy product.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.040]  We've got the numbers, maybe like 10% shared articles and videos. What if 50% of you decided to
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.280]  share articles and videos? What if 2% of you decided to buy products? We could have expanded
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.960]  stuff, we could have more reports, we'd be 24 hours a day live, we'd have everywhere. I want to
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.720]  say something else to my enemies that want to shut me down. I have a great crew, the best crew I've
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.960]  ever had at info wars, they're incredible. We have over 65 employees. If they're able to shut down
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.640]  info wars, I can go and I have some big offers with a crew, do my own show and not be censored
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.800]  and we'll still reach a lot of people, but I'm a loyal to this crew and I don't want the enemy
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:33.200]  to be able to shut us down. So go to info wars.com and realize that the young turds do not want you
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.640]  to spend money with us. We have great products you need. Ultimate bone broth, vitamin mineral
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.840]  fusion, super metal vitality, the great natural healthy brain boost we've got with
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:50.560]  Rain Force Plus and Rain Force Ultra. It's all there at infowarstore.com and they're so mad.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.160]  Rolled that daily about 10 years ago, sued, I got the Clinton library documents. They were
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.960]  suppressing and when they first got in office in 1993, they were obsessed with killing independent
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.000]  conservative media that was putting out VHS tapes exposing the state, the Clintons, the New
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.480]  Lord and they said, if they create an economy of books and films, it's popular in America,
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:19.440]  it will defeat us. We've got to shut it down. Then Fox News started and Limbaugh, they weren't
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.560]  perfect. They were light, but then the hardcore came and now we've taken over the debate and
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.720]  we're winning and they admit that it media matters and toward Soros and their leaked documents and
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.720]  oh my God, Alex Jones is the mainstream. We're going to lose the risky chapter. We got to destroy
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.680]  him, but you saw through the attacks. You saw through the lies and now a guy that fantasizes
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.920]  about being a dictator, so he can pleasure animals. He's named after an Islamic genocide
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.960]  group against Armenian Christians, literally is up there lying about me and then saying he hopes
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:56.080]  I lose everything. Let's finish the club. I hope they take everything from him and so this guy,
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.240]  and we get a little of this guy, he's like, well, oh my God, I can't believe they're trying to take
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.920]  all my stuff. I mean, I've got no money left. I don't know what they're trying to take. They're
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.240]  trying to take my cab, but I got to spend $100,000 a month. I mean, that's a bare minimum.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.320]  Really? $100,000 a month. Let's think about it guys. That's post taxes, right? So that's 1.2
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.520]  million post taxes per year. That means tax pre taxes. He's paying two to two and a half million
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.200]  that he's saying it's just a bare minimum for the upkeep of his goddamn cat and other things,
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:30.240]  right? And so, and he's like, this is next level harassment. I mean, to not let me spend millions
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.520]  of dollars and then have this Mushu or Mr. Bigglesworth or whatever the cat's name is.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:43.040]  How this is next level harassment? I mean, one of the families of the murdered children
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:49.360]  had to move six different times because lunatic Alex Jones fans kept going up to them
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.280]  and threatening them because they knew that they were crisis actors and their kids didn't exist.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.880]  I mean, that is a minor miracle. No one got hurt in that situation. And that's why he owes all this
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.440]  money because he lied and lied and you saw the tapes. I did deep research and all my research
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.400]  and all the facts lead to. And now he says, by the way, in court, if you're an Alex Jones fan,
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.000]  you're a total sucker. He says in court, oh, no, I don't believe that. He blights you. That's his
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.880]  business model, man. And by the way, you know what he lists? This is a hilarious little snippet
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:27.920]  here. When I had to list what he does for a living, Jones listed himself as a media personality and
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:35.520]  dietary supplemental sale supplement sales person. Because that is how he makes his money.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.480]  Yeah, that's not a lie. Yeah, that's. So pause. Yeah.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:45.600]  Hey, pause. My lawyers filled that out. I'm a populist leader that uses media to reach the
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:53.120]  people. So again, listen to these lies. The judges found me guilty and then let the juries here,
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.480]  a bunch of people say whatever they wanted, that I've went and told people to pee on their graves.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:02.640]  No video, no emails, no proof. But this is their model. This is their model, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.400]  It's incredible. And I didn't say, oh, I never believed that. I said, I looked at both sides of
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.640]  it and it was a big debate on the internet. So again, all this representation from a guy that
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.640]  literally, it's kind of creepy. I mean, he wants to pleasure animals as a dictator,
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.560]  and now he wants my cat. Here he is.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.440]  Could have been a little bit more honest. The dietary supplements come in, I think second.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.760]  Number one is the penis pills, I think that he sells. So he's a penis pill salesman.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.480]  That's who he is. Let's hit pause again. Let's hit pause again. You got sink is the big Pfizer
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:41.920]  recipient, I believe, Pfizer money that makes viagra. We have natural herbs that I've taken.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.440]  I've taken both and I believe in working well. I don't really need to help, but it's kind of fun.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.080]  But let's be honest, I'm married here. I'm a man. But again, oh, I'm bad. I'm selling herbs. What
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.280]  does whole foods sell? Let's continue. And a bunch of knuckleheads are going around going, oh,
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.960]  the penis pill salesman did it. A lot of research. And so let's go harass. Hold on. Hit pause again.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.360]  Does the penis pill salesman talk about, hey, what's the pleasure animals?
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.960]  Because I'm not, I'm not selling supernova vitality, which isn't just about sex. It's about
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:17.360]  libido, energy, stamina, great herbs, feeling good, feeling young. But this is this is not for
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:25.280]  animals, brother. The poor parents of kids who were murdered. And now we're going to cry about your
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:34.160]  cat. No, no sympathy for you. None. I hope they take everything, your cat, your dog, your house,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:40.560]  everything. And by the way, the guys also like trying to hide the money in a thousand different
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:47.840]  ways, shoveling it to his parents, et cetera. And they go, oh, my God, my God, what will I do without
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:58.320]  Mr. Bigglesworth? He's $2,000. I believe that I am going, I, if I were the rule, the benevolent
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:08.800]  dictator of the world, I would legalize the shallity where you are giving. You are, you are
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.760]  pleasuring the animal. You see what I'm saying? Okay. Okay. What, what now? Why, why did that
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.480]  happen? It's the dumbest thing. It really is the dumbest thing you said. But I'll tell you why.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.480]  I'll tell you why. Because like, so there's like, was the case that we covered where there was like
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.960]  a guy or a girl or something that was pleasuring a horse. And the horse came to a conclusion,
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:37.280]  right? So who got harmed? You know that people who are, okay, look, not to be a downer. It's the
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.480]  rape of an animal. It's satanic. It's evil. It's sick. But let's talk about my parents. I never
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.960]  really stole the story. My dad was managing over a hundred dental offices 12 years ago.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.040]  And the hardest working man I've ever known in my life, the smartest person I've ever known.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:28:00.240]  And my mother even never even really knew this, but my dad had a heart attack. And he was gonna
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.880]  have heart surgery and Dallas, both of stuff went on. And I said, dad, you've been involved
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.600]  getting stuff approved by the FDA or a great manager. When you come to work with me and set up
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  a supplement company, because I want you to not kill yourself. And he took the job, he did it.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.160]  And I'm not been shoveling money to my parents. My dad owns a supplement company. We send the
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.560]  money to him. He buys the supplements that comes back. And my dad makes like $400,000 a year.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.160]  It's true. He's just making a million dollars a year where he was killing himself. That's true.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:33.680]  Yeah, I saved my dad. You did a great job, by the way. So if you Mr. Have sex with the animals
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.400]  and burn it out, you're damn right. I've worked with my family and my dad did a great job.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:45.520]  He's done a great job. And that's where we're at. And and you people are sick. It's the Justice
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.520]  Department in a meeting asked you about my cat saying they went may want to take my daughter's
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.400]  cat. It's a gift. They know it's my daughter's cat. That's how sick they are. They want to
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.480]  normalize that they want your kids. They want your money. They want your life. They want your
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:08.160]  body. This is their big move. So yeah, you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.760]  United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United States.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:21.440]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:30.960]  They must be opposed. And that's who autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:38.480]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.840]  to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.800]  selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.920]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:08.000]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life. And Info Wars for decades has been at the very forefront

[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:27.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:37.440]  So ladies and gentlemen, I was faced in Connecticut and Texas by weaponized democratic
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.880]  parties and judiciary. So that Austin, Texas and places like Washington, DC and Connecticut are
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.800]  the very worst jurisdictions in the country for weaponized systems. You all know about that.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.120]  Still on air because of your support. You hear how angry they are that we're more popular than ever.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.560]  We're only here because of you. So commit to go to infowarstore.com, buy a great product,

[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.920]  and we have great products you need. But the way they misrepresent everything in the media,
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.480]  the way they attack everything, this cat thing has totally blown up their face. It was the number
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.040]  one story over the weekend, according to a bunch of different systems, Twitter, you name it,
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:27.360]  because people are really understanding what this is really, really, really all about ladies and
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.800]  gentlemen. And they are very, very upset about it. And they understand that this is an attack on
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.320]  you. The attacks on me are an attack on you. They're an attack on us all. And so the bulwark,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.680]  the fight, the main battleground is info wars and their globalist decision is trying to shut us
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:51.600]  down and break our will as a beta test for you and your family. So go to infoorstore.com right now.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.040]  I need, my God, we're barely making it right now, barely beating them, barely getting the funding we
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:03.280]  need. We need more funds. I want to send folks to Bilderberg coming up in May. I want to, or
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.080]  late June, early May, I want to go to the naval script. I want to do what we used to do, but I
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.400]  don't have the funds for that. And so I need the funds to prosecute this war and you're seeing big
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.720]  victory right now. You're seeing everything we've talked about become the main debate, become the
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:25.280]  real discussion, new world order versus humanity, great reset versus the great awakening. It's here
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.680]  and info wars is right at the heart of it because you're at the heart of it. You kept the show on
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.960]  air. You prayed for the show. You spread the word about the show. I see you guys on Instagram and
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.000]  Twitter and Google and everywhere, promoting the links to support them. They're exploding everywhere.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.560]  You're doing it. You get the credit. You get saluted. And it's not about kissing your ass.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.840]  I need you to know you are just as important or more important than I am. Now Owen came in tonight.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.560]  I was just going to do an hour. It's a business and family that needs to go see, but I'll be doing
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.320]  the show throughout the week. But the point is, is that Owen came in here, Christy Lee's coming up
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.840]  next hour, but Owen came in and I'm the whole show prepared so much to cover. But I had so much to
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:10.080]  get to and this announcement that we've really crossed the limicon over a year ago. I told you the
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.400]  shot was defeated and indeed trouble. We had to keep pushing and now the chain reactions happen
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.400]  with all these prominent people coming out against the new world order. This is what victory looks
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.240]  like. It's what victory smells like. But now we've got to press the attack all the way to ensure
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:29.360]  the victory. Owen Troyer, one of the great info wars crew that I love so much that I appreciate
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:36.960]  so much. What do you make of the enemy? So blind, so tone deaf that they are just pushing and pushing.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:43.600]  This cat thing is really blowing up in their face. Well, watching that segment, the new one
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:49.680]  where Cenk Uygur is telling you who he is. And remember it was Anna Navarro on the view, Alex,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:56.080]  not so long ago with pretty much the same diatribe. I want him crushed. I want him annihilated. I want
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.440]  his life destroyed. He must go down. I mean, it just, this is who they are. This is the essence
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:07.200]  of authority. I want him stopped. I want him silenced. I want him shut down. That means you,
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.800]  the American people, when they say me, they see me as you because I am standing for you.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.280]  I mean, you scratch a liberal, you get a fascist real quick. And so it's nice to see,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.760]  it's nice to see the young Turks showing their audience who they really are. It's nice to have
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.120]  the left show us who they really are, Alex. And they try to hide behind all these flags and rainbow
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.600]  this and pride that and black lives matter. But no, at the end of the day, that's who they really
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.880]  are. They want to destroy you. They want to run your life. And they get off on it. And they get
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:42.160]  off on watching that. I don't wish, I don't want Cenk Uygur's life destroyed. I don't want his
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.880]  crew's life destroyed. I disagree with their politics and ideology. I'd gladly debate them
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:52.800]  until the end of time. We do want to protect animals from him. Like he's saying, he wants my cat.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.280]  And I mean, I just, I mean, I'm not saying he wants to have sex with my cat, but I hope,
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.080]  I mean, I hope he doesn't think some dictator gives an order that my cat gets pleasure by him.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.200]  Yeah. I mean, that's some of the greatest unintentional comedy of all time is
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.480]  him getting called out by his own crew like, hey, hey, chunk, you might want to stop. You're talking
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.600]  about pleasuring animals. They're weirdo. Maybe this is time to pump the brakes. But aside from
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.000]  bursting out laughing at that every time I play it, I wish that the way I'm into pleasuring animals
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.200]  by petting them and giving them a bowl of food and playing with them with a toy.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.720]  I don't look at like a donkey or a horse. My parents ran to go, I want to have sex with that
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.680]  or or my cat go, well, let me, you know, have sex with a cat here. Hey, don't try to channel the
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.680]  mind of chunk yogurt now. All right. You know, you're going into a dark place now, Alex. All
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.560]  right. You don't want to try to get in his mind. It's a very devious. You think you got excited?
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.440]  Do you think you got excited by seeing the cat? Well, I mean, Alex, you were, you were pleasuring
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.360]  the cat. You were petting the cat and rubbing the cat's belly. It was letting out some purrs.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.320]  That's like Viagra for him. I see animals like. Yeah. So that he might actually, we might need
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.960]  to check his hard drive. He might have downloaded that video and putting it on a separate hard
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:11.040]  drive for his own little personal time. But we, I don't think that he, but you know what's sick
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.720]  about it though, Alex, again, aside from the intentional comedy, he's just, you know, it
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.320]  hurts me that he lies. You know, I care about you. You're my friend. And to just have him go on air
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.640]  and just lie about you like that and lie about the situation. It's just sick. These are sick people.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.320]  But you know, on your second point, which is the more important point, Alex, the awakening is
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:35.280]  truly on. And I was at the Austin FC soccer game last night and, you know, they bring all the,
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.520]  they bring all the new world order stuff to these sporting events. So everything's cash cashless now.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.880]  So you can't bring cash. You're not going to have any cash. Oh, by the way, the airports,
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.120]  everywhere, people got to stand up against us folks. And they do the digital tickets. So you
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.360]  can't have a hard copy of a ticket. So everything's, everything's digital, but they got a new thing.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.640]  And I've never seen this before, Alex. And this was wild where to go in, it's basically like a
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:03.040]  little market, but it's a concession at the game. You flash the chip on your card and it lets you
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.840]  in like you were getting on the subway. It lifts an arm and then you go in and then somehow these
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.200]  computers in this, in this little market at the game can track and trace what you do and what you
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.160]  grab out of the fridge. And then you walk out and it charges you. You don't even have to scan
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.520]  anything. Nothing. And I'm sure there's a credit store of China. So you, I hope you shot footage
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.920]  of this. We should go to this and make a, well, I will, the enemy. This is their attack plan to
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.880]  shut down. Because then once they have that, no other economy, not Amish farmers, not a small
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.920]  auto park store, not a small auto mechanic, not a small private school, everything will be shut
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.560]  down under this. And we'll be under the control of these dictators that want to have sex with our
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.440]  animals. Yeah, I'll gladly go back and film that. But it was crazy, Alex. So it happened and I stopped
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:52.240]  and I was like, Oh, this is, I want you to go this, I want you to go this week. It's just happening
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.280]  all the time. They just had their first game last night. And so it was the first time I've ever seen
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.480]  it. The Austin soccer team, it's an MLS Major League soccer team here in Austin. It was their
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.040]  first game last night. Symbols of green, symbols of green tree. Yeah. Yeah. The tree. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.360]  So, so, so hundreds of millions promote that. And now they're, let's leave, get on the plane,
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.920]  go through TSAB search, border wide open, all of it is slave training, all of it is, oh,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.400]  you can have your job, you can get in your car, just take a shot. It's all about seeing what we
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.800]  will put up with to get through these control mechanisms. That's huge. I want you to go.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.120]  I want you to do a report on this. Oh, and this is huge. I'll go with you. Yes, boss,
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.040]  you should come with me. We would have a great time actually. I got drew right here with me.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.720]  We're going the next fire game. It's on. No more BS in the field. And Alex, I'm telling you. And so
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.520]  when they do it, and when they, when I slid my chip in and the thing left it up, I go, oh, I go,
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.360]  oh, this is the future, isn't it? This is what they want. They want to put a microchip in us,
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.880]  don't they? And everyone around was kind of like, yeah, that's, yeah, that's what this is going.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.280]  Even the guy that was running it was like, yeah, I know nobody likes it. So they're rolling it out.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.760]  And Amazon's doing it. They own Whole Foods. They're doing it. It's in the airports. Do it.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.480]  It's, it's, again, well, just the new technology. No, it's about total control and nobody else
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.880]  can spend money. No other business is available during the lockdowns. Only big corporate stores
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.960]  you could shop at, stop supporting the big corporations folks. You got to do it sometime.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.600]  It's fine. Nobody's judging. I do it too. But try to support mom and pops support. I get
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:25.280]  Amish milk every week. It's so good. It's real milk. Everything else was fake milk, homogenized,
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.720]  boiled, sludge for your heart. Real milk is so good for your body. It's a probiotic. We have
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.200]  got to build our new economy, build our new world with our decisions now. We're not down the rat hole
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.840]  like China yet. We've got to do it now. And that's why people got to support them forward for.com.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.480]  They got to say to sync. He's so mad at the young turds that we're getting funding and say, no,
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.920]  I'm going to go make a donation at forward for.com. I'm going to get a product there. I'm going to
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.120]  keep my ear. Oh, and you're going to go ahead and take over here. We love you. You and Chrissy
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.760]  Lee appreciate the crew. I'll be back tomorrow. 11 a.m. Central up to Harrison Smith, American
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.960]  Journal, 11 a.m. Central. Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.760]  is a historic book that documents the globalists and their own words planned for our future.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.080]  That is a hellish future. Now you'll be always while they sell our books, I guess they're starting
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.800]  to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.760]  Amazon, or infowordsword.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.800]  after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:32.160]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at infowordsword.com.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.560]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.120]  just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep info
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.160]  words on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:50.320]  or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowordsword.com
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.160]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.720]  or give them to the local school. This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:06.720]  support. Info wars, tomorrow's news today. This is their big move. So yeah, you say why doesn't
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.560]  Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:18.560]  president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:30.080]  autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.800]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.800]  businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.920]  say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:54.160]  World War three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.840]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:07.120]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life. And info wars for decades has been at the very
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:12.640]  forefront of the fight for a pro human future. We can't stay on air without your help. And I want
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.000]  to thank you all for your past support. And I want to encourage those of you that have never

[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:18.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.760]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. All right, something you're not going to hear about
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:38.240]  from your American news media. And that's an anti-war, anti-nato protest that happened in France
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.680]  over the weekend. If you guys just want to roll clip two without the audio, it's fine.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:50.960]  But massive, massive turnout in France against the war. Massive, massive turnout in France
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:58.720]  against NATO. And so the story is, and the French are known for protesting, they have a very
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.560]  long tradition with protesting, is you're aware, even in recent history, and so they are out in
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:13.520]  force. Now, the same day with mainstream media promotion and the same propaganda machine that
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:21.680]  you see here, they had a pro-Ukraine rally and nobody attended it. Everybody went to the anti-war,
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.040]  anti-nato march. But see, you don't hear about that. Joe Biden goes to Poland
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.040]  where they're foaming at the mouth for war with Russia, like some old beef from the Soviet Union
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.760]  that they can't let go of. And so Biden goes to Poland where they have the tens of thousands
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.680]  in the street screaming, and even they were a little shocked at some of the stuff he was saying.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.960]  Even they were kind of like, whoa, you could hear it in the crowd at times.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.960]  But no, the truth of the matter is, outside of Poland, there's not much support
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.040]  for the war in Ukraine or rather the war against Russia. But they won't play you
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.880]  the tens of thousands in the street in France against NATO. And we should be doing the same thing.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.680]  And we've had a couple of peace rallies that we've promoted.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:21.040]  Now you won't get politicians really promoting it. You don't get the Republican or the Democrat
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:27.200]  party involved. And we know why that is. But we should be doing our own massive demonstrations
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.160]  against NATO. We should be doing our own massive demonstrations against this war.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.680]  And Zelensky has seemingly just gone completely mad. Zelensky has seemingly just gone completely
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:44.000]  insane. And I guess at this point, anybody supporting a war against Russia in Ukraine
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.640]  that could end in a nuclear conflict or even a World War III thermonuclear war situation,
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.760]  anybody at this point that's moving towards that scenario is completely psychotic.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:03.520]  And so here is Zelensky. This is his new talking point saying you need to support
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.920]  the war in Ukraine or it will lead to World War III. And this is what the pro-war stance is.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:17.760]  This is what the pro-war talking point is. We have to stop Russia in Ukraine to stop World War III.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:25.680]  Now, I'll get into the logic or lack thereof when it comes to that belief. But here's Zelensky
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:32.960]  saying we have to continue to support Ukraine to stop war in clip one. Those political leaders
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:39.360]  need to be responsible and cautious because people are looking at them. Who wants the
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:49.520]  Third World War? Would anyone risk? Would anyone be willing to accept that risk? The U.S. is never
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:58.960]  going to give up on the NATO member states. If it happens so that Ukraine, due to various opinions
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:10.960]  and weakening and depleting of assistance loses, Russia is going to enter Baltic states,
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:19.360]  NATO member states, and then the U.S. will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:25.840]  way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war. And they will have to fight because it's
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:31.040]  NATO that we're talking about, and they will be dying. God forbid, because it's a horrible thing.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:42.400]  Now, I don't believe one word of that. But let's try to understand this logic,
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.960]  because it's not just Zelensky saying this. This is the logic for supporting the war.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:52.960]  If we don't stop Russia in Ukraine, then we're going to have World War III.
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:59.840]  Well, let's say we don't stop Russia in Ukraine. What is the scenario? Okay, well,
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:06.000]  I guess the fear would be Russia takes over Ukraine, Ukraine essentially falls,
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:19.280]  and either becomes Russia, annexed by Russia, okay? Now, Ukraine is not a NATO country.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:26.800]  So that's why Zelensky has to say, if Ukraine falls, you'll fall next. So how about this?
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.040]  We can have a line in the sand, which is what it's already supposed to be,
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:38.880]  if Russia goes into a NATO country, or if Russia expands into an EU country even,
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:46.160]  past Ukraine, well, then okay. Okay, then maybe we'll talk about funding these wars and getting
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:58.800]  involved. But maybe that wouldn't happen. Maybe Putin just wants to have a pro-Russia regime in
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:07.200]  Ukraine, or maybe Putin doesn't like the way Ukraine is going with the influence from the West
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:16.400]  and the bribery and the shakedowns and the blackmail and the bio labs and the money laundering, and
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:23.600]  just wants to stop it. Either way, I don't see how that starts World War III. I don't see how
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.040]  Ukraine falling starts World War III. I don't see why that should impact us at all. Should I feel
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:37.520]  bad for the Ukrainian people? Perhaps. Perhaps. Will there be refugees? Will there be fallout?
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.320]  Will there be death? Yeah, it's not good. The situation is obviously not good. I'm not claiming
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:51.600]  it is, but no, I don't think if Ukraine falls, that leads to World War III. No. No, I'm just not
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:54:04.640]  buying that logic. And I don't think Russia or Putin is that aggressive to do anything past Ukraine.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:13.600]  I think they want Zelensky out. I think they want to clean it up from Western influence,
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.800]  and they want to make sure it doesn't become a NATO nation. And you might not think or you might
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:28.080]  think that's all good. You might think that's all bad. Either way, if it happens, I don't think it
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:33.280]  leads to World War III. But that's what they're telling you. And of course they are. Hundreds
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.520]  of billions of dollars going to Ukraine. Where do you think that money is going? Here's Treasury
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.600]  Secretary. This is after Joe Biden. By the way, the numbers are not even consistent. You can try to
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:50.240]  add it up and look at all the reporting. The guesses are 100 billion to 150 billion that has
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:55.520]  been sent to Ukraine in the last year. It's the year anniversary since Russia went in.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.840]  So you're talking about 100 to 150 billion. Joe Biden just went over there, cut a 500 million
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.800]  dollar check. Now there's new reports that there's going to be another 2 billion, another 10 billion.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:14.000]  And here's Janet Yellen making that request, saying we need more assistance, more money,
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:22.160]  to the IMF. Clip three. Economic assistance is making Ukraine's resistance possible by supporting
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:28.880]  the home front, funding critical public services, and helping keep the government running. In the
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:36.800]  coming months, we expect to provide around $10 billion in additional economic support for Ukraine.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.880]  Putin himself thought he would achieve a victory at minimal cost in the words of CIA
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:49.840]  Director Bill Burns. One year later, Putin's war has been a strategic failure for the Kremlin.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:58.240]  Ukraine still stands. I love this. Putin's losing. Putin's a failure, so we need more money.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.800]  Huh, sounds like you're losing.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:10.400]  You keep coming back to us for more money. You keep coming back to us for more weapons,
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.760]  more equipment, more support. That doesn't sound like winning to me.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.000]  Interesting. Funny how that works. So nobody even knows the numbers.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.120]  I've seen 2 billion, 5 billion, 10 billion is what Xi just said. I've seen 15 billion reported.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:39.040]  It's just a damn slot machine. It's just a damn slot machine.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.960]  Now, it all reminds me, though, for a little comic relief as we exit the Alex Jones show,
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.960]  it all reminds me of a great Seinfeld episode. Do you remember this classic?
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.120]  Oh, stop, Starling. Come on.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:00.720]  I can't think of this all this noise. Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland,
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:06.320]  I've driven you out of Western Europe, and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:10.720]  denialation. I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:18.000]  The Ukraine? You know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck, a rolled apple noob.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:25.200]  The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the herd to the Ukraine.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.640]  I come from Ukraine. You're not saying Ukraine weak.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.480]  Yeah, well, we're playing a game here, pal.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.520]  Ukraine is good to you. How about I take a little bonus?
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:43.680]  Oh, man. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, remember infowarstore.com coupon code SAVEMUSHU for 10%
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:54.880]  off at checkout. Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.520]  infowarstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:05.360]  system and your body, and keep us on air. I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.400]  and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:16.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.160]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation. Sure, you share a link,
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.240]  you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great. I thank you. But we need
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.240]  funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:33.040]  our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep bait and our nitric oxide and our real
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:37.040]  Red Pill Plus. All of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:41.360]  missing out on having these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate,
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:47.280]  and go to infowarstore.com right now and get these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.280]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.120]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:07.600]  info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.480]  this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Stroyer and the hard work they engage in
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:18.640]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:23.120]  info wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I want to encourage you now to realize that
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:28.080]  info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word,
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:32.160]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners,
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:37.120]  never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:41.520]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.880]  products at infowarstore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com,
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:57.840]  our fighting problems will be... If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
