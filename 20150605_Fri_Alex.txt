[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  You want answers?
[00:10.800 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.140 --> 00:26.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.280 --> 00:31.440]  On Tuesday, the residents of Flint, Michigan were rattled by explosions that resulted from
[00:31.440 --> 00:35.880]  a secretive Jade Helm 15 urban army exercise.
[00:35.880 --> 00:37.280]  Big, huge explosion.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.280]  I mean, it was loud.
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.160]  Explosions you'd expect in a war zone echoed through Flint and people's homes shook and
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.240]  those inside were caught off guard.
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.440]  It all went down at the shuttered bowl junior high on the east side and we've learned the
[00:49.440 --> 00:52.760]  blasts are just an army exercise.
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.000]  When the city representative was asked why the locals weren't warned in advance, his
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.880]  response was as typical as it is ominous.
[00:59.880 --> 01:04.180]  Well, obviously I can't speak for the army on that, but we try to give people the heads
[01:04.180 --> 01:05.680]  up when we can.
[01:05.680 --> 01:07.280]  We can't go into too much detail.
[01:07.280 --> 01:10.960]  We don't want people just coming to these things and sightseeing.
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.760]  So we have to be careful with it and we obviously have to respect the army's wishes.
[01:15.760 --> 01:19.680]  Meanwhile, the Michigan Air National Guard published a warning just hours before they
[01:19.680 --> 01:24.680]  began night flying helicopter drills from the Selfridge Air National Guard base into
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.520]  the surrounding area of Mount Clemens, Michigan.
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.320]  Jade Helm 15 appears to be underway according to US Army Special Operations Command.
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.880]  Urban drills conducted by all four branches of the military are to begin in Texas, New
[01:38.880 --> 01:46.480]  Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana from July
[01:46.480 --> 01:50.200]  15th through September 15th, 2015.
[01:50.200 --> 01:55.400]  The state of Colorado and two Texas counties requested to be dropped off the list of potential
[01:55.400 --> 01:57.000]  mock war zones.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.440]  Clearly, the Flint, Michigan, June 2nd, 2015 exercises are way ahead of schedule and no
[02:03.440 --> 02:05.280]  warning was given.
[02:05.280 --> 02:06.280]  There's older people.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.680]  I mean, they probably give them a heart attack.
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.760]  Some are saying Jade Helm stands for Joint Assistant for Deployment and Execution Homeland
[02:14.760 --> 02:22.720]  Eradication of Local Militants, Homeland Eradication of Local Militants.
[02:22.720 --> 02:27.000]  This can only mean the returning veterans at the top of the Department of Homeland Security's
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.720]  Domestic Terrorist.
[02:28.720 --> 02:34.640]  Back in 2009, the FBI launched Operation Vigilant Eagle, a nationwide operation that targeted
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.280]  militia sovereign citizen extremist groups with their sights set on veterans returning
[02:40.280 --> 02:42.400]  from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.360]  The Wall Street Journal reported on the memo trail that led, months later, to the desk
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.480]  of then DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano.
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.520]  Janet Napolitano warned of a surge of domestic right-wing terror groups that would recruit
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.120]  returning veterans into their fold in order to carry out attacks similar to the Oklahoma
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.360]  City bombing.
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.000]  Returning veterans are targets of right-wing extremist groups that are trying to recruit
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.800]  those to commit violent acts within the country.
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.160]  We want to do all we can to prevent that.
[03:11.160 --> 03:17.080]  At very same year, U.S. active-duty Army military police troops from Fort Rucker in Alabama
[03:17.080 --> 03:22.520]  violated Posse Comitatus by assisting in traffic control and securing a crime scene.
[03:22.520 --> 03:27.080]  These soldiers were reprimanded because the President and the Governor didn't request
[03:27.080 --> 03:28.080]  their deployment.
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.720]  The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of federal military personnel to execute the
[03:33.720 --> 03:34.720]  laws.
[03:34.720 --> 03:39.880]  Regardless, the feds interpret the language as it may apply to troops used in an advisory
[03:39.880 --> 03:48.920]  support, disaster response, or other homeland defense role, as opposed to domestic law enforcement.
[03:48.920 --> 03:49.920]  It was earth shatter.
[03:49.920 --> 03:50.920]  It was quite an explosion.
[03:50.920 --> 03:54.200]  They were very loud and shook my house.
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.560]  The explosions came the same day the city said the U.S. Army would be conducting training
[03:58.560 --> 03:59.560]  in the area.
[03:59.560 --> 04:02.920]  Here we are six years later in a summer of rages heating up.
[04:02.920 --> 04:08.120]  The Obama administration's rhetoric and George Soros' dollars have done all they can to divide
[04:08.120 --> 04:09.120]  the nation.
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.720]  Divided we stand.
[04:10.720 --> 04:11.720]  Divided we fall.
[04:11.720 --> 04:17.240]  Apparently, North Com and South Com see that as an order and not as a long-standing American
[04:17.240 --> 04:18.240]  value.
[04:18.240 --> 04:19.240]  John Bowne, Infowars.com.
[04:19.240 --> 04:26.200]  Well, folks, that is another excellent and extremely informative report by our own John
[04:26.200 --> 04:27.200]  Bowne.
[04:27.200 --> 04:28.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.640]  We're live on this Friday worldwide broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, and when we return we're
[04:33.640 --> 04:36.800]  going to break down the huge developments on the TPP front.
[04:36.800 --> 04:37.880]  It's in trouble.
[04:37.880 --> 04:39.280]  The EU is in trouble.
[04:39.280 --> 04:46.360]  A lot of good news, as the global fascist empire takes more serious blows from the worldwide
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.600]  rebellion against tyranny.
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:49.600 --> 04:58.720]  You have found the tip of the spear for the fight for human liberty, Infowars.com.
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.400]  Today's top stories for June 5th, 2015, Obama secretly backing Muslim Brotherhood, article
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.520]  up by Washington Times, President Obama and his administration continue to support the
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.400]  global Islamist militant group known as the Muslim Brotherhood.
[05:13.400 --> 05:18.400]  A White House strategy document regards the group as a moderate alternative to more violent
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.560]  Islamic groups.
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.840]  The policy of backing the Muslim Brotherhood is outlined in a secret directive called Presidential
[05:23.840 --> 05:26.040]  Study Directive Dash 11.
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.120]  The directive was produced in 2011 and outlines administration support for political reform
[05:31.120 --> 05:32.120]  in the Middle East.
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.520]  The TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches final push for votes.
[05:36.520 --> 05:41.480]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Package, is beginning to
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.840]  unravel with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and Republican leadership
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.960]  over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand big corporations
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.040]  new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[05:55.040 --> 06:02.040]  You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[06:25.040 --> 06:33.720]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist,
[06:33.720 --> 06:38.720]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[06:38.720 --> 06:44.120]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, experience the benefits of
[06:44.120 --> 06:49.920]  combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical
[06:49.920 --> 06:50.920]  science.

[07:03.680 --> 07:08.960]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient in
[07:08.960 --> 07:10.840]  clean forms of iodine.
[07:10.840 --> 07:17.440]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced
[07:17.440 --> 07:18.920]  it for themselves.
[07:18.920 --> 07:24.480]  The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfowarsLife.com
[07:24.480 --> 07:28.000]  of survival shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.840]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[07:32.840 --> 07:40.200]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfowarsLife.com and
[07:40.200 --> 07:43.320]  that supply is running low and is in question.
[07:43.320 --> 07:47.240]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and long-time supply
[07:47.240 --> 07:50.240]  of survival shield nascent iodine X2 today.
[07:50.240 --> 08:19.720]  Available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[08:45.240 --> 08:47.720]  Now today we got in our brand new t-shirts.
[08:47.720 --> 08:51.000]  This is the Save America t-shirt with the upside down flag.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.840]  Now at Infowars.com in no way are we being disrespectful.
[08:54.840 --> 09:00.120]  In fact, this t-shirt was designed to help inform you and the people around you that
[09:00.120 --> 09:04.600]  will be seeing this t-shirt because at the very bottom we show you the actual United
[09:04.600 --> 09:09.560]  States flag code Title IV Chapter 1 which states that you should never fly the flag
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.800]  with the Union side down unless you're in a dire state of emergency.
[09:13.800 --> 09:17.840]  Now if you haven't taken a look outside the door or turned on the news in the last year
[09:17.840 --> 09:22.600]  or so then you would understand that our country, our republic is in dire need of help.
[09:22.600 --> 09:26.420]  We have a government that continuously spies on us illegally.
[09:26.420 --> 09:31.920]  We have a country that continuously mistreats our veterans and then sends them to stupid
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.000]  pointless mindless wars with no truth based behind it whatsoever.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.680]  And then they come home and they treat them like crap.
[09:39.680 --> 09:41.400]  They throw them on death panels.
[09:41.400 --> 09:43.040]  I myself am a veteran.
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.600]  I've served numerous tours and I do not find this disrespectful whatsoever.
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.280]  At Infowars.com, we are here to...
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.200]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[09:56.200 --> 10:04.280]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[10:04.280 --> 10:19.400]  Today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[10:19.400 --> 10:49.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.600]  On this Friday, already the fifth day of whatever month it is in this insane asylum that we
[11:01.600 --> 11:08.760]  live in, because it doesn't even matter what month or what year it is here inside the planetary
[11:08.760 --> 11:17.400]  world government, where the tyranny and the oppression and the ignorance just intensifies
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.120]  by the moment.
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.200]  It's television that's killing society.
[11:23.200 --> 11:31.640]  The world is absolutely filled with just nonproductive mindless chatter and behavior and people
[11:31.640 --> 11:41.520]  frittering away their lives, pretending that they're schoolteachers, pretending their parents,
[11:41.520 --> 11:49.080]  pretending their senators, pretending their police officers, pretending their artists,
[11:49.080 --> 11:53.880]  pretending their intellectuals, pretending they're informed, pretending they've got their
[11:53.880 --> 12:04.040]  head screwed on straight, while, meanwhile, organized anti-human systems are being developed
[12:04.040 --> 12:07.200]  and deployed against humanity.
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.360]  There is a lot of positive news, though, at the same time that we're going to be breaking
[12:12.360 --> 12:20.240]  down today on this worldwide broadcast.
[12:20.240 --> 12:26.480]  We have Lord Moncton joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the hour, one of the main
[12:26.480 --> 12:33.120]  fighters of the EU and the founder of UKIP, the fastest growing party in England, UK-wide
[12:33.120 --> 12:45.040]  and also in much of Europe, and he's an expert on EU tyranny and what's happening currently
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.240]  with the European Union, and that's tied into the rest of the trilateral global government
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.920]  program, the Asia Union and the American Union.
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.160]  EU ways unprecedented reform has written threatens to leave.
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.080]  That's the associated press today.
[13:03.080 --> 13:15.200]  Germany's Merkel open to EU treaty changes for UK, BBC, we're going to be drilling down
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.400]  into what this means, but here's what's happened.
[13:19.400 --> 13:27.040]  The UK was brought in decades ago without a vote through stealth political actions into
[13:27.040 --> 13:33.160]  the unelected draconian European Union that at the time wasn't even announcing itself
[13:33.160 --> 13:41.200]  as a European Union and was actually a, quote, trade deal that was negotiated in secret and
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.160]  that England was then a signatory, too, and we'll go over the years when it happened,
[13:46.160 --> 13:50.240]  how it was implemented with Lord Moncton, who was there in the Thatcher government as
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.640]  her chief advisor, stopping it, and then as soon as she left office, they were able to
[13:54.640 --> 13:56.200]  sneak it through.
[13:56.200 --> 13:59.040]  So he was there when history was happening.
[13:59.040 --> 14:06.720]  Now you may be saying this sounds like deja vu because that's what the TPP is for the
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.040]  United States, and that's what NAFTA and GATT and all these things are, are the so-called
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.320]  trade agreements that are really global government agreements bringing us under private corporate
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.680]  globalist boards.
[14:18.680 --> 14:23.620]  And so this is really good news because even if they ran the TPP through, which is in big
[14:23.620 --> 14:31.680]  trouble right now, it shows how decades later, as the public is informed of how they've lost
[14:31.680 --> 14:40.680]  their sovereignty and how roughly 83% of British and UK laws from Scotland to Ireland
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.960]  are made by the European Union itself.
[14:46.960 --> 14:54.760]  And then you notice just a few years ago, the EU actually officially just took Ireland over
[14:54.760 --> 14:57.880]  when it became a member, and then notice what happened to their economy.
[14:57.880 --> 15:01.600]  Suddenly they were signed on to all this debt that wasn't theirs.
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.080]  They conquer you through economic conquest.
[15:07.080 --> 15:13.840]  So this is such a huge time to be alive because Bilderberg is a microcosm of this.
[15:13.840 --> 15:21.560]  The people that run Bilderberg since the 1940s, they officially called it Bilderberg in 1954
[15:21.560 --> 15:29.240]  when they met Neustrubeck Holland at the Bilderberg Hotel, they are the royalty, they are the
[15:29.240 --> 15:35.120]  robber barons of Europe and the United States, they are what you could call Hydra or Specter,
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.640]  they are the bad guys, and their agenda can only operate in secret.
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.400]  If there's ever a debate about them, if there's ever a discussion about private corporate
[15:47.400 --> 15:53.760]  individuals and combines controlling government and controlling the issue in some currency
[15:53.760 --> 15:59.720]  and credit and controlling interest rates and controlling trade and borders and military
[15:59.720 --> 16:08.400]  and sovereignty and immigration, it's game over because even the stupidest 75 IQ person
[16:08.400 --> 16:14.880]  out there who might be able to tie their shoelaces, who might be able to find their butt at high
[16:14.880 --> 16:21.920]  noon with both hands, they can understand that the decisions are being made by people
[16:21.920 --> 16:27.040]  who aren't from this country or aren't from their country and who do not have their best
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.000]  interest at heart.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.760]  That is the simple fact in all of this, and so when you see the trilateral plan of an
[16:35.760 --> 16:44.220]  Asian Union, American Union, EU Union, all those unions then merging together through
[16:44.220 --> 16:50.080]  trade deals, when they were set up as trade deals, once you have a debate about that,
[16:50.080 --> 16:56.080]  the whole thing starts falling apart, the whole thing becomes crystal clear as a dictatorial,
[16:56.080 --> 17:05.720]  centralized despotism, no matter what name or whatever word you give it.
[17:05.720 --> 17:19.160]  And so you can see June 5th, 2015, as a very dark time for the world where a lot of evil
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.520]  is coming out of the closet, emerging out of the waves and attacking like the Hydra,
[17:24.520 --> 17:31.200]  like the Leviathan, but at the same time it's an incredibly positive time because the world
[17:31.200 --> 17:36.680]  is awakening and saying no, and the Tory party had to act like UKIP or they would have lost
[17:36.680 --> 17:45.200]  the election, UKIP gained a lot of seats, it's like a Ron Paul style party, their listeners
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.520]  of this show, their guests of this show, they understand what's going on, their fight is
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.880]  our fight, our fight is their fight, we're all in the same boat, sovereign nations being
[17:54.880 --> 18:01.600]  taken over by the globalist, we're all allied against this, and the Tories as we said last
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.600]  year before the election this year, began to act like UKIP and said okay we'll control
[18:05.600 --> 18:12.120]  the borders, okay we'll cut the taxes, okay we will get us out of the EU or at least allow
[18:12.120 --> 18:17.560]  you to have a vote, the British and the rest of the people in the UK never had a chance
[18:17.560 --> 18:21.760]  to even vote on whether they want to be part of the EU, we don't get a chance to have a
[18:21.760 --> 18:33.840]  vote here doing, we don't get to even see the TPP, the Congress just votes, the House
[18:33.840 --> 18:38.640]  is about to vote, the Senate voted to just give the President a limited power to sign
[18:38.640 --> 18:50.320]  on to whatever he wants, I mean that is so sensational off the chart over the top, ridiculous.
[18:50.320 --> 18:59.360]  Ridiculous that that would be happening, two members of Boehner's leadership team openly
[18:59.360 --> 19:11.480]  refuse to admit if they've read Obama trade, that's the TPP, so this is all a bunch of
[19:11.480 --> 19:17.560]  criminals in suits trying to act like what they're doing is normal and kosher and acceptable
[19:17.560 --> 19:24.280]  and not a problem, they're hiding it in plain view, we're blowing the whistle and just as
[19:24.280 --> 19:30.520]  they said Bilderberg didn't exist 60 years ago, 50 years ago, 40, 30, 20 in the last
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.240]  10 years they've been forced to admit it exist, they've been forced to admit much of their
[19:34.240 --> 19:41.320]  agenda and guess what it's a global government, carbon tax, open border, technological technocracy
[19:41.320 --> 19:48.080]  that ends human liberty, ends freedom, ends sovereignty and forces you to eat Monsanto
[19:48.080 --> 19:55.240]  GMO basically and taxes the internet and takes over free speech, I mean it's sick, we're
[19:55.240 --> 19:59.400]  exposing the entire globalist hierarchy.
[19:59.400 --> 20:03.560]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate

[21:03.600 --> 21:07.280]  some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins
[21:07.280 --> 21:11.800]  in a toxic colon, a toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative
[21:11.800 --> 21:16.000]  disease and a clean and well moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.

[21:33.600 --> 21:37.080]  with diabetes, I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the
[21:37.080 --> 21:41.000]  foot pain as well, but I've noticed in the past week or so I'm not feeling bad anymore
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.040]  and the foot pain is gone, I'm just finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got

[24:10.160 --> 24:20.680]  I just spent, let me just turn it in, 12 minutes trying to break down something that's really
[24:20.680 --> 24:21.680]  simple.
[24:21.680 --> 24:33.000]  The private, global, fascist, eugenics-based world government that started the Nazi Party,
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.360]  started the Communist Party, is so evil they've just committed purely to the most wicked darkness
[24:39.360 --> 24:40.560]  you can imagine.
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.600]  They're purists.
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.280]  These bloodthirsty purists, based out of the British Empire, allied with the United
[24:49.280 --> 24:57.080]  States and the Robber Barons, created a system of culture control about 160 years ago and
[24:57.080 --> 25:03.040]  deployed the plan and have pretty much taken the planet over.
[25:03.040 --> 25:10.360]  And they discovered DNA and they invented computers and biometrics.
[25:10.360 --> 25:16.000]  Galton in the 1860s said we're going to create machines to track everyone.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.960]  We're going to discover how humans operate.
[25:19.960 --> 25:22.080]  We're going to master it.
[25:22.080 --> 25:26.200]  We're going to bring in a planetary government.
[25:26.200 --> 25:33.280]  And we're going to remove all of the dumb people from the Earth and create a utopia.
[25:33.280 --> 25:39.760]  And the dominant empire of the world adopted that, the British Empire, the greatest empire
[25:39.760 --> 25:48.040]  of this world's ever seen, with all its administrative manipulations and military power.
[25:48.040 --> 25:56.400]  And now that philosophy, that system, that logic has permeated into a private, global
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.040]  banking cartel, because the British don't really run it today.
[26:02.040 --> 26:09.480]  They're just part of it, and has merged with the military industrial complex and the technological
[26:09.480 --> 26:14.000]  elite that Eisenhower spoke of.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.840]  And they're on a power trip.
[26:15.840 --> 26:19.800]  They're racing to get life extension.
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.640]  They're allowing all their new drugs and surgeries to be tested on the general public to perfect
[26:24.640 --> 26:27.600]  them for themselves.
[26:27.600 --> 26:28.880]  That is the practice of medicine.
[26:28.880 --> 26:29.880]  Is it not?
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.960]  It's why it's called practice.
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.880]  And they are effectively anesthetizing and dumbing down the public to come in for the
[26:39.880 --> 26:42.480]  big win.
[26:42.480 --> 26:47.160]  Ragtag forces are aware of this around the world.
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.840]  The chemicals in the food and water, the biological weapon, engineering in the food.
[26:52.840 --> 26:54.640]  We can see the diseases skyrocketing.
[26:54.640 --> 26:56.480]  We can see the IQs plunging.
[26:56.480 --> 26:59.800]  We can read the globalist tone battle plans and see they're carrying it out.
[26:59.800 --> 27:04.360]  And we're just here desperately trying to warn people.
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.400]  People being laughed at by the controlled right and controlled left.
[27:08.400 --> 27:14.840]  But as Christ said, forgive them, they don't know not what they do.
[27:14.840 --> 27:18.280]  The mid-level minions.
[27:18.280 --> 27:24.160]  The good news is because of fighters like Nigel Farage and Ward Monkten 30 years ago
[27:24.160 --> 27:30.080]  that founded UKIP, they put so much pressure on the UK that they are threatening to leave
[27:30.080 --> 27:34.760]  the EU if national sovereignty is not at least partially returned to the UK.
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.280]  That's a big first step.
[27:38.280 --> 27:40.520]  That's in the BBC and the Associated Press today.
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.640]  Germany's Merkel opened the EU treaty change for UK.
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.160]  EU ways, unprecedented reform as Britain threatens to leave.
[27:50.160 --> 27:51.160]  AP.
[27:51.160 --> 27:54.400]  And that ties into this headline.
[27:54.400 --> 27:58.600]  TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches final push for votes.
[27:58.600 --> 28:02.320]  Please just tell us what is in TPP.
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.760]  I'm going to read over some of this article.
[28:05.760 --> 28:08.880]  So humanity is putting up a fight.
[28:08.880 --> 28:16.520]  I mean, just 10 years ago, you'd tell people that there were G7s and G20s and you'd tell
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.600]  people that there were global elites meeting in secret and the public had been taught
[28:21.600 --> 28:27.960]  there were no robber barons, there were no powerful men and women who wanted more power.
[28:27.960 --> 28:31.360]  I mean, that's like saying there is no sun that comes up in the morning.
[28:31.360 --> 28:37.120]  The public had been taught that government is pure goodness and so are corporations and
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.320]  nothing bad goes on.
[28:38.320 --> 28:39.320]  There's no secret grips.
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.280]  So just stick your head in the sand and go to sleep and watch your favorite TV show.
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.720]  We've now progressed to the point where 20 years ago, maybe one out of 50 people knew
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.400]  the Federal Reserve was private and European owned.
[28:54.400 --> 28:58.180]  I mean, I remember hearing conservative talk show host 20 years ago say the Council on
[28:58.180 --> 29:04.040]  Foreign Relations didn't exist.
[29:04.040 --> 29:11.120]  They would get on air and say that Cooke Alex Jones says a thing called the CFR runs everything.
[29:11.120 --> 29:16.600]  I didn't say it ran everything set up by British intelligence publicly in 1922 at Pratt House
[29:16.600 --> 29:23.280]  in New York City with the express goal of establishing British Empire rule over the
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.960]  continental United States through infiltration of government and working with U.S. robber
[29:27.960 --> 29:28.960]  barons.
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.960]  They did a pretty good job.
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.800]  But see, now people know the Council on Foreign Relations exists.
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.320]  The U.S. branch, the role instead of international affairs.
[29:38.320 --> 29:45.040]  So once we identify there's this shadow monster in the room that's doing the mischief that
[29:45.040 --> 29:48.320]  it's the 100-pound gremlin, it's goodbye gremlin.
[29:48.320 --> 29:49.640]  We're on the march.
[29:49.640 --> 29:52.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.120 --> 29:56.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.360 --> 30:03.080]  The film, The Magnificent Seven, is about to be remade, a story of a village oppressed
[30:03.080 --> 30:05.360]  by both bandidos and federales.
[30:05.360 --> 30:09.320]  The villagers realized that until they were able to defend themselves, they would always
[30:09.320 --> 30:11.480]  be slaves and victims.
[30:11.480 --> 30:15.920]  So they hired professionals, not to be their protectors, but to teach them how to defend
[30:15.920 --> 30:16.920]  themselves.
[30:16.920 --> 30:22.080]  It's a timeless tale of the power of the community of Posse Camatadas.
[30:22.080 --> 30:26.360]  Our founders knew that permanent standing armies would mean a permanent state of war
[30:26.360 --> 30:29.320]  abroad and tyranny at home.
[30:29.320 --> 30:34.680]  And as we've maintained the largest standing army in the world, we have had a permanent
[30:34.680 --> 30:35.680]  state of war.
[30:35.680 --> 30:39.840]  If our increasingly militarized domestic law enforcement were an army, it would be the
[30:39.840 --> 30:42.440]  fourth largest in the world.
[30:42.440 --> 30:47.660]  The concepts of a militia and a Posse kept power in the hands of the people to be led
[30:47.660 --> 30:50.320]  as needed by a few professionals.
[30:50.320 --> 30:55.800]  So we reclaim that constitutional heritage, we will remain helpless peons.
[30:55.800 --> 30:59.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.160]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits

[33:19.720 --> 33:39.040]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:39.040 --> 33:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live, worldwide original teleprompter
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.760]  free radio slash television transmission.
[33:47.760 --> 33:54.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, Infowars.com, and PrismPlanet.com are our two flagship websites.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.880]  We also have PrismPlanet.tv as we fight the construction of the global prison planet.
[34:00.880 --> 34:01.880]  Let me just do this.
[34:01.880 --> 34:02.880]  I do this sometimes at the start of the show.
[34:02.880 --> 34:07.240]  I'm going to reset because I get so upset looking at the news headlines before the show.
[34:07.240 --> 34:11.880]  I tend to get mad, and I'm trying to psychologically get a handle on this.
[34:11.880 --> 34:13.880]  Again, there's a lot of good news.
[34:13.880 --> 34:15.480]  There's also a lot of bad news.
[34:15.480 --> 34:22.240]  We told you the day they indicted Dennis Hastert that it would be about basically raping his
[34:22.240 --> 34:23.240]  wrestlers.
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.440]  Of course, now families have come out and we know the names of the people and the payoffs.
[34:29.440 --> 34:38.040]  Exclusive Dennis Hastert sex abuse victim is named by family.
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.440]  I wonder what Lindsey Graham's going to do when his friend gets in trouble.
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.160]  Good Lindsey, I just think of Hastert, I just think of Lindsey, I don't know why.
[34:50.160 --> 34:57.600]  But you wonder why these guys are so sold out, why they go against 90%, 85% polls on
[34:57.600 --> 35:00.840]  things like TPP.
[35:00.840 --> 35:07.000]  It's because the Republican and Democratic parties go out and recruit people that are
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.520]  pedophiles because they know once they destroy them or need to destroy them, no one's going
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.240]  to listen to them saying other people are corrupt around them because of the scarlet
[35:17.240 --> 35:23.640]  letter P for child rapist or pedophile.
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.120]  So they go and they recruit them out of networks of pedophiles and that's why the government
[35:29.120 --> 35:34.560]  is so scum filled and why so many Homeland Security regional directors constantly get
[35:34.560 --> 35:43.680]  caught just every few weeks with little kids.
[35:43.680 --> 35:47.200]  There's one level even worse than them though, there's the snuff films.
[35:47.200 --> 35:57.720]  In fact, the bassist of the Scorpions came out on TMZ a week ago and Mark Dyson reported
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.520]  on it, we ought to play it, I forgot to tell you guys that, where he admitted in Germany,
[36:02.520 --> 36:08.560]  movies like Hustle I've told you are based on real stuff, where people are killed at
[36:08.560 --> 36:13.600]  these elite parties.
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.360]  That happened in New York with Rolling Stone one time, little dead black kid at the party
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.480]  but you can hardly find that even in the news annals with Alexis Nexus search.
[36:22.480 --> 36:28.800]  So there's a whole other level beyond just raping kids, it's killing them.
[36:28.800 --> 36:34.680]  And the Scorpions, you know, bassist credit, he said it was horrible and made him sick
[36:34.680 --> 36:40.960]  and traumatized him, he's very serious when he's talking to the reporter.
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.840]  So this is who we have running things, people that like to take five year olds and torture
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.640]  the living daylights out of them and scare the hell out of them before they kill them.
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.360]  And I'm not going to go into what they do to kids folks, but it's everything you read
[36:56.360 --> 37:02.320]  about the old wives tales, oh, people claim Satanist would get babies and cut them and
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.320]  drink their blood.
[37:03.320 --> 37:06.240]  No, that's what they do.
[37:06.240 --> 37:09.840]  Former Scorpions bass player admits to attending snuff parties.
[37:09.840 --> 37:20.880]  There's the headline, oh man.
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.880]  You know, I did a whole report on this earlier this week and trans able where people cut
[37:25.880 --> 37:32.600]  their arms and legs off and I talked about chemicals in the food and water increasing
[37:32.600 --> 37:41.920]  breast and prostate cancer and accelerating aging and causing sexual confusion and salon
[37:41.920 --> 37:45.200]  wrote an article making fun of it.
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.480]  It's not funny.
[37:48.480 --> 37:51.920]  And implying I'm basically making it up.
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.920]  No, I'm not making any of it up.
[37:56.920 --> 38:03.080]  I'm not making it up that the IQ points in the United States just dropped another 14
[38:03.080 --> 38:04.080]  points.
[38:04.080 --> 38:13.800]  In fact, none of this matters though, because no one's going to go after Mark Rubio.
[38:13.800 --> 38:17.440]  The senator for saying there's no NSA spying lying bigger than clapper.
[38:17.440 --> 38:23.800]  No, they're going to go after him or something doesn't matter, his wife's 17 traffic infractions.
[38:23.800 --> 38:28.040]  They always go after some little crooked toenail because that doesn't affect the elites and
[38:28.040 --> 38:33.760]  all their big corrupt operations.
[38:33.760 --> 38:40.520]  That's the big national news story today out of the New York Times is Mark Rubio, his wife
[38:40.520 --> 38:49.040]  cited 17 times for traffic infractions.
[38:49.040 --> 38:50.040]  You know, knock on wood.
[38:50.040 --> 38:59.360]  I haven't gotten a traffic infraction in like, it's got to be like six, seven years.
[38:59.360 --> 39:06.360]  But then all of a sudden I'll get like three in a row.
[39:06.360 --> 39:08.000]  But why are we even talking about that?
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.160]  Well, I raised the point to illustrate how it's a distraction.
[39:11.160 --> 39:19.720]  For a second when I talk about Bruce Jenner, we're being assaulted by Tavistock Institute
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.720]  technology weaponized media to scramble our brains.
[39:23.720 --> 39:24.720]  And you know what?
[39:24.720 --> 39:25.720]  It's working.
[39:25.720 --> 39:26.720]  Our brains are even getting smaller.
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.080]  Paul Watson wrote an article and he has links to the statistics and facts in it called the
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.280]  rise of the idiots.
[39:34.280 --> 39:42.920]  Lessoners are dumber than ever before and their brains are physically smaller.
[39:42.920 --> 39:48.640]  Genitalia are smaller.
[39:48.640 --> 39:50.480]  Sperm counts are down almost 90%.
[39:50.480 --> 39:53.680]  Oh, but there's nothing wrong.
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.080]  Nothing bad's happening because diabetes is up several thousand percent.
[39:58.080 --> 39:59.880]  Type two.
[39:59.880 --> 40:00.880]  Type ones.
[40:00.880 --> 40:02.280]  Well, cancer is without the chart.
[40:02.280 --> 40:04.520]  Don't be a fearmonger.
[40:04.520 --> 40:08.440]  They're only spying on us without warrants and opening the borders outside of law and
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.440]  having military drills everywhere and TSA grabbing our genitals.
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.440]  Everything's fine.
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.480]  Don't worry about Jade Helm, even though every state in the union is having reports of troops
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.320]  running checkpoints and helicopters blowing stuff up in the middle of the night, terrorizing
[40:23.320 --> 40:26.120]  people as they get us ready for a military takeover.
[40:26.120 --> 40:27.960]  Oh, everything's fine, though.
[40:27.960 --> 40:30.880]  Go back to sleep.
[40:30.880 --> 40:36.000]  Be like walking in and seeing your five-year-old dying of cancer and going, don't be upset.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  Don't be upset.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.840]  There's nothing wrong with you.
[40:38.840 --> 40:40.720]  America is on its deathbed.
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.080]  We're on our deathbed.
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.160]  We've killed 56 million babies and just say, oh, they're not babies.
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.840]  And now, old people aren't old people.
[40:48.840 --> 40:49.840]  Kill them.
[40:49.840 --> 40:51.720]  And now, veterans aren't veterans.
[40:51.720 --> 40:52.720]  Just death list them.
[40:52.720 --> 40:59.000]  I've got an article right here out of the New American by Alex Newman that details with
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.320]  links to all of the announcements where they're calling elderly in Europe and the U.K. second-class
[41:05.320 --> 41:08.640]  citizens and denying them health care saying, well, we're socialists.
[41:08.640 --> 41:09.920]  We save money doing that.
[41:09.920 --> 41:12.920]  I thought it was about being nice and taking care of everyone.
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.200]  No, it's about killing you.
[41:17.200 --> 41:20.720]  I mean, just look at these headlines, OK?
[41:20.720 --> 41:23.560]  When is it a crime to withdraw money from your bank?
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.560]  That's right.
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.880]  That's a serious headline in the New York Times.
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.680]  Obama under pressure to release secrets of 9-11 report.
[41:31.680 --> 41:33.440]  Let me tell you a graph.
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.480]  Massive data breach could affect every federal agency.
[41:38.480 --> 41:44.680]  Chinese breach of 4 million federal workers' databases in a cyber war, right as they try
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.480]  to pass the Homeland Security Cyber takeover in the end of the Internet freedom.
[41:48.480 --> 41:50.680]  Who knows if the Chinese even did it?
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.400]  And I'm not saying they're not probing and there isn't wars going back and forth.
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.680]  The point is, look at the timing of all this.
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.160]  Look at these headlines.
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.920]  Obama and his GOP allies launch big effort to win trade fight in the House.
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.760]  Oh, the Washington Post calls it a trade fight.
[42:12.760 --> 42:14.960]  How did the EU start?
[42:14.960 --> 42:21.240]  Oh, is the Treaty of Rome a steel deal in 1957?
[42:21.240 --> 42:27.000]  But it wasn't a steel deal.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.760]  It was the entire Union.
[42:28.760 --> 42:29.960]  It's 600 pages long.
[42:29.960 --> 42:31.600]  I've scanned the whole document.
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.280]  It's incredible.
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.560]  And you've got Pelosi and Boehner and all these crooks.
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.920]  Boehner is completely out of his mind, is always crying, complete lunatic.
[42:46.920 --> 42:52.640]  God knows what they've got on him.
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.960]  And they're just up there going, there's a secret treaty that takes over everything
[42:55.960 --> 42:57.200]  and you can't see it.
[42:57.200 --> 43:03.320]  And the whore media, the prostitute media, won't even tell you that it's not a trade
[43:03.320 --> 43:04.320]  deal.
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.720]  That it's a huge power grab when subsections have been leaked of it that are so draconian.
[43:08.720 --> 43:11.480]  And of course it came out, Obama was on NPR.
[43:11.480 --> 43:14.920]  This is on Drudge today.
[43:14.920 --> 43:19.440]  And said, yeah, there's carbon taxes, we're going to save the earth from global warming
[43:19.440 --> 43:20.440]  in the TPP.
[43:20.440 --> 43:21.440]  That's why we've got to do it.
[43:21.440 --> 43:24.760]  Of course that's in there.
[43:24.760 --> 43:30.040]  Senators have already leaked what's in it, gun control, open borders, world government.
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.080]  And the worst part is, it's a blank check written open-ended.
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  There it is.
[43:37.080 --> 43:44.320]  Obama admits climate change will be in Obama trade.
[43:44.320 --> 43:50.120]  This is all in there because it has to line up with the European Union rules and it has
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.040]  to line up with all the NAU stuff.
[43:52.040 --> 43:57.240]  I've got the EU documents, I've got the NAU documents, it will be the same thing, folks.
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.600]  That's how I told you what was in it before it got released because it's a long-term plan.
[44:02.600 --> 44:13.600]  I know the whole stinking thing up one side and down the other.
[44:13.600 --> 44:14.600]  People are like, why are you so upset?
[44:14.600 --> 44:19.080]  I mean, I don't know if our government would have stood down to Japan in World War II and
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.520]  just invited Imperial Japan in to take over, I'd be upset.
[44:22.520 --> 44:25.720]  Or if we would have stood down in World War I, I guess, and invited the Germans in to
[44:25.720 --> 44:27.200]  take over or something, I'd be upset.
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.920]  Or if we would have stepped down and said, Stalin's going to take over America, I'd
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.920]  be saying it was wrong.
[44:32.920 --> 44:38.240]  But because it's a bunch of corporations and the media won't tell you about it, I mean,
[44:38.240 --> 44:45.240]  this is incredible that they would be doing this.
[44:45.240 --> 44:48.120]  And again, there is something wrong with me.
[44:48.120 --> 44:51.960]  Because I'm upset that all over the place they're announcing, yeah, we're not going
[44:51.960 --> 44:54.080]  to give old people medical care.
[44:54.080 --> 45:00.600]  Yeah, you know what, maybe we should kill babies up to age five.
[45:00.600 --> 45:07.160]  Yeah, you know what?
[45:07.160 --> 45:11.360]  We're going to lower the blood alcohol level down to half a beer and then put you in jail
[45:11.360 --> 45:12.360]  for it.
[45:12.360 --> 45:15.840]  It's not about keeping you safe on the road, it's about getting everybody in the prison
[45:15.840 --> 45:17.640]  system.
[45:17.640 --> 45:23.360]  This country and this world has learned how to steal and how to scam and how to bamboozle,
[45:23.360 --> 45:25.440]  not how to build anything anymore.
[45:25.440 --> 45:29.840]  And we're now reaching the tipping point into total corruption when everything unravels
[45:29.840 --> 45:33.800]  and falls apart and hell on earth gets released.
[45:33.800 --> 45:42.480]  And the giant hordes of moralists, mindless, dumb, pack-minded, tribal-minded people will
[45:42.480 --> 45:49.800]  be organized into giant criminal hordes by the government to rob and steal everything
[45:49.800 --> 45:55.800]  and the youth will be turned loose into arrogant, power-tripping, politically correct, modern
[45:55.800 --> 46:03.280]  red brigades to just run around robbing and clubbing and stealing and raping and just
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.640]  pleasuring themselves on the carcass of humanity.
[46:08.640 --> 46:10.400]  Read the Bible.
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.120]  Your women will be put above you when you're cursed, your children will be put above you,
[46:15.120 --> 46:21.100]  you will be enslaved, you will lose all your prosperity, you will be driven into the dirt
[46:21.100 --> 46:25.640]  and then everything will collapse and the children will just ride around in dirt piles
[46:25.640 --> 46:40.120]  throwing fit, starving to death, cursing those that fed them.
[46:40.120 --> 46:42.240]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the news.
[46:42.240 --> 46:44.560]  Jade Helm 15 has already begun.
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.760]  Training likely linked to Jade Helm begins in other states.
[46:46.760 --> 46:49.080]  Yeah, it's been going on intensely.
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.400]  Powerful report on infowars.com.
[46:52.400 --> 46:57.240]  One of the free police and prosecutors fight aggressively to retain barbaric right of civil
[46:57.240 --> 46:58.520]  asset forfeiture.
[46:58.520 --> 47:05.840]  This isn't like how they sold it in the 80s, you know, that they bust some kingpin in Miami
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.480]  who's got a $50 million house and $100 million in the bank and it's all cocaine money and
[47:10.480 --> 47:13.040]  then that gets seized.
[47:13.040 --> 47:20.600]  No, it's, you pull an old lady over and she's got $2,000 and you just take it or on Amtrak's
[47:20.600 --> 47:25.640]  you got $5,000, they just take it and now they're taking jewelry off your fingers.
[47:25.640 --> 47:33.920]  It's just highwaymen, it's train robbers and this is what the feds got the states to do.
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.920]  Then when the states passed laws doing it, the feds came in as the savers and said, no,
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.360]  we're going to lobby to have state laws changed and sue people until asset forfeiture is only
[47:42.360 --> 47:46.600]  a federal program and then the feds give 80 plus percent of the money back to the state
[47:46.600 --> 47:52.560]  to federalize them and that's all that is really about.
[47:52.560 --> 48:00.200]  I mean do I care if some scumbag, pimp, drug dealer gets his Corvette taken away?
[48:00.200 --> 48:04.400]  Not really on the surface but then that corrupts the police and incentivizes them to keep the
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.000]  drug war going when the government and the big corporation ship the drugs in as a destabilization
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.320]  effort.
[48:13.320 --> 48:20.440]  That says Yemen help direct Al Qaeda, we're going to break that now.
[48:20.440 --> 48:26.320]  It's all coming up today, we have Lord Monkton joining us on the big victory that the EU
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.800]  is now in deep trouble because people are thinking why are we under the EU?
[48:30.800 --> 48:34.200]  We never got to vote, that was supposed to just be a trade deal, see it's the same thing
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.200]  with TPP.
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.240]  They never want to discuss how it's foreign, how it's shadow, how it's secret, how the
[48:39.240 --> 48:44.160]  bill's secret, how the agreements are secret because they don't want to have a discussion.
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.440]  We force the discussion, we've already done it, from this doesn't exist to oh it's good
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.760]  for you, don't worry about it, it's secret.
[48:53.760 --> 49:01.040]  We've already come that far and let me tell you once you identify that there's criminals
[49:01.040 --> 49:03.720]  running things, it's game over.
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.800]  They're going to try tyranny, they're going to try takeovers, listen they would have already
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.160]  carried out false flags to blame it on the Tea Party but they're scared, we've got people
[49:12.160 --> 49:18.160]  in every federal agency, every police department, every shop, every store, there are patriots
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.640]  that know the paradigm with video cameras everywhere and not even an internet kill switch
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.320]  is going to save you when you pull off some big new 9-11 or nuclear 9-11 and we catch
[49:28.320 --> 49:30.120]  you doing it.
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.800]  Hell, even if you didn't do it, the people are going to blame you.
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.440]  You know that, right, because you did it so much before, it's like if you're a convicted
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.680]  child molester, three-time loser and you've gotten out after 30 years in prison and a
[49:43.680 --> 49:49.360]  kid gets raped on the street, you're going to get blamed, perp, even if you didn't do
[49:49.360 --> 49:59.360]  it this time, you understand so you go ahead and pull off those false flags scum.
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.920]  I'll ask why I get so vicious and nasty and mean and I've psychoanalyzed it, I was traumatized
[50:05.920 --> 50:10.840]  as a young man growing up in Dallas, Texas and you could say it made me who I am or you
[50:10.840 --> 50:17.440]  could say it made me a nasty person or whatever, I was in a lot of rough situations but the
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.480]  point is, is that at least I'm not these jellyfish that don't recognize tyranny when they see
[50:21.480 --> 50:27.800]  it, I've seen it and I know to stand up against it and I know these nasty people have to be
[50:27.800 --> 50:34.120]  met with nastiness right back, their intimidation, their arrogance, their con artist game is
[50:34.120 --> 50:35.120]  over.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.640]  Who's going to stand up for the kids they're grabbing for snuff films?
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.600]  Who's going to stand up against the Hollywood folks at their death parties?
[50:43.600 --> 50:51.280]  Remember Chuck Norris' son in here talking about Hollywood and all the bad stuff he's

[51:29.920 --> 51:33.680]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[51:33.680 --> 51:34.680]  IRAs?
[51:34.680 --> 51:38.600]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[51:38.600 --> 51:40.200]  of gold for your retirement.

[53:52.840 --> 54:11.160]  I want to be clear, the United States has already been taken over, already in the NAU,
[54:11.160 --> 54:16.720]  already merged with the EU and Asian Union and that's in all the different globalist
[54:16.720 --> 54:18.920]  BAMP Canada and other documents that have come out.
[54:18.920 --> 54:23.080]  I talk about BAMP all the time because it was thousands of pages and I actually read hundreds
[54:23.080 --> 54:27.240]  of them and it was all, we've got to do this by stealth, we'll use terrorism and the flu
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.160]  to take over and merge everything and then we'll get the politicians to join our ranks
[54:31.160 --> 54:38.480]  and it was like Fortune 500, over 100 companies there voting and then the leaders of the US,
[54:38.480 --> 54:46.320]  Canada and Mexico would then vote off their orders at the secret meeting.
[54:46.320 --> 54:51.640]  That's how this works and it just broke at infowars.com, red-linked.
[54:51.640 --> 54:57.240]  Trans-Pacific partnership emails show CEO joked about making royalty payments to US officials.
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.240]  These are our rules, Brad, the chemical company boss and the emails are now through foyer
[55:02.240 --> 55:03.320]  request.
[55:03.320 --> 55:11.280]  You see, they've made the TPP secret but then you can do foyers to the United States trade
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.160]  representatives and others and then get the sub documents.
[55:15.160 --> 55:18.240]  That's why they're now having hearings in Congress, I saw them yesterday about just
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.680]  basically getting rid of foyer saying there's so many, we just can't respond anymore.
[55:25.680 --> 55:31.920]  Years ago I sent off for my FBI file and they said, we're too busy, they violated federal
[55:31.920 --> 55:35.400]  law, I have a lawyer doing it right now.
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.120]  My lawyer said, you know, they may come after you for this and he goes, yeah, now they come
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.160]  after people that do their foyer, well good, come after me, like you did all those little
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.120]  kids, you'd rip and blow their heads off, I mean, you people are sick freaks, you're
[55:48.120 --> 55:53.000]  a bunch of crooks, I don't care what you do anymore, I'm not ever going to back down
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.920]  from you scum, I mean, you're a bunch of scum.
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.080]  I'll cover this more in the next hour Lord Monkton, I'm going to settle down, speaking
[56:04.080 --> 56:10.160]  of snuff films, here's the clip from TMZ, we'll put the article on screen too about
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.880]  the snuff stuff and that's what all this crush porn and all of it is.
[56:13.880 --> 56:19.840]  That's all just hating life and it's just sick, a former Scorpions bass player admits
[56:19.840 --> 56:24.200]  to attending snuff parties, by the way, I just love the Scorpions, he said he hated
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.720]  it but still he should have done more and spoke out then, it just makes me sick now
[56:27.720 --> 56:36.440]  when I hear him come on the radio, briefly, we fund this operation with t-shirts, books,
[56:36.440 --> 56:42.680]  films, high quality water filters, HD firearms, dot com, super high quality assault rifles
[56:42.680 --> 56:49.520]  made in America, the best out there for the price, acfirearms.com, infoorstore.com, we
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.560]  are running out of X2 faster than I thought, Weldon and Anthony came in and said the numbers
[56:54.560 --> 56:59.400]  show it will be sold out by Sunday night at this rate and we think it will only be a few
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.360]  weeks until we get a small supply back in that's being manufactured right now but then
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.800]  the crystals are basically out and so it can be a month, six months a year, maybe never,
[57:10.800 --> 57:19.040]  so maybe quicker, I don't know, it's up in the air, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139,
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.880]  read up on Iodine, it's serious business, this is the best cleanest out there and it's
[57:23.880 --> 57:28.360]  just done wonders for myself and others but it's powerful so be sure and check what the
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.680]  adverse reactions can be especially if you're already unbalanced, so read about all that,
[57:32.680 --> 57:40.720]  talk to your physician or healthcare provider before using infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.200]  we've got the DNA force, we've got the supermellosuprafemovitality, all of it is knock your socks
[57:45.200 --> 57:46.880]  off hard core.
[57:46.880 --> 57:51.920]  Let's go out to break here with a clip from Mark Dice breaking this down, back to the
[57:51.920 --> 57:56.160]  next segment I'm going to air Mark Dice's whole report because it really brings a lot
[57:56.160 --> 57:59.880]  of context to it, he has a way of just saying stuff right down to the point, not kind of
[57:59.880 --> 58:02.640]  pontificating like I do but here's a clip.
[58:02.640 --> 58:09.800]  Rikerman originally from Germany bumped into a paparazzi from TMZ who asked him about Berlin's
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.800]  popular fetish parties and this was his stunning response.
[58:14.800 --> 58:24.800]  Was it like a donkey show or no actually you know I think they actually kill people there
[58:24.800 --> 58:30.480]  and stuff, they pay like up to like 100,000 people to see people get executed, I'm not
[58:30.480 --> 58:31.480]  kidding.
[58:31.480 --> 58:36.840]  Yeah well the Romans did that and the Babylonians did that and the ancient Chinese did that
[58:36.840 --> 58:42.840]  and everybody else the Mesoamericans did it, the Druids did it, I mean this is sick.
[58:42.840 --> 58:48.680]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:48.680 --> 58:52.600]  Ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors
[58:52.600 --> 58:57.720]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website infolwars.com because
[58:57.720 --> 59:02.440]  the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as
[59:02.440 --> 59:07.720]  affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over
[59:07.720 --> 59:08.720]  the years.
[59:08.720 --> 59:14.880]  Well then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com, own
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.760]  and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots,
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.600]  their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast, it's always
[59:23.600 --> 59:27.200]  about security whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.560]  Go to their website hdfirearms.com, buy right off their website and they'll just send it
[59:31.560 --> 59:35.760]  to the FFL dealer of your choice, you can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it
[59:35.760 --> 59:41.680]  up at the local sporting goods store, whatever you do get your head down firearm today.

[59:51.400 --> 01:00:04.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:11.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:20.160]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.520]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.160]  I guess I'm a snuff of a, but I'm not cool enough to think young men and women they grab
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:36.160]  off the street, usually young trendies thinking they're moving to Berlin or LA to make it
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160]  big.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.200]  I guess I'm not cool because I'm not into pedophilia, I'm not into torturing people
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.000]  to death.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:50.360]  I am in hunting down people that are involved in stuff like this at a very fundamental level.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:57.120]  But I wouldn't even take pleasure in seeing these people executed anymore and I take pleasure
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.880]  on shooting a weasel getting in the in-house.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:06.040]  But these are predators, this is who rules our planet, they're set up a world government
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.280]  so they can carry out their operations publicly and be above the law and so they can be above
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.200]  God's law and achieve life extension.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]  That's their holy grail.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.920]  But I guess supposedly if you had the holy grail you live forever.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.600]  As science fiction becomes reality, let's go ahead and play Mark Dice's report.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.360]  I'll show you the video clip of him admitting it out of his own mouth in just a second.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.400]  The former bassist from the Scorpions, Ralph Rykerman, has admitted that he once attended
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.680]  a snuff party where someone or multiple people were murdered for the entertainment of the
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.600]  guests who paid up to $100,000 to attend.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:54.880]  Rykerman originally from Germany bumped into a paparazzi from TMZ who asked him about Berlin's
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.640]  popular fetish parties and this was his stunning response.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:22.240]  Says he's not kidding, you can see the look on his face looks pretty freaked out.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:28.360]  Which brings to mind the allegations made by former Senator John DeKamp in his book
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:35.600]  The Franklin Cover-Up about supposed snuff films and child abuse that is alleged to have
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:43.520]  occurred inside the Bohemian Grove by Illuminati members and Ollister Crowley fans and black
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:51.240]  satanic sex magic practitioners back in the 1980s around the same time when the Scorpions
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.400]  were in their heyday.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.520]  They were very popular, songs like Wind of Change, Rock You Like a Hurricane and Still
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:08.040]  Loving You, but one of their album covers, Virgin Killer, features child pornography
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.160]  which was sanctioned and approved by RCA Records.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:18.960]  So it shouldn't be that surprising that such sick individuals who would put such things
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:26.240]  on their album cover would be rubbing elbows with such sick satanic people that they would
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.120]  be throwing parties where people would get murdered for the entertainment of the guests.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.560]  Ralph Rykerman also hinted that there was even something worse that happened at the
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:47.800]  parties when he said this.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  Was he talking about possible child abuse as outlined in the Franklin Cover-Up?
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.680]  Such allegations don't seem that far-fetched when you understand the sick satanic black
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:10.720]  magic-practitioning scum within the Illuminati and his stunning admission really should be
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.960]  investigated by the FBI.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:44.760]  This is a form of their entertainment.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:05:04.720]  And today's top stories for June 5th, 2015, TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches final
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.120]  push for votes.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.060]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Package, is beginning to
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:16.360]  unravel with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:21.400]  over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand-big corporations
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.400]  new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.560]  Hunting for hackers, NSA secretly expands internet spying at U.S. border, article by
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.040]  New York Times.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.480]  Without public notice or debate, the Obama administration has expanded the NSA's warless
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:41.360]  surveillance of Americans' international internet traffic according to a classified NSA document.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:46.280]  In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers wrote two secret memos permitting the spy agency
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:52.000]  to begin hunting on internet cables without a warrant and on American soil for data linked
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.160]  to computer intrusions originating abroad.

[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520]  Good, brother.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.520]  I just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.520]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.520]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.520]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:18.520]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.520]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.520]  We did the supermail and the superfemale vitality.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.520]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.520]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.520]  They've got a ton of money there.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.520]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520]  harvested around the planet,
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.520]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.520]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.520]  Just cover that up for a while,
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.520]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.520]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.520]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.520]  That she was a keynote speaker at.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.520]  She was actually there attending it with the vice president.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.520]  And he wrote an article about it.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.520]  The fact that he brought up Bilderberg to her
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.520]  and how she had helped keep the UK out of the European Union
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.520]  and that she said that she was very, very proud of that
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.520]  and that she was most proud of that
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.520]  and that basically it was treasonous.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.520]  Well, the UK was sucked into the EU by the so-called trade deal,
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.520]  just like the TPP.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.520]  And details were kept secret.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.520]  They weren't allowed to vote on it.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.520]  Just as we're now seeing their prime minister, our president,
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.520]  was, quote, given the unconstitutional authority
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.520]  under either country's laws to sign on to it.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.520]  And now we know because of a statement
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.520]  President Obama made on NPR that's on InfoWars.com
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.520]  and Drogerport.com today that indeed there is carbon taxes.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:31.520]  There is, quote, global warming initiatives in the TPP agreement.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:37.520]  There is draconian manipulation of our borders, quotas on refugees.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  It's the same thing that's in the EU or the NAU.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.520]  It's the same group.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.520]  And we're very honored to have Lord Christopher Monkton,
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.520]  who was on record, a major newspaper editor and vener,
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.520]  chief advisor to Margaret Thatcher,
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.520]  the founder of UKIP, the fastest growing party in the UK and in Europe.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520]  Of course, they're big stars, Nigel Farage,
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.520]  I'm going to guess many times here.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520]  He heads up scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.520]  We normally have him on as the leading expert,
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  exposing Al Gore and the carbon tax fraud.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.520]  And there's new documents out today that NASA was ordered to fix
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.520]  the decline in temperature just as East Anglia got caught in climategate doing.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.520]  But we're not going to get into that today.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.520]  I wanted to get Lord Monkton on and I appreciate him taking the time out to do it
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:34.520]  on this Friday evening UK time to discuss what it's like to have fought this,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.520]  held it back as her advisor, he was the guy,
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:44.520]  who found UKIP decades ago to try to get them then out of the EU,
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.520]  the dictatorial EU that makes 80 plus percent of UK laws without a vote.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.520]  And to now have the BBC News headline,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.520]  Germany's Merkel opened the EU treaty changes for UK to keep them in,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.520]  AP, EU ways, unprecedented reform, as Britain threatens to leave.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:07.520]  The TPP, the EU, it's all heads of the same globalist multinational hydra.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:17.520]  And sure, UKIP's forced the Tories to act like they're going to try to let the EU system be forced to a vote.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.520]  But it does show major progress in my view.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  And just look at the progress of founding UKIP.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520]  In fact, Lord Monkton, give us some of the history.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.520]  I'm going to give you the floor right now until we go to break about eight, nine minutes.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]  I mean, when did you found UKIP?
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.520]  Break it all down for folks and where we are today because this is so historical
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.520]  and it's got to feel really good for you to see this happening.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.520]  Well, UKIP was founded actually not by me, but it was founded 22 years ago.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  But you were one of the founders of UKIP, from what I've read online?
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]  I came quite late to the party, actually.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  It was founded by an academic called Alan Sked, who was concerned that we were no longer a democracy.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.520]  Our democracy had been taken away by stealth, piece by piece.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.520]  They had dismantled our democracy.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:16.520]  Now it's getting on for 90% of all laws made for us are made not by people we elect,
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520]  but they're made by people we don't elect.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.520]  The commissars, as the Germans call them, the people who meet behind closed doors are 30 of them.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.520]  Nobody knows really who they are.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:32.520]  Sherman, I want to give you the floor, but just to get it clear, you were there early on with Thatcher fighting it from my research.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.520]  And you were involved in the main launch of UKIP being successful.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.520]  Because from what I've read in newspapers, they say you and Nigel Farage are basically founders of it.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.520]  And I guess because you helped it become successful, they say that then.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.520]  I mean, certainly in Scotland, we've got it going.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.520]  We've now got our first representation north of the border.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.520]  I was leader of the party in Scotland when that happened.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.520]  We are making waves right throughout Britain.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:02.520]  We got an enormous percentage of the vote at the last general election, but didn't get more than one parliamentary seat.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.520]  Because when you first begin a breakthrough at this time, you don't get many seats.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.520]  And then you build on that.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.520]  And next time we'll get a little more.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  Because what's going to happen is there's going to be a bogus negotiation where Cameron and the other European members will get together.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:30.520]  They'll work out a few token concessions so that Cameron can then say to the people, well, I recommend that they've given us enough.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.520]  What they won't have given us is our democracy back.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.520]  And until they do, UKIP won't be satisfied.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:52.520]  So what we want to see is a right of the Parliament of Member States to vote down legislation proposed by the EU, unless and until the elected European Parliament,
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:59.520]  which at the moment doesn't even have the power to bring forward a bill, not much of a parliament that then, is given proper democratic power.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.520]  If it's not given enough power, then we would rather just leave.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  So we've made huge advances in the European elections.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.520]  We're now the largest party in Britain in the European Parliament.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.520]  We've made very big advances also in the British elections.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:24.520]  But we've now begun, rather surprisingly, to take votes almost as much from the Labour Party as from the Conservative Party.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:31.520]  Because one of the things that Nigel has brilliantly done is to broaden the appeal of the party.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.520]  So it's no longer just the intellectual, the academic concerned about our democracy.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.520]  It's only working people who are now becoming concerned about our democracy.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.520]  Well, that's very exciting.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.520]  But I mean, as somebody involved since the Thatcher administration, can you go back to the fight then?
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.520]  I mean, she was successful holding it back then.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.520]  Then they were able to ram it through by stealth because I'm comparing it to how they're trying to ram through the TPP the very same way.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.520]  Absolutely, they could not get through what eventually became the Maastricht Treaty,
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:08.520]  which was the one where we finally gave our control of our laws away forever.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.520]  They couldn't get that through while Margaret Thatcher was still in office.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.520]  They had to get rid of her before they could do it.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.520]  And it was the pro-European faction in the Cabinet that plotted against her to bring her down,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.520]  so that they could drag us in ever deeper into this mess of anti-democracy.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  And we fought that for as long as she was Prime Minister.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520]  They knew they couldn't get away with that.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:41.520]  She was very willing to work with our European partners on matters of common advantage.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.520]  But she was not willing to give away our democracy.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.520]  And she stood very firm and very strong and very clear on this.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.520]  And of course, it was very popular with the people.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:59.520]  She was re-elected three times with huge majorities, precisely because she had taken a tough line,
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:07.520]  a pro-British line and a pro-democracy line, because in her day the two things went together.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:10.520]  Now Cameron is not at the same stamp.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.520]  He's very different.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.520]  He is saying, well, you know, we want to stay in the European Union and he will do whatever it takes to do it.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.520]  It's not even clear that they will make sure that the referendum bill,
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.520]  which has to be passed before referendum can be held on this question,
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.520]  will pass the House of Lords because...
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.520]  Sure, but I mean, he is at least engaging in this lip service because of UKIP pressure, correct?
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.520]  Absolutely.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.520]  There's no doubt that had it not been for UKIP,
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.520]  he wouldn't even have made that promise before the last general election
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.520]  that this time he would give us a referendum...
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.520]  So it shows the issue is now becoming more and more popular.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.520]  People are more and more aware of it.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.520]  Now on the front page, there's no longer, can the establishment say,
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.520]  this is something you can sweep out of the carpet?
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.520]  No longer can they say, this is just a few cranks?
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.520]  That's what they said of us in the early days.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.520]  So isn't that a devastating victory for sovereignty worldwide?
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:13.520]  I think this is enormous because I think what's going to happen is that people worldwide will realize you can do this.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.520]  You can fight city hall on these democratic issues and you can win.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.520]  I want to end very briefly on one little point that you raised earlier
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.520]  about Tom Carl of the NOAA and fiddling the temperature data to try to pretend
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.520]  that there has been global warming over the last 18 years, six months,
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.520]  when the satellites show zero global warming over the last 18 years, six months.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.520]  How has he done this?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.520]  He's done it by fiddling the figures and he's fiddled them in a really clever way.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520]  But we've seen through it.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.520]  I've got a paper already up on the internet at what'supwiththat.com, WATTS,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:57.520]  upwiththat.com, which explains that since the oceans below the surface,
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:04.520]  which he's talking about, are warming at only one-fifth of the rate he says the surface is warming at,
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.520]  and because the air immediately above the surface he's talking about is not warming at all,
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.520]  the conclusion is that he is simply making it up.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.520]  His paper is, in fact, a breach of the laws of thermodynamics, which is how heat gets moved around.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.520]  If you make a sandwich like the barbecue you and I had when I came to visit you in Austin, Texas,
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.520]  and you put meat in the middle and bread either side, if the bread is colder than the meat,
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520]  the meat will cool down.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.520]  It will not stay hotter than the bread.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.520]  And what he's trying to say is that the surface in the middle of this sandwich between the air above and the ocean below
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520]  is hotter than both.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.520]  It can't be.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.520]  It's as simple as that.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520]  Incredible.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.520]  We've got one more segment, and I do want to segue into this because it's all interconnected.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.520]  We now know TPP, that's secret.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.520]  Basically, the Asian Union emerged with the EU, the American Union, with a trilateral plan.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.520]  We now know, Lord Monkton, as you know, that it does have that in it just outrageous.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:14.520]  Well, this is an enormous disgrace that Obama is insisting as the price of American cooperation
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.520]  in this and any other international agreement that the countries with whom he does business
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:25.520]  have to cow-tow to this climate monster by shutting down their major industries.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  And already your coal industry is on its knees.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.520]  Already your utilities are on their knees.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.520]  Already your aluminium smelters are going overseas.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.520]  Your steelworks are going overseas.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:44.520]  And paradoxically, therefore, emitting more CO2 because they operate under more inefficient overseas regimes than if they'd stayed at home.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520]  But he doesn't care.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.520]  These were the people who used to be the big donors for the Republican Party.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:20:00.520]  And this has nothing to do with the climate, but everything to do with Obama trying to destroy the funding of his political opponents.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.520]  It is as straightforward as that.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.520]  It's a mafia takeover.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:13.520]  It's like Hitler, for five years before he rounded him up, wouldn't let Jews and others run their shops to first make him destitute before he actually grabbed him.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.520]  You take people's power away before you kill them.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.520]  That's exactly what he's been trying to do, and that's the significance of Tom Carl's paper today.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.520]  After the break, I'll tell you a very funny story about me and Tom Carl in front of Congress.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.520]  Sure, I actually skipped the break, Lord Monkton, to give you more time.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.520]  Yeah, sure. Do you want to carry on now?
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.520]  Yeah, go ahead. I just skipped it. Go ahead.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:48.520]  Okay, fine. What we're going to do is about 2009 this was, I've been invited by the Republicans to testify as their witness in front of Congress, opposite Tom Carl, who of course was the Democrat's witness.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:21:01.520]  Tom Carl is the head of the national climatic data center, which is a subdivision of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, and it among other things keeps a global temperature record.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:10.520]  Now, I was explaining to Congress and I showed them a chart which demonstrated that for the eight previous years, there had actually been global cooling.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:18.520]  Now, representative Joe Barton of Texas, who was the Republican ranking member on the committee at that time, said to Tom Carl, he said,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.520]  but you and other officials have been coming here for months telling us we've got global warming.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.520]  Lord Monkton says there hasn't been any. In fact, it's been cooling for eight years.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:32.520]  Will you please explain why you never told us that, or is Lord Monkton lying to us?
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:41.520]  So Tom Carl flanneled like mad and said, oh, well, he wouldn't have done the thing the same way as I had done it. So Joe Barton cut him off and said,
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.520]  you're both to go away and write letters to the committee explaining your facts.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:57.520]  So all I did was to send a letter to the committee taking Tom Carl's own temperature data set, the NCDC temperature data set, and sure enough, for eight years, it showed global cooling.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:08.520]  He had tried to mislead Congress. He's now trying to mislead the world again, this time by pretending that there hasn't been this very long pause in global warming,
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:19.520]  clearing which for the last 18 years and six months, according to the satellite data that came out just two days ago, there has been no global warming at all,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:28.520]  not withstanding record increases in CO2 concentration. So we've got the CO2 concentration going through the roof.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.520]  In fact, it's now higher than it's been in 810,000 years.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:45.520]  Absolutely, sir. But I mean, before you go any further, just as a political researcher, the Club of Rome, all these inside robber bearing globalists are the opposite of free market corporations
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.520]  are at war with the free market segment and, quite frankly, taking it over, we're in deep trouble.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:57.520]  And so productivity is in deep trouble. They're in a consolidation period. We're being conquered, basically.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:04.520]  But even if carbon dioxide was bad, even if it was warming us up, even if all these lies were true, we always have that debate on the science,
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:14.520]  which I know is important and you've won that debate. They just keep stonewalling and separately, how does paying gore and blood carbon trading in London
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:22.520]  or paying with Chicago Mercantile that Obama is invested in and that Soros is invested in and an NM Rothschild?
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:33.520]  How does paying these billionaires, billions and billions and trillions in the aggregate, how does that save the earth when you move a thousand coal plants
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.520]  from the U.S. to Mexico and China where they have no controls and they're totally dirty and ours are clean?
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.520]  How? I mean, it's all a fraud. It's all a scam.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:56.520]  Because China overtook the United States just 10 years ago as the world's largest emitter and in 10 years has become twice as large
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  an emitter of CO2 as the United States. What does Obama do? He goes to his fellow communists last December in China and says,
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:13.520]  you can go on emitting as much CO2 as you like. I'm going to shut down the U.S. economy so you don't have to compete with it for natural resources.
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.520]  Unbelievable.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:19.520]  The turn of the Chinese and the Chinese have said, yeah, we're happy with that. Well, what's not to like?
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:30.520]  So what is happening here? You're quite right about these rich people who have clambered onto this climate bandwagon because this Alex is the fastest transfer
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:39.520]  of wealth and power from poor people worldwide to rich people worldwide in human history. That's what it's really all about.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.520]  And they package it as helping poor people.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:48.520]  Because as you said, they don't care about poor people. They care about them if they, if they're voters, otherwise they don't care about them at all.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  And even then, not much. They want to get rich. They have realized that by coming up with this ridiculous, increasingly visibly ridiculous climate mantra,
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:07.520]  they can get shovelfuls of cash. That's why Tom Karl comes out with these dopey papers and puts all those falsehoods in front of him.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:15.520]  Well, I mean, how many times can they get caught with fake data and fake data sets in the emails, you know, to hundreds of other groups faking everything?
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.520]  I mean, how many times can they get caught until they get into some type of trouble?
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.520]  I want you to answer that, police sir. And then in closing, what about Al Gore in a speech we played the clip last week in 2007,
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  getting his Nobel Prize or 2006, saying that the Antarctic ice cap will be completely gone by 2013, and now it's at record levels.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:39.520]  I mean, he's got to get caught saying polar bears are all dying when their numbers are up five-fold.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  That's right. The polar bear numbers are up. It's the Arctic ice cap he was talking about. And that is still there, very much still there.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.520]  You've got my piece now, I see, on the...
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.520]  What was he talking about? He was talking about Arctic. Yeah, the northern. I said the southern, sorry.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:26:00.520]  The Arctic ice is still there, even in the summer. And it wouldn't matter terribly much if it disappeared in the summer.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:08.520]  It's only going to disappear for a few weeks. Again, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that for the rest of the time it's got to be there because of the way the sun hits at an angle.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.520]  So all of these fictions are beginning to become more and more impossible.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:31.520]  That's the significance of Tom Carl's ludicrous paper, because what he is having to do is to produce so absurd a false result that even a layman like me can look at it and find the most obvious way of showing it's an absurd result,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:40.520]  which is if the air above the surface isn't warming, if the ocean below the surface is hardly warming, how can the surface itself be warming?
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:48.520]  That is, it can't. It's an offense against the laws of thermodynamics, the laws of how heat moves around in the system.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:54.520]  There is no way that his results can be corrected, is really as simple as that. And that's the point.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.520]  Are you saying 2 plus 2 doesn't really equal 5 like Common Core says?
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.520]  That's it. I'm saying 2 plus 2 still equals 4. Like it or not, Alex, I'm old-fashioned about these things.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:14.520]  What they are saying is they are now in desperation coming out with lies that are so absurd that you can knock them down in two minutes.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.520]  It doesn't even require detailed research to do it. And that's the point. They know that this Paris climate...
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.520]  So what are they going to do next and what's their next big power grab?
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:30.520]  The next big thing is the climate conference in Paris. The Paris climate conference is the real big one.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:37.520]  In December this year, it's the 23rd, I think it is, in a series of annual UN climate bedwetters conferences
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:45.520]  where tens of thousands of activists basically go there and a few dozen national negotiators go there.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:53.520]  And they now have in place a plan which will create what they're no longer going to call a global government.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:00.520]  The term government was used in the 2009 Copenhagen draft, which failed when China blew it out of the water.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:05.520]  But now China's been knobbled by Obama because he's exempted them from having to make any cut in emissions.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:13.520]  Whatever Paris actually does will make no difference to the climate, even if CO2 had an influence to the degree that they say it does,
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.520]  which we now know it doesn't. But they're still going to set up their global government.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:25.520]  They're calling it this time rather coily a governing body so that they can easily change it into a government later.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:35.520]  Exactly the same as the EU. It's the same model. They started by requiring that nations should report various data to them.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:42.520]  They then gradually increased the obligations to report so that you're having to spend vast amounts of money
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  collecting perfectly useless data about how much CO2 you emit and how much you scavenge back by plunging free and nonsensical stuff.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:59.520]  And they make the nations do that. Then they make the nations comply with various targets which the nations first of all voluntarily put forward
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.520]  and then gradually they become compulsory. That's the stage they're reaching now in Paris.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:13.520]  They have set up in the meantime something like a thousand new supranational bureaucracies to be the seniors of this global government.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.520]  They are already in place. They were put in place by the Cancun Treaty.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.520]  Lord Monkton, we're going to have to have you back up in the near future to break all that down.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.520]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org. You're on the front line of fighting global tyranny.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:33.520]  And we salute you for your great work with the UKIP and others on forcing and awakening to the fact that you're under EU dictatorship.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.520]  Thank you so much. Great job. Have a great weekend.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.520]  Thank you very much. And God bless you. God bless America.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:43.520]  We will keep the world free whether the powers that be like it or not.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.520]  Who are out of that? We'll be back. Tons of news straight ahead.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:30:04.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:23.520]  Talk about a major shift in narrative. Since the beginning of Syria's so-called civil war,
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:30.520]  the Obama administration has funded and armed radical Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:36.520]  Last February, the president even handed the Free Syrian Army the ability to order U.S. airstrikes.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:45.520]  And one jihadist told Al Jazeera in 2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving shipments from the U.S.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:51.520]  Well, that's when the U.S. isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS territory.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.520]  So who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria?
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:16.520]  The full story at infowars.com.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:33.520]  Alex Jones here. For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist,

[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:08.520]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:13.520]  to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:23.520]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:39.520]  I have sure better start from the beginning.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.520]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:49.520]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.520]  Rocatory containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:02.520]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.520]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.520]  For example, the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.520]  We have to work the dark side all the way while spending time in the shadows.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:26.520]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well, join me. I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.520]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:45.520]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:08.520]  Coming up, we have the lawyer who authored the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Treaty.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:18.520]  He also went to the quasi-classified Harvard PhD program and only has one PhD a year that Kissinger and others have gone through.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.520]  He was given the inside scoop on how stuff really operates.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.520]  Francis A. Boyle's coming on because he's an expert on the anthrax attacks that happened.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.520]  He can get into the Pentagon mailing anthrax all over the U.S. and all over the world, weaponize anthrax.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  What's really behind that? Then we'll get his breakdown on the TPP, on all the news coming out and the documents coming out that the West is running.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:50.520]  These Syrian rebels, including the, quote, radicals that make up the vast majority, while saying that we should all give up our freedoms to be protected from the very radicals that they run.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.520]  So that is coming up for 30 minutes of the next hour, just like Monkton joined us for half-hour.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:03.520]  Then in that last half-hour, I've got a special report that Cary Jackson did dealing with just the out-of-control corruption with big charities.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:11.520]  And how United Way, Red Cross, and others keep more than half the money. They give money to gun control, you name it.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.520]  But because there's too big to fail, people will just keep giving them money.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.520]  And it's the same thing that we see across the board.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:30.520]  Meanwhile, they're talking about Senator Marco Rubio's wife, and he both have, together, since they've been married more than a decade, 17 traffic infractions.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.520]  What is that, less than one a year?
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:41.520]  I don't like Rubio for open borders, being anti-gun, being a globalist, being pro-big brother.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:49.520]  Attacking them off, but it just shows how, oh look, 17 traffic infractions. Oh my gosh, this is amazing.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:57.520]  Oh my, that's really big news. Did you hear about Jenner? Yeah, he wears a wig now. Wow.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.520]  Why don't they call all the guys from Police Academy where they dress up like women and got beer?
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:07.520]  It's not going to give them Nobel Prizes or something.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:16.520]  It's not that I'm even bashing the guy that thinks he's a woman, it's that it's the top story in the country for the last few weeks, and it just doesn't even matter, it's stupid.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:21.520]  Like stories about traffic tickets.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:31.520]  While we're going under a global treaty, the TPP, that codifies every nightmare you can imagine into law.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:39.520]  But before I go any further, I want to get into this whole soccer situation. I've talked to them about it, but now it's really clear.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:49.520]  Just a week ago it was a conspiracy theory to say that the U.S. was doing this, the people that run the U.S. were doing this, to claw away the World Cup from Russia.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.520]  Now they say that's in question whether they'll get the World Cup.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:02.520]  I tell you what, we can clean up soccer when you clean up the NFL and boxing and everything else that's so corrupt in this country.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:09.520]  And it seems like, yeah, America's going to get us the game.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.520]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:25.520]  They pay, the city of Austin paid hundreds of millions of dollars to build the F1 track outside town and give Eccleston, or Steen, or whatever you say it, Eccleston.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.520]  So he could give his daughters each $400 million houses or whatever.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:43.520]  And look, if it wasn't taxpayer money from all over the world, where they give them the land, pay for everything, then he gives deals to the politicians locally to get some of the money back through corporate deals, he gives them.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.520]  I mean, this corruption is endemic.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:39:00.520]  So it's the equivalent going after the soccer federation of going after Ribeo for parking tickets.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.520]  But don't worry, the NBA says no suggestion of FIFA style corruption of basketball.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.520]  Oh, even when you get cities to build you these billion dollar stadiums, multi-billion dollar in the case of football.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:16.520]  And then I got to pay for it, just like I got to pay for sex changes, abortions.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:24.520]  Now if I'm not making people pay for nose jobs, I don't want to pay for you chopping your nose off.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.520]  Meanwhile, I know so many people having their houses taken by the IRS because they've lost their jobs and can't pay.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.520]  And then people getting kicked off Social Security and not can't get health care.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.520]  They go in and say, where's my free health care?
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.520]  And they laugh at them.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.520]  Obamacare in free health care, scum.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.520]  How about a double or triple your prices?
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.520]  They got rid of the charity care now under Obamacare.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:52.520]  They don't have to give you health care at charity hospitals anymore that run as profit centers.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.520]  Most hospitals are charity hospitals.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.520]  That's how it was always run.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.520]  We had the best health care in the world until 50 years ago.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.520]  Government corporations got involved, insurance companies got involved.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520]  Now it's really bad.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.520]  We got still some amazing health care sometimes, but the system itself is out of control.
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:18.520]  And then people think we're going to get reformed by a group of crooks like Boehner and Obozo.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:26.520]  And again, I like to call him Obama or whatever, but really he's very successful.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:32.520]  So I want to play John Bowne's report on this because it is a major distraction.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:40.520]  Then I'm going to get into when is it a crime to withdraw money from your bank and more.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.520]  Here is that report.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:53.520]  We are here to announce the unsealing of charges and the arrests of individuals as part of our long-running investigation into bribery and corruption in the world of organized soccer.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:58.520]  It must have been, let's pretend we work for the American People Day over at the Department of Justice.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:05.520]  Newly appointed United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the hammer on World Cup soccer executives,
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:14.520]  issuing warrants for their arrest regarding the accumulation of over $150 million received by employing methods of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:20.520]  The head of the snake of this notorious soccer empire, Sepp Blatter, will of course remain untouched.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:35.520]  Bread and circus historically serves as a huge distraction while the real criminals mingle in smoke-filled rooms holding the puppet strings of law enforcement that knows full well how they arrived at their position and where the real line is drawn.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:48.520]  And so it goes, while the world watches soccer executives scurrying out like rats, no arrests, no warrants, nothing is done to the instigators of a far greater recent scandal that dealt punishing blows to the economy.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:54.520]  Six banks have agreed to pay a combined $5.8 billion to the Justice Department and other regulators.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.520]  Five of them have pled guilty to criminal charges.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:08.520]  City Corp. J.P. Morgan, Barclays and RPS are pleading guilty to charges tied to forex manipulation while UBS is pleading guilty to interest rate manipulation charges.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:19.520]  They have each agreed to a three-year corporate probation period, no scurrying executives, no impending jail time, just a laughable corporate probation period and fines.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.520]  Who cares if executives of the most powerful banks colluded on rigging interest rates to make billions of dollars?
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:41.520]  The DOJ doesn't seem to mind that the Department of Defense spent $4 million on taxpayer-funded credit cards for personal charges, including $3.2 million of it at casinos, and $100,000 at strip clubs by 646 government cardholders.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:49.520]  While the average American family is seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket, the government throws away billions per year on waste and fraud.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:43:00.520]  Those very same officials spending our taxpayer dollars will be right on board once the cash trough is replaced by digital currency, and that is coming sooner than most people think.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:09.520]  A new age of economic totalitarianism, as highlighted by economist Martin Armstrong, is being discussed with Zeal in secret meetings in London.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.520]  Armstrong writes,
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:23.520]  This idea of eliminating cash first floated as the normal trial balloon to see how the people would take it. Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and William Buter, the chief economist at Citigroup, first launched the concept.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:30.520]  Their claims have been widely hailed and their papers are now the foundation for the new age of economic totalitarianism that confronts us.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:38.520]  Rogoff and Buter have laid the groundwork for the end of much of our freedom, and one day will be considered the new marks with hindsight.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:46.520]  Considerations of their arguments have shown how governments can seize all economic power and destroy cash in the process of eliminating all rights.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:54.520]  Physical paper money provides the check against negative interest rates, for if they become too great, people will simply withdraw their funds and hoard cash.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:44:04.520]  Furthermore, paper currency allows for bank runs. Eliminate paper currency and what you end up with is the elimination of the ability to demand to withdraw funds from a bank.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.520]  Our defense department squanders billions of taxpayer dollars.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:14.520]  We wanted to know how much taxpayer money the government spends on these mysterious micro purchases, so we found out.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.520]  Our review found about 20 billion dollars in just about the course of a year.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:28.520]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in DC for their micro purchase shopping lists and all refused.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:36.520]  The same codder of criminals that crashed the economy in 2008 were merely slapped on the old wrist after being caught rigging interest rates.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:53.520]  And world governments are colluding to imprison the population with a digital currency that will enslave anyone that doesn't adhere to the impending new world order system run by a group of elite scum that would become far more powerful than anything we have ever imagined in our worst nightmares.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:01.520]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, as it is called, is an all-out assault on our national sovereignty.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:17.520]  It would unconstitutionally transfer legislative powers from the U.S. Congress, our state legislatures, our city and county governments, to multinational corporations and unaccountable international bureaucrats at the World Trade Organization.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:24.520]  Americans are still off in La La Land thinking that the United States has the sovereignty.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:39.520]  You know, the International Organization of Securities Commission regulates our market, and there's a Basel Commission on Banking and BIS, which bank international settlements.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:52.520]  The Federal Reserve is part of BIS, it regulates banking, you know, the International Criminal Court of Europe has jurisdiction over here in the United States.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:00.520]  So the American people need to wake up that the sovereignty of the United States is gone.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:03.520]  Global government's not coming, it's here.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.520]  Exactly.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:13.520]  But twisting a few media moguls' arms to squeeze out bribes within an industry built on kicking a ball around a field is far more important.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:40.520]  John Bowne, Infowars.com.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.520]  I want to go through news as much as I can.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.520]  I mentioned the war on cash.
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.520]  When is it a crown to withdraw money from your own bank account?
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.520]  I want to get into this Paul Watson article that's huge.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.520]  TPP emails show CEO joked about making royalty payments to U.S. officials.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.520]  I'm going to say these are our rules.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:08.520]  Brad Chemical Company boss on how they're basically writing the international law that you can't see.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.520]  So we'll get to all that.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:20.520]  But there's a Fox News story here that I could spend 10 hours on because I call this a Rosetta Stone article.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.520]  And I talk about this maybe once a week, something I say is a Rosetta Stone.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.520]  It's a decoder.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.520]  You read this article, you understand everything, how they work, how they operate.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:41.520]  Even Fox News reports, like, is it reasonable, is it not reasonable, that 11-year-old girls were taken to a lesbian-slash-gay porn shop,
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.520]  porno movies, sex toys, everything.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.520]  And the school said it's okay because it's alternative.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:57.520]  See, if they were teaching heterosexual sex to third graders, it'd be called pedophilia and it is.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:03.520]  But when you bring this whole gay thing in, it's all right.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.520]  So we'll grab that news report and play the next segment.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:23.520]  This is the sexualization of our children and this is cults of basically pedophiles from Dennis Hastert on down that are coming after our children.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:30.520]  And when heterosexuals do it, they get locked up.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:36.520]  When homosexuals do it, they get called goddesses and worshipped.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:39.520]  And this is what the takeover is.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:40.520]  Star Tribune's also reporting it.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.520]  We're not joking.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.520]  I mean, full-on sex shop folks, 11-year-old girls.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.520]  Imagine in America.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.520]  And by the way, I can't even say some of the stuff we know that WorldNet Daily reported on years ago.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:49:04.520]  Stations would complain when I would read articles about what 10, 11, and 12-year-old boys and girls in Rhode Island and other states.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:12.520]  Or in one case, were taken to a college dorm and put in beds.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:18.520]  And then taught stuff I didn't know about till I was in college.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.520]  It's pedophilia.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.520]  That's not my view.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.520]  That's what it is to take.
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:35.520]  I mean, if you go up in a park and try to show a hustler magazine to an 11-year-old girl, folks, you're going to go to jail for 10 years and you should.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:42.520]  But you take them and you show them a bunch of women naked together and a bunch of men naked together, then it's trendy.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520]  It's the same thing.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.520]  These people need to be indicted.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.520]  And it's just part of the course.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.520]  I see this all the time.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.520]  The smitten kitten.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.520]  By the way, any of these stores have got everything in them.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.520]  So to claim, oh, it's progressive, it's okay.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:15.520]  Again, that's the political correctness is an excuse for people to do whatever they want, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:21.520]  Absolutely, totally and completely over the top.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.520]  Over the top.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.520]  You're an adult.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.520]  Do whatever you want, long as you don't hurt somebody else.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:31.520]  You keep your hands off kids.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:37.520]  Briefly, infowarslife.com has survival shield Mason Island X2 that you've heard people go crazy about it.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:40.520]  So folks are so deficient in it.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:46.520]  But if your thyroid is full of a bunch of stuff, I mean, get ready for some serious, serious stuff to go on and consult your physician.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.520]  This is the real deal.

[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:06.520]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our U.S. politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:20.520]  They can feel better too.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:26.520]  You know I come up with the music list here on the show.
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.520]  That's why it's hard for me to turn the music off.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:41.520]  It's not like listening to it.
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:45.520]  That's a good point.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  Globalists think they're insulated from all their corruption that they're putting on us,
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:58.520]  but history shows they'll always end up getting run over by their own system.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.520]  Ooh, don't they help themselves?
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:09.520]  Just like Obamacare, the insurance companies just last year had almost a 50% increase in profit.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.520]  Was it 48?
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.520]  Just off US Obamacare.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:22.520]  Insurance companies worldwide, 7.5 billion people, insurance companies all over the world,
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:31.520]  48% increase in profits globally, off screwing over American taxpayers.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:40.520]  A global tax on the USA of chumps.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:49.520]  I think our country's been exceptional, I love our republic, but I am ashamed of our nation.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:56.520]  And I get up here and I talk about how I'm ashamed of it and run it down so we can change it.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.520]  It's like telling your kid if they're being a slob, you're acting like a slob cleaning up your room.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.520]  But I mean it's gotten to the point where the gay and lesbian agenda,
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:09.520]  not of the average person that's gay or lesbian out there, I want to make that clear.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:16.520]  But of the people driving it, is to take people's kids and sexualize them and have their way with them.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:23.520]  I mean, girls 11 to 13 were taken on the field trip.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.520]  I'm going to cover this more at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:34.520]  I'll get to Jacare's report as well, but it just shows how whacked out everything is.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:42.520]  And it was a liberal holistic school for K through 12 with emphasis on the democratic process,
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:50.520]  individualized instruction, academic freedom, self-motivation, cooperative learning, youth empowerment,
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.520]  and environmental stewardship, hardcore liberal.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.520]  So you took them to a smut shop.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  God almighty.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:06.520]  That just shows the unbelievable, I mean I have an 11-year-old daughter,
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.520]  and I'm not a violent person, but if someone took my 11-year-old daughter to a porn shop,
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:21.520]  I don't care who it is, what color they were, if it was a school, an individual, anybody,
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  I would call the police, but if I saw you, I would beat the living snot out of you.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.520]  I couldn't help it. I would guaranteed start punching you in the eyes and the nose and stomping you.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.520]  I mean, that's a normal response too. I can't handle it anymore.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  I can't handle all you scum that think my kids belong to you.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.520]  They don't. You got it? Get it through your head.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.520]  Leave us alone. We're tired of it. Quit pushing us.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:50.520]  Melissa Harris Perry on MSNBC saying our kids belong to you.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.520]  No they don't. You stinking witch.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.520]  You criminal cartel member. Shut up, you stinking pile of crap.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.520]  Excuse me. Man, this pisses me off.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:08.520]  I hadn't seen that article and they came in and gave it to me and I went and read like three articles before I believed it.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:13.520]  They're in the Minneapolis Star Tribune discussing whether it's good or not.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:17.520]  I mean, that's the thing. They're in the news like, well, it is progressive.
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:24.520]  Yeah, men having orgies together. It's okay. Women all together. It's okay because it's not heterosexual.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:29.520]  What the fuck? I don't care what it is, you stinking pervs.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:47.520]  I mean, it's just over the top. Third hour coming up. Stay with us.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:04.520]  The same kind used in B-12 injections and a dinosaur.

[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.520]  nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:16.520]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:22.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:27.520]  By the way, have you just joined this guy up for Earthworship?
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:37.520]  What's that name basically means? Mother Earth School is progressive and teaches environmentalism, just the standard liberal totalitarian tribe.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:45.520]  Reason I say that they're gonna spin it and say it's okay because it's about being progressive because the store is a quote
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:54.520]  progressive sex toy store for everyone. So my point is, is it's being spun that it's okay because it's for everyone.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:00.520]  And you watch, that's how it'll be defended because I've seen this over and over again.
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:11.520]  So we're gonna have the sex education on Billy having two daddies or whoever having two mommies when you shouldn't be teaching sex anything to young children.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:17.520]  They're not even thinking about that. It's not the place of schools that are riddled with predators.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:26.520]  And I've explained this over and over again. There's a predatory hierarchy that's taken over the Catholic Church, that's taken over Congress,
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:33.520]  that's taken, that made major inroads, maybe not taken over a lot of major institutions.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:40.520]  I think you could argue taken over the Catholic Church to a great extent.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:45.520]  And I remember them 15 years ago and that was all breaking going, it's a conspiracy theory about the Catholic Church.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:50.520]  None of that's going on. There's no cover ups. No, there are cover ups.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:57.520]  And it's kind of this thing where you commit crimes so big, even people who aren't involved in it cover it up to protect the institution.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.520]  It's too big to fail. That's what Jakari Jackson's reports about coming up.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  With these big charities that everybody knows are stealing and not giving money where they're supposed to, but they're just institutions.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  So the mainstream media every time there's a disaster says United Way and Red Cross, that's where you're supposed to give your money.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  So it's the same story over and over again. I'm not saying the school itself are a bunch of pedophiles.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  I'm saying it's part of this culture that is mainlining sex to kids and spinning it as if it's progressive to teach them about it.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.520]  It's not the school's place. You're not their parents.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:42.520]  Parents call on schools chief to resign or smitten, kitten, field trip. Let's go ahead and play a clip from the news. Here it is.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:49.520]  Lynn Floyd says he enrolled his children into Gaia Democratic School because of its emphasis on academic freedom and student-led instruction.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:54.520]  I wanted our children to grow up and remain children as long as possible.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:59.520]  But says he never imagined that would include a first-hand look at sex toys and risque material.
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.520]  I don't see how it can continue how she should be allowed to lead children in this manner.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:11.520]  Last week, Floyd says the school's sex education teacher, Starry Hedges, took about a dozen middle school and high school students on a field trip.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:15.520]  To an adult sex store called the Smitten Kitten in Uptown.
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.520]  After his 13 and 11-year-old daughters came home, they shared what they saw.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:27.520]  Floyd immediately pulled them out of Gaia, including his 3-year-old daughter, and says the school did not give him any notice about the field trip.
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  All you had to do was ask us. This whole situation would have went a completely different way.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:39.520]  Ms. Hedges is also the private school's director, and when we tried to get her side of the story, her staff kicked us off the school grounds.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.520]  Do you have any thoughts on the visit to the Smitten Kitten?
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  In a letter posted to Gaia's website, the school board says it stands behind the field trip and views it as a legitimate learning experience that relates directly to topics covered during a year-long sexual health class.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:04.520]  They also said participants communicated to us that the trip was a positive education experience. No student was required to attend.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:15.520]  The owner of the Smitten Kitten said in a statement, the store is a resource for sound science-based sex ed information, and leaves it up to parents and guardians to use their discretion when seeking resources.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.520]  There's certainly not going back to that school.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.520]  Floyd says his daughters are so traumatized and is waiting for an apology.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.520]  I want justice.
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:29.520]  See, he's just an extremist. I mean, it's no big deal to take little girls to a porn shop for a school field trip.
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:39.520]  I mean, come on. That'll take them to a field trip where they're doing surgeries, chopping arms and legs off for transabled folks.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:50.520]  I mean, it is a Democrat school. It is trendy. It is liberal. Sound science. I mean, that's what this is all about.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.520]  All right, I'm done talking about that. We've got another guest coming on.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.520]  Here's some really key information. Stay with us.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.520]  Today's top stories for June 5, 2015, Obama secretly backing Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:13.520]  Article up by Washington Times, President Obama and his administration continue to support the global Islamist militant group known as the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:19.520]  A White House strategy document regards the group as a moderate alternative to more violent Islamic groups.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:25.520]  The policy of backing the Muslim Brotherhood is outlined in a secret directive called Presidential Study Directive Dash 11.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:31.520]  The directive was produced in 2011 and outlines administration support for political reform in the Middle East.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.520]  TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches final push for votes.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:41.520]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Package, is beginning to unravel,
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:49.520]  with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and Republican leadership over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.520]  and hand big corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty.

[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:28.520]  Coming up, TPP email shows CEO joked about making royalty payment to U.S. officials.
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:31.520]  That's up on infowars.com.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:37.520]  Professor Francis Anthony Boyle is a leading American expert in international law.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.520]  He's responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 89.
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:46.520]  The American implementing legislation for the 72 Biological Weapons Convention.
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:52.520]  He served in the board of directors of Amos International and represented Bosnian Hershey Convenient at the World Court.
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:59.520]  He serves as a legal advisor to Palestinian delegation of the Middle East peace negotiations from 91-93.
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:02.520]  In 2007, he delivered the Bertrand Russell peace lectures.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:13.520]  Professor Boyle teaches international law, University of Illinois, champagne and is author of a whole bunch of books dealing with genocide,
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.520]  dealing with international law, you name it.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  He holds a doctor of law, Magna Cum Laude as well as PhD in political science both from Harvard University.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:25.520]  His recent book is destroying Libya and the world order.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:28.520]  The three decades U.S. campaign to terminate the Gaddafi revolution.
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:36.520]  I want to briefly talk about that because at the time he said it was to destabilize and basically destroy Libya and the rest of Africa for that matter.
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:42.520]  And then now they call it a great failure that it is a failed state and a big Al Qaeda ISIS hangout.
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:48.520]  But the reason I got him on today is he's traveled extensively the Middle East.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:51.520]  He's also to get into ISIS and the West being behind it.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.520]  And the Defense Intelligence document that went to judicial walks two weeks ago showing the West is running it.
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:59.520]  I mean, this is just huge information.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.520]  Saudi Arabia being protected on 9-11, the 28 pages.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.520]  That's the one in Telegraph today.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:10.520]  This stuff's really starting to come out now and just the whole political atmosphere.
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:15.520]  But first, he is an expert on anthrax and has contact with the experts.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.520]  And I just wanted to know what he thought about this news that hadn't gotten a lot of attention, but it's been in the news.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  Pentagon, number of anthrax shipments accidentally shipped doubles.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.520]  And now he learned it's all over the U.S., all over the world.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:34.520]  Anthrax mistake grows as 51 labs may have received live spores from U.S. military.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:40.520]  You know, they tried to blame three or four different patsies for the anthrax attacks in 2001.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.520]  They said it wasn't weaponized.
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.520]  And of course it was.
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.520]  I mean, what's really going on here?
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.520]  Professor Francis Boyle, thank you for coming on, sir.
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.520]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me on my best peer listening audience.
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.520]  Yes, the anthrax, this is an extremely dangerous situation.
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  All I can comment on is what I've seen so far in the public record.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  First, Dugway admitted that they were engaging in open-air testing of live anthrax there at the Dugway proving ground.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.520]  They said it was for defensive purposes, but that's nonsense.
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:30.520]  If indeed they just wanted to test costumes or things, they have chambers to do that.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:40.520]  The only reason they would be testing live anthrax in the open there is part of waging anthrax war.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:51.520]  Indeed, there is a federal statute directly on point prohibiting the open-air testing of both biological and chemical weapons.
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:12:00.520]  Going back to the earlier offensive warfare preparations at Dugway that killed all those sheep.
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:08.520]  Although there is a presidential waiver in there, but I don't know if there has been a presidential waiver,
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:14.520]  either by President Bush Jr. or President Obama.
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:24.520]  Second, if you look at what happened in South Korea, that is extremely dangerous.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  It's already been reported that the anthrax there was aerosolized, which means it was weaponized.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:37.520]  The only reason you aerosolize anthrax is to weaponize it.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:49.520]  We know for a fact now, according to their own account, that at least 20 people there are taking Cipro or other antibiotics
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:54.520]  and getting the anthrax shots in combination.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:13:06.520]  So it does appear there was a major incident there in South Korea at that U.S. air base involving live weaponized anthrax.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:18.520]  Third, even in accordance with their own account, they sent in this special unit of the United States Air Force
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.520]  to clean up the mess and decontaminate it.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  This is a well-known unit in the U.S. Air Force that specializes in NBC warfare
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:39.520]  and in particular how to contain it, sanitize it, de-sanitize it, decontaminate it.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:44.520]  These are the pros from Dover as far as the Pentagon is concerned.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:50.520]  And when they have a very serious situation to contend with, they sent in this particular unit.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.520]  Let me ask you a big picture.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:55.520]  They wear moon suits. Let me continue.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:57.520]  They wear moon suits.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  All right, when they go in somewhere, they are wearing moon suits,
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:09.520]  which again to me indicates that this is weaponized anthrax we are dealing with.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.520]  And finally, let me relate this back to the anthrax attacks of 2001.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:18.520]  That was my question. How does this tie together?
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:23.520]  That we've already discussed quite extensively on your program.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:32.520]  My research and others have concluded that that too was super weapons grade anthrax
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:40.520]  manufactured by a combination of Fort Dietrich, the CIA, Battelle, and Dugway.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:46.520]  And as I said before on your program, I believe even before this happened
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:52.520]  that there is a stockpile of weapons grade anthrax there at Dugway.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:57.520]  And that very well could be what we're seeing here too.
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  I simply do not know if the other shipments to the now 51 labs,
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  and we've got 30 people now on Cipro and or taking anthrax shots.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:19.520]  I don't know. I can't say if that's weapon grade anthrax either like South Korea,
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:22.520]  but it very well could be.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:27.520]  Well, Professor, I'm not a biological weapons expert like you,
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.520]  but I've interviewed the experts many times. I've researched it.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  I mean, they don't just pull weaponized anthrax out of these vaults with these containment units
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  where they have moon suits and pressurized seals and underground buildings, as you know,
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  and then mail it around everywhere.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:45.520]  So what is the point of doing this?
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  Even mainstream media says, yeah, it looks like it's, you know, super hardcore anthrax.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:57.520]  Then we go back to the original anthrax situation in 2001 with the White House on Cipro.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:01.520]  They had to admit that before it even happens.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:04.520]  Like a day before it gets mailed out, they all go on it.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.520]  So it really is a big mystery because they tried to blame three pats.
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:16.520]  He dies in custody. You're, I mean, you don't like to speculate, but looking at all this weirdness,
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:22.520]  why is anthrax getting out again? Why is it breaking now that happened in 2008?
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:27.520]  What does all this mean? I mean, it's so crazy.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:30.520]  Well, Alex, you're certainly right.
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:37.520]  None of this goes out of the dog way unless it was sent out on purpose and intentionally.
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:43.520]  Indeed, General Odierno said this was no accident.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:47.520]  So we have to ask why.
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:51.520]  And the reason it was done, they did it the last time.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:58.520]  The Pentagon CIA dog way was to terrorize the American people.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:07.520]  After 9-11, 2001, to ram through the USA Patriot Act.
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:13.520]  That was being held up by Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:20.520]  And all of a sudden they were both hit with super weapons grade anthrax and their opposition disappeared.
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  And we know the so-called bogus U.S. Freedom Act just went through Congress this week.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:44.520]  The other purpose of that October 2001 anthrax attack was to try by the neocons to get us to go to war against Iraq,
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:49.520]  claiming that somehow Iraq was behind it.
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.520]  And if you look at the international situation today,
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:02.520]  I don't believe the domestic situation can be disjoint from the international system.
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:10.520]  We're on the verge of warfare there with Ukraine.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:17.520]  And the Pentagon and the neoconservatives are provoking it now as we speak.
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  If you look at the Associated Press headlines today,
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:29.520]  the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, have threatened to use nuclear weapons against Russia.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:32.520]  It's incredible. I want to go to break and come back with that, Dr. Boyle.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.520]  But first, just briefly, I get the motive.
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.520]  I understand what happened in 2001.
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.520]  Clearly, Pentagon directed anthrax attacks to ram through the Patriot Act.
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.520]  That's well known and you help Pioneer exposing that.
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  It's come out. What's the motive now randomly mailing it all over the place and then getting caught?
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.520]  Well, first I'm getting caught. I think there was a whistleblower at work here.
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:06.520]  Just as there was a whistleblower at work on those nuclear cruise missiles being sent out of a mine at Air Force Base.
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:11.520]  So there's a whistleblower at work here that's gotten this message out.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:20.520]  But if you recall, Alex, I'm sure you do, General Tommy Franks gave that interview publicly stating that
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:27.520]  in the event of another major terrorist attack on the United States along the lines of 9-11,
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:31.520]  the military was just going to shut the government down for good.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:32.520]  So I think...
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.520]  I forgot that quote. You just said it. Let's pull that up.
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:42.520]  Tommy Franks said in Shigaraficionado, he said, he said, we're going to just take over the government next time there's an attack.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:45.520]  And that's the plan. And it's not the military taking over the coup.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  It's the coup through the military and we're just another third world nation.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  Unbelievable. Dr. Boyle, stay there.
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:55.520]  See, he just reminded me of that. We're the ones that, like, a listener called us and said,
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:24.520]  have you seen Shigaraficionado?
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:28.520]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:03.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:06.520]  or the nightly news or the news website, infolwars.com.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:13.520]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be,
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:17.520]  so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:26.520]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by a head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:30.520]  Own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots, their listeners of the radio show,
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:36.520]  and they want to support the broadcast. It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:38.520]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  Buy right off their website and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:50.520]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store, whatever you do, get your head down firearm today.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:57.520]  The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:01.520]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:08.520]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:13.520]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:23.520]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses,
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:26.520]  all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:30.520]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:37.520]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.520]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:08.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:11.520]  If Dr. Boyle's got to go here in six minutes, he can.
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:17.520]  If he wants to stand there 10 minutes after that to expand on things he's welcome to because every time he comes on,
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  he starts reminding me of things I'd forgotten about.
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:27.520]  Like the cigar aficionado that was basically Tommy Franks on the cover promoting martial law.
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:33.520]  Because the first few years after 9-11, they would go, well of course we torture people.
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.520]  And you know, of course we're going to do this and that.
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:38.520]  Of course the NSA spies on you.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:44.520]  He said, quote, of a terrorist massive casualty producing event will occur somewhere in the western world.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.520]  It may be in the United States of America that causes our population to question our own constitution
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:55.520]  and begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass casualty producing event.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:58.520]  And of course they would stage it to take over.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:05.520]  Then enters Jade Helm, all the admissions of government gearing up to go after anybody that doesn't go along with the takeover.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  I've never seen such movement and preparation and starting wars with Russia, China, you name it.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.520]  And you know, Dr. Boyle is a world expert.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:19.520]  He went to the top globalist PhD, groomed by them, wrote weapons treaties, was being vetted to go to the...
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  And then he basically exposed it.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.520]  I mean, as a guy that studied this a while, what do you think about all the preparations that are being made?
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:29.520]  I've never seen such ominous behavior.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.520]  Well, that's correct.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  Again, I'm afraid what we're seeing is the neoconservative agenda here being continued to pursued under Obama.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:56.520]  We're coming close to warfare with Russia, sort of like a reverse Cuban missile crisis.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:02.520]  And at that point, I think the American people are going to wake up and say, what's going on here?
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.520]  Why are we on the verge of Russia?
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:16.520]  And I suspect then we're going to see anthrax being used to scare monger the American people into sporting a war against Russia.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  And China too, as you know, we're supporting this over militarist Abe, who has these outlandish claims to these Chinese islands of Da'iu.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:38.520]  And both Clinton and Obama and Kerry have all said, well, we're prepared to go to war over these islands,
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:42.520]  even though we do not recognize Japanese sovereignty over these islands.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:51.520]  So, you know, anything could set off a war with Russia and or China.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:27:01.520]  And again, read today's Associated Press report where Carter and the Pentagon are threatening the first use of nuclear weapons against Russia.
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  They know that this is extremely destabilizing, and that's why they did it.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:22.520]  You have massive war games out now going on all over Eastern Europe and in the surrounding seas, the Baltic, the Black Sea, and in the air.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:25.520]  So, sure, anything could go wrong.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.520]  Anything could set this up off.
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:33.520]  It's sort of like the origins of the First World War, if you read it.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:48.520]  And that is probably where the anthrax comes in, that when finally the American people pay attention to what's going on, I'm afraid we might be hit by anthrax.
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:54.520]  I also want to say a word in support of your governor down there in Texas.
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.520]  I don't know him personally.
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:09.520]  But I think this is a wise precaution in light of the J-15 maneuvers to put the Texas National Guard on alert.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:20.520]  Anywhere these U.S. military forces go and exercise, it's basically a zone of de facto martial law.
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:28.520]  So, we really don't know what could happen here, except in the drafting of the Constitution at Philadelphia.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:40.520]  Our founders firmly believe that the most dire threat to the existence of the Republic was a standing army, which is why they did not create one.
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:52.520]  Although they did create a standing navy, they only gave Congress the power to create a standing army, and the Republic was to be defended by the state militias.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.520]  Sure.
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:56.520]  And in modern parlance, you just don't have troops quartered among you.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:02.520]  You don't bring your military into the country, because that's what Caesar did, bringing the troops across the Rubicon.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:04.520]  And we know where this story goes.
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:06.520]  We're going to go to Brighton.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:20.520]  We have Northern Command, which, as you know, was set up after 9-9-11, and they're treating the continental United States as well as Canada as a military command.
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:33.520]  So, it's an extremely dangerous situation, not only war abroad with Russia, which appears more likely now than China, but even it could happen with China.
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:34.520]  Totally insane.
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:38.520]  I asked you when we come back, we had a few more minutes with you, what that might look like with Russia.
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:42.520]  We'll go over that incredible AP report where they're going to say they're going to move the missiles into Europe.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:48.520]  I mean, it is pure madness, and Obama's playing golf, and Kerry's crashing his bicycle.
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:30:16.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:21.520]  It's a timeless tale of the power of the community of Posse Kamutatas.
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:28.520]  Our founders knew that permanent standing armies would mean a permanent state of war abroad and tyranny at home.
[02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:35.520]  And as we've maintained the largest standing army in the world, we have had a permanent state of war.
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:41.520]  If our increasingly militarized domestic law enforcement were an army, it would be the fourth largest in the world.
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:49.520]  The concepts of a militia and a Posse kept power in the hands of the people to be led as needed by a few professionals.
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:55.520]  Until we reclaim that constitutional heritage, we will remain helpless peons.
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:58.520]  For FOWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:04.520]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:07.520]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:14.520]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:17.520]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:20.520]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:25.520]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:30.520]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:34.520]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:25.520]  Crashing music, lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:30.520]  Sunday broadcast. And tonight the nightly news, 7 o'clock central.
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:38.520]  And Sunday we launch our team to cover Bilderberg 2015 from the Alps in Austria.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:43.520]  And basically it's the TPP, it's the people that run the TPP that run all these unelected,
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:47.520]  unaccountable boards, all these globalists that the power is being transferred to,
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:52.520]  it's worldwide fascism. They control the left, they control the right, we're in deep trouble.
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:56.520]  But the neocons, the Straussian neocons from Chicago Business School in Harvard,
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:01.520]  have written books, they're on record, PNAC, Pax Americana,
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:05.520]  but not a real American empire of ideas and freedom.
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:09.520]  You know, they're velvet empires, no, a militarized empire of tyranny.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:13.520]  And they believe the end justifies the means, well the truth is they're just evil.
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:17.520]  And they talk about nuclear war with Russia, survival wars with China,
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:22.520]  national paramilitary stabilization forces in the U.S.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:27.520]  And they wrote all this stuff in the 70s, 80s, 90s, now they're doing it.
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  And they tried it when Reagan was in, not so much Reagan, people running it.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:37.520]  The Rex 84, they had hearings in Congress about a plan for martial law during stage crises.
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:40.520]  It was in the Miami Herald and rounding people up.
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:46.520]  And all those back to L.L. Limnitzer and people that Kennedy and Eisenhower basically fired.
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.520]  They're going on forever, want to stage terror attacks and take over.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.520]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:57.520]  And now here's the headline, U.S. might deploy missiles in Europe to counter Russia.
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:01.520]  And then they go into talking about a first strike, which they say is U.S. policy.
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:04.520]  When they say U.S., this means the mad men running us.
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:10.520]  But I study Hitler attacking Russia or Napoleon or other megalomaniacs of history.
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:14.520]  They always end up believing they're invincible.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.520]  And going too far.
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.520]  And even if we could beat Russia two or three times over, you can't beat their counter strike.
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:23.520]  I mean, we can't beat China.
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:25.520]  No one wins a nuclear war.
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:26.520]  This is insane.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:28.520]  And you can see the real buildup.
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:30.520]  You can feel the energy.
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:31.520]  You can see the preparations.
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:33.520]  This is different.
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.520]  And I know Dr. Boyle's agreeing with us, Francis Boyle.
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:41.520]  Sir, for like 10 minutes or so, then I understand you have to go back to your students and your work.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:49.520]  To confirm what you were saying, which is this, I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:57.520]  And went through that same Straussian program with all the rest of them, including Wolff Woods, who was there.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  All of them were there.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:05.520]  And Strauss had just retired, but I studied with his right-hand man, Cropsey.
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:18.520]  What we have to understand is that Strauss' mentor and guru and sponsor in Germany was Carl Schmidt,
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:27.520]  the diehard Nazi law professor who justified every hideous atrocity.
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:36.520]  Hitler and the Nazis inflicted on everyone, including the Jews, which is why then Strauss broke with him at that point.
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:40.520]  But these neo-conservatives are neo-Nazis.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:51.520]  This is a neo-Nazi cabal here, right at the center of power in the United States government,
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:37:03.520]  in the Pentagon, in the White House, in the CIA, who are carrying out what you correctly called seems to be Nazi policy.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.520]  And that is correct.
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:09.520]  We have a Nazi philosophy at work here.
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  They've spent the past generation of trying to infiltrate the academic world.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:22.520]  I've been fighting these people for ever since I was at the University of Chicago.
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:33.520]  And we see now law professors at elite law schools like the University of Chicago openly advocating Schmidt.
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:43.520]  We even now see professors on the so-called left, citing Schmidt, without mentioning he's a Nazi.
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:55.520]  It's very similar to the left's fascination with Heidegger, who, as you know, used to lecture in his Nazi uniform
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:01.520]  and fired his teacher and mentor, Jasper, because he was Jewish.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.520]  So these, you are correct.
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:12.520]  We're dealing here with a Nazi philosophy and a Nazi cabal going back to Strauss and Schmidt.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:18.520]  And then just look at Bush's lawyers, John Yu and Alberto Gonzalez, saying we can bury people alive.
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:19.520]  We can rip their toenails out.
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:22.520]  We can cut their genitals off.
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:25.520]  I mean, these people just think they're God.
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:28.520]  And now this craziness is continuing into Obama.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  It's just sheer insanity.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:32.520]  Right.
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:39.520]  And we see Nuland in charge of the provocations against Russia over Ukraine.
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:41.520]  This is a matter of public record.
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:48.520]  We've illustrated that coup d'etat over through the democratically elected government of Yanukovych.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:50.520]  She's a neocon.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.520]  She used to work for Cheney.
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:39:00.520]  Well, the main group and the party that they turned power over to when they threw the elected group over are neo-Nazis who actually Heil Hitler.
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:01.520]  That is correct.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:10.520]  If you look at all the reports coming out of Ukraine, these paramilitary organizations are Nazi.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:18.520]  Nazi direct descendants of Nazi formations and movements during World War II.
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:26.520]  And now Obama put 300 U.S. military trainers in Ukraine.
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:34.520]  They're now allegedly to train the Ukrainian National Guard, not the Ukrainian Army.
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:38.520]  Well, who is the Ukrainian National Guard?
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:43.520]  Who is all these Nazi, neo-Nazi paramilitary formations?
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:44.520]  The one's carrying out atrocities.
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.520]  So what's the grand strategy or is this political insanity?
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.520]  Because then you've got the open funding of al-Qaeda and ISIS as if we don't know it.
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  But then defense intelligence leaks that we're doing it.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:58.520]  So we have leaks on the anthrax, leaks on al-Qaeda.
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  It sounds like a lot of good people in the government are really doing the right thing.
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:10.520]  Well, I think so, that there are some, what appears to be, principled people in the Pentagon.
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:18.520]  Maybe the CIA, I don't know, who are leaking this type of information to the American people.
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:25.520]  So at least we have some idea of what the plans are behind the scenes.
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:35.520]  But now today, the Associated Press, you have the Pentagon threatening Russia with a first strike of nuclear weapons.
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:38.520]  Well, that is deliberately destabilizing.
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:41.520]  How do you think the Russians are going to respond to this?
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:44.520]  They very well could go on alert again.
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:45.520]  I really don't know.
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:46.520]  It's just totally insane.
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:50.520]  But meanwhile, Obama's playing golf, they're crashing bicycles.
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:54.520]  I mean, is there a method of the madness or have they gone insane?
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:57.520]  Well, again, it's the old debate about Hitler.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  Was Hitler insane or not?
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.520]  And I've got a lot of Hitler and the Langer biography and whatever.
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:17.520]  I just think what we've seen here for the past generation is a Nazi philosophy and Nazi operatives at work at the highest level of the United States government.
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:19.520]  And that's what's going on.
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  If you want to call it insane, fine.
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:23.520]  I don't know where that gets us.
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:32.520]  But I think if we study the history of the Nazis and you pointed out their attack on Russia, the Russians will fight us to the death.
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:44.520]  If I've been over to Stalingrad, they even invited me to honor the victims and the defenders of Stalingrad when I was over there, which I did in a ceremony.
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:46.520]  The Russians will fight us to death.
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:47.520]  There's no question about it.
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:57.520]  And if these Straussians, these neocons believe that the Russians are going to back down, I think they're wrong.
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:07.520]  Well, in closing, shifting gears over the Middle East, these Salafis, these Al-Qaeda-type folks with the people Hitler funded again.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:15.520]  And I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy, but clearly they took the Nazi blueprint that they got at Nuremberg.
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:18.520]  And that's even the 68 Gun Control Act was actually that change.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.520]  I mean, that's on record.
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:22.520]  They just took not just the Straussians, but so many others.
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:24.520]  I mean, our troops dressed like it.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:26.520]  They wear the Kurtzel helmet.
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:29.520]  We call it homeland, Reichland.
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  They are just basically doing the fear of precept that the executive branch can do whatever it wants.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:44.520]  It just sounds like a bunch of diseased lawyers came over and just taught a bunch of sick students this.
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:47.520]  And they bought into the power trip sitting at their knee.
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:59.520]  And then you add some of the folks that fled Russia, the Trotskyites, who then also went from becoming communists to fascists sitting there at the Nazi knee.
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:00.520]  It is just sick.
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:08.520]  And you got 36,000 top Nazis brought over because they would autocratically follow orders to run a bunch of agencies, not just NASA.
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:16.520]  It is like, I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy, but it is like we got smallpox from the Nazis.
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:17.520]  And now we have it.
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:22.520]  It's like we have that power mad disease, that autocratic control freak disease.
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:31.520]  And that's why I call it a mental illness because, you know, if you love your kids, even if you're a maniac, you don't want to start a war with people with 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:37.520]  I mean, it's just they just seem like they have death wishes or something, Dr. Boyle.
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:39.520]  Well, the Nazis did too.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:48.520]  You know, when what could I say when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, he should have studied his history and he didn't.
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.520]  So there you go.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:58.520]  And unfortunately, we're dealing with a group of people who believe that they are above history.
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:04.520]  That very famous statement, we're an empire and we make history and then you can catch up to it.
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:11.520]  By the time you've caught up to it, Carl World down there in Texas, we'll make some more history again.
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:14.520]  So that is the mentality.
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:23.520]  I've seen it here in operation ever since I entered the University of Chicago in 1968 and then went to Harvard.
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:33.520]  As I said before in your program, I went through the exact same Harvard PhD program that produced both Kissinger and Brzezinski and Huntington.
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:35.520]  Before me.
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:41.520]  And that's the way they train you to think at Harvard, just like the Nazis, right?
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.520]  Well, I just hope cooler minds prevail and I'm not glorifying the military leadership.
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:55.520]  But compared to these people, it was Dempsey who went to Obama a couple years ago and said, no, we're not going to knock over Assad with the military because the troops won't go along with it.
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:01.520]  It seems to be the soldiers that have been in combat who know that this isn't fun.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:09.520]  It seems to be chicken hawks who've never fought and think it's cute to play war and just, you know, reading what Hitler actually wrote near the end of World War II.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:11.520]  He followed Napoleon.
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:14.520]  And I know you know this, Dr. Boyle, but visited his grave, all that.
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:16.520]  He thought he was above history.
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:21.520]  He knew why Napoleon failed and he believed Operation Barbarossa would.
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:27.520]  He was in competition with Napoleon and Hitler thought he was better than Napoleon, basically.
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.520]  Right. And also, you're right about Dempsey.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:35.520]  It was Dempsey who told Obama they were not going to attack Syria.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:42.520]  So at that point, then, Obama and his CIA people, remember Obama has been a lifelong CIA asset.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:45.520]  They then activated ISIS.
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:48.520]  And we now, I said that right at the beginning.
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.520]  And that's where ISIS, ISIL, this Islamic State come from.
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:46:01.520]  When they couldn't do an outright military attack as a military opposition, they then activated ISIS.
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.520]  All these guys were in U.S. custody in Iraq.
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.520]  And we turn them to our favor, to our benefit.
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:14.520]  Now the Defense Intelligence Agency is admitting that.
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:16.520]  So you're perfectly correct.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:17.520]  Yes.
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:22.520]  Well, I talked to a lot of military folks, retired generals, recently retired colonels, lieutenant colonels and other folks.
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:24.520]  And they're all completely freaked out.
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:26.520]  They said the military is falling apart.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:27.520]  They won't even fix equipment.
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:29.520]  They won't even give them health care.
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:36.520]  It's all just a bunch of delusional, you know, good guys up there who think they're invincible because they have Harvard degrees.
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:37.520]  No offense to you.
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:38.520]  You know them.
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:42.520]  You've said that on power trips, believing they control reality like Carl Rove said.
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:44.520]  It just sounds like megalomania to me.
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:45.520]  Collegial all over again.
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:47.520]  Dr. Boyle, thank you so much.
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:50.520]  Where's the best place for people to find your latest book?
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.520]  If you just Google my name, all my books will come up.
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:55.520]  All right.
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:57.520]  Well, thank you so much for your time.
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:00.520]  Really appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:01.520]  Thank you.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:02.520]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:05.520]  My best to your audience and everyone down there in Texas.
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:06.520]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:07.520]  Yeah, it is.
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:08.520]  It is just totally insane.
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:15.520]  I mean, the time we're living in, if we survive this, we're going to look back and just go, what was wrong with us?
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:17.520]  Like Germans following Hitler or something.
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:21.520]  I mean, it is just people can say, well, the Russians were bad.
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:22.520]  Whatever.
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.520]  It was stupid for Hitler to go attack him.
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:27.520]  Don't even choose sides.
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:29.520]  US, Hitler, Russia, whatever.
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:32.520]  It was dumb.
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:36.520]  21 million Germans died.
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:40.520]  Almost all of them in Russia.
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:42.520]  I mean, why?
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:45.520]  So Hitler could outdo Napoleon.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.520]  It's a power trip with these globalists.
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:50.520]  They think they're, man, I've been around some of these billionaires.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:55.520]  I've been around some nice ones too, but some, and all they do is just walk around going, I don't like that guy.
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:56.520]  He didn't like it.
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:57.520]  I'll take him out.
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  Most of it's all about you talking.
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:05.520]  I'm just sick of being around men who sit around and talk about, well, I don't like this guy.
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:08.520]  Business ought to just kill him, you know, just stuff like that.
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:14.520]  And then nine times out of 10, these guys have never been in a vicious knife fight.
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:15.520]  They've never been in the military.
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:18.520]  They've never fought for their lives, you know, in a gang fight.
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:19.520]  They have never lived it.
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:25.520]  People that have been in real stuff generally are wary of it because they understand it's real.
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:32.520]  Have you seen how soft Obama and Carl Roevar?
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:37.520]  And they just need to stop, stop it.
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.520]  Stop it right now.
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:42.520]  Stop trying to take the whole world over.
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:50.520]  I mean, in Julius Caesar's day, at least he was taking over, you know, backwards areas and giving him some civilization, and he was a tyrant.
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:53.520]  And there weren't nuclear weapons.
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:56.520]  Julius Caesar was like a cupcake compared to these people.
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:04.520]  I mean, he was a humanitarian compared to them, and I would judge him as a bad guy.
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:08.520]  But I mean, you look at the people we've got now.
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:16.520]  Hitler was a complete psychopath, but he wasn't really a sociopath.
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:19.520]  He thought he was doing something good.
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:21.520]  You look at the people we have running things now.
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:24.520]  It's just, in a way, they're worse than Hitler.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:26.520]  I mean, Hitler had been in the military.
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:31.520]  Hitler had a Congressional Medal of Honor, Iron Cross first class.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:35.520]  I mean, only a few hundred people had that in World War I.
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:38.520]  I mean, he was a war hero.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:42.520]  That's why he thought he could win all these wars and do better than the generals.
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:44.520]  Today, it's the inverse.
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:47.520]  It's just a bunch of arrogant Harvard guys.
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.520]  It's like Corzine making 40-to-1 bets with other people's money.
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:52.520]  They're crazy.
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:56.520]  We're going to come back with Jacarie Jackson's report and more.
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:02.520]  Briefly, we are going to sell out a survival shield, a nace and iodine, you know, ultra-pure 999.
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:04.520]  It's super hardcore.
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:07.520]  The body, most people are deficient in iodine.
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.520]  This is very strong, though.
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:14.520]  Be careful whether to consult your physician and see what it does for you if you choose to check it out.
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:18.520]  In FullWarsLife.com, we are selling out of our current supply.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:25.520]  We have enough to manufacture a smaller amount, and then we have to procure more of the crystals,
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:28.520]  which nobody else gets them drilled out of the ground at seven to 12,000 feet.
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:30.520]  Everything else comes from kelp.
[02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:33.520]  Our original survival shields tested to be the cleanest out there.
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:35.520]  We still got it, and it's kelp-based.
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:38.520]  We got plenty of that in FullWarsLife.com.
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:40.520]  That's what you'll be able to get after this sells out.
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:42.520]  I hope we get more soon.
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:46.520]  InfowarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:53.520]  Another great benefit is you help fund the Infowar where you get hardcore, unfiltered historical analysis and truth.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:56.520]  This is as close to the truth as you're going to get.
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:58.520]  I'm trying my best to be absolutely on target.
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.520]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:10.520]  All over America, people are suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol.
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:15.520]  Can you live your life free from sickness, pain, and fear, and experience your body healing itself?

[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.520]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:04.520]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:10.520]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:15.520]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:21.520]  The phone line, you shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe.
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:25.520]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:28.520]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:31.520]  Simply Safe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:25.520]  And of course, there would have to be 10 women to every man to repopulate the earth,
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:33.520]  a breeding program, and the females would have to be selected for their appeal because of the duty of the men.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:38.520]  The women would have to be of a sexually stimulating nature.
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:41.520]  And I am quoting Dr. Strangelove there.
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:44.520]  Every time I'll warn people about fluoride, the media goes,
[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:47.520]  oh yeah, Dr. Strangelove, General Ripper, you're crazy.
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:50.520]  Is that why Harvard admits to the great Harvard that's brain damaging people
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:52.520]  and the feds are saying cut it back?
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:55.520]  Same people that love their kids are going to take this world back.
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:59.520]  We don't want GMO. We don't want rat poison. We're done.
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:02.520]  Here's Jakari Jackson's report. It's really important.
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:07.520]  I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:11.520]  with a Sunday transmission, Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:15.520]  Here's Jakari Jackson.
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:19.520]  Jakari Jackson here going to talk to you guys today about some fraud.
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:23.520]  Now we know that there's been a lot of natural disasters in places like Texas, Oklahoma,
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:27.520]  I'm sure other parts of the country as well. This is just part of country that I'm in.
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  And you have the tornadoes, you have the floods, and along with it you have the charities,
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:34.520]  and you also have the fraudsters.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:37.520]  And sometimes it's hard to figure out who is who
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  because there are plenty of people saying, hey, give me money and I'll donate it to the victims.
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:45.520]  And some of these people are on the up and up, but sometimes they're not.
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:49.520]  And it's not always the people you think. We have this article out of ProPublica
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.520]  how the Red Cross raised half a billion dollars for Haiti
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:57.520]  and built six homes. That's right, with half a billion dollars in aid.
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.520]  And I understand you got to have travel and water
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:05.520]  and things such of that nature, but they built six
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:09.520]  permanent structure homes. Now what do they do with that other money? Okay, well,
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.520]  they set up tents and they're teaching people how to wash hands
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:17.520]  even though they didn't have efficient running water, things along that nature.
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:21.520]  So where did all the money go? I don't have a definitive answer for that.
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:25.520]  I definitely encourage you guys to go and look at it for yourself. I try to print it out
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.520]  myself, but it is quite long. It is 17 pages printed
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:33.520]  out, so you guys go look at it at your leisure and you'll see all the
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  various instances of management and mismanagement of the funds.
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:41.520]  But it's not just Haiti as you guys would call Hurricane Katrina a lot
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:45.520]  of mismanagement there as well. In particularly, we have this article New York Times
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:49.520]  Throwback, Breathtaking Waste and Fraud in Hurricane
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:53.520]  Aid. And one of the examples in this article points to a woman
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:57.520]  who says that her children died during the hurricane or the flood that happened
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  thereafter, but not only did her children not die, she did not have
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.520]  children to begin with, or at least not children that she claimed died in this
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  incident. And let us not forget FEMA coming out
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.520]  and saying that, hey, during Hurricane Sandy, we're going to close because the weather
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.520]  is too bad. That's right, the agency that's supposed to come to your aid
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:21.520]  in time of a crisis is saying that, hey, it's too much snow,
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.520]  the streets are too slick, so we can't actually come and help you
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:29.520]  do anything. And I'm not just here to bash these companies, these
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:33.520]  organizations, these charities or whatever. I'm just trying to get you guys to understand
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:37.520]  that when it comes down to it, when it really hits the fan and there's
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.520]  floodwaters or hurricane damage or whatever else, the only people you can
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:45.520]  really rely on are your neighbors. Because yeah, there may be good hearted people
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:49.520]  all over the world, but they can easily be scammed if they're trying to get the money
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:53.520]  to you, trying to get the supplies to you. So when you have things
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.520]  that happen like such here in the city of Austin, you can go to local food pantry.
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:01.520]  Personally, I don't give people money, or at least not charities money, like I'd rather go
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:05.520]  donate food or drop off clothes or whatever else. I'll give
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:09.520]  a homeless person money, but it's going directly to that person. It's not going to
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:13.520]  some committee. It's not going to pay somebody's travel expenses or not getting since off the
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:17.520]  dollar. If I give a homeless person $2, they get $2. So that's it for right
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:21.520]  now. Be aware of the scams and you can find more reports on the Alex Jones channel
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:25.520]  on YouTube. That's a good report with all these
[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:29.520]  crises going on. A lot of people giving. I mean, it's like the Clinton Foundation, more than half the money
[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:33.520]  is siphoned off and scam, but United Way and others have been caught giving
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:37.520]  money to gun control. So I mean, it's even worse. We're going to a little bit of overdrive to finish
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:41.520]  up here in full wars.com forward slash show to find that feed. I want to thank all of our
[02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:45.520]  affiliates and the crew. Great job folks.
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:51.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:55.520]  firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news
[02:58:55.520 --> 02:58:59.520]  or the news website in full wars.com because the companies I've been
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:03.520]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:07.520]  as they should be. So I refused probably 30, 40 firearms
[02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:11.520]  manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago, we get
[02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:15.520]  contacted by head down firearms, HD firearms.com
[02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:19.520]  own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people, their veterans,
[02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:23.520]  their patriots, their listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:27.520]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:31.520]  Go to their website, HDfirearms.com, buy right off their website
[02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:35.520]  and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice. You can pick it up at the gun show,
[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:39.520]  you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store, whatever you do, get
[02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:43.520]  your head down firearm today. The spirit of
[02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:55.520]  1776 lives at head down firearms, HDfirearms.com.
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:17.520]  about United later in the break and Joe Jennings popped in. Now when he worked
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:21.520]  at a bank, they required him to give. And then you go to Walgreens
[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:25.520]  or CVS or anywhere and they'll start bullying
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:29.520]  you to get money to this or that and most of the time it's a scam. Or you're
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:33.520]  giving money that goes to leftist organizations or United Way's keeping their money
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:37.520]  with that bank. Joe, tell us the story because I've heard about this
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:41.520]  companies that quote, make you take automatic, you know, a deposit
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:45.520]  and make you give to a charity. I mean, it's just sick.
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:49.520]  Tell us about it. Well, basically they
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:53.520]  required, they said, hey, you know, we're going to be doing this United
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.520]  Way funding thing and we'd like you to
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:01.520]  donate. You need to tell us how much we're going to take out of your paycheck. And I said, well, I don't agree with
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:05.520]  I don't even know anything about United Way and isn't that a
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:09.520]  choice? Well, no, you don't really have a choice. It's going to be taken out of your
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:13.520]  paycheck. So you need to let us know. Of course, you did have a choice. It's like vaccines. They go,
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:17.520]  no, you will do it. Well, there's no law. You're going to do it. It's all bullying. Sorry, go ahead.
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:21.520]  No, no, you're correct. It was kind of looked down like
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:25.520]  well, if you don't give, I don't know if we can still
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:29.520]  have you around if you don't want to participate with our
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:33.520]  bank and how we do things. What bank was it? First
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:37.520]  interstate bank in California, which is no longer
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:41.520]  a bank anymore.
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:45.520]  You know, I don't want to just make this a leftist right thing as the right has its own problems. We were just covering
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:49.520]  that with Bush and stuff earlier. But there's this new totalitarian left where they've got
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.520]  the moral high ground. So we'll take your kids to a sex shop if we want when they're 11
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:57.520]  or we'll make you give to United Way. That is a whole leftist thing
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:01.520]  because they're not leftists. They are these totalitarians. I mean, I know a lot of liberals
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:05.520]  that are the coolest, smartest people you can imagine. Now I disagree with them on
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.520]  abortion or, you know, things like that. But overall, you know, they're smart
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:13.520]  informed, loving people. I just disagree with some of their views.
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:17.520]  But it's like that professor said, I'm scared of my
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:21.520]  young liberal students in that article yesterday. I mean, it's like the red
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:25.520]  guard. They're like, you will do it. Shut up, you know, white people are inherently
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:29.520]  bad. And then it's all financed by big mega banks
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:33.520]  that just want us all each other's throats. That's the point
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:37.520]  is that they're just conduiting this entire deal into a huge
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:41.520]  giant mess. While mega corporations write
[03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:45.520]  the laws that then get adopted in secret and things like the TPP.
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:49.520]  And I mentioned this earlier. I'm going to cover it now briefly. TPP email show CEO
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:53.520]  joked about making royalty payments to U.S. officials. These are our
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:57.520]  rules, bragged chemical company boss. The emails released under Freedom of Information Act request
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:01.520]  show how one chemical CEO was so pleased
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:05.520]  with the rules being set by the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that he
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:09.520]  joked about making a royalty payment to U.S. government officials before bragging these rules
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:13.520]  are our rules, close quote. 400 pages of confidential emails between
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:17.520]  industry advisors and the USTR officials were obtained by the Intellectual
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:21.520]  Property Watch, the USTR, obviously United States and trade representative, and the U.S.
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:25.520]  government agency responsible for developing the United States trade policy. And of course
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:29.520]  you know it's all chaired with people from the companies who then
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.520]  shut down their competition. That's my biggest issue. And they don't
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.520]  again do this for America. They do it for globalist corporations.
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:41.520]  One of the emails was written to Jim DeLessie
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:45.520]  of Fanwood Chemicals, a company that provides technical marketing
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:49.520]  direct sales manufacturing, regulatory services, the chemical industry.
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.520]  Addressing to the USTR, Barbara Weisel should be Weisel. The email
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:57.520]  states emphasis, hi Barbara. John sent through a link
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:01.520]  with the P4 agreement. See they get to see it, not us.
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:05.520]  I've taken a quick look at the rules of origin. Someone owns
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:09.520]  USTR royalty payment or owes them. These are our rules. They will need some
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:13.520]  tweaking, but will likely not need major surgery. This is a very pleasant
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:17.520]  surprise. I'll study more closely over the weekend.
[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:21.520]  See the real setup of all these corporations is that once the body itself is
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:25.520]  set up and the corporations give their power to Sauron
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:29.520]  and the one ring, they're now slaves. See the ring race think they're
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:33.520]  going to get power. They become slaves when they put their rings on.
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:37.520]  Understand? The real power is that it's transferred to that
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:41.520]  body and then they can change this stuff however they want and then make these guys
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:45.520]  give campaign contributions and jobs and kickbacks to even stay
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:49.520]  in the game in the future. Totalitarianism looks good up front, but man it's like
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:53.520]  sticking your arm in a bear trap. That's it for this live transmission. We'll see you
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:57.520]  Sunday 4 to 6 and tonight at 7.
