[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:38.720]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones man I'll tell
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.480]  you getting ready for the news it's just something that's an ongoing pretty much 24
[00:44.480 --> 00:53.040]  hour today process for me because I even tend to dream about politics and geopolitics and issues
[00:53.040 --> 00:59.360]  and what's happening in the world I eat drink and sleep this information because this is reality
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.880]  studying how the world works the mysteries of the universe is not a job it is an adventure
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.040]  and it is engrossing and I would take reality over delusion and illusion any day that's what
[01:15.040 --> 01:22.160]  this comes down to the system is selling delusion selling fairy tales selling lies and then telling
[01:22.160 --> 01:34.720]  people don't listen to the conspiracy theorist that are questioning the admitted on record fraud
[01:36.640 --> 01:42.400]  that is the globalist system and I'll go back to the big news of yesterday six percent approval
[01:42.400 --> 01:48.320]  rating in Gallup for Congress the lowest ever I have never heard of a government that unpopular
[01:48.320 --> 01:55.040]  in history I think the headline is criminal U.S. government or occupied U.S. government
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.160]  most unpopular in history of course they're acting arrogant of course they're acting like
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.560]  they're all powerful of course they act like it's ridiculous to question them oh you don't
[02:06.560 --> 02:16.240]  think one guy killed Kennedy when 90% or more know that it was a conspiracy it's all a giant
[02:16.240 --> 02:23.760]  con game and they know it's a con game the people working in the system know it's a con game
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.240]  and it's all a giant confidence act where they sit up there and act all confident
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.640]  and try to keep this whole ball rolling and then as the society implodes and as people become more
[02:34.640 --> 02:43.200]  corrupt institutions become colleges think tanks of evil think tanks of fraud
[02:43.200 --> 02:52.960]  and then suddenly there's giant waves of corruption that that want to basically take over
[02:53.680 --> 03:01.680]  new territory and they will extinct all real commerce and production that's why
[03:01.680 --> 03:08.880]  Venezuela now only has power a few hours a day in their major cities and now they can't even get
[03:08.880 --> 03:17.120]  the power on half the time for the socialist leader to address everyone on the big screen TVs
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.680]  they've handed out that they stole from private importers and you can look at what comes out of
[03:23.680 --> 03:31.840]  the end of something you can look at what the fruits are of gangs of collectivism of centralization
[03:31.840 --> 03:44.800]  and the the wages of it are giant steaming piles of poison not not big steaming piles of horse crap
[03:47.520 --> 03:50.720]  no because that is actually valuable you can fertilize with that that's
[03:50.720 --> 04:01.120]  a it's not right to call it bs because it's not bs it is a negative value
[04:02.880 --> 04:09.920]  it's not just neutral value it's it it doesn't have a low value it has a negative value so of
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.280]  course it runs around with high-tech propaganda telling one you know telling the public that
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.240]  that it's done a great thing but it's all a fraud and it's all coming to an end the question is how
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.040]  bad's it gonna be coming to an end we're gonna have a civil war gonna have world war three
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.640]  gonna have bio weapons released as the elite try to maintain control and play god and merge with
[04:30.640 --> 04:36.960]  machines and all this delusional crowd they're involved in or do we just have a major awakening
[04:36.960 --> 04:46.320]  to this politically spiritually culturally racially as a human race and not repeat the worst
[04:46.320 --> 04:54.240]  disasters of history with a high-tech icing you're gonna have a high-tech nightmare technocratic
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.880]  icing to this it's gonna make it a thousand times worse than we've ever seen
[05:00.320 --> 05:05.280]  now alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire
[05:05.280 --> 05:11.600]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies

[08:24.400 --> 08:33.040]  december 2013 on this live tuesday edition and lord welling will be here alive for the next three
[08:33.040 --> 08:40.880]  hours we've got the tv newsman and presenter linel syndicate radio host and tv host in new york
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.280]  joining us as he's a former lawyer and prosecutor in the state of florida to break down just a whole
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.560]  host of issues that are unfolding around the country always great to have him pop in with us
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.560]  for the last 40 minutes of the second hour curtain demo is going to talk about attacks on the first
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.760]  amendment and free speech worldwide and moves to tax the internet that are now being proposed and
[09:03.760 --> 09:09.120]  moved forward very aggressively with the supreme court's help he's going to be joining us in the
[09:09.120 --> 09:16.000]  last 15 minutes of the transmission today or so and we will have open phones now now here's the deal
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.600]  i have masses of news and i'm just i'm going to try again to just give you the headlines
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.960]  and then burrow into some of these top stories in detail but i want to talk about the nature of
[09:28.960 --> 09:40.080]  psychology and the nature of how people work because once you know how to push people's
[09:40.080 --> 09:49.200]  buttons the average person is totally unconscious and you can literally walk up to them men and
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.160]  women but especially women and program them you can literally
[09:57.280 --> 10:04.720]  absolutely manipulate about 80 percent of people and i've just come to the conscious
[10:04.720 --> 10:12.480]  realization that i never do that i'm open when i try to get people to wake up and realize what's
[10:12.480 --> 10:18.240]  happening but it fundamentally comes down with this broadcast and info wars dot com and everything
[10:18.240 --> 10:25.040]  we do here because i was thinking this morning about what is my main mission what do i stand for
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.840]  what do people that i like to be around stand for and it's for being real and trying to unlock
[10:33.840 --> 10:41.600]  humanity empower humanity uplift humanity and uplift ourselves individually as well to build
[10:41.600 --> 10:48.800]  a truly better world through free association and free will and i know that's really a simple
[10:48.800 --> 10:55.760]  statement but it's also profound that most people do not operate from that position
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.240]  they've been such failures throughout life because the system is designed to disempower
[11:01.200 --> 11:08.080]  or at least they believe their failures that they actually believe that the fraud of the system
[11:08.080 --> 11:17.520]  is going to empower them and that they believe a gangster scam culture is really what successful
[11:17.520 --> 11:27.040]  people do because the establishment has put that idea out and that they're converting the economy
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.280]  over to an unfair fraudulent crime system because it's the ultimate form of discrimination
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.720]  because the globalists control the police and the courts and the systems and so they can selectively
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.760]  enforce wherever they want and once you give into a fraudulent corrupt system and believe that's the
[11:43.760 --> 11:54.880]  way to go then you've converted and dominated the society and as things get corrupt it forces good
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.880]  people to stop working within the system because the system is a fraud and it's an impossible
[12:00.880 --> 12:08.560]  equation to be successful within the tyranny and then that implodes things even further which is
[12:08.560 --> 12:16.320]  actually the end game goal of this parasitic mindset that has pledged humanity since our
[12:16.320 --> 12:29.760]  first agrarian civilizations were formed 10 000 years ago humans are communicating at a stone age
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.720]  level of leadership actually wanting people to have food and water and to find the game
[12:36.720 --> 12:43.200]  and to find the good areas uh in the valleys to plant crops and to survive and so the average
[12:43.200 --> 12:48.640]  person at a subconscious level really looks at leaders as if they want to help the tribe
[12:49.280 --> 12:55.520]  but from the time of the ancient priest class being set up there's always been grips that have
[12:55.520 --> 13:03.760]  learned how humans work and then sabotaged from birth successive generations to domesticate
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.440]  their fellow humans as slaves and again this is a well-known historical fact i'm not
[13:11.440 --> 13:18.080]  giving you some revelation here except that our whole civilization is now developed around this
[13:18.080 --> 13:25.520]  to a very high order and the public has been turned into the most dumb servile shallow wicked
[13:25.520 --> 13:37.120]  evil grasping foolish unhappy unfulfilled group in preparation for the mass removal of humanity we
[13:37.120 --> 13:43.200]  must first be spiritually and physically broken so that we will not organize against the final
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.680]  takeover with an establishment that is the worst of the worst who've been smoking their own political
[13:50.240 --> 13:57.200]  poison and who actually believe like the the the pharaohs and the british royalty and
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.840]  the roman emperors and every other elite the ashtek kings and their priest class
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.520]  that they are going to become god in their narcissistically driven megalomania
[14:11.520 --> 14:19.280]  and i can see the entire historical chain of events and exactly where it's leading and it
[14:19.280 --> 14:27.920]  is spectacularly evil it is going to be the manifestation of the worst demonic
[14:28.480 --> 14:36.720]  trances and hallucinations from the literal dimension of hades itself manifest in the third
[14:36.720 --> 14:45.120]  dimension because humans are designed to be able to build in the image of god we are creators and
[14:45.120 --> 14:53.440]  now evil is going to jack into that and actually for the first time evil will not be a pure destroyer
[14:53.440 --> 15:02.400]  it will be a builder of total abomination the the devil wants to be god and the devil is going
[15:02.400 --> 15:09.280]  to be given the power through human slaves to be a creator and this is going to be spectacular
[15:10.720 --> 15:18.400]  they say that on the isle of patmos john the revelator marveled with his mouth hanging open
[15:19.760 --> 15:26.160]  i can imagine because i can see it as well just politically scientifically by being immersed in
[15:26.160 --> 15:32.320]  it historically i can see the vision of the top new world order i have seen where they're taking us
[15:32.320 --> 15:38.080]  and it is beyond my even comprehension
[15:42.880 --> 15:50.560]  i can focus in on pieces of it and and it and it's dark fractal vortices but to actually pull
[15:50.560 --> 16:04.000]  back it is it is it is it is a hallucination out of the mind of total abomination
[16:08.640 --> 16:12.800]  because i consider and analyze all this news for you you notice the system wants to turn
[16:12.800 --> 16:17.600]  everything good on its head it wants to pull down everything beautiful it wants to destroy
[16:17.600 --> 16:20.640]  and deceive and betray for betrayal's sake
[16:27.040 --> 16:34.480]  and i look out at our enemies and they are so weak they are so hollow they are empty
[16:35.840 --> 16:38.160]  i don't even have the capacity to hate them anymore
[16:38.160 --> 16:48.480]  because i'm not looking at people i'm staring through and seeing they are biological androids
[16:49.200 --> 16:52.720]  literal unconscious replicants
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.160]  who have been completely programmed and who have given up their free will
[17:00.720 --> 17:03.520]  by fraud from birth in front of the television
[17:03.520 --> 17:11.200]  and inculcated with false fantasies and the average person in their own brain waves is in a dreamlike
[17:12.000 --> 17:23.280]  waking trance and that's why you can walk up and literally program 80 plus percent of the public
[17:24.240 --> 17:32.560]  but i won't do it i will not sit there with someone else because i'm losing my soul when i do it i
[17:32.560 --> 17:37.520]  can feel it if i sit there and actually manipulate people and then i see other people trying to
[17:37.520 --> 17:44.640]  manipulate me and i don't even know how to respond because it's it's literally like a
[17:44.640 --> 17:50.160]  animated meat puppet a zombie that's where the zombie art type is they're telling you you're a
[17:50.160 --> 17:56.640]  zombie and and that's where it's at and you look at the the typecast police the typecast
[17:56.640 --> 18:05.120]  um groups of any type and you can literally tell who someone is what they do i can walk
[18:05.120 --> 18:10.720]  over and ask them it freaks people out freaks my wife out across the board i can guess what somebody
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.200]  looks at their profession is even if they're not dressed in anyway like it just by their
[18:15.200 --> 18:20.240]  bearing and manner because they've literally gone under corporate programming and i recognize
[18:20.240 --> 18:28.160]  the exact tailor of their programming the cut of it and all i want is to empower humanity all i want
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.000]  is reap what you sow all i want is to see people flourish and be successful
[18:36.320 --> 18:44.960]  and then i see the system full of a bunch of cowardly fearful delusional grasping no bodies
[18:44.960 --> 18:50.480]  who've who've made themselves no bodies because they've been captured in the web of deceit
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.920]  and then i see all of my own weakness and all of my own worldliness but i do see it falling away
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.640]  like one of the crew described it like rocket boosters falling off the shuttle as it gets ready
[19:06.640 --> 19:12.400]  to escape the atmosphere and i just really want to see you win i want to see you succeed
[19:12.400 --> 19:19.200]  i want to see humanity spread through the universe and really become what god has envisioned for us
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.520]  and i know god's vision for humanity because god's told us his vision for humanity and its
[19:25.520 --> 19:32.160]  prosperity and its blessings stacked on top of blessing but to do that we have to have free will
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.280]  and so that's why evil is allowed to operate and people can call god cruel it's not cruel
[19:37.280 --> 19:48.880]  it is free will as god test souls that for eternity will serve in projects at a galactic
[19:49.920 --> 19:59.120]  subatomic pan-universal system of things that we cannot even comprehend this is boot camp

[24:05.760 --> 24:06.320]  this is the
[24:10.560 --> 24:14.800]  Alex Jones here back live thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition i went into preacher mode
[24:14.800 --> 24:21.200]  i meant to go in news mode because believe me it's it's there's a lot of it it's just when you see
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.840]  the systematic madness of the system you have to understand it is organized evil it is systematic
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.360]  but in the general public it is a bunch of sleepwalking unconscious people that have no idea
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.200]  the type of attack they're under by social engineers that want to keep you unconscious
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.560]  so you can literally be a slave controlled by their programming under their trance under their spell
[24:48.560 --> 24:56.000]  that's what it is america is under the spell of hollywood under the spell of obama but they're
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.640]  beginning to break that spell and so they're moving on to new front people new pushers of fraud
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.920]  we've got to get back to the ancient common sense you've got to get back to following your gut
[25:10.560 --> 25:14.880]  and people's gut says the government's evil 94 percent of americans in gallup
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.200]  say the government's illegitimate and they don't like it this government is not a government
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.880]  it has been hijacked it has been inverted it is the opposite of what it was set up to do
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.000]  of course they demonize the bill of rights and constitution of course they demonize the founders
[25:30.560 --> 25:35.840]  who were trailblazers in their day of liberty and who led the way for even more freedom
[25:38.320 --> 25:44.800]  because it's the antidote to the ancient poison of slavery that rears its head in a thousand
[25:44.800 --> 25:52.160]  different ways so they only teach you the last slavery or the last tyranny so you're looking
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.040]  for it to come in the uniform of adolf hitler or you're looking for it to come in the uniform of
[25:57.040 --> 26:02.880]  a clansman or you're looking for it to come in the uniform of joseph stalin when it's in the uniform
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.440]  of nameless faceless systematic bureaucrats with the regulations written by offshore above the law
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.520]  banks let me just give you headlines i'm going to do this okay i'm not going to comment on the stories

[26:45.520 --> 26:52.240]  in because most of them got their wealth through fraud and government contracts or they made their
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.960]  money the honest way and know they're that the elite are going to sick the unwashed masses on them
[26:56.960 --> 27:04.960]  during the re-engineering that is the implosion let's continue oh yes that's the that's the great
[27:04.960 --> 27:10.800]  reeducation camp that america's being set up to be you think it's bad now this is only the beginning
[27:10.800 --> 27:15.520]  and i'm not trying to scare you folks it's all coming like a hurricane coming in you think the
[27:15.520 --> 27:24.800]  winds are high now it hadn't yet yet i can't choose reality up here just tell you everything's roses
[27:24.800 --> 27:33.600]  it didn't but it's the desperate test that will purify and cleanse us and decide who we are let's
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.800]  continue ohio court polite drivers are not suspicious that's right that's in the homeland

[27:51.920 --> 27:56.240]  having children or being a priest or having a baby stroller i'm not getting these are all actual
[27:56.240 --> 28:02.880]  quotes being a gun owner being a veteran being conservative being a ron paul supporter being
[28:02.880 --> 28:08.080]  an alex jones listener having a tattoo of the gatston flag i mean there's literally hundreds

[28:27.200 --> 28:32.800]  and then you don't even have a pot you know what in we're also going to be getting into
[28:32.800 --> 28:39.120]  the really big news i'm just going to the first stack here in order nfl band super bowl gun commercial
[28:39.680 --> 28:45.280]  it's too offensive they said we're going to play the ad coming out in the next segment
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.240]  for radio listeners and for tv viewers and again they can have violent video game ads
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.800]  they can push all the military as you join the military to be a guinea pig and fight for the
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.920]  new world order they can have the total gangster culture of it but you just want to have a pro
[28:59.920 --> 29:05.040]  second amendment ad no you can't and the nfl has signed on to push anti-gun and obama care
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.400]  as official sponsors so i'm calling now everyone to join me in an nfl boycott and i got a lot of
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.120]  people that work at my office that watch nfl football i get it i played football i i know i like it too

[29:24.480 --> 29:30.000]  the stupid gladiatorial event that has stolen our manhood as a culture and turned men into a bunch
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.480]  of people that sit on their butts watching other men all day instead of being real men in your own
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.160]  life then you deserve to lose everything and you will but i know most men who are even awake can't
[29:40.160 --> 29:46.000]  give it up they cannot give up their male soap opera and watching all their boyfriends will be
[29:46.000 --> 29:55.840]  being right back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[34:05.120 --> 34:11.520]  addition your phone calls are going to be coming up on the issues that i've raised i'd love to get
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.880]  your take on many of the other issues i'm about to throw out so let me cover some more of the news
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.160]  before i get into the nfl censorship and more then i'll dive back into that and give out the toll
[34:22.160 --> 34:29.280]  free number again for first time callers and we tend to get a wave of callers that have been drinking
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.600]  cough syrup and are half awake or we get super informed awake callers so i would like folks to
[34:35.600 --> 34:42.320]  call in because we don't really screen the calls who are not injecting heroin so i'll be giving that
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.880]  phone number out coming up here in just a little while i'm just joking around sometimes it's like
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.680]  incredibly dynamic smart informed callers who are willing to put up with being interrupted by me
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.400]  and sitting on hold and then other times it's kind of like huh what oh yeah i really love you alex
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.240]  i guess because they've been on hold for 20 minutes but we're going to give the number out
[35:02.240 --> 35:09.120]  coming up uh let me just continue reading some of the headlines here for folks uh female
[35:09.120 --> 35:15.680]  fordhood soldiers recruited for prostitution ring trial hears a 17-year veteran accused of using
[35:15.680 --> 35:21.680]  service set up by coordinator of bases sex assault and harassment prevention program and they admit
[35:21.680 --> 35:26.800]  that they were using that program to coordinate the basically sexual exploitation of women
[35:26.800 --> 35:32.160]  statistically in criminology the cps will have the highest level child protective services
[35:32.160 --> 35:38.640]  of pedophiles statistically you'll have the highest level of sadist in the police force
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.200]  statistically you'll have an incredibly high level of child abusers in the truancy officer
[35:45.200 --> 35:52.560]  division statistically you'll have a lot of drug addicts that are in the dea or in the medical field
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.240]  and you ask why is that they're always catching game wardens poaching stuff
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.240]  because they get into it because they're obsessed with it and they want to be on the inside to
[36:04.240 --> 36:10.320]  carry out the criminal operations that's why tyranny is such a problem historically because
[36:10.320 --> 36:15.520]  even if you have a good government people will become lackadaisical and trusting of it because
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.680]  it is a good government the people will become prosperous and go to sleep and forget the lessons
[36:21.680 --> 36:29.520]  of tyranny and then the corruption creeps back in and then takes over and then purges everybody
[36:29.520 --> 36:36.880]  and then collapses and the cycle goes on and on sometimes civilizations can jump the end of the
[36:36.880 --> 36:42.240]  cycle you think we're going to jump the end of the cycle this time no i think it's going to be
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.240]  in fact i know it's going to be the final arbiter on whether humanity goes to the next level
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.680]  or whether we destroy the planet so the big giant challenge is here will we destroy ourselves with
[36:53.680 --> 36:59.840]  the advanced fish infusion any matter discoveries they've made on record the artificial black holes
[36:59.840 --> 37:05.440]  they've been creating for 20 years the super weapons the bio weapons that kill 99 of all
[37:05.440 --> 37:13.920]  mammals they come in contact with nanotech gmo cross splicing hybrids of plants and animals and humans
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.120]  pig human hybrids human chimpanzee hybrids been alive in laboratories on record for 20 years
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.480]  the tales remain classified i mean look the elite are already living in the future that's why
[37:26.480 --> 37:32.880]  they're so arrogant heaven knows what heartedness they've they've they've created or or mutated
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.840]  i mean the stuff we know is so buck rogers on pcp that i don't even know what to say at this point
[37:42.800 --> 37:50.000]  meanwhile people are worried about kim kardashian and cayenne west and justin biebler
[37:51.760 --> 37:59.120]  literally rejections of nothingness to make sure that you never figure out what's going on
[37:59.120 --> 38:11.440]  in the matrix are on the island this is not my opinion this is 100 percent in all of their
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.680]  globalist publications they sit around and brag how they were putting everybody ever bernay's
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.240]  wrote the 30s how they were creating a false culture to literally envelop everyone to where
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.120]  people wouldn't even know they were slaves and the irides books every page is how they
[38:27.120 --> 38:30.480]  launched this and how they launched that and how they did this and how they did that and
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.120]  and then you realize your whole culture i mean about half our culture literally was
[38:37.120 --> 38:42.880]  launched by edward bernay's america wonders why our culture took over not american culture that
[38:42.880 --> 38:49.600]  took over it was globalist weaponized culture that took over using america's good rough name
[38:49.600 --> 38:59.760]  trailblazing name using using using the world's good will for us packaged with a trojan horse
[38:59.760 --> 39:11.680]  payload of scientific villainy i mean i start to think about it it's just i i can't believe
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.480]  that we've even gotten to this point but people buy into the fact that they're a conservative
[39:16.480 --> 39:21.200]  or they're a liberal or they support obama or they they support bainer well i'm a man line
[39:21.200 --> 39:26.800]  republican i get invited to the local republican meetings not like you bad patriot people that
[39:26.800 --> 39:32.880]  say we're under tyranny and don't act ladylike or gentlemanly i mean he's just i mean literally
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.840]  you're talking to someone in the matrix it's like arguing with a schizophrenic homeless person
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.520]  who runs over to your car and starts cussing at you it'd be like rolling the window down and
[39:41.520 --> 39:44.800]  getting out in a fight with them why don't you get get out and get in a fight with a homeless
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.120]  person that cusses at you and says they want to kick your butt but if some guy in a nice truck
[39:49.120 --> 39:53.280]  well-dressed rolls out his window and says i'm gonna kick your butt i don't like you you actually
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.840]  take it personal and go i hadn't done nothing i'll kick your butt because because you care about
[39:57.840 --> 40:03.600]  what somebody who looks like they're informed says you you don't get upset by a poor schizophrenic
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.480]  person talking to themselves on the side of the street who sees you and makes eye contact and says
[40:08.480 --> 40:15.440]  you killed my mother sometimes you can roll your window down and say here's ten dollars look i'm
[40:15.440 --> 40:22.960]  your friend i'm not the one i don't want to hurt you i haven't even learned how to talk to mentally
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.640]  it'll get the French you just go i'm not with the bad guys you don't tell them hey you're crazy
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.720]  so i'm not with the bad guys and that's kind of like how it is with general public cop pulls
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.120]  me over acting all weird i go you know this is all your training and i haven't done anything wrong
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.840]  and you know this is foolish how you're acting and i care about you and your family
[40:40.720 --> 40:51.040]  okay well you can go no one's ever even talked to them like that
[40:58.080 --> 41:03.120]  i said i'd cover the news oh here it is uh fort hood soldiers recruited for prostitution ring
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.280]  trial here's and it was the it was the women abuse and sexual harassment division
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.440]  see just like msnbc runs the witch hunt for white racist but they're actually perpetuating
[41:15.440 --> 41:21.600]  total racial division it's the same deal you run and promote the racism and the division
[41:21.600 --> 41:26.320]  show you can continue to manage it let's go to the next thing i'm going to cover this later
[41:26.320 --> 41:33.200]  in detail because this is a big deal i'll cover this it's a start of the next hour because i actually
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.080]  can't believe this is actually debated by people i hear this all the time our men and women different
[41:38.080 --> 41:50.000]  i don't know gee can i have babies as a male can i have a baby no uh can't can a woman walk on to
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.840]  the dallas cowboys uh and and then and then go play a nfl level football no i've always
[41:57.840 --> 42:01.440]  explained this to everyone women have three times the connections between left and right
[42:01.440 --> 42:07.280]  hemisphere this has been known for about 80 years i'll show folks a document cam shot of this
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.960]  but now the the the london guardians reporting on a big scientific brain scan study that we already
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.360]  know folks when i've been in darpa research laboratories that i was allowed into at the
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.360]  university of texas this is all they're working on is how to program men and women down to subliminal
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.920]  messages in in tv advertisements to sexually excite women and to create a sexual subconscious
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.440]  feeling you know towards a particular type of fabric softener just like the beer ads or drink
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.960]  this beer beautiful woman of show up that's over it's also it's total weaponized and then you tell
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.600]  women you know uh you're being targeted by mind control oh shut up you male chauvinist i know
[42:45.600 --> 42:52.640]  how to be free i keep men down oh yeah really they just broke the human family in two and then
[42:52.640 --> 43:00.240]  they've already won dividing us at that point first all the different tv shows show the woman
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.880]  getting in her man's face and putting him in his place and that's how she's empowered oh yeah
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.080]  that's how women get ahead in this universe is bringing their man down and why do they target
[43:10.080 --> 43:17.680]  women because women are the heart of the family the engine of the entire system they they target
[43:17.680 --> 43:23.440]  80 plus percent of advertising at women talk radios different because males listen to information
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.720]  more and that's in the study here and they've weaponized studied our brains and they give men
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.000]  simulated war we watch simulated football and guys go oh alex i know it is but i like it i'm like
[43:34.000 --> 43:41.280]  it's mind control the creator of the olympics uh french royalty related to napoleon bonaparte
[43:41.280 --> 43:48.800]  i forget the guy's name who created the olympics in 1914 he said we'll use this as the new religion
[43:48.800 --> 43:55.520]  to enslave everyone i mean i read his writings look up the creator of the olympics of french
[43:55.520 --> 44:02.480]  the french nobleman the french elitist um hiller was a big fan of later by the way but
[44:02.480 --> 44:09.280]  and he adopted his designs and ideas the point is is that if you just type in the creator of
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.960]  the olympics it's the first thing comes up it's a frenchman just want to get his name um again
[44:14.960 --> 44:18.800]  this is the whole thing about history they admit they've programmed everybody that's what i keep
[44:18.800 --> 44:25.280]  trying to get to here i'll go to google it's no big deal let's just see how fast i can get it
[44:25.280 --> 44:34.800]  oh there it is olympic games baron it's too far away for me to read pierre de cuba team that's
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.880]  yeah that's that's him baron pierre de cuba team there you go that's that's and of course he didn't
[44:40.880 --> 44:45.520]  invent all this he just invented the modern inculcation of how the romans used it and others
[44:45.520 --> 44:50.480]  used it we need to use it that's how we you know basically and of course they spin it when they
[44:50.480 --> 44:56.560]  write it up saying you know the french lost world war one he believed because they which they really
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.960]  didn't lose but they know he's talking about the previous war the the french lost a war with the
[45:00.960 --> 45:06.400]  germans i guess with bismarck because uh they weren't athletic enough and they needed to be tougher
[45:06.400 --> 45:10.960]  but that was only on the surface of his writings it doesn't matter see see people ask why i go off
[45:10.960 --> 45:19.600]  in so many different directions it's because it's all interconnected and the male mind on average
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.480]  doesn't mean that there aren't female minds who its strategy are just as good as any other man
[45:24.480 --> 45:34.320]  it just means on average men men have larger cerebral cortex you understand that larger
[45:34.320 --> 45:41.600]  cerebral brain processing and they have on average three times less connections between
[45:41.600 --> 45:48.560]  left and right hemispheres so so women have better intuition and a lot of other issues with a larger
[45:48.560 --> 45:57.040]  deeper subconscious pool of race knowledge but they're there to then choose men that actually
[45:57.040 --> 46:03.360]  will lead the tribe to a higher level than they choose their mate generally and it varies between
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.440]  different mammalian species but generally the same but in birds other animals you know it's
[46:07.440 --> 46:12.320]  different and it gets into some really sophisticated areas the whole point is is that they've now
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.920]  jacked into women and give them false programming about what will make society successful and that
[46:17.920 --> 46:22.320]  is bringing down men when they're actually bringing down themselves their children
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.920]  in the entire society and it's all been done scientifically see i say i'm going to go to
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.320]  this newsletter i just start covering it now but but we could talk about this for years
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.520]  and literally when you talk about this they have now and all these organizations that claim they
[46:37.520 --> 46:44.320]  represent women who are really Rockefeller and CIA controlled groups on record glorious time admit
[46:44.320 --> 46:49.280]  she's CIA and was there to get women into the workforce they could get double taxes and break
[46:49.280 --> 46:54.880]  up the family and again it's not defending any other system that was there before the point is
[46:54.880 --> 47:00.640]  is that they claimed all this civil rights movement for women as a way to literally end the human
[47:00.640 --> 47:09.520]  species as we know it and you can now see them doing it and it's all weaponized and literally
[47:09.520 --> 47:15.040]  people center on and go oh no women can be in combat just like men oh no women women you know
[47:15.040 --> 47:20.720]  you know in strategy or no they're not none of the top chess players are women
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.440]  and don't don't worry the computers already beat all the men a decade ago deep blue and all the rest
[47:27.440 --> 47:36.080]  of it and they've also found and there's genetic variations but people that live in worse climates
[47:36.080 --> 47:42.160]  especially freezing climates genetically have the highest ability mathematically and test scores
[47:42.720 --> 47:46.240]  doesn't matter if you're a russian from up you know near the north pole or from northern europe
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.440]  or ever or if you're japanese folks up where it gets really cold back in the old day especially
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.680]  in the last ice age 10 000 years ago if you made a miscalculation and stayed out past dark you were
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.720]  going to die they've done studies of people in northern clines with an inner time clock
[48:02.720 --> 48:08.880]  who actually can tell in studies what time it is because if you didn't you were dead ladies and
[48:08.880 --> 48:18.000]  gentlemen and then they found in other environments and things groups of humans that have more advanced
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.280]  faculties in other areas because humans have become specialized depending on what area they
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.080]  were in and they don't want you to have strategy they don't want you to have cunning they don't
[48:28.080 --> 48:33.040]  want you to have an instinct to help others they want you to have an instinct to bring others down
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.320]  believing that that is going to empower you and the only time that bringing others down to empower
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.280]  you is in the ancient system of you have an overpopulation area and you've got to take over someone
[48:43.280 --> 48:53.280]  else's agrarian farming belt to supply your population with food but now with technology
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.360]  we have unlimited energy structures if we decide to begin colonizing off world and that's the only
[48:59.360 --> 49:06.880]  step humans have left is to go to the stars to look to the stars immediately see i'm just getting
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.920]  into philosophy i mean there's all this news out there but of course the pentagon has been forged
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.200]  into an imperial army to take over and abuse people and to carry out forms of evil and the
[49:17.200 --> 49:22.320]  subconscious mind knows the mission is overall dehumanizing so of course they're going to turn
[49:22.320 --> 49:28.880]  the women into camp hookers named after general hooker who had large groups of hookers that they
[49:28.880 --> 49:33.760]  brought around the northern soldiers of course they're going to do that and and and then we've
[49:33.760 --> 49:43.360]  got such a dumbed down population that they actually think it's sexist to say that men and
[49:43.360 --> 49:50.000]  women are different when men and women are as different as night and day and that's why the
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.360]  night and day meet and you can debate if a man is day or a woman is day or whose night
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.200]  doesn't matter because the human species is not a man the human species is not a woman the human
[50:01.200 --> 50:07.200]  species is the man and the woman and then the children and the journey we've had together
[50:07.760 --> 50:15.120]  through the entire development under god's watchful direction of this species towards the
[50:15.120 --> 50:23.040]  great challenge we now begin to arrive at in the 21st century these are the real big ideas
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.080]  you're not meant to think about this is what the controllers think about and they've decided
[50:28.080 --> 50:32.320]  you're going to be dumbed down you're going to be poisoned so you're ready for extermination
[50:32.320 --> 50:41.760]  you are being drugged and prepped and psychologically killed before you are being physically killed
[50:41.760 --> 50:50.320]  because if you have a spirit that's not poisoned then you will see the evil and resisted so they
[50:50.320 --> 51:01.280]  first have to sabotage your survival systems before they can physically kill you in the last 50
[51:01.280 --> 51:07.520]  years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a
[51:07.520 --> 51:14.000]  practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.520]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and
[51:19.520 --> 51:26.480]  encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[51:26.480 --> 51:32.640]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been
[51:32.640 --> 51:39.120]  deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[54:16.720 --> 54:20.880]  talk about the idiocy and how the system continues to dumb the news down we were watching
[54:20.880 --> 54:26.080]  fox news during the break we've got different establishment networks state-run media systems
[54:26.080 --> 54:32.880]  on out there and uh on fox in here they weren't saying ban energy drinks i was watching cnn in
[54:32.880 --> 54:38.320]  there and they were saying uh you know get rid of them because they're evil let the government
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.600]  take them over attacks them and then i came in here and it was so fox news talking about how it
[54:43.600 --> 54:49.360]  makes the heart beat faster oh we need a study for that actually most of the studies show that
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.400]  moderate caffeine is actually good for the average person and their cardiovascular system
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.920]  you can look those up if you want now the argument is people are so sedentary that that's why it's
[54:59.920 --> 55:04.640]  good for them that if you're really in good shape it probably isn't good for you but it's a very
[55:04.640 --> 55:10.640]  complex issue the point is is that moderation of coffee the overwhelming evidence shows it's good
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.640]  for you just like if i could drink one glass of red wine and i it would be good for me the problem
[55:16.640 --> 55:25.200]  is i'm going to drink five glasses of red wine hence i don't do it and it doesn't matter there's
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.360]  just so much news i mean i've gotten through like one stack i've got one two three four five six
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.600]  seven eight more stacks i haven't gotten into the second amendment thing i don't sell as ours waiting
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.600]  to write an article about my announcement i'm going to make right now and i'm going to shoot a video
[55:37.600 --> 55:41.680]  on this this afternoon so we can have a special report running on the nightly news and on youtube
[55:41.680 --> 55:47.360]  and on youtube but i mean i've had enough of the nfl and i think you've had enough of it as well i
[55:47.360 --> 55:53.920]  mean i'm sure you have i see your emails i see your comments pushing obama care uh pushing anti
[55:53.920 --> 56:02.000]  gun messages officially signed on with the winehouse uh they're using the roman games to actually try
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.440]  to overturn the republic we don't have the russians beaming propaganda in here saying turn on your
[56:07.440 --> 56:13.440]  guns americans or socialize your healthcare and bankrupt america we have the nfl doing it
[56:15.520 --> 56:21.280]  and i'm sick of watching egomaniac drug heads on a bunch of synthetic growth hormone and stuff
[56:21.920 --> 56:27.680]  completely out of their minds with their pit bulls and all the rest of it i mean i i've already
[56:27.680 --> 56:33.200]  been boycotting the nfl for a long time but i i'm calling on everybody to boycott it i mean all i
[56:33.200 --> 56:39.360]  see men doing is fantasy football and bragging like like it's battle strategy about knowing
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.400]  more than the coaches that's why you're not doing good financially it's why your country's
[56:44.400 --> 56:50.560]  been stolen they're shutting the nation down don't you take that personal you're under scientific
[56:50.560 --> 56:58.160]  mechanized attack and you really really really are an expert in simulated warfare
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.720]  with a bunch of arrogant gladiators fighting with each other i mean who cares i'm boycotting it
[57:05.920 --> 57:10.080]  because if you go up to info wars dot com we have the video nfl band super bowl
[57:10.080 --> 57:16.400]  gun commercial says it's too offensive here is the ad from daniel defense that they say
[57:16.400 --> 57:24.080]  can't air this this is tyranny here it is it's been a long road to getting here

[57:48.160 --> 57:53.440]  is my highest priority he's a marine who comes home to his family and his baby this is what they
[57:53.440 --> 58:00.720]  call offensive it is affordable for their protection because he's a man in charge on a team with his family
[58:04.160 --> 58:09.520]  and no one has the right to tell me how to defend them that's right it's a good clean message that's
[58:09.520 --> 58:16.560]  why it's banned so i've chosen the most effective tool for the job daniel defense defending your

[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:35.360]  about how arrogant the system is they would never dare use the supposed american pastime of
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:42.400]  nfl football to have illuminati ceremonies during every halftime with women's breasts hanging out
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:48.800]  Madonna crawling all over everything acting ridiculous they would never have obama care
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:53.920]  propaganda about all the nfl supports the president and the destruction of our already
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:58.400]  screwed up health care system by design and now they won't let you run the most wholesome
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:07.040]  daniel defense ad where it shows a father driving homes saying it took a long time to get here
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.800]  he walks in the house and it's picture of his baby his wife him and the marine corps

[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:26.080]  and then it just cuts to it website daniel defense and they said quote it's too offensive
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:32.000]  you know why because it's a loving father coming in straight and strong with his wife
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:40.960]  and his daughter and they're a team uh uh you do not show that period this government is our enemy
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:46.240]  and is sworn to hurt everything good my god how obvious does this have to get people
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:49.680]  it's pure evil
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:59.520]  you cannot show a father in a good light you cannot show a man saying i have a right to defend my
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:04.480]  family no you can put all the political commercials you want you can have the attorney general meet
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:08.240]  with the media heads and say we need to have another but anti-gun messages in the public's
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:16.000]  mind we need to brainwash these people and then you have that incredibly wholesome ad
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:21.840]  and it's got them pulling their hair out ladies and gentlemen i'm telling you
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:25.520]  i see people at restaurants watching stuff i'm gonna walk over and say you know they're anti-gun

[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.600]  hate hate these fake men that all they do is watch sports all day and brag how much they know
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:41.840]  about them and you people you people are literally living in a fantasy land
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:49.440]  we are under attack every form of liberty is being gutted in front of us and chopped up
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:57.040]  and you are literally watching modern sports designed to distract men because men are designed
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:03.200]  to be building and constructing and innovating and and being leaders but the average man is
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:07.680]  like a 10 year old trying to be cool in a rest of development and so is the average woman
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.240]  and that's really it i don't like being in a culture of children
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:21.920]  it's not an elitist statement about how how grievously childlike in a bad way like
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:29.040]  petulant 10 or 11 year olds the general public is while all these idiots are pulling the political

[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:43.600]  giggle at you and say i'm with the establishment they think because they buy into it that they're
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:49.280]  now part of it when they're absolutely in the crosshairs absolutely under precision

[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.480]  to get to let me just finish up with some of these headlines we just joined us male and
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:50.960]  female brains wire differently scans reveal but if you say that men and women are different that's
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:09:00.160]  sexist well i mean i can't have a baby can i this is ridiculous it's social engineering folks to
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:06.480]  put women in front line combat islamist rebel sees part of ancient syrian christian town take
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:14.000]  nuns captive rts reporting that and there's just all sorts of al-qaeda taking over the middle east
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.960]  i've got a big stack of news on that front today also the financial times is reporting what we were
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:29.360]  telling you yesterday this rollout by jeff bezos of amazon saying they're going to have thousands
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:35.280]  of drones per city delivering everything this is involved with the government to condition everyone
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:41.680]  and these drones will actually make a lot of their money off of human intelligence to send back video
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:47.200]  to humans watching it and to face scan and to read license plates so and members of congress
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:51.840]  are now announcing that this is just the full-on slot of we're going to launch thousands of drones
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:59.120]  per city oh cute the drone came and you know dropped something off at the party and this
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:03.200]  is just setting the precedent where these corporations with their robot cars and robot
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:12.560]  18 wheelers and robot larger delivery systems will be able to basically take over the world
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:18.000]  because they're much cheaper than humans now and folks are like well that's just progress no we need
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.920]  to decide our development that is one of the most basic human traits is that we can decide our own
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:29.200]  environment and try to build our own future unlike animals like that's probably the greatest human
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:35.680]  trait that an empathy and we're allowing other small groups of humans through government and
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:43.280]  regulations and through creating monopolies like amazon and walmart have done with all sorts of
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:51.920]  really you know in my view criminal actions amazon's almost bankrupted the major publishing
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:56.080]  industries out there even for small publishers because they won't let you sell your product
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:02.720]  there unless you give it to them about 65 70 off and by the time you do that they then lower the
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:07.840]  price let's say the book should be 20 dollars big hard bound expensive book you need to sell
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:15.120]  tens of thousands even make your money back they will sell it for nine dollars and guess what you
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:23.680]  sold it to them for eight dollars or seven dollars and so you make a couple dollars because of the
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:28.000]  cost of the book and the promotion and all of it and then they get the book and they make a couple
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.520]  dollars and so it's not even free market because because they become the market and then freeze
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:42.000]  everyone out and operated a level meant to shut down their competition so there you go you know
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.480]  i mean i remember the fAA came out three years ago and said we're going to authorize 30 000 drones
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:53.280]  in the skies for deliveries and surveillance and everything else by 2020 and half of those will
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:12:00.240]  be in the air by 2015 and that was like 2011 i was only reading what the fAA put out in curtain
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:04.640]  emo and watch and wrote articles in drudge report dot com picked it up and then so they
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:08.800]  people were upset about it and congress started having hearings so they just came out in the news
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:17.680]  and said i was a liar there were no drones no drones none and we're like well wait we have the fAA we
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:22.000]  have wired magazine admitting they're using predators on you know people that are growing
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  crops they're not supposed to or building barns they're not supposed to or you know they
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.120]  could claim stealing neighbors cows and they're like shut up liar shut up deeply racist i'm like
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:38.400]  i'm for unity and humans coming together shut up racist and then behind the scenes these msnbc
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:45.120]  people i've had them physically attack me in colorada with a knife cut the cord on my megaphone
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.880]  to violate my free speech so the Denver police wouldn't arrest me and violate the first amendment
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:55.280]  for their credit got a hand that's a Denver police for two hours they told him shut me down
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:01.520]  with my bullhorn they said nope first amendment uh as long as he doesn't block traffic with his
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:07.120]  crowd so they sent over like a six and a half foot you know seven foot guy was just giant
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:13.040]  to cut grab and cut the wire so we had our own giant guy there and hoisted folks up on his back
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:16.240]  and i went and got another bullhorn and we bullhorned the crowd we went to radio shack and
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:21.760]  bought one well you guys type in um msnbc attacks alex jones i think that's the headline on youtube
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:27.120]  you can actually see the guy do it but but the point here is i don't know why i went off into
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:34.560]  that story is that they're afraid of people power and they're just rolling all of this out amazon
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:40.160]  drones nine ways it could go horribly wrong and then they go over the nine ways packages fall from
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:49.360]  the sky hacking theft the weather friendly fire lost bearings airspace restrictions
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  diversions making cars wreck yeah how about face scanning you as they're already doing and
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:02.480]  and surveilling you and and using it to stalk people and on and on and on and on and on and on
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:07.600]  and again amazon is a globalist front company that's even come out in the news
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:11.680]  i was the first to tell you not bragging they don't allow these big companies to get that
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:18.480]  big and operate folks unless they're part of the club hong kong confirms first case of h seven in
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:26.720]  nine bird flu that's not good news yeah they're gonna claim down the road everything they've
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:32.080]  set up for bio attacks there'll be other stuff they do but they may just go right to a weapon that
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:35.840]  kills almost everybody or they could release something i think they like to test things so
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:39.600]  they'll release something that only kills you know 10 million people first i would guess and then
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.000]  they'll use that as a medical tyranny to put in control and then they'll release something that
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.560]  kills a billion people and then they'll test the response to that and then they'll release something
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:55.440]  that kills everyone 100 of people that come in contact with it but then it will be a mutagen
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:05.520]  designed to then mutate uh into a non-lethal pathogen uh within one year that will be the attack
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:11.360]  pattern prime projection analysis from all of the enemy transmissions and reverse engineered
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:16.400]  preparations so they've got it in test tubes right now to wipe everybody out and listen what
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:20.000]  matters is you get your heart right with god if they do go ahead with that if we're not able to stop
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:25.680]  them uh just remember as you're dying with your family that the system did it to you and just get
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.800]  right with god don't worship the government and the system and and the beast worldwide system as
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:37.040]  you're dying don't call 911 they're not going to help you they're all going to be dying too all right
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:40.960]  there you go i know it's hardcore it's reality and and and you'll laugh now you probably won't
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:45.680]  laugh later i mean i hope we can stop it and people to say oh he said this was going to happen
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:49.520]  all the preparations are for that and so you seem to know that's in the cards and they could do it
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:56.000]  tomorrow they could do it 10 years from now but they are prepared cog is for them to go underground
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.160]  and survive it while everyone's wiped out they'll be a nostalgia for those that uh this is a rank
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:06.560]  corporation plan actually they'll be a nostalgia for those left behind that died they'll be given
[1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:11.840]  a false story uh everyone's already been tested for government connections corporate connections
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:18.720]  genetic connections they have the adam and eve list of of of eugenic prime types that they're
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:22.240]  going to it's really people they won't have sex with uh that are going to be brought into the
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.400]  underground bases and all the rest of it it's just totally dr strangelove and i hope you all

[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:43.600]  is a cheat now we're a negative commodity garbage to be taken to the curb that's the view of the
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:54.880]  elite hitler was only a spinoff of the eugenicist my friends monday through friday 11 a.m to 2 p.m
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.640]  central we're here live back week night seven o'clock central for the rest of the hour we're
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:01.760]  going to be joined by a very interesting fellow who always enjoy getting on i want to get him on
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:06.400]  about a host of issues and i'm going to ask you about all sorts of news and throw wildcards at him
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:10.960]  we're going to cover the waterfront of news with him but first find out what's first and foremost
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:15.760]  on his radar because he's a former prosecutor and a really good lawyer not just a tv host
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:22.560]  on the news in new york and a syndicated radio host but um i was reading out of revelations
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:27.840]  revelation 18 whether you see it as as a warning about corrupt civilizations or whether you see
[1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:34.640]  it as prophecy regardless it certainly fits with our day and it says that the merchants of the earth
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:43.120]  trafficed in slaves and the souls of men that's revelation 1813 king james version
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:50.240]  and says the same in the greek out of the hebra and the aramaic so that's what we're talking about
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:57.200]  and at the bottom of this my faith has become stronger not all the fake stuff in the churches
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:02.160]  but but but my personal understanding of good and evil how real it is studying the global engineers
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:07.680]  they want your mind from a from a secular perspective they really want to control your free will
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.080]  that's what i tell you you have no free will
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:17.920]  and top globalists are all extremely into the occult folks and they tell you to be an atheist
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:22.800]  because they don't want you even thinking about all that going on because that's the higher things
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:26.240]  whether you think it's a part of your brain that is attracted to that or whatever brain waves go
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:30.320]  higher in all the studies when you're in a spiritual situation you're more creative you're
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:35.120]  more giving they don't want you to be like that whether it's really spiritual or part of our
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:41.360]  physiology there's no debate it's there a god-shaped vacuum and they don't want you going there
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:46.640]  because then you're going to worship that and they can't get you to sell your intellect and your
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:52.080]  free will to them they want to control the spark of free intellect i've gone off on some really
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:57.440]  heavy topics today we've got huge obama care news huge news with cps chopping women over to
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:00.880]  steal their babies out of their wombs it's just going to get more insane folks this is what happens
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:06.160]  when governments are out of control that's joseph mingla level stuff and we've also got
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:12.320]  huge al-qaeda news we've got huge snowden news as the guardian now basically faces criminal
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:16.880]  prosecution by the criminal british government for exposing the criminal activity of the nsa
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:21.600]  which is their duty i told you they're heroes folks so are we quite frankly the whistleblowers
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:27.440]  we've had on they're going after them and the guardians says look we only published one percent oh
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:32.640]  yeah folks listen we actually know all about the nsa i'm trying to explain this to everybody
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:35.920]  because it's an insider it caught on they tried to block it
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:43.280]  Wayne madson had his article removed off the guardian we know everything about it we know
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:48.800]  everything okay it's so big it there's contractors how it's funded what how it's designed they had
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:55.120]  to get the funding and the telecommunications act and other acts before that we've had so many
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:00.960]  whistleblowers on we're going to go to linel i'm ranting here linel of course is linelmedia.com
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:08.240]  and he's on pix11 news in new york and i always uh in you know enjoy having him on to give his
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:14.160]  perspective he's in the top most important radio talk show host of all time according uh to talkers
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:19.120]  magazine and more linelmedia.com hey linel uh we're only got about two minutes before we go to
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.840]  break but i threw out a bunch of stuff here we're gonna come back and get into free speech attacks
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:28.080]  and drones and everything that's happening at obama care and all of it but what do you think
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:32.320]  the nature of the universe is and what do you think about the people running the planet well the
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:37.360]  first thing is by the way you never rant don't ever say you're ranting i dig you i understand
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:42.240]  what you're doing because sometimes you have a tremendous amount of information that you have
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:47.600]  to get through this very small funnel that we call radio because your brain is on fire and
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:53.920]  a wash and ideas so don't ever uh um apologize for that let me see what happened this week to me
[1:28:53.920 --> 1:29:00.880]  which blew my mind last week as you know it was the 15th anniversary of the murder of president
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:06.080]  kennedy and i talked to a young man the young man who had never seen this a pruder film believe it
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:10.160]  out of a city side by side with him don't ask me how he missed it he had heard about it he saw
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:16.880]  maybe even segments he saw the portion that is the most horrible this is of course the the president's
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:24.080]  brain the the the misting of the president right there before our eyes and he let out a shriek
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:28.880]  in a bit of an expletive and i said let me ask you a question i said you know something about
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:34.560]  inertia where do you think that shot comes from he said well the front i said well guess what this
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:40.800]  is what the conspiracy theories are about they say it came from the back and i saw in his face a
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:47.440]  disbelief and a concomitant terror and i thought this is where we've gone stay there i want to
[1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:52.960]  explain this when i come back we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:35.280]  looking like a child who was caught basically uh you know in the closet doing you know what and
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:42.000]  mom opens the door i mean he just looks like he is just emanating i'm a liar and remember congress

[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.520]  but final finish your story so go back you see the head of the president vaporize the whole back of
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:56.320]  his head brain splattering all over the back of the vehicle even if someone's never fired a gun or
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:00.320]  never been hunting and you know you shoot a deer on the side of the head the other side blows off
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:03.040]  shoot a deer in the front of the head the back of the head blows off i don't want to get graphic
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:08.240]  here uh but the point is you see war films whatever everybody knows you shoot somebody in the front
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.920]  of the head back of the head blows off but so so this this man you're talking to finally sees this
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:19.760]  you're a former prosecutor you know how to put evidence on continue well what i said was i said
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:27.200]  now i i said this is not to say that this event is not without um alternative theories and hypotheses
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:32.720]  that's not the point but what has happened alex and you know this very well is that we have taken
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:39.840]  this term conspiracy a conspiracy theory you know the great gorvidal whom you've uh interviewed who
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:46.000]  i think is just i mean i watch him sometimes and he's to me still alive some of the stuff he said
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:52.320]  speaks to me so well he said he was not a conspiracy theorist he was a conspiracy analyst
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:57.520]  and he said there will come a day if it's not already here where it will be an article of faith
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:03.920]  that there are no conspiracy theories now this word conspiracy merely means the confederation
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:10.880]  the union an agreement between two guilty parties to effectuate something most crimes
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:15.920]  if you think about it of any worth involved more than one person yeah there's a lone wolf here and
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:22.400]  there so the word is very very black and white in in criminal statutes but it has taken alex a
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:30.240]  new frame it means crazy farfetched paranoid baseless the other day somebody was i was i'm
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:37.040]  very concerned about a number of things obviously in terms of uh this as well but what we're eating
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:41.440]  and and gmo's and labeling and i asked somebody a question i said what is it and that because of
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:48.080]  course many many big companies in monsanto and japan and others and big agra have shown a concerted
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:54.160]  effort to try to dissuade us from labeling so i asked this happened to be the same person this
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:37:02.000]  question i said what do you not want to know that you're eating so let me repeat that what do you
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:08.640]  not want to know ground glass asbestos calories fat content tell me what you know and he said well
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:14.480]  of course i want to know everything precisely why do you think that there is such a concerning
[1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:20.960]  and expensive effort to keep gmo contents from you and he said oh is that a conspiracy theory i
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:28.160]  said wait a minute stop conspiracy theory does not mean evil now it's gone from you know unrealistic
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:35.920]  paranoia to somehow evil this word has now enveloped everything and then we have this
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:42.640]  group of people and alex these people scare me this is the professional skeptic this is a person
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:48.880]  and i love uh pen and teller and pendulets done some wonderful things and some of the skeptics
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:54.000]  people have been very very good and the amazing randy and done some wonderful stuff but they start
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:02.240]  off with the premise a priori that i'm going to debunk something that you're advancing that's
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:07.520]  intellectually disingenuous if you want to i'm sure you've run into these people as well
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.040]  atheists these are people who think not only do they disbelieve or they're non-faith but they
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:20.320]  start off with the premise that a person of faith you or others are insane baseless so you
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:25.920]  have these groups of people and what's happening alex is this this anti-intellectual argument
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:32.400]  is now become personal and you also meet people and i'm going to tell you this is the pro conspiracy
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.800]  people these are people who to use that word and i'm going to embrace it i'm not going to find it
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:41.280]  anymore i'm going to use it a shorthand there's the other end that believe they can make reality
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.760]  by whatever they make up and whatever they say is true that's the extreme of conspiracy theory
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:50.880]  but that's what i found is that you can say they're devaluing the dollar and they go you're a
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:57.680]  conspiracy theorist they use it as a crutch when you're not intellectually informed to say obama
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:04.640]  is not related to dick cheney and you say no actually he's his ninth cousin here's ancestry.com
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:12.320]  oh they can just make that up no obama admits it through his mother's family so so it's a way where
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:19.360]  the people denying conspiracy theory are are saying they can choose reality and then the extreme
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:25.200]  conspiracy people they believe that they're like fiction writers that when they write it it's like
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:30.240]  they wrote it in starlight it makes it come true so there's there's both extremes of delusional
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:34.800]  people that meet around the back precisely but there's also something here that's happening you know
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:40.320]  i i told you that my dream one day is to be the psychologist general not the attorney general not
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:48.320]  the surgeon general but the psychologist general and i would be empowered to create memes and
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:54.000]  themes and understandings and kind of a an understanding of what is real and what isn't
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:00.640]  real there's something called speaking of gormadaling and he said we are the united states of amnesia just
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:10.080]  seems like yesterday uh mr carrey was saying to us that we must act immediately in syria
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:16.480]  or else we will have hell to pay syria syria syria syria syria all of a sudden he perhaps
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:24.080]  made a little bit dumb uh medvedev or putin took him up or called his bet and now syria is off the
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:31.840]  mainstream media map lindsay graham was saying we would be nuked in south carolina by syria if we
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:39.760]  didn't attack them cbs knows you see you know alex i must say something if you've never heard the alex
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:48.240]  jones show what you are is you are a citation freak and and the lawyer in me really loves this
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:53.600]  in in law you have to have a citation you can't say it's against the law to uh
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:00.560]  moporee's against the law who says section 220 so it's it's in my my nature i don't think you have
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:09.360]  ever given and i've listened to you for years now an opinion based upon just an opinion and
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:17.680]  not based upon some factor statute the things that you will read on a daily basis by their very nature
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:23.520]  to the uninitiated to people who have been lulled in this sense of kind of like um you know leave
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:29.360]  it to beaver land the 50s black and white everything's fine you've said some things that
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:35.520]  absolutely would blow my mind you say don't take my word for it it's in the telegrapher
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:41.680]  it's here where it's there that's the thing that is you are the master of this oh no please i'm
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:46.960]  enough of that i mean listen i just look at the news i see the pattern historically repeating itself
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:50.800]  and i know the history of eugenics i know where it comes from i know who's set up plan parenthood i
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:56.800]  know i know the players and so then i get called a conspiracy theorist or they point at wacky folks
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.520]  that think you know space aliens you know are secretly running the white house and and it you
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:06.080]  know it's all just insane but shifting gears into a whole bunch of issues what do you make
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:11.520]  because i know your commentaries have covered this on obama care because if you analyze it
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:17.600]  they had msnbc say that i'm a deeply racist with with no citation by the way no clip of me saying
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:24.320]  something even racist much less deeply racist and then i influence the boston bombers no citation
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:30.960]  because i don't like obama care this is two months ago saying it was a giant scam by offshore banks
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:35.440]  rip us off well i know who lobbied and wrote it and now what's happened and it's been ruled attacks
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:39.600]  to private grips and i've been called a conspiracy theorist if you criticize it i guess you'll be
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:44.080]  called a heretic as well what do you make of obama care and where it's going and what's happened to
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:48.560]  the president okay well it is a tax according to chief justice roberts there was a basis that it was
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:55.040]  on hell if i recall correctly at least the uh the uh private mandate that's right let me bring this
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:02.880]  up i'm gonna bring a very very perhaps two base but this is what amazes me alex there is not a
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:12.560]  pizza delivery shop there is nothing that does not have a website that works nothing i had suggested
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:17.360]  one time in in passing that perhaps maybe the administration or the government should turn
[1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:23.520]  to porn sites because they are most proficient at getting out their product i have heard of a lot of
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:30.880]  things funding problems okay we didn't anticipate the sign up okay but not having a website that
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:38.880]  works when john stewart and his writers of the daily show speak to this you know it's a critical
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:46.080]  bottom what i don't understand is simply this when a person becomes the commander chief or the chief
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:53.040]  executive of this country and they say x and x does not seem to be the truth anymore why doesn't
[1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:58.880]  everybody as a citizen call that president out irrespective of the party or irrespective of the
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:07.520]  man or the woman i don't understand that so i am absolutely beyond explaining this anymore and it's
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:11.760]  become a comedy of errors and what's even more interesting are the people who are trying to
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:18.560]  save the apologists for i guess not so much the administration but the event that no no you really
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:23.600]  don't understand it these things aren't that bad but i gotta say something to you when you you
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  mentioned this before there is so much you started off with this absolute amazing story something
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:34.400]  happened this week which and you said this and it goes back to my psychologist in general part of
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:41.040]  you don't mind and that is the habituation the conditioning and the generalizing of us to more
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:47.360]  and more surveillance when 60 minutes mentioned the jeff bezos octacoppers and and helicopters and
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:56.720]  that sort of thing what this is is again a systematic um acceptance as to how cool things are
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:01.040]  and i did the commentary and i said wait a bit let's look at a couple of things here
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:08.240]  michael where to the f a a chief says it by the year 2050 there's going to be 7500 drones uavs
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:13.600]  and who was going to license these folks forget the fact that congested airspace forget the fact
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:18.480]  that these things are run by gps and they can crash forget the fact that they have metal blades
[1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:23.200]  it can hurt people the batteries can blow up forget the fact that they can get sucked up into jet
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:32.960]  turbines all of that who is asking these questions but what happened was the sheeple looked at the
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:41.040]  gold watch and they said isn't this cool isn't this neat imagine now how somebody's going to drop
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:46.480]  a box of i don't know socks in your backyard i don't know how this is going to work that was
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:53.520]  i don't want to say a beta test but that was part one of the acclimation and the habituation that
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:46:01.120]  we have to this idea of drones and by the way by the way i saw articles in wash tech like in 1999
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:05.360]  back when washington post had that tech magazine i read it on air bragging that they were going to
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:10.800]  habitualize us to chips in our bodies and drones and so even when they're on records saying they're
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:16.080]  going to do this to us we're still a conspiracy theorist for for pointing out that there is an
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:21.200]  agenda and listen here is a conspiracy theory most stuff i do is not theorizing but as the police
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.800]  are prosecutors you've got to figure out what the criminals are doing and try to figure out their
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:30.240]  plan unless you actually you know tap their phone or whatever or you know infiltrate their group
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:34.400]  well i've studied these globalists so i know how they think what their in game is they think they're
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:39.760]  so bulletproof politically they're all over their own white papers bragging so in their case we know
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:45.520]  nine times out of ten exactly what their plan is and it's so bold the average person has trouble
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:50.560]  dealing with it but i've noticed this planned failure thing in other countries they fire you
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:57.440]  if you screw up that's the old common sense way right no fema ordered a stand down in katrina and
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:04.240]  screwed up to say oh look we did terrible give us more funding and i predicted that it wasn't
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:09.520]  going to work on purpose because the bill was going to screw everybody so they want to act like
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:15.360]  oh you're getting screwed because it's messed up it's not on purpose it's not personal and so
[1:47:15.360 --> 1:47:20.480]  that's why they're going to keep it screwed up forever and then oh give me dictatorial power
[1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:26.240]  i can selectively get in there and fix it making him the hero giving themselves a good crisis
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:32.720]  that won't go to waste and so i don't know they did it on purpose i mean i can't prove it in court
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:40.000]  but i know i mean i know because i've seen how these people operate it's like as a long time ago
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  he's been a deer hunter and my dad taught me when you see a bunch of dough run out in cold weather
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.840]  looking back over their shoulder they're getting chased by a buck that's in the rut trying to have
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.640]  sex with them get your gun up and get ready and nine times out of ten when i see a bunch of dough
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.520]  running looking back over their shoulder the big bucks going to come running out or a coyote
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:04.960]  sorry go ahead i mean it's not conspiracy theory that as a hunter i know when dough are you know
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:10.880]  running from a buck go ahead first of all i think we need to reacquaint ourselves with a couple of
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:14.880]  rules you know there's this um i think it's called pilgers law never believe anything until it's
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:21.760]  officially denied and that that's almost to the point right now where i'm almost i i don't want
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:26.880]  to think this but i'm getting very close to it where the official statement to me i interpret
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:34.320]  almost as oh so that's what you want me to think versus that's what happened also i said that history
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:41.280]  would be a wonderful thing if only we're true looking past looking at um jfk and what i saw
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:49.200]  and where we are now 50 years later is is beyond me there's another thing too which is very interesting
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:55.280]  here now i want everybody to to pull yourself out of the matrix if you will that you're living in
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:00.880]  and and by the way that movie was so prescient and minority report i mean i can't believe this was
[1:49:01.440 --> 1:49:07.920]  cloaked as entertainment and many of us missed how vatic and how pythonic that was but i want
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:13.760]  people to look at something alex what we are missing here at the school level at the government
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:19.840]  level is a lack a dearth and the death of critical thinking you know in law school there was a
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:26.880]  mnemonic that we use iraq ir ac when you tackle the legal problem it's issue rule analysis
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:33.120]  conclusion what is the issue focus on what we're talking about don't go off into the words and
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:39.600]  talk about uh nixon or liberals or whatever just just just focus it what is the rule what do we
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  know and that's why you could be talking about you don't want gmo they just throw in why are you
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:48.080]  racist it's just meant to change the subject so you'll say i'm not a racist they've already won
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:54.720]  changing the subject let me tell you something what happens is when you use any racist misogynist
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:50:02.000]  anti-semitic anything when you use something and you give too many false positives you will
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:09.040]  habituate desensitize people to the word and the sting of it so that when you are really there
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:16.160]  it's like these uh antibiotic resistant bacteria when you say racist racist racist and you say no
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:22.000]  no no no this really is racist because racism is here and anti-semitism is here misogyny it's here
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:28.400]  but when that's your answer you turn off that sensitivity mode in people there's also something
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:34.320]  here which is very interesting you know i heard a statistic the the uh i i call him the ted baxter
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:41.200]  sock puppet mainstream media by the way ron burgundy is not the person ted baxter was so
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:47.520]  speaking depression he saw it all but whenever you hear the decline in american education scores
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:54.560]  i think somewhere there are people almost ringing their hands in delight because they do not want
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:58.400]  people to be smart sure sure the owners want dumb people so stay there we're gonna come back
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:03.520]  and finish up with that story straight ahead the ultimate knife dot com presents the fox

[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:41.040]  how we treat people in and then we need to treat animals better the problem is the movement behind
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:47.600]  all this wants to be able to have government and institutions claim they represent animals and just
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:52.160]  use it to take our liberty just like the environmental movement more and more is about power grabbing
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:56.480]  not about dealing with real issues like gmos so i'm going to break that down coming up
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:04.400]  also over in england they're now chopping babies out of women the cps is uh and this is outraged

[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:28.720]  of the proprietary nascent iodine in and i'm going to do this test on video for folks and post
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.640]  it on youtube tomorrow because i've tested the leading competitors which i'm sure great i've
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:38.000]  talked to medical doctors you know it's good iodine it just makes me not feel well and people
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.600]  ask why other iodine's like black it's because it's oxidized in the other things like alcohol
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:50.560]  in the glycerin base it turns purple and then i went and did the mainline medical research that's
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:55.040]  because it is truly the free nascent iodine and we're getting a bunch of tests done right now
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:59.680]  by a bunch of big laboratories but it appears that you actually this may be some of the only
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:06.000]  real nascent iodine out there where it is open free form i mean i i just can't believe how good
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.040]  uh this product is that i literally lucked into in private label because no one was even buying

[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:39.680]  giving 20 off uh that really pretty much violates my contract has 10 off is driving down the price
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:44.560]  for everybody and 20 is just really aggressive uh but we're doing it on the whole pro pure pro one

[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:55.200]  so that's it i've got to end it because they don't want to sell out they want to be able to still
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:58.720]  that's how supply and demand works if it's such a good deal that it's selling out even their

[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:08.080]  all of it blows away the leading competitors we have side by side comparison uh and i hate to

[1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:55.600]  radio network a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:00.880]  pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:05.360]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:11.600]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:18.480]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin

[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:28.080]  all right lionel the media analyst final media dot com final segment with him i'm going to shut
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:31.520]  up give you the floor finish that story up you were getting into it i want to ask you
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:36.240]  where is the dinosaur media going i mean you've been giving hardcore libertarian commentary for
[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:42.000]  decades so your show is still popular in mainstream media but if people don't get with the program and
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.320]  i'm seeing a little bit more of this like dylan radigan came out and exposed the predatory system
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:51.920]  and said we're in an unequivocal monopoly system not a free market and they basically got rid of
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:57.920]  him even though he had the most popular show on that channel but i mean what is the establishment
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:02.160]  going to do with the media well a couple of things to alex first of all i want to thank you
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:06.640]  and i want to wish you and your your family the best this holiday season because we don't speak
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:12.560]  enough and i do like to give you my my thoughts of love and respect back at your brother now a
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:17.760]  couple of things to uh first and foremost i please let me comment about this animal thing because
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:21.200]  i'm going to be doing a comment during this tonight and this is this is one of the thing
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:26.000]  i want to teach somebody something if ever you are arguing any kind of legal argument
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:33.680]  the answer alex that will that you can use for every every uh legal question there is that
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:39.520]  has ever been posited by the mind of man the answer that will always work is it depends
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.640]  and i'm telling you i'm not fudging on that i'm telling you it's the truth here's a question
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:50.400]  that i have we know like potter stewart said he said he knew uh obscenity but he saw it we all
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:56.960]  know for example about this business about animals being basically treated as humans for purposes
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:04.480]  of habeas corpus and there's uh this the non-human rights project did you know in this movie black
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:09.760]  fish this documentary about orcas did you know speaking of facts that they have looked at the
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:16.960]  anatomy of a brain of an orca of a of the cretacean species model knows dolphin purposes dolphins
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:23.680]  and they have something called a paralympic system meaning two brains well yes but they're
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:31.120]  this particular lobe their sensitivity for attachment is greater than even that of a human
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:39.360]  so when you take a a a a way all the way from its mother they grieve forever now that being said
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:46.640]  does that change the equation what happens if somebody were to say that you who let's say keep
[2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:54.240]  kosher or halal uh uh dietary systems that kosher slaughtering that that's deemed inhumane
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:03:01.280]  i don't know where this is going what i always tell people to be very very careful with this because
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:05.840]  like years ago they said it's not nice to fool mother nature but when you go into some areas
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:12.240]  understand number one who is behind it always ask because if i was let's say and i'm not saying
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:18.080]  these people are nefarious but if i were a really evil person what i would do is i would always
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:25.360]  introduce myself by taking a position that everybody agreed on and then as i became friendly
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:30.880]  and people like my cause whatever it was then i stick it to him so that's number one number two
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:38.320]  never ever ever apologize for a question you have you know kids always say why daddy why why
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.760]  that's why they act like it's bad under political correctness to even ask questions or have or talk
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:51.360]  and it's amazing uh that if you even make an observation they they just want us to shut down
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:55.280]  and do what we're told and only accept the official story one minute left what's going
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:01.280]  to happen to the mainstream media the mainstream media right now is going to have to understand
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:09.200]  that when it comes to news this is the opportunity it has because human beings love information
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:16.960]  and they love thinking and it is completely possible for mainstream uh corporate entities
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:24.080]  to expand their area of coverage and break away because the information that is out there
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:29.680]  that people might say well it's a little offbeat a little bit different that is what people
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:37.360]  love and all i'm saying is never apologize for thinking never apologize for asking a question
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:43.120]  critically thanks no matter what you do and you will never go wrong and alex thank you again for
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:47.040]  allowing me the opportunity to be here with you my dear friend if you and your family the best

[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:09.520]  it's like saying uh alibaba had a bunch of women in his harem uh the point is it's not my only love
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:15.760]  uh but a lot of the special forces use them you name it they ran a very nice ad of the dad coming
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:20.960]  home to mayberry usa going in and hugging his wife and saying i have a right to defend my family
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.160]  daniel defense and they banned it they said it's offensive but you can have shoot them up video games
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:31.360]  all that is it simulated you're living in fantasy land that's what they want you can have military
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:36.960]  ads whatever you want you do not show a father coming home walking in the house with images
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:43.200]  of his children uh and uh him and his marine corps uniform being pro second amendment the
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:47.920]  image of the marines cannot be used to promote the bill of rights they can only be used to promote
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:55.360]  the globalist empire and this is offensive because anything wholesome is offensive absolutely
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:02.720]  amazing and i am calling for a boycott this is like saying leave it to beaver is offensive
[2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:09.280]  but but it is offensive they're busy overturning our culture bringing in tyranny they want us
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:14.960]  totally screwed up here's another one oregon girl barred from selling mistletoe but told it's okay
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:23.040]  to beg w r i c television abc news is reporting uh that she her dad didn't have money to get
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:27.280]  her braces so she did what any terrorist would do she wouldn't cut a bunch of mistletoe thinking i
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:33.920]  could go to the local uh you know city uh area where they're having a christmas fair and i could
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.680]  walk around selling my wares like people've done for 10 000 years in city markets uh and they said
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:43.680]  we'll arrest you if you do that anymore just like they've cracked down on the eliminate stands the
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:47.760]  last thing a kid needs to learn is you can do something without the government saying you can
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:54.160]  here in north korea i meant land of the free home of the brave you're meant to go work at a box store
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:01.360]  for minimum wage and be a slave and take your vaccines and die early uh again lawmaker says amazon
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:06.240]  drone could photograph your home that's that's the real reason for the drone rollout claiming
[2:11:06.240 --> 2:11:11.760]  it's package delivery that's now come out in congress uh shifting gears uh guardian we have
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:17.120]  published one percent of the snowden leak bright bart is reporting that from ap it's up on drudge
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:27.040]  report dot com as the top story there it's also on info wars dot com right now and it is just
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:32.400]  outrageous that they're trying to criminally prosecute now and are doing a criminal investigation
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:38.640]  of the guardian for exposing illegal spying by the u.s and british government it'd be like if they
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:46.640]  caught the president snorting cocaine off of the back of a hooker like a like his predecessor uh
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:51.040]  bill clinton like to do and then and then if someone reported on that arresting them for
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:56.800]  reporting the crime but but this is a crime not a sexual crime against society as they say it but
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:01.600]  but a much higher crime of violating all of our rights not to keep us safe they run the terrorist
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:06.080]  so there you go the guardian should have released it all but now
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:11.600]  now they're going to go after them and persecute the press and the press of course is rolling
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:20.080]  over groveling to watching another quasi decent organization being torn apart just like news
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.560]  core i don't like a lot of stuff news core does they've attacked me many times but they're clearly
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:29.520]  going after news core for spying on other people which is what the press does while the government
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:34.960]  spies times a million and the government ships guns into mexico and the government's involved
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.720]  funding al-qaeda and the government's involved putting our military into nato and the government's
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:44.080]  shutting off our coal power plants and jacking up our prices meanwhile that very same justice
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:51.520]  department that says they're quote brainwashing people against guns is is is now threatening
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:56.560]  and blackmailing news core and i told you this two years ago for my inside sources it broke last
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:03.360]  month that news core has been threatened rupert murdoch with arrest if he criticizes obama and
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:11.280]  that's why you see so much groveling not just on fox news but on news core properties movies
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:20.800]  sitcoms dramas it's almost all pro obama the fox run nfl and the superbowl has refused the ad
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:25.680]  that we just in fact i got to play the ad one more time i've got to play the ad
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:29.600]  this is the ad if you're a radio listener i'm going to narrate it but the ads up on info wars
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:37.440]  dot com adan solazar has written an article about it dealing with my call to boycott uh the
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:43.120]  nfl but here's some of the other headlines half of americans want obama care scrapped
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:52.720]  81 one law changed as more white house lies are exposed i mean steve writes these articles off
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:14:00.640]  mainline polls i've seen polls of 90 plus percent against uh against obama care but
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:04.080]  doesn't matter it's unconstitutional i don't care what the supreme court says you can have a private
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:11.680]  tax to foreign banks tsa expands searches of parked cars at airports yeah they actually go into the
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:18.320]  airports down breaking your cars and screw them up with those slim gems tsa claim debunked photo

[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:35.600]  so that's just some of the news up on info wars dot com right now on adan's article i guess is
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:40.960]  going up any minute with this nfl piece where i call for the boycott uh of
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:50.240]  the nfl for what they're doing but but this is fox and this is the nfl
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:55.600]  daniel's defense recently submitted a commercial to fox to be played during the
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:01.360]  2014 nfl super bowl xlv 111
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:09.040]  though the video doesn't showcase one of the company's popular dd m4 rifles
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:18.240]  the paid advertisement spot was rejected by the nfl as being offensive and the nfl said it's
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:27.760]  in prohibited advertising categories so there you go ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:35.440]  play the prohibited ad that shows a dad driving home driving home regular neighborhood regular car

[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:55.520]  of the center of his world is his family that's evil the nfl's supposed to be the center of your
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:04.880]  world walks by pictures of his family is my highest priority his family's safety a man
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:10.080]  protecting a woman and the baby that is that is blasphemy for their protection
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:20.240]  he's responsible protect his family blasphemy and no one has the right to tell me how to defend
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:24.400]  that's right nobody has a right to say you can't protect yourself that's a basic so i've chosen
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:32.240]  right effective tool for the job daniel defense defending your nation defending your home oh my

[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:52.720]  they've had on national television different so-called liberal journalist calling me a die hard

[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.160]  obvious that's the definition oh it's obvious that i'm going to just give in to classical evil
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:12.000]  that every culture listed is bad there's not one culture that ever said what the system's doing is
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:21.360]  good it is crime of fascia on its face a hundred percent bad news and we're supposed to just grovel
[2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:30.000]  to the entire thing amazing and they don't want you to recognize there's a war
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:33.600]  against the individual or the family or that you're under attack or that there's groups with
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:38.800]  agendas to run your life of course there are they say that's a conspiracy when that's historical

[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:51.520]  merciless control freaks dedicated to destroying free will

[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:18.480]  against the adversity i walked in at 6 a.m this morning because my kids um my my youngest daughter
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:24.080]  five years old has a cold and she'd climbed in bed with my wife and and i didn't want to get it so
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:29.520]  i went and slept in the guest bedroom and i walked in and the french bulldog they were all in the
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:35.040]  king size bed over on one side like almost the whole bed was open it was my wife asleep with my
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:40.560]  daughter holding her like a barnacle clutching her with the french bulldog up against my daughter
[2:19:40.560 --> 2:19:46.080]  with a cheek up against her all three of them snoring and they look so cute and i looked at that

[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:22.240]  the woods and they saw us peeing in the woods it didn't charge us because even though they're
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:25.440]  in any state they're not going to arrest you for peeing in the woods but i'm telling you the
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:31.200]  canadian police told us yeah if we see you peeing we're going to charge you with sexual indecency
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:35.520]  i go but i've seen you over there peeing they go it doesn't matter and i don't know why i've

[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:57.200]  all right it's hard to turn that off at least for me
[2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:03.600]  we're gonna go to curtain ammo on the attack on the first amendment a bunch of other news
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:07.120]  here i said i'd take calls then i've ended up not giving the number out not taking calls just
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:11.760]  because there's so much to talk about i've probably covered one third of the news and since then a
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:15.440]  ton of other stuff is broken but i'm i'm going to get to it we're doing pretty good here so far
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:21.040]  today briefly ladies and gentlemen i'm going to do this on television right now for folks
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:26.640]  that are watching it no no i'll do it tomorrow because i got dr. group coming in but the point
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:31.920]  is is that you take this iodine according to the the medical and scientific research i looked into
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:37.440]  myself confirming what dr. group and others said if it's true freeform iodine when you put it on
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:44.800]  white paper it should turn purple ultra violent blue and if you do that with our nascent iodine
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:53.120]  that's what it does it goes from the yellow to the blue and it's simply amazing and then it's
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:59.040]  going to turn blue you're watching on television now you take every other so-called nascent iodine
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:03.520]  out there and you do it and it turns red and then total black it's oxidized in the alcohol
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:08.480]  and we're looking at what that is and and we're doing tests it looks like the iodine is actually
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:14.240]  breaking down into something else derivatives of it whatever the point is that's why this is so
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:18.560]  special look at that it's turning bright purple i don't know if the camera of folks watching on
[2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:23.920]  the internet could see that we're gonna shoot a high def video of this today and i was looking at
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:27.360]  this doing research and finding these old tests they used to do to see if something was really
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:33.600]  nascent or freeform and see how it's purple it's having the reaction that's why our iodine is clear
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:38.320]  versus the iodine that's like black because it's had some chemical reaction and again we're having
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:44.000]  it tested right now but infowarslife.com and i'm not even differentiating our iodine versus others
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:49.920]  you need iodine period whether it's in kelp or just you know the different gourmet sea salts
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:55.920]  whatever but then it's still somewhat bound but your body can break it down the word for the
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:00.480]  medical doctors and nutritionists i've talked to is this is this nascent form if it's truly nascent
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:05.920]  where it's freeform it just goes right into your body and just attaches the fluoride everything
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:11.680]  else is such a detoxifier and most importantly ladies and gentlemen you know we're so deficient
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:16.000]  in this i call it the iodine conspiracy and that video is on infowarslife.com you want to watch

[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:34.880]  here but worldwide so persist by internet taxes he said yeah i'll come on so uh here is kurt nimo
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:40.720]  who also is the editor of info wars dot com and his joint duties with paul watson they both
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:46.720]  edit info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and here he is with us in studio pert i mean it's
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:51.840]  really happening just like on every front they're trying to get their whole agenda through right
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:57.040]  now i think i know because they know there's an awakening happening the question is in this race
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:01.840]  the finish line what's going to happen go over some of what we see with the war on the press
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:07.440]  and now the war on the internet itself uh with the big internet giants that cheerleading along with
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:13.760]  this uh the power to taxes the power to destroy to quote george washington and we're now looking
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:17.680]  down the barrel of this tell folks about your article from yesterday well on monday this uh
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:23.680]  the spring port decided to not hear a case between amazon and overstock dot com about challenging the
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:29.440]  market fairness act which is or excuse me a marketplace fair fairness act that the senate
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:34.800]  passed um taxing the internet so um in essence what happened is is they refuse to hear the case
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:39.920]  so what's going to happen is is the states are free to impose taxation yeah they didn't overturn
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:44.720]  or hear the earlier case saying we can tax the internet to any point we want yeah and so now get
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:50.240]  ready absolutely so by the way you already pay taxes on all the telecommunications on all the
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:54.800]  phones on all the infrastructure you already we already built the infrastructure that's right
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:58.720]  and so it's taxes on taxes on taxes well the states are real hot to do this because
[2:39:59.360 --> 2:40:03.280]  obviously they're they need their revenues so they're going after and there's never going
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:06.720]  to be enough money for these bloodsuckers that's right that's right you gotta pay all our government
[2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:11.520]  workers their pensions and everything else so by the way texas really has a franchise tax
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:16.400]  and a business tax that is a sales tax and it's only a couple percent right now they're about to
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:21.120]  jack it up so there's you they won't stop until they've wrecked everything right but what's
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:25.680]  significant about this is it's an attack on the commerce clause of the of the constitution and
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:31.760]  also the 14th amendment due process clause um that states particularly that you have to have a
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:36.880]  presence in a state to tax a business and states aren't supposed to be able to tax outside their
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:42.960]  state right well the commerce clause was was created to facilitate um competition between
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.840]  the states not impeded that's right and the feds have used it to actually dominate the states but
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:53.360]  now they're going to let the states engage in their own uh savage attack on the well we saw this
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:41:00.240]  coming when roberts uh cited with the uh in the obama care decision to uh allow uh you know the
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:06.160]  irs and the government to uh you know well we already get i haven't done stories on this yet
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:10.320]  but i've got all the letters threatening new york and california letters going we are the state
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:13.920]  ordering you and of course it's all fraud they can't just order me we're all ordering you under
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:17.920]  penalty and perjury and everything to answer our questions about your business and in california
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:24.000]  and everything you've done back 10 years and we and i sent a letter back saying go to hell right
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.320]  because you're you know i'm not operating with the business inside your stinking filthy new
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:32.800]  order run cesspit right well the commerce and now their tentacles are shooting out to suck my
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:36.560]  blood here right the commerce class is like north korea just send me a letter go ahead there has to
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:42.000]  be a nexus what they call a nexus between the cell and i have no nexus with north korea or california

[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:45.040]  which attacks fourth amendment so they're going they're using the internet to attack the constitution
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:49.360]  on multiple fronts this is just not yeah i'm sorry you're here by internet censorship tell us about
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:54.000]  all the loving stuff that the filth is engaged in well with syspa what they do is they they said
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:43:01.040]  that they could check your internet communications uh surveil you under the rubric of um of um uh cyber
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:06.080]  security so what they're saying is is that the fourth amendment doesn't apply anymore to internet
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.200]  communications that they can just go in you know with this phony terror war and and see if you're a
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:17.120]  cyber security threat so well here's an example there's many famous cases of of an engineer
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:23.360]  you know 500 years ago a thousand many cases being marooned in a primitive area if you got marooned
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:26.800]  and you were a criminal you'd later read about another explorer came by and found out you know
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:31.520]  they killed the guy but if you were somebody that could help them and give them science you'd end up
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:36.560]  you know forming a new dynasty and ended up being the chief of the tribe and it's the same thing i
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:40.960]  don't care if you're black white hispanic old young you got something to add you want to be free

[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:57.200]  high horse and lecture me all day because you're accepting the vomit out of the government and the
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:02.640]  average californian literally cannot tie their shoelaces and doesn't and you see the mark dice
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:07.920]  videos that's that's not edited that's what they're they do not know what planet they're on you can
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:12.240]  say we're gonna murder all the gun owners they'll sign it for obama we're gonna make obama dictator

[2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:35.840]  arrogant scum filled attitude that we've got a bout of them and suck the pus out of their green
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:40.720]  breast i will have no part of it go ahead i was gonna say that's endemic across the country it's
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:46.240]  just not california i mean it it's moved from the east coast to the west coast you know i mean
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:50.160]  is eating its way into the middle and texas is going to be a hard push for that because notice
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:54.400]  they declare us the enemy everywhere on the news yeah oh they want their guns and their bibles
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:45:00.240]  and they work and the men are still men put more poison in their water teach them they'll
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:05.760]  prance around like trendy soon enough disgusting it was that i mean to rant hurt it's okay that's
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:09.520]  everything about californians and we're on a bunch of affiliates on california and the people in
[2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:14.320]  california are great that are awake but they're like people in nancy germany and they're just
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:19.520]  literally i mean they want 55 year old men to be able to go in little girls bathrooms
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:23.600]  and look at them they recently passed a law where you can't smoke in your own house in california
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:30.400]  if you know hitler did that yeah i know a hitler was anti anti tobacco big time but they passed a
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:34.000]  law recently where if you have a house that's conjoined with another house like a duplex
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:39.920]  then you can't smoke what the point is is that they do it all saying it's for the betterment of
[2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:45.120]  everybody there it's a bunch of lawless crooks i mean look at acorn and all these people yeah you
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:48.480]  can go in the democratic offices we're gonna run child sex slaves oh good let's help you
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.640]  we're gonna run giant scams bring out america you know howl stalling oh yeah we love it
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:57.760]  tell me more about the internet censorship curd well this this particular bill is not
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.160]  necessarily internet censorship but what it will do is and as a matter of fact i have to
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:06.080]  stipulate that if you make less than a million dollars or you earn less than a million dollars
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:10.240]  in internet sales this law as it currently stands in the senate version does not apply but that's
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:14.240]  the way they always are absolutely like the income tax was only on millionaires and i'll
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:19.040]  look at it that's right absolutely so for now it's not going to affect small people selling
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:24.560]  stuff on ebay or a small edgy business or something's not going to be affected but a larger operation
[2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:28.000]  is going to be affected and again the reason all the big corporations really aren't battling at
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.640]  that much amazon is a little bit for now is they'll just create subsidiaries they'll never pay any
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:37.440]  tax or they'll go off shore they'll run their operation in the netherlands or germany or
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:41.920]  something or on google barges or google barges there you go yeah absolutely that's what they're for
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:48.880]  probably come on kurt what's wrong with an amazon drone i thought the barges were for
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:57.520]  for like uh fun houses for google glasses oh yeah hey hey hey kurt um looking at all this
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:00.480]  there was a point i was going to make and you brought up the google fun houses and that brought
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:06.400]  up some images um they had like these they had like these flying sex palaces on these big jumbo
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:12.320]  jets and the rest of it uh the point is it but but they don't want us to have any privacy but
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:16.160]  but they're obsessed with privacy the head of google makes women wear wear wear like those
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:21.040]  michael jackson veils like his kids have to wear but but then but then they want all our stuff to
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:25.680]  be known you're talking about schmidt does yeah yeah oh wow schmidt looks like he dresses up in pig
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:31.200]  outfits at night or something i mean they're like eyes wide shut type stuff boy i mean that's just
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:36.160]  what i see but no seriously what do you make of the surrealness kurt of the way the world's getting
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:42.480]  right now well it's just the it's the over the top aspects of the police state and totalitarianism
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:46.640]  in the modern age with technology i mean it's just like you said it's over the top it's crazy
[2:47:46.640 --> 2:47:51.280]  but a lot of people don't see it they they just they're wrapped up in there you know they're
[2:47:51.280 --> 2:47:55.760]  television and like you're talking about earlier football games and oh yeah people really think
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:00.480]  the television is the world absolutely all these fantasy characters yeah it's dangerous it really
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:08.000]  is i mean yeah it's getting crazy it's getting crazy it really is um america is the epicenter of
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:13.120]  it and i never thought i've said i won't never evacuate it but i mean it's like a walking dead
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:19.600]  now i mean how do you get away from the zombie trendy masses well a lot of people are going
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:24.240]  off the grid and moving away from the the population center just to get away from it i mean but michael
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:29.440]  morse says that's racist well of course michael morse would say that i mean he also believes
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:34.000]  that um you should have a dog to protect yourself and somebody but he should have six body guards
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:40.240]  with guns absolutely absolutely same thing with the pearl jam guy by the way he says it's violating
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:47.200]  his first amendment we disagree with him did he say that oh yeah yeah he actually said that these
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.360]  could be people have no concept of what the first amendment in the bill well the thing is they're
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:56.640]  not liberals card we're liberals right that that we want freedom we're classical liberals yeah these
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:01.520]  people are foaming at the mouth morons is what they are socialists always turn into totalitarian
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:06.320]  thugs it's it's it's inevitable history shows it over and over and over from Hitler to Mussolini
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.880]  to obama you know just they consul at a power and turn into thugs and they go they're fascist
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:18.080]  that's what socialism always turns into you look at the soviet union that's fascism that was right
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:25.680]  well fascism classically it Mussolini said is corporatism so it's large business and and government
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:31.840]  merging working together yeah communism is if the corporations are offshore then they set up
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.640]  communism to suck everything out and go to people's paradise if the corporations are in your country
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:40.880]  they call it fascism because they then exempt themselves it's a looting operation basically
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:46.480]  which is what dylan radigan said they're like you're out of msnbc yeah you made some good points
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:51.840]  well i bring it up because he was having a panic attack on air imagine being around those plastic
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:56.640]  fake people all day spewing lies at folks and then he starts telling a little bit of the truth and
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:03.120]  gets top ratings and then finally just flips out on them so they don't renew his contract right and
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:08.080]  all these corporations think they can spew all this bull on us through their state-run media and be
