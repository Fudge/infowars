[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.320]  Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in
[00:30.320 --> 00:34.520]  Austin Alex is joining us live and he's going to be breaking down the news today
[00:34.520 --> 00:37.960]  and we've got a lot happening today we've got a couple of very important
[00:37.960 --> 00:41.480]  guests one of them is an Atlanta businessman that you won't know but
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.680]  you've heard this story before somebody being illegally arrested because I've
[00:45.680 --> 00:49.560]  got a handgun in this particular case who was arrested for loitering on his
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.600]  own property his car was confiscated and his handgun was taken even though he
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.040]  had a concealed carry permit and it was suggested to him by local law
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.520]  enforcement that he had that he'll be joining us on the show as well pastor
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.520]  James David Manning because there's been a lot of talk about Obama as a
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.880]  dictator and that's even being aged on by those on the left urging him to use
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.120]  his executive power to just enact minimum wage reform to ignore the
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.920]  immigration laws so we see that happening over and over again Alex that's
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.800]  right and I'm gonna be here breaking it all down today with you popping in with
[01:23.800 --> 01:30.440]  breaking news analysis there from the info wars.com news center also we've
[01:30.440 --> 01:35.800]  known this plan for 11 years since TSA was basically shut up almost 12 years
[01:35.800 --> 01:40.920]  now that they're going to grope everyone and harass everyone until people say
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.720]  please do anything but but Gropus and put us in body scanners and now they're
[01:45.720 --> 01:48.840]  coming out with these quote smart tunnels like smart growth and everything
[01:48.840 --> 01:55.800]  else where they will biometrically scan you and the pod doors lock when you come
[01:55.800 --> 01:58.920]  into the airport when you go through the scanners and then when you try to exit
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.640]  these pod bay doors like prison doors like Italian bank doors they have these
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.080]  in Italy where you go in and a door closes and then another door opens they
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.920]  are putting these high-tech systems in with taxpayer money and then rolling out
[02:11.920 --> 02:18.240]  the previous TSA system onto the streets of America and then they'll roll these
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.440]  armored doors out onto the streets with hardened checkpoints on the highways
[02:22.440 --> 02:27.960]  that they've already purchased thousands of so this is a total takeover plan I
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.960]  want to break that down if folks go to drudgereport.com it's the easiest place
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.960]  to find Paul Watson's article it's red link on the right hand side of drudge
[02:35.960 --> 02:42.040]  report.com and again it's up on prisonplanet.com mirrored there as well
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.600]  because infowars.com does go down every once in a while so we have the backup
[02:45.600 --> 02:50.240]  prisonplanet.com it also has some news on the side obviously that is unique to
[02:50.240 --> 02:59.040]  prisonplanet.com but if you look up on infowars.com you will see a video from
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.960]  years ago where I talked about Nelson Mandela and his wife winning his ex
[03:04.960 --> 03:11.000]  wife now he divorced her when he got out of prison who is a monstrous person
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.040]  totally monstrous Nelson Mandela himself there's a lot to admire about him
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.320]  I've been very very clear about that very intelligent very smart guy also
[03:21.320 --> 03:25.720]  extremely vicious but you know one man's vicious terrorist another man's
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.440]  George Washington I mean George Washington helped wipe out a bunch of the
[03:29.440 --> 03:35.440]  Iroquois nation and the French and Indian war and other things so definitely a
[03:35.440 --> 03:43.120]  manly man but also the the heir of one of the four major nations that is
[03:43.120 --> 03:47.740]  African nations in South Africa and that's who when he would go out and
[03:47.740 --> 03:52.120]  kill was the black people mainly folks have to understand that but between the
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.760]  Zulus and all these other groups and he wasn't a Zulu he was he was he was the
[03:55.760 --> 04:02.120]  king he was never crowned but he was the king apparent of a large portion of
[04:02.120 --> 04:07.400]  South Africa and then that's never even discussed why was this guy put forward as
[04:07.400 --> 04:12.240]  the leader later by the clerk and others after he was in jail for 27 years it was
[04:12.240 --> 04:17.440]  because he was definitely an insider with the Russians previous to that they
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.960]  were gonna make him the king of South Africa basically and then when that
[04:20.960 --> 04:25.920]  fails he was in his guerrilla war blowing up military bases you name it blowing
[04:25.920 --> 04:30.960]  up trains targeting civilian targets whenever that quote terrorist guerrilla
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.480]  war that's his quote fail they threw him in jail for 27 years and when he came
[04:35.480 --> 04:41.440]  out after leading that war then they set him up and made him president and then
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.840]  he betrayed the South African people big time there's no doubt and that's why you
[04:45.840 --> 04:51.640]  see all the new order worshiping him is because he was their guy and hey I might
[04:51.640 --> 04:55.560]  break up for 27 years in prison I'm not I mean he's definitely very interesting
[04:55.560 --> 04:59.640]  character we're gonna break down the real Mandela straight ahead
[05:00.040 --> 05:05.720]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.640]  how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scowze the US isn't building
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.480]  huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat they
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.560]  know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.920]  told Scowze is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic
[05:22.920 --> 05:27.360]  relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you do have
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.360]  time we talk about natural disasters the health environment we talk about
[05:31.360 --> 05:35.320]  pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in every one of
[05:35.320 --> 05:38.640]  these states most people wouldn't be ready won't be able to get out of town
[05:38.640 --> 05:43.680]  because they'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy this

[06:04.560 --> 06:09.840]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[06:09.840 --> 06:13.920]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.520]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[06:18.520 --> 06:23.960]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[06:23.960 --> 06:29.320]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ
[06:29.320 --> 06:33.920]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[08:30.160 --> 08:34.080]  program with a couple of interviews we've got a businessman out of Atlanta who
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.360]  was arrested on his own property he had his gun confiscated even though he had a
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.200]  concealed carry permit he had his car towed and he still has not been
[08:42.200 --> 08:45.480]  reimbursed for his car towing and he's not gotten his gun bag and it's been over
[08:45.480 --> 08:48.360]  a year we're going to have him on talking about his case with his lawyer we
[08:48.360 --> 08:51.960]  also have pastor James David Manning out of New York and he's going to be
[08:51.960 --> 08:56.440]  talking about Obama as dictator because we're seeing more and more often in
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.920]  Washington that people are accusing him of that we even see people using the
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.160]  quote-unquote I word impeachment well let's long overdue and we're going to be
[09:04.160 --> 09:07.480]  talking about exactly what he's doing and calls from the left for him to do
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.840]  even more executive orders even more dictatorship right now we've got Alex on
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.400]  the line Alex that's right I'm going to be hosting the entire three hours here
[09:16.400 --> 09:22.720]  with David Knight giving us breaking news and analysis today again I'm here in
[09:22.720 --> 09:27.560]  East Texas for a funeral for my cousin who died but I will be back Sunday in
[09:27.560 --> 09:33.600]  studio Lord willing 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time with the Sunday broadcast
[09:33.600 --> 09:37.720]  as well and of course there's in full Wars nightly news hosted by the great
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.920]  crew there 7 o'clock central now we're going to cover a lot of news and
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.440]  information today we're going to break down the entire waterfront on the
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.400]  economy on very important police state developments on huge developments where
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.960]  as David Knight just pointed out the authoritarians that camouflage
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.840]  themselves as the left are all over the news and we have articles on this right
[10:03.840 --> 10:09.840]  now and in full Wars calm prison planet calm it's now being picked up even by the
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.200]  Washington Post and others have been saying is Obama a dictator Howard Dean
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.640]  came out and said well he is acting like a dictator but maybe that's what we need
[10:19.640 --> 10:25.720]  so again create the crisis offer the solution which is more power then things
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.360]  get worse then offer the solution more power and then things get worse offer the
[10:30.360 --> 10:36.600]  solution more power this is a classic communist tactic of problem reaction
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.280]  solution of cloward and piven is one of the more modern examples from the 60s
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.360]  of official you know university studies and reports on how to bankrupt the
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.200]  country how to get us on to welfare make us dependent and finally totally
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.200]  bankrupt the system to cover the reeducation of the nation use that
[10:55.200 --> 11:00.040]  crisis to bring in total control social unrest and then out of the ensuing
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.720]  crises only a centralized collective like government backed with
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.520]  corporations and then using sports as propaganda to to to overlay their
[11:10.520 --> 11:16.000]  takeover message in sports messages they found that's a way to unify people so
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.320]  first they break things down then they unify people through propaganda in sitcoms
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.560]  dramas movies TV shows education sports mainly that's their main tool they
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.440]  Nelson Mandela Bragg that was their main tool using sports as propaganda and
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.880]  then finally rebuild the new society and we're going to be going over all of
[11:36.880 --> 11:44.080]  that here today on this live Friday edition as we broadcast worldwide we've
[11:44.080 --> 11:51.360]  also got huge new domestic police state news on the front of the TSA now I'm
[11:51.360 --> 11:58.600]  going to break down from now until the bottom of the hour in some detail again
[11:58.600 --> 12:02.040]  I'm on the road I was there at the office I could have all these printed out
[12:02.040 --> 12:05.760]  and all the areas highlighted I wanted to cover but I'll give kind of a
[12:05.760 --> 12:15.280]  gestalt of who Nelson Mandela really was and what he did in South Africa coming
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.720]  up in just a few minutes and then at the bottom of the hour
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.840]  Jacari Jackson is doing a report on this on the nightly news tonight he was the
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.000]  one that discovered this vicious new article in Esquire with an army military
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.880]  officer saying quote yes we will pry the guns from your cold dead hands and so
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.360]  David Knight and I will read over some of these quotes and cover that at the
[12:41.360 --> 12:47.400]  bottom of the hour I have a Don Salazar right now and Kurt Nemo posting the
[12:47.400 --> 12:53.240]  article on info wars.com so you can comment on it you know just a snippet
[12:53.240 --> 12:55.840]  of the first part of the article and some of the quotes then we will write a
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.360]  whole response article under that snippet that's how I want that done to
[13:01.360 --> 13:09.560]  respond to this but the Pentagon's main mission now not just internationally but
[13:09.560 --> 13:13.680]  domestically is a respond to indigenous groups that don't want to be taken
[13:13.680 --> 13:16.680]  over by the globalist by the corporate New World Order our military is becoming
[13:16.680 --> 13:22.280]  a backup arm it has been for a long time but a pure backup arm of authoritarian
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.040]  takeover and you've got West Point you've got the Army War College all of
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.360]  them training to quote fight the Tea Party gun owners returning veterans
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.640]  libertarians anybody that isn't basically a communist or an elitist above
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.960]  that because again it's always big banks and power that funds communism and
[13:41.960 --> 13:48.240]  socialism and domestication at a low level because if your pigs or cows you
[13:48.240 --> 13:52.560]  know in a barn being fed collectivized you are pretty much given an equal amount
[13:52.560 --> 13:56.880]  and then of course you've got the people that live in the farmhouse you know 50
[13:56.880 --> 14:00.640]  yards away though that's the establishment you know so so so you're
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.640]  going to live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment and work at a slave
[14:03.640 --> 14:06.960]  factory for the greater good of everyone in the collective they're going to take
[14:06.960 --> 14:12.680]  your money and they're going to live offshore in 500 room palaces with 25
[14:12.680 --> 14:20.460]  jets apiece ocean liners 747s with pleasure palaces and Luxembourg in
[14:20.460 --> 14:24.760]  Switzerland and you know they're going to have 20 30 mistresses of the Saudi
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.800]  princes are going to have you know whole harems of hundreds of women it's the
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.840]  same deal and of course they're all the ones promoting that we be socialized and
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.760]  middle-class not be able to have guns or family raise their children or own
[14:37.760 --> 14:44.560]  property because this is what modern slavery is and so we're going to be
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.720]  breaking that down coming up at the bottom of the hour with David Knight
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.720]  but David give folks just a brief minute or two on the headline who this guy is
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.080]  and some of his quotes of foreshadowing of what's coming up because this is the
[14:59.080 --> 15:04.240]  mainlining of the culture where the American people are the enemy and will
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.160]  be disarmed by the military now under globalist control well this guy Alex
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.800]  was a lieutenant colonel and he taught history at West Point and that's a very
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.680]  important position because he's not just teaching them how to clean their rifle
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.360]  he's shaping their worldview and this is how he starts out the article he says
[15:22.360 --> 15:26.000]  my job at the end of the day is about killing I orchestrate violence but my
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.160]  profession is about directed violence on behalf of the nation but by that what he
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.160]  really means is the government that's what he sees as the nation then he goes
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.120]  on to yeah exactly he goes on to say he's got he's got a program here about
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.720]  how he's going to limit guns to just smooth bore rifle muzzle-loading
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.720]  like powder muskets but here's what he says in point number two we will pry
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.760]  your gun from your cold dead fingers because I am willing to wait until you
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.560]  die hopefully of natural causes guns except for the three approved
[15:53.560 --> 15:56.560]  categories cannot be inherited when you die your weapons will be turned to the
[15:56.560 --> 15:59.960]  local police department which will then destroy them then he says police
[15:59.960 --> 16:03.840]  departmental would no longer be allowed to sell or auction weapons then he says
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.720]  he would submit a new tax on ammunition in the first two years 400% of the
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.320]  current retail price thereafter it would increase by 20% a year we're going to
[16:12.320 --> 16:17.440]  cover that at about 35 or 40 after we're going to break that down into tail
[16:17.440 --> 16:21.240]  that's just a foretaste yeah we're gonna give you his name everything the
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.360]  article is going up on info wars dot com right now but I just want to stop and
[16:25.360 --> 16:31.240]  explain something to everybody West Point is training the entire officer
[16:31.240 --> 16:37.120]  Corps the elite officer Corps for the US Army so and and he's not the only one
[16:37.120 --> 16:42.000]  this is pretty much you don't get a job there now unless you do this and this is
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  why there's a culling of the general staff of the military as well and
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.480]  remember a secondary West Point for officers in ROTC I'd say it's in the
[16:52.480 --> 16:59.880]  top 10 of lower-level officer schools would be something like college station
[16:59.880 --> 17:06.320]  and Texas A&M and at Texas A&M they now have professors teaching in the
[17:06.320 --> 17:09.640]  military history there's no right to guns we will take your guns the
[17:09.640 --> 17:14.560]  Constitution's bad we're gonna get rid of free speech too so this is open enemy
[17:14.560 --> 17:20.080]  operations open saboteurs open infiltrators of the foreign megabanks
[17:20.080 --> 17:22.800]  that have captured America that isn't rhetoric that's what's happened
[17:22.800 --> 17:27.320]  literally teaching sedition and treason and you have free speech in this
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.360]  country to say anything you want as long as it doesn't call for violence against
[17:31.360 --> 17:36.120]  someone unless you're in government or in a critical infrastructure area
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.320]  teaching the overthrow of the Bill of Rights and Constitution that is
[17:41.320 --> 17:48.640]  illegal that is illegal that is illegal that is illegal that is illegal I mean
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.000]  if I was preaching the overthrow of the office of the presidency and putting
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.320]  something new in that would be illegal if the president was executing the
[17:58.320 --> 18:02.960]  Bill of Rights and Constitution so this is sedition from within the system but
[18:02.960 --> 18:08.400]  it's not really sedition because these are globalist operators and they're
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.160]  foreign officers and by the way they have the was the name Thomas Barnett
[18:14.160 --> 18:18.680]  one of the Army War College top professors you can see a C-SPAN
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.960]  interviews because C-SPAN has them all archived back 25 years now online for free
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.200]  you can just search it we'll do a flashback on Thomas Barnett giving
[18:27.200 --> 18:32.120]  lectures on C-SPAN but to the general C-SPAN common shows him talking to the
[18:32.120 --> 18:36.280]  generals and he goes listen you serve the New World Order you serve foreign
[18:36.280 --> 18:41.440]  corporations and banks and you serve the centralized system now and America
[18:41.440 --> 18:45.520]  doesn't exist you serve Wall Street everyone is a piece of stock a human
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.480]  resource and that's the way it is and they just beat them with this until they
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.280]  give into it or say they're for it they get promoted we have to remember with
[18:54.280 --> 18:57.760]  with Barnett and others there's a whole bunch of these guys we have to remember
[18:57.760 --> 19:05.480]  with Barnett and all the rest of them that the key to all of this is that
[19:05.480 --> 19:09.160]  again they're openly operating for foreign power and it's just like in the
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.000]  film network where the where the executive calls in the anchor and says
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.960]  you have meddled with the title forces of nature mr. Beale and you will atone
[19:20.960 --> 19:26.320]  and that's basically what this is is they are bringing us into a corporate
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.080]  system where we have no rights except with our piece of stock but even that
[19:31.080 --> 19:35.760]  has no rights so it's a modern high-tech form of slavery now David and
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.480]  listeners when we come back I'm gonna get into Nelson Mandela and break down
[19:39.480 --> 19:42.040]  who he really was and a little bit in the next second because I've got behind
[19:42.040 --> 19:45.960]  as usual then we're going to look at this particular Lieutenant Colonel who's
[19:45.960 --> 19:50.440]  not the only one you have to understand this is the new officer class this is
[19:50.440 --> 19:53.760]  it I mean this is happening and they're calling the military of anyone who's
[19:53.760 --> 20:02.080]  pro-America pro-liberty will be right back stay with us Alex Jones here and I

[24:17.120 --> 24:21.960]  hosting the show live on the road and he's gonna be giving us his breakdown of
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.960]  Nelson Mandela because Nelson Mandela's you know passed away yesterday and all
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.480]  of the news is all about Nelson Mandela and what we've seen is one hagiography
[24:29.480 --> 24:33.480]  after the other as if he didn't have anything wrong with them and of course
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.160]  as Alex pointed out earlier there is nobody like that everybody has good and
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.080]  bad in their life so he's gonna give us his breakdown of Nelson Mandela Alex
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.680]  thank you David again yesterday the crew just went and did a search of anything
[24:50.680 --> 24:54.240]  I'd ever said about Nelson Mandela and put it out and when I said about Nelson
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.880]  Mandela and his wife was totally true but I want to break it down within a
[24:57.880 --> 25:04.280]  larger context so people understand my real view of Nelson Mandela and I'm by
[25:04.280 --> 25:10.440]  no means a expert on Nelson Mandela but compared to the general public it I
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.160]  mean I know literally a thousand times more because I've actually tried to
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.920]  study it and for anyone informed that's why watching the news is like watching
[25:19.920 --> 25:25.680]  watching or tuning into the mind of someone on PCP I mean it does not
[25:25.680 --> 25:32.120]  resemble anything based in reality and I have found African history as well as
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.000]  many other histories very very interesting so I've read a lot of history
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.640]  books from different perspectives on Africa but let's just put it to you this
[25:38.640 --> 25:43.000]  way the whole world's been barbarous and totally insane and murderous and
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.880]  unbelievably out of control Africa has been as bloody or bloodier than any
[25:48.880 --> 25:56.360]  other place in history and South Africa itself has been the epicenter of just
[25:56.360 --> 26:03.240]  unbelievable hell on earth for thousands of years you had huge different
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.600]  diverse African tribes always battling for that area because it was very very
[26:07.600 --> 26:14.680]  fertile and a lot of resources and Mandela was to be the king of one of
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.400]  the most powerful tribes in southern Africa the Joshua I'm pronouncing that
[26:19.400 --> 26:26.560]  right X H O S A and when he Mandela his wife and I'm just giving folks a quick
[26:26.560 --> 26:33.840]  snap gestalt on this was a literal demon who would run around murdering
[26:33.840 --> 26:38.640]  African groups just explain folks our media gives us this one-dimensional
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.960]  image that it's white people and black people killing each other in Africa no
[26:43.960 --> 26:48.480]  look at the Boer war that Winston Churchill was in when England invaded
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.000]  South Africa to attack that the Africaners the Dutch and there was also
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.660]  French settlements there was a whole bunch of settlements folks everyone was
[26:57.660 --> 27:01.840]  killing everybody okay 24-7 and you'd have different white groups that I'll
[27:01.840 --> 27:05.360]  have a different black tribes just like the French and Indian Wars where you'd
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.320]  have the French with one group of Indians natives you'd have the British
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.800]  with another you have the Spanish backed by another this is the way the world was
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.160]  and Hollywood and the media just totally dumb it down and I'm not defending any
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.320]  group I'm not an Africana never been to Africa never been to South Africa I'm
[27:22.320 --> 27:28.880]  not a French Africana I'm not a British you know South African none of this I
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.960]  don't have a dog in the fight another South Africans that listen and you know
[27:32.960 --> 27:35.760]  they know a lot more about it in fact perhaps we should open the phones up
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.640]  that's a pretty good idea at the start of the next hour before our guest comes on
[27:40.640 --> 27:47.960]  to have in fact we're gonna do that from South Africa or Zimbabwe or from people
[27:47.960 --> 27:52.520]  that are formerly from South Africa folks that left South Africa whether they
[27:52.520 --> 27:55.480]  be black or white if you're white you pretty much had to leave because of the
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.840]  racial attacks and you have it other areas of Central Africa and other areas
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.680]  where the white farmers have all been run out and the society totally collapses
[28:04.680 --> 28:10.320]  and you're seeing a lot of examples of that so it's an incredibly complex just
[28:10.320 --> 28:13.920]  just incredibly complex issue but you have to first understand that Nelson
[28:13.920 --> 28:23.280]  Mandela was born in the beginning of the last century back in 1918 at the end of
[28:23.280 --> 28:29.440]  the of World War one and he was set to basically become the king of a large
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.560]  area of South Africa and when that failed in their and their and their
[28:34.560 --> 28:38.520]  Imperial Empire basically collapsed he began working with the Communist and
[28:38.520 --> 28:43.920]  then later with the Soviet Union through the 40s 50s and 60s to try to
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.080]  overthrow all of the countries in Southern Africa and install a Marxist
[28:50.080 --> 28:57.080]  Leninist dictatorship so you're replacing one tyranny with one I got to
[28:57.080 --> 29:00.440]  say there's pretty much nothing worse than a Marxist Leninist or Stalinist
[29:00.440 --> 29:03.200]  state look at North Korea is a stall in the state I mean there's nothing worse
[29:03.200 --> 29:09.440]  nothing worse okay so my whole issue is they made it all this big cause celeb
[29:09.440 --> 29:17.080]  and what you had is you had basically a bunch of rich Dutch people and French
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.200]  and British and others who were always fighting with each other and the British
[29:21.200 --> 29:25.080]  elites basically came in hyped up Hollywood made a deal with the De Beers
[29:25.080 --> 29:29.560]  and the Oppenheimers the owners of the diamond system to come in and kick out
[29:29.560 --> 29:33.880]  some of the rich white people that were there and take it over and then make
[29:33.880 --> 29:37.520]  things I know looks not exaggerate five times worse for them so they just
[29:37.520 --> 29:40.400]  traded one slavery for another and that's what Nelson Mandela did we're
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.400]  gonna explain it all he didn't go with the commies he went with James Baker
[29:44.400 --> 29:47.560]  in the bushes and that's the story of South Africa we'll be right back to tell

[33:41.640 --> 33:46.240]  Middle East and the rest of the world into Central Asia Eastern Europe Western
[33:46.240 --> 33:51.720]  Europe all of this is all of this is interconnected and it's so frustrating to
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.440]  be doing research again to just double check my memory on South Africa and all
[33:57.440 --> 34:02.200]  the books and films and documentaries I've watched on the subject to be looking
[34:02.200 --> 34:08.480]  at photos of British concentration camps and if you go to Wikipedia just type
[34:08.480 --> 34:15.120]  in Boer War and Cyclopedia Britannica type in Boer War or Boer War Boer Wars
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.640]  there's actually a bunch of them two big ones about 10 small ones the British
[34:19.640 --> 34:26.160]  did what they've done all over the world they put tens of thousands of whites
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.360]  just pointing out there's something to do with Africans at that time folks
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.720]  actually from Africa put them in concentration camps to starve them to
[34:33.720 --> 34:38.000]  death and if the crew can do that if you just type in Boer War and then go to
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.680]  Wikipedia and then scroll down to the photos at the bottom you can see
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.640]  children being starved to death looks just like Nazi Germany with the Jews
[34:47.640 --> 34:54.680]  now now now why do I interspersed this because you have to understand that
[34:54.680 --> 35:01.760]  Nelson Mandela's father the king of one of the major tribes actually sided with
[35:01.760 --> 35:07.640]  the British in this and then later flip sides it's very complex so the point is
[35:07.640 --> 35:16.040]  is that is that Nelson Mandela couldn't be king of South Africa I mean no one
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.560]  ever says he was royalty I just again the the history they give you know much I
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.960]  hate royalty folks I mean it's nothing to do with me in black I just really
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.200]  have discussed it by royalty now he actually did some stuff on his own and
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.360]  was have had a lot of courage was very smart so I admire him from the
[35:32.360 --> 35:40.200]  perspective of of being a very powerful individual in fact it mires not even the
[35:40.200 --> 35:46.760]  proper word I I respect him I respect Adolf Hitler even though I don't like
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.600]  Adolf Hitler I respect Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong now I don't want to say that
[35:51.600 --> 35:57.600]  Mandela was a Hitler or a Mao he doesn't come to that level he's more
[35:57.600 --> 36:00.240]  complex figure than that I've really tried to figure out over the years as
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.320]  I've done many people who Nelson Mandela really was but the point is his wife is a
[36:04.320 --> 36:12.320]  would-be Hitler that's why probably devoidster winning Mandela who would
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.920]  look would personally torture people to death herself mainly black folks because
[36:16.920 --> 36:22.040]  that's mainly black folks down there so everybody's fighting over resources and
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.360]  so you got the tribes constantly killing each other and if you go back to the
[36:27.360 --> 36:32.560]  Boer War and you look at it because that's where this all starts fought from
[36:32.560 --> 36:40.680]  1880 to 1902 so over 22 years these different wars the Boer Wars literally
[36:40.680 --> 36:44.400]  freedom wars were two wars fought by the British Empire against the
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.840]  Africaners of two independent Boer Republics the Orange Free State and then
[36:48.840 --> 36:52.320]  it goes into the other republics so that's all it was was a big fight over
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.960]  stuff and that's why elites always want to disarm people whether the whether the
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.320]  Boers you know whether the Africaners were good guys or not whether the
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.080]  British Empire was the good guys nobody was probably the good guys the point
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.400]  here is it's all from your perspective but that's why the British Empire once
[37:08.400 --> 37:11.480]  their subjects disarmed because then they don't have to fight you when they
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.000]  enslave you and we can put on screen the tens of thousands of people in
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.680]  concentration camps that's where Hitler got it was from the British who first
[37:21.680 --> 37:25.360]  used it in the Revolutionary War here in the United States when they were
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.640]  colonies that was invented in America for use against whites then it was
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.760]  deployed against Indians the reservation system after it the British
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.400]  government the British New World Order invented this let's just get this
[37:39.400 --> 37:45.800]  straight now the British government comes along in the 70s and and hires I'm
[37:45.800 --> 37:50.400]  oversimplifying this Hollywood to basically put movies out showing white
[37:50.400 --> 37:53.960]  people torturing and killing black people all day so that they could come
[37:53.960 --> 37:59.640]  into South Africa politically unseated get Nelson Mandela out of prison set him
[37:59.640 --> 38:04.960]  up to be the leader 27 years in terrible conditions he definitely turned and then
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.960]  he basically sold out South Africa and it's conservatively depending on the
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.120]  numbers you see five times worse than it was mass killing everywhere blacks
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.320]  murdering blacks in mass and the media just totally covers it up they've run
[38:18.320 --> 38:21.440]  off almost all the whites the whites that live there live in these high
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.720]  security compounds with other rich blacks in places like Johannesburg has one
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.920]  of the highest crime rates in the world they've taken the citizens guns and it's
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.960]  total political correctness and basically a Soviet model of race war in
[38:34.960 --> 38:38.360]  slow motion of what they want to do in Europe in the United States so it's the
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.480]  South African model by the Oppenheimers and by the beers their front company I
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.920]  mean it's the same thing Cecil Rhodes and the beers wanted to take over South
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.960]  Africa in 1880 so they came in when the diamonds got discovered and gold and all
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.680]  this that's all this is and someone who knows history it's so frustrating to
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.600]  sit here and to watch this and to sit here and see this unfold and to know
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.080]  what's really going on and to know what Nelson Mandela did and how he used
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.480]  sports quote to everybody to be racially friends that's not what really
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.520]  happened and and it's just all a lie and they just go oh my gosh he's like Jesus
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.960]  he's the greatest man who ever lived and it's just like a total fraud he's an
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.560]  African royal and the globalist only deal with other royals and they basically
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.200]  he lost trying to team up with the Soviets so they put him in jail for 27
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.280]  years and then he came over to their side and all they did was kick out any
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.120]  middle class that was in South Africa and anybody that knew how the
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.240]  infrastructure was operated because they'd owned it and run it and then the
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.440]  communists just came in and wrecked it and now the diamond workers everybody
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.100]  are even in worse shape and they call it a civil rights movement a lot not let
[39:47.100 --> 39:50.080]  any African country mind their own diamonds and sell them so they get
[39:50.080 --> 39:53.720]  money they call those blood diamonds and it's the opposite to actually keep
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.920]  everybody enslaved to keep the price of diamonds up by artificial scarcity and
[39:57.920 --> 40:00.720]  the average person doesn't know that after watch all Bono and all these
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.360]  Hollywood people about oh don't buy diamonds unless they're certified by
[40:04.360 --> 40:09.560]  De Beers which makes sure it's basically slave labor just it's like
[40:09.560 --> 40:13.520]  everything you're told is the opposite of what's really going on and David
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.160]  we'll have to get into the gun thing this a lieutenant colonel at West Point
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.520]  saying we're gonna take your guns we're gonna ban your guns and we're gonna
[40:20.520 --> 40:24.240]  take them from your cold dead hand that quotes now upon info wars dot com that
[40:24.240 --> 40:27.640]  article because we only got a few minutes for this other report to get
[40:27.640 --> 40:32.400]  into this but I hired you because you're a smart engineer and you you you've
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.760]  studied history as well it's addicting once you learn about it you always want
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.040]  to learn more but it's very painful to then run into people that just go oh
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.600]  you're just racist you don't like Nelson Mandela it's like this mindless feel
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.440]  good thing like that Miss Teen USA that said you know what do we do to help
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.640]  American test scores she goes such as all over the whole thing I mean it's
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.040]  literally you don't know how to tie your shoelaces but you know how to go
[40:56.040 --> 41:03.120]  Mandela Mandela Mandela and it's totally frustrating that they have no idea that
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.240]  they basically traded one set of masters who are actually reforming they
[41:07.240 --> 41:10.920]  always use reform like Assad started reforming in Syria they use that to
[41:10.920 --> 41:14.680]  bring an al-Qaeda to overthrow him same thing with Qaddafi that people say
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.880]  well why are you defending Qaddafi because he was much better than what
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.800]  they've done now al-Qaeda just like I'm not defending the white africaners that
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.000]  were had a racist system I just knew that they actually were building things up
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.920]  and actually helping people compared to communist I mean the that's what I'm
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.400]  saying is I don't want apartheid but I don't want to live under Joseph Stalin
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.280]  either I knew it was a globalist commie banker takeover so that's why I would
[41:39.280 --> 41:42.880]  simply pointed out hey this is what's happening and if the Africans knew that
[41:42.880 --> 41:46.680]  and if the American people knew that and if the cause celebs knew that we could
[41:46.680 --> 41:52.320]  have actually reformed things had real unity and use South Africa in the south
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.280]  and Libya in the north which is what Qaddafi wanted to do to jack up Africa
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.960]  politically out of the mud and actually build it up but the globalist don't want
[42:02.960 --> 42:06.520]  that and I mean it's like Coney 2012 hadn't been seen in seven years now it
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.200]  was six years we're gonna invade Africa because this guy's a bad guy who's
[42:10.200 --> 42:13.760]  hiding in the jungle somewhere he's actually dead now they're invading most
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.960]  of the country's north southwest killing people with UN drones and saying it's to
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.200]  get Coney and because they know the general public just goes Coney blow up
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.880]  all of Africa nuke the whole continent or you're for Coney well then let South
[42:27.880 --> 42:31.920]  Africa be enslaved or you're against black people you know it's the same
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.880]  mindlessness David Knight well you know racism is a tactic quite frankly just
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.240]  like communism is a tactic fascism is a tactic and the elite always use this to
[42:42.240 --> 42:45.160]  oppress the people what they do is they say well we've had fascism for a while
[42:45.160 --> 42:47.800]  so now we're gonna have communism and you're gonna be free it's gonna be
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.080]  completely different or we've had racism for a long time so now we're gonna have
[42:51.080 --> 42:56.040]  communism the fact of the matter is is that Mandela fought against racism which
[42:56.040 --> 43:00.400]  was a good thing but he did it with communism which is just a different evil
[43:00.400 --> 43:05.360]  and you got people that don't want to talk about this I saw somebody write
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.120]  that now is not the time to talk about the history of this historical figure
[43:09.120 --> 43:12.680]  well the reality is is that they are talking about this historical figure
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.840]  they're making him into a saint and if you ignore both the warts as well as
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.280]  what he did well then you're not going to really get an accurate picture of it
[43:20.280 --> 43:23.840]  and once they make him into a saint then nobody will be able to talk about him
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.800]  without being tagged as a racist and as we see in this country racism is a
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.200]  tactic for the ruling elite well they're racialist exactly it's a divide and
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.160]  conquer the British Empire has written published books hundreds of years ago
[43:37.160 --> 43:41.920]  that are on record how to do this that's what they're doing and then they'll use
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.760]  old wounds to keep the wounds open and engage in new wounds we're gonna air a
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.040]  special reporter and then we come back from break we're gonna get into this
[43:49.040 --> 43:54.280]  army colonel who openly says he quote will get the guns out of our cold dead
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.120]  hands we're gonna do that but very eloquently said that's why I love David
[43:58.120 --> 44:02.320]  night folks he could crystallize what I tried to say in 10 minutes down to just
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.840]  a little blurb and then James Baker went over there when he got out of prison
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.160]  was the first person to talk to me got a prison the first world leader was
[44:10.160 --> 44:14.360]  Secretary of State James Baker with that whole setup with the British Empire to
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.240]  literally betray Africa again and they have betrayed South Africa I want
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.200]  prosperity for South Africa and it's undoubtedly many times worse than it was
[44:22.200 --> 44:27.360]  you judge a tree by its fruits and Mandela literally was just someone who
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.520]  was basically broken and programmed in prison and people have to be honest
[44:31.520 --> 44:34.880]  about that and not let them create a saint so that he can't be questioned
[44:34.880 --> 44:41.480]  perfectly crystallized David Knight now here is a special report and also
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.520]  operational you know promotion to be able to stay on the air folks and keep
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.600]  expanding operation it's it's quite an issue to deal with with something that
[44:49.600 --> 44:55.720]  helps everybody across the board and that of course is fluoride shield and so
[44:55.720 --> 45:01.320]  here is a piece that we put together on this new proprietary development that we
[45:01.320 --> 45:05.320]  put together with Dr. Group and Anthony Gujiardi and it is simply amazing just
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.080]  like the nation iodine and also the Supermail Vitality would come out with
[45:09.080 --> 45:17.000]  infowarslife.com here it is the facts are in the studies are legion sodium
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.320]  fluoride and other members of the fluorine family that are added to Western
[45:22.320 --> 45:29.240]  water supplies are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the
[45:29.240 --> 45:35.520]  people that drank it so the question is why are the social engineers adding it
[45:35.520 --> 45:42.280]  to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[45:42.280 --> 45:49.560]  technocracy is feeding on destroy our health make us weak now we're battling
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.200]  to get fluoride removed out of the water and we've been successful in some
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.440]  cities in the U.S. Canada England and Germany but in most areas the poison is
[45:59.440 --> 46:06.280]  still being added we can't get it out of the water supply yet but we can get it
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.840]  out of our bodies there is a way to fight back the reason I have launched
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.640]  infowars life is because in my own research trying to figure out how to
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.720]  detox my body and how to live a healthier life and how to take care of my
[46:20.720 --> 46:28.840]  children I did more and more research on substances that are known on record to
[46:28.840 --> 46:34.320]  help block fluoride and other toxins but also help strip them out and cleanse
[46:34.320 --> 46:37.400]  them from the body and talking to medical doctors
[46:37.400 --> 46:45.800]  scientists researchers nutritionist different compounds continued to come
[46:45.800 --> 46:52.080]  up in their research separately to be the best at detoxing and cleansing the
[46:52.080 --> 46:57.120]  body and for the first time ever this product did not exist I'm quite
[46:57.120 --> 47:01.600]  frankly shocked that nobody else developed it we can now bring you fluoride
[47:01.600 --> 47:08.000]  shield fluoride detox but again it doesn't just detox fluoride the six
[47:08.000 --> 47:16.040]  substances in fluoride shield have been shown on record to battle and to cleanse
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.840]  and to strip out these known poisons that are wreaking havoc inside our bodies
[47:21.840 --> 47:27.000]  we developed the fluoride shield to be the highest quality highest standards
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.480]  because I use it every day and my family uses it every single day and the
[47:32.480 --> 47:37.920]  results that I have experienced have been dramatic let's take a closer look at
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.320]  the ingredients that make up this special proprietary formula tamarind has
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.160]  been celebrated for its ability to immobilize toxic fluoride residues
[47:48.160 --> 47:53.760]  while zeolites have a long history of attracting and holding toxic compounds
[47:53.760 --> 47:59.280]  interfulvic acid an excellent cleansing agent that was included in the formula
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.080]  to displace fluoride from key areas of the body then we added the highest
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.800]  quality shillage a rare compound that is collected from the high mountains of the
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.320]  Himalayas and that has been used for thousands of years by Tibetans to cleanse
[48:14.320 --> 48:19.240]  the body we topped it all off with the powerhouse herbs cilantro that is
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.960]  intended to mobilize fluoride and other dangerous compounds for removal from the
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.840]  body and the final touch to energize this formula is our proprietary nascent
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.840]  iodide the ingredients in fluoride shield were carefully selected from
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.560]  thousands upon thousands of herbs minerals and nutrients whatever you do
[48:39.560 --> 48:44.600]  it's imperative to go to info wars life calm and read our entire informational
[48:44.600 --> 48:49.760]  write-up on fluoride shield because these compounds don't just strip the body of
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.760]  unwanted fluoride it targets mercury and a whole other list and the
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.760]  documentation is an info wars life calm and as always consult your physician as
[49:00.760 --> 49:06.480]  well because that is important and finally fluoride shield survival shield
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.880]  and all the products at info wars life calm grew out of my quest to try to find
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.600]  the very best compounds from God's cornucopia to protect myself and my

[50:13.920 --> 50:18.480]  teaching the new officer corps that the Second Amendment does not exist and
[50:18.480 --> 50:21.920]  then our guns will be taken and the rest of the West Point training it's in
[50:21.920 --> 50:25.440]  Forbes and Washington Times and Associated Press they're trained to
[50:25.440 --> 50:30.200]  confiscate our guns one more thought on Nelson Mandela this is what frustrates
[50:30.200 --> 50:34.520]  me so much you got four big tribes of dozens of other little tribes all
[50:34.520 --> 50:37.320]  killing each other constantly if you're not part of that tribe they
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.520]  literally will will kill you now Mandela tried to unify that and that was a
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.920]  positive thing but it's the same thing that's what it's not even racism it's
[50:45.920 --> 50:49.440]  tribalism just like the whites wouldn't let you in their club if you weren't
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.120]  Dutch or then you had French that were only in their club that were white this
[50:53.120 --> 50:56.840]  is tribalism and under political correctness they're not trying to get

[53:58.040 --> 54:07.960]  armor dot com folks one last little piece of history about Nelson Mandela in
[54:07.960 --> 54:12.360]  South Africa one reason I've read so many books about it is it's so entertaining
[54:12.360 --> 54:19.760]  I mean it's like reading histories of the West it was like America and that all
[54:19.760 --> 54:23.320]  these poor people from all over the world including India including the
[54:23.320 --> 54:28.420]  Middle East not just anglos other Africans would try to get there and get
[54:28.420 --> 54:35.120]  off shifts at the Horn of Africa or down there in southern Africa I guess
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.680]  they call it the Cape and the point is the horns up up in Somalia the the Cape
[54:40.680 --> 54:45.320]  I'm going through all this history just from background but yes the Cape of
[54:45.320 --> 54:51.440]  Good Hope and Cape Town and then you had the British basically able to grab the
[54:51.440 --> 54:55.840]  south the central and the far eastern piece but then there were only two
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.640]  little pieces that were kept by the Dutch the French and others and again
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.480]  they all hated each other even more than the blacks because that tribally was
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.280]  their tribal warfare and then you had the blacks all hating each other even
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.480]  more than the whites and it's just so frustrating it's all the exact same type
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.800]  of human behavior tribalism and it tribalism is why Africa has always had
[55:18.800 --> 55:22.640]  so many problems is because they always engage in tribal warfare well every
[55:22.640 --> 55:25.600]  other cultures done that as well and then that's the argument for Empire it
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.800]  comes in and stops the tribalism the problem is the these empires then keep
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.640]  tribalism going to keep everyone under control with the Empire and then this is
[55:34.640 --> 55:39.160]  a predatory New World Order Empire that once it's all disarmed all disowned of
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.000]  property all disowned of rights so the New World Order is a new corporate
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.240]  colonialism that is anti free market anti individual and it's colonizing the
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.360]  mind now I'm done I'm done talking about it it's just that I'm just thinking
[55:53.360 --> 55:59.600]  about how insane South Africa has been I mean the wars there make anything in
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.760]  the US look like a joke folks and I want to talk to folks who are the who are
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.040]  Dutch Africaners French Africaners black Africaners who lose it if you're part
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.080]  of Mandela's tribe I'm not attacking you because I'm not worshipping Mandela I
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.840]  mean this is so frustrating all this tribal warfare stuff where I point out
[56:16.840 --> 56:20.480]  the West brought in Muslims to attack the Serbs the Serbs fought back they
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.680]  called it ethnic cleansing and then the West came in and bombed the country and
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.240]  gave Albania a third of Serbia I'm not Albanian I'm not Serb I just know the
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.960]  New World Order is going in and destroying nation states and that's why
[56:31.960 --> 56:35.600]  I'm frustrated and and let's finish up with South Africa we'll get into this
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.880]  traitorous professor later in the next hour because I think we've run out of
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.200]  time here David Knight but other points on what I just said well you're
[56:44.200 --> 56:48.160]  absolutely right Alex and we've got tribes here in the US we've got a tribe of
[56:48.160 --> 56:51.560]  Republicans and Democrats it's one of the reasons why the founders opposed
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.840]  partisan politics because they knew that it would be used to divide and to
[56:55.840 --> 56:59.360]  conquer they said it would cause tribalism absolutely and so what's
[56:59.360 --> 57:02.840]  important is about the individual and it's about individual rights and that's
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.320]  is that essentially what's going on with this debate that got drug up again by
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.480]  this West Point instructor former West Point instructor he's taking a
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.600]  collectivist status view of the Second Amendment not that it's about individual
[57:15.600 --> 57:19.480]  rights not that it's about establishing the right of the people to keep in their
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.520]  arms no for him of the state which is the super elite royal tribe exactly their
[57:24.520 --> 57:28.520]  ideas are what we must adopt in collectivism that's slavery exactly so
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.120]  everything is about divide and conquer everything is about breaking us into
[57:32.120 --> 57:36.040]  competing groups sports reinforce that you're talking about the boycotting of
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.800]  the NFL I mean sport team sports are really about getting people back into
[57:40.800 --> 57:45.080]  this tribalistic mindset and they can easily then transfer that into the
[57:45.080 --> 57:48.520]  political realm because people are much more interested in watching a sports
[57:48.520 --> 57:52.720]  pageant but once you get into this them versus us type of mentality it's very
[57:52.720 --> 57:55.520]  easy to do that that's what we saw happening there and as I pointed out
[57:55.520 --> 57:59.640]  before communism does not mitigate racism you know it's not a it's not a way
[57:59.640 --> 58:02.440]  to substitute one for the other it's just a different kind of control technique
[58:02.440 --> 58:06.760]  well and then they use getting rid of racism as a way to reaffirm the
[58:06.760 --> 58:10.720]  differences and then selectively enforce it but it's just like the Ford versus
[58:10.720 --> 58:14.480]  Chevy where it shows a little character urinating on the symbol people getting
[58:14.480 --> 58:18.560]  fights over I like Ford I like Chevy I like Dodge it's just they have no
[58:18.560 --> 58:23.680]  culture and it's it's like it's like cowboys versus the 49ers it's just that's
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.080]  and it's a fake culture and notice the globalist attack anything that's a real
[58:28.080 --> 58:32.520]  culture folks don't give up your culture no matter what it is be proud of it and
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.560]  be proud of other cultures as well but don't give up your culture and turn
[58:36.560 --> 58:46.080]  against any plastic culture thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com

[58:55.560 --> 59:00.360]  the future how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scousen the US
[59:00.360 --> 59:04.240]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[59:04.240 --> 59:08.520]  threat they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack
[59:08.520 --> 59:12.680]  to come told Scousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in
[59:12.680 --> 59:17.280]  strategic relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you
[59:17.280 --> 59:21.240]  do have time we talk about natural disasters the health environment we
[59:21.240 --> 59:25.080]  talk about pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in
[59:25.080 --> 59:28.440]  every one of these states most people want to be ready won't be able to get
[59:28.440 --> 59:32.520]  out of town because there'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness

[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:24.920]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones with the death of Nelson
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.960]  Mandela we've been discussing tribalism which is how humans have organized
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.760]  themselves for all of our history which works fine if you're a band of people
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.280]  out of middle of nowhere and stare kinship and this other group that wants
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.600]  to you know basically take your your hunting lands from you that that's how
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.440]  you operate but the globalist the Empire is going back to Roman before they
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:50.400]  scientifically studied tribes and how to manipulate and I have read no
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:58.520]  exaggeration let's not exaggerate I don't know 30 40 probably more books by
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:06.160]  the British Empire by I mean published for the British Empire published by the
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:18.320]  Roman Empire published by anthropology sociology textbooks and that's really
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.240]  what the elite are into is how they manipulate you and their culture is
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:30.240]  really eugenics ultra-slavery hatred of humanity mega-authoritarians and how do
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.880]  you explain that somebody that's been raised on NFL tribalism or Ford versus
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.600]  Xavier Coke versus Pepsi I mean you see how they do this everywhere and then it
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.380]  turns out Coke and Pepsi are basically interlocking corporations the same
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.400]  people it's like England has two big grocery store chains and it turns out
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.960]  they're all by the same people it's just we're literally under a colonization of
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.640]  the mind I want to free people's mind because I think everybody's beautiful
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.080]  and great and has interesting attributes the problem is once someone's bought
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.720]  into collectivism and and and has been programmed by by tribalism it doesn't
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.600]  matter if you individually don't hate them they hate you because of your color
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.800]  and even if you try to talk them out of it they think they have power over you
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.560]  now in political correctness if you're one of the chosen bad groups just
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.040]  reverse racism I'm the bad white person and then there's no way to deep program
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.800]  most of those folks because the social engineers have have done this for so
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.860]  long this is their identity their culture is being racially upset with the
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:40.680]  social race pimps the race hustlers reaffirming on top and manipulating the
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.920]  entire program and when you look at tribalism I've realized more and more
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.880]  we have to act like sports teams we have to put our ideas out very simply and
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.880]  then connect them to the more complex ideas to counter folks that are like
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.200]  zombies and that's what I've said we need to have our own gangs people go
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.760]  what like your crypts and bloods no no no or or the cook looks clan no no no no
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.360]  I'm saying second amendment property rights liberty free market that's why
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.840]  the establishment you know the left today attacks the movie Scarface so much
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.840]  because it backfired on them because you've got this entrepreneur character
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.600]  even though he's a bad guy he's a good guy at the end doesn't kill kids makes
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.400]  the right decision at the end and he says I like everybody but a communist
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.840]  that's slavery you want somebody telling you what to eat what to sleep what to do
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.840]  you will not have enough food to eat you want a rat on every corner telling you
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.840]  what to do we have to literally fight this communist collectivism with our
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.080]  own tribalism of forget what color you are it's what Martin Luther King actually
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.520]  said you know the left tried to control him and communist he was getting away
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  from them that's why they killed him because he was getting off the whole
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.640]  left-right reservation the judge someone by the content of their deeds and their
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.040]  heart and how they act and what they do you judge a tree by its fruits not not
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.480]  what they say on the surface but but what do they actually do and Nelson
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.600]  Mandela was only a puppet and a frontman though he was a very interesting
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.920]  smart guy I'm not saying that he was an interesting guy and a manly man you know
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:16.960]  big warlord king of the whole area of Africa notice the media never says that
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.080]  like he just came from nowhere a nice person over here and everyone grovels
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.560]  to him in fear because of you know whatever when you really get down to
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.400]  the end of the day he totally to get out of prison I don't know 27 years of

[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.200]  last hour what really happened in South Africa how the British government
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:43.360]  wanted to break down the cut to replace one form of tyranny with another but
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.160]  we've already covered that we're gonna cover it more I'd like to hear
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.520]  specifically from people in South Africa or if you live in Australia the
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.880]  United States Europe if you've left South Africa if you're a black South
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.920]  African white South African French South Africa because they're all in
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.240]  different groups Dutch South African mixed South African whatever what is
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.560]  your take on how South Africa is now 20 years after Mandela it's been about 20
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.800]  years since he was in there as president what is your take on the divide and
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.400]  conquer that's now taking place and how they use that opportunity for unity I
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.960]  believe for division but you know more about it than I do the toll-free number

[01:09:51.120 --> 01:10:00.560]  number would be zero zero and then one and then 651-695-7755 those are for
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.440]  international callers and you're on air right now right yes sir okay good

[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:13.760]  info wars news center and then you're in Minnesota and thank you very much John
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.880]  Harmon and again give that number up one more time that's zero zero one six
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.760]  five one six nine five seven seven five five all right we should get John
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.680]  Harmon on air more often so please call in we'd like to hear from you whether
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.000]  you're an ex-patriot or whether you're visiting the United States or whether
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.600]  you're listening on the internet I know we get calls routinely from South
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.040]  Africa I know it's caused quite a stir when I've been on South African radio
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.520]  shows and they've actually had the government try to tell them not to have
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.920]  me back on anymore I mean that's the type of tyranny now that's going on there
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.560]  so they've replaced one form of oppression with another and it's
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.040]  statistically much worse as folks said it would be see you're like what are you
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.200]  for apartheid no I'm saying the globalist are even more evil than this on
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.560]  record and they are gonna want to totally oppress everybody in social
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:10.240]  engineering it's like the Borg versus you know some good old boys who actually
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.120]  want prosperity and again we need tribalism of liberty not tribalism of
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.120]  race or even religion because you know we got a black fellow from Georgia coming
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:27.080]  on who had a gun at his own business and people complained so the cops said
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.520]  well you want you to conceal Kerry so he got that and they came and arrested him
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.680]  and haven't given him his gun back or any of it and a bunch of other stuff and
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.960]  see I'm as offended if it was a black person a white person or whatever I
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.080]  never even when I first heard than heard about it on the radio I didn't think is
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.120]  it a black person is it a white person I just thought of somebody having their
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.520]  rights violated it's like that lady that black lady that we've got scared at the
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.520]  checkpoint and they so they chased down and killed her I immediately came on and
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.320]  said this is the tyranny of Washington and the paranoia of terrorism and this
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.000]  police state and I literally saw YouTube comments and I showed them on air and
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.280]  comments on info or saying she was driving a nice car you're just mad that
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.760]  some white lady got killed because that was right during the Trayvon Martin
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.840]  thing or at the end of it people were so racially charged up and then when it
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.680]  turned out she was a black lady I had such an outpouring of liberal blacks then
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.640]  loving me like I defended a black lady it's I didn't even think what color is
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.240]  this woman they just killed some woman in front of her kid who was unarmed I I
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.320]  just don't get it I mean I you know you bleed red I'm for you and and it's so
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.280]  frustrating to see that Pete when he's I'm ranting 800 to 5 at 992 31 we want
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.760]  to hear from folks with their take on South Africa if you lived there or even
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.000]  to be visited or if you're a historian your take on it we I see a lot of
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.480]  callers coming in Jim in Texas and others who lived in South Africa but we've
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.000]  got some other news we've got a hit on two different fronts and drugs report
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.680]  dot com has a red link to our article about thumb scanning in these prison
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.280]  tunnels that lock you in at the airport those are going into more airports
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:08.520]  that's an incredible story we've got to cover but this West Point trader this
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:14.760]  this this globalist operative in Esquire saying you know the military will
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:20.600]  get our guns break down this information well you know Alex what he was
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.880]  writing his essay in Esquire essentially about was a 2010 Supreme Court
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.200]  decision Heller versus DC now that was a Supreme Court decision that
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.560]  established as according to the a 5-4 decision that the Second Amendment is
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.440]  about an individual right and of course that's really the crux of the debate
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:43.080]  people on the authoritarian left have tried to portray this as something that
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.320]  is a right that belongs to government and that's the tack that this guy who was
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.200]  a West Point history instructor that's the tack that he's taking throughout his
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.920]  entire article he says my job at the end of the day is about killing and I
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.120]  orchestrate violence but my profession is about directed violence on behalf of
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.120]  the nation you see the way that he defines the nation is the federal
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.920]  government not the individual people and to say that the Bill of Rights
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.640]  especially the Second Amendment is about establishing powers for the
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:17.080]  government is just amazingly an amazing lie because the entire the entire 10
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.840]  Bill of Rights was about individual rights and then they summed it up with a
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.240]  10th Amendment and said oh no by the way if we haven't given anything
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.800]  specifically to the government it's still reserved to the people and to the
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.720]  individual states and so and by the way the Violence Policy Center 13 years ago
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.040]  in the front page of the Dallas of the Austin American statesman whenever we
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.120]  caught bribery at the Capitol they literally in the paper quoted the head
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.640]  of the Violence Policy Center and he said it doesn't matter what Mr. Jones
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.400]  does he's gonna die and with him his Second Amendment we've got your kids in
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.640]  the schools and then here's this West Point professor in the articles I see
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.920]  on infoworks.com saying doesn't matter we're gonna get your guns anyways but
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.960]  for sure when you die and so it is about killing a culture and it's so sick that
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.360]  this guy shows Marxist training when they say we've got your kids and I can't
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.080]  believe we just turn our kids over to these people go ahead that's right and
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.360]  of course at West Point he taught history because he's about shaping the
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.920]  worldview that's why he believes that he can take the guns from your cold dead
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.440]  hand he says he hopes that he doesn't have to kill you of course he will if he
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.080]  has to he'll tell his and it's worse inherited yeah yeah and it's worse it's
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.480]  worse he the scandal is why are they putting these people in everywhere yes
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.120]  you know it just came out two weeks ago that the person teaching history in a
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.480]  lawn a bunch of other stuff at another West Point type installation one of the
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.680]  biggest in the country Texas saying him and it's not just this one professor the
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.760]  bunch of them are doing it they're bringing him in and literally saying
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.240]  we're gonna take your guns and and she said the rest of the bill writes free
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.240]  speech everything that's right well of course this guy is writing for Esquire
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.920]  he's also written for the Small Wars Journal and if you remember back to the
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.240]  summer of 2012 there was a lot said about an article that they had called
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.240]  full-spectrum operations in the homeland a vision of the future do you
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.200]  remember that where they were yes when they said they're preparing for war with
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.120]  tea party that's right the tea party was taking over after hard times and a bad
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.480]  economy they had taken over one town and so this was their their gaming
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.000]  scenario how they were gonna fight the tea party people who had taken over
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.800]  Darlington South Carolina now he didn't write that particular article but he
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.680]  writes many many articles for the Small Wars Journal he's also see that's even
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.160]  more important that's even more important again it's infested it's it's not
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:41.640]  this one guy it's it's most of them I mean I'll turn on C-span and see an army
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.280]  war college briefing for generals and I mean it sounds like the most author it
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.280]  it sounds like a science fiction movie of the bad guys yeah go go ahead well and
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.200]  you know this is very relevant because you remember when we were down in San
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.400]  Antonio and you and Anthony Gutiarty were talking to the police chief because
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.680]  we had this open carry rally down there at the Alamo and and you asked him he's
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.240]  a you know point blank you and Anthony were asking him would you confiscate
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.160]  guns if you were ordered to do so and he said well that's a hypothetical just
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.160]  dropped they have hypothetical scenarios that's exactly what they train in all the
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.760]  time is hypothetical scenarios that's what the Small Wars Journal is about it
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.240]  was about a hypothetical scenario where they could have the operation in the
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.480]  homeland their vision of the future where they're fighting tea party people to
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.000]  confiscate their guns so to say that I can't tell you whether I would confiscate
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.040]  your guns or not because that's a hypothetical scenario everything that
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.560]  they train with is hypothetical and they are creating scenarios where the
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.440]  federal government where the military is going against individual citizens
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.640]  because as this fellow points out he doesn't see it as an individual right he
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.320]  sees it as absolutely right it's all about continuity of government it's not
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.120]  about individual right we're gonna go to phone calls now again I'm hosting the

[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.920]  shift gears and get into other news but if you hear me jumping in and getting

[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.720]  we're going to take it from your hand I mean this is that this is absolute
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.120]  sedition absolute enemy infiltration and Americans love to follow authority so
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.640]  much they're gonna try to have a war war here folks I'm telling you they are
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.200]  gonna come after the gun owners and by the way all you idiots they're gonna
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.440]  side with them you're gonna be slaves when they're done you idiots excuse me
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.320]  I'm getting angry here folks I'm just it's I can't believe that our own military
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.960]  leadership is openly teaching treason and sedition and overthrow they are
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.840]  criminal infiltrators according to the Bill of Rights and Constitution they
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.040]  have broken their oaths they are involved in sedition thank you David Knight
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.240]  let's talk to and chime in anytime you want on these gentlemen Jim in Texas
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.080]  lived in South Africa then we'll talk to Swiss Mountain in Switzerland thank you
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.080]  for holding Jim you're on the air go ahead
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.920]  back off your phone a little bit it's overdriven for those that don't know
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.520]  Rhodesia was when the British captured the north area of South Africa the
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.640]  northeast they named it after their Illuminati chieftain who openly called
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.080]  for world government and he set up the Rhodes Scholarship so so you were born
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.440]  in Rhodesia go ahead yes that's correct my father was in the Rhodesia army in
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:12.920]  fact he was a captain in all the companies in the Rhodesian African
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:18.240]  rifles which was the black and white unit mixed up battalions growing up there
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.440]  was no racial strife whatsoever in Rhodesia the hostiles in the debate
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.720]  these were major black tribes we lived in neighborhoods I had black
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.840]  neighbors I had the color they were the ones that you know maybe had a wife
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.920]  parent that was interracial there was no problem no racial strife whatsoever
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:45.720]  until the Zeng Zengla Zimbabwe an African national people's liberation army
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.760]  communists who are Chinese back began in insurgency from Zambia now why is this
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.920]  important because Nelson Mandela was a Zengla operative they were the ones who
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.000]  set him up Winnie Mandela and her little soccer soccer boys that they call them
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.760]  were a bunch of little terrorists that would go around killing members of the
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:13.840]  Zulus and the Dibelles in South Africa that did not support their communist
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:20.080]  attitudes now when I went after Rhodesia come in 1980 my family my father and my
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.760]  mother and my brothers and sisters and I moved to Cape Town which is the
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:29.720]  English speaking area the British versus the Dutch area of South Africa and my
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:36.120]  father became a policeman what men thought and his ilk would do is terrorize
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:40.640]  they were color delict they wouldn't attack the policemen in the police
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:46.120]  stations they were kidnapped and tortured and terrorized the family members of the
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:52.880]  police but when I hear people exclaiming how wonderful Nelson especially
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.760]  that either woman Winnie Mandela when they are singing their praises they
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.960]  wouldn't feel the same way if they would have had a family member usually
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.560]  innocent children coming home from the private schools that we were forced to
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.840]  go to then we kidnapped the children of police officers and set them on fire
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.920]  these are five and six year old little children that Winnie Mandela and Nelson
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.120]  Mandela and the others then the terrorists used to torture and kill
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.920]  and by the way you point that out I mean of course he was part of that group he
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.600]  was to be the king of that particular tribe and notice they never even point
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.960]  that out and that again they went around murdering other tribes of blacks that
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.240]  didn't want to be communist you're absolutely right that's mainline history
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:41.360]  you lived it and it's just crazy to sit there and see none of that on the news
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.880]  and they are sanctifying him like he is the st. Mary or something I mean I have
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.080]  never seen anything like it what is it like for you living in the United States
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.800]  now I guess you're a US citizen now it sounds like it I can't even you know
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.280]  hear your South African accent what is it like to see people who I guarantee you
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.720]  can't even find South Africa on a map I guarantee it would argue with you and
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.440]  call you a racist if you didn't literally put a tire around your child's head
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.880]  and burn that white devil for Mandela will you do not kill your children now
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.200]  sir to show you're not racist there you go absolutely and you can look at the
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:23.080]  the Zulu tribes which were very anti Mandela the Zulus were criticized for
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.240]  being part of the apartheid government when in fact they were just very
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.920]  decent people the Zulus never been terrorist the Zulus never had any
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.560]  allegations of murdering white children or black children or anything the Zulus
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:43.380]  are a very they have a very strong political they had a warrior code they
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:47.960]  had a warrior you know like a chivalry like Knights exactly and the Zulus did
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:53.120]  not care for any of the communists at all and even there the Zulu chiefs would
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  would denounce Mandela publicly because of the methods he would use to try and
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.700]  end the apartheid all apartheid was is as you correctly stated Alice was the
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:09.040]  night tribe trying to maintain itself against the other black tribes the
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.240]  blacks in South Africa even to this day are very tribal and then they would
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.740]  criticize the white which are referred to as Europeans in Africa white
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:24.200]  Africans are referred to as European even though I've never been to Europe for
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.440]  us for being tribal ourselves we would be criticized now they would maintain
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.280]  their tribalism so the Zulus were good the communists the Balinese and horses
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.760]  were not very good they were terrorists they were murderers they were insurgents
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.840]  backed by the communist Chinese and Nelson Mandela now that he's dead I hope he
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:50.200]  wraps in hell and suffers pain for eternity for what he and William Mandela
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.280]  did to innocent people all right well that's from somebody that lived it and
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.320]  I'd love to hear from any you know others South Africans blacks South
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.840]  Africans I don't care all I know is I've studied it and yeah the the Russians the
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.120]  Chinese on record would go into African countries where there were basically no
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.600]  whites north of there and and would just kill everybody I mean it's but it's like
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.720]  well when you want to when the Soviets kill Africans it's loving and cute see
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.800]  cute and and it's just now look at South Africa folks it is a hell hole of
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.320]  communism now but our media you never know it you would never know what South
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.560]  Africa is like now because they just the foreign banks came in the British
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.920]  Empire came in they finally conquered it with political correctness and I just
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.640]  wish that everybody would have worked together I know they tried to with the
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:40.080]  Zulu's to actually get real liberty and try to unify but then once Mandela he
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.480]  unified him around communism with sports and then what you know oh the the you
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.560]  know the soccer team or the rugby team went and met with him and it was a white
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.520]  team and then oh they're all friends now that was just for outside consumption
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:01.000]  from what I've read let's talk to Swiss Mountain who lived in South Africa what
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.520]  is your take on all this and what the last caller said Swiss Mountain
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.280]  hi Alex it's nice to talk to you and well I think I think the previous caller
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:14.000]  romanticizes the Zulu nation of it even though I did vote for the Impala freedom
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  party in 94 elections but I mean that election in itself is completely rigged
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.520]  I just want to sort of mention a lesson on point that PW Brutha before he went
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:33.840]  out he was actually starting to move South Africa towards a system of the
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.400]  cantons as we have it in Switzerland or as you have the states in America and I
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.000]  think that's one of the reasons why they took him out so quickly why FW
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.400]  declared to completely usurp the national party back then and started
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.720]  working with Mandela to bring in the coalition government which eventually
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.520]  led to ANC rule and again for those that don't know the average American
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.080]  literally can't even I'm sorry the average government trained American
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.440]  cannot find their feet with both hands or their butt either but for folks that
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.720]  don't know you have the Incada group connected to the Zulus and then you have
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.280]  the ANC of course with Mandela and the communists and the rest of them give us
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.040]  your take on you know living there and why you left and what you'd like to say
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.800]  folks calling from Switzerland we we left our left because it just got the
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.960]  point where I wasn't safe anymore and your gun rights were virtually zero so for
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.800]  me to get a gun to protect myself was not not the way to go so I just decided
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.880]  okay I'll leave thanks the other reason I left was because everybody they were
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.400]  so much killing and I'm not just talking killing where they go and they shoot
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.640]  somebody they torture people they torture people in the most horrendous
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:58.600]  psychopathic ways before they finally let them die there's there's an
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.120]  extermination happening in South Africa of white farmers I don't know where
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.240]  these people are going to get their food from they most probably going to get
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:14.120]  genetically manipulated food from the UN but it was just psychologically so
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.880]  horrendous to live there I just had to leave and of course other areas of
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.040]  Africa they have exterminated all the whites actually exterminated the few
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.960]  farmers to stay behind and are now collapsing like Zimbabwe and again the
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.040]  average American hears the word Zimbabwe and just it thinks it's a foreign
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.480]  planet they are what do you want to tell Americans that naively think that
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:43.520]  communism in Africa is a wonderful thing I want to tell them to read read
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.920]  history and read lots of it and the only thing I can say to the American
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.720]  listeners is there's so much love and support for you from all around the
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.440]  world we're all in this together I think Thomas Payne even said we're all
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:03.600]  Americans in this cause of liberty and we've just got to keep on educating
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.000]  people we've got to interject small pieces of information to those that are
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.280]  entirely numb and try to tune in on their level to raise them up but even the
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.200]  slightest little bit and apart from that I'm so impressed with people running for
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.240]  local government in America that's the way to take it back our part of South
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.640]  Africa was the worst if you were a black living under the apartheid regime
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:34.320]  that's what you guys are fighting against right now it was horrendous for
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.840]  the black people as well because I grew up with them well I want to hear the how
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.760]  bad apartheid was when we come back we've got another guest coming on but I
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.560]  want to give you two minutes to finish up man and we'll be getting the guest on
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.960]  but I want you to talk give that perspective as well please stay there

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.960]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally

[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:18.320]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.920]  you so much and we've got a special guest coming up that the guys lined up
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:59.480]  from WSB TV first reported businessman arrested for loitering carrying legal
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.400]  gun on his own property in Atlanta Georgia or outside Atlanta the good
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.080]  Californians I guess that have moved to the area they see anyone with a gun they
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.520]  call the police and the police say look doesn't matter if your guns legal or not
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.720]  we're gonna take it because the Californians don't like seeing it and
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.600]  and that's an oversimplification I love a lot of Californians I love the state
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.000]  of California it's very beautiful but a lot of the my problems everybody I know
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.080]  lives on a ranch has had their California neighbors that's who's moved to
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:31.400]  Austin and to the Texas Hill Country call the police on them when they shoot
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:37.480]  their guns even a mile away and it's a reign of terror and that's basically what
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.760]  happened to this gentleman we're getting him on the line gonna talk to him in a
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.600]  second but a lady going by the name Swiss Mountain I wanted to hear from
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.640]  South Africans black South Africans white South Africans human beings who've
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.000]  lived in South Africa in the in the hellish stuff that's gone on there and
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.640]  you know get your real perspective on Nelson Mandela and we were about to go
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.280]  to break but she was talking about how bad apartheid was as well to give that
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:09.640]  perspective so living there and watching apartheid you were trying to
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.400]  make a point Swiss Mountain calling from Switzerland to go ahead and finish up
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.160]  yeah well I mean the amazing thing for white South Africans was that you had
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:23.960]  help in the house that were black women that worked in the kitchen for example
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.600]  and I grew up with these people and with their children and under apartheid
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.120]  their children were not allowed to be with them they had to go back to the
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.440]  townships and my mother was against this and we had several visits from the
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.040]  police where she just didn't allow them inside so then you had your past laws
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.200]  where black people had to carry their papers on them at all times and could
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:53.360]  be searched anywhere it really wasn't a nice system to be under if you were in
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.760]  the wrong skin color category so I can understand why why people like Nelson
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.560]  Mandela got really really annoyed at this I don't agree with his methods in
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.600]  the least nor do I agree with him contour we see where all any of those
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.880]  organizations that they started up I mean they they also had their fair share
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:18.600]  of our child soldiers and misery that they spread but the fact of the matter
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:24.200]  is you can't really have a libertarian system there because every single
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.120]  African tribe in South Africa has a hierarchy that's based on monarchy so
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.640]  they know nothing else and it's going to take a hell of a long time for them to
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:39.880]  start grasping individual rights and and life beyond a sheepenship that has a
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.200]  monarchy above it well that's what I was pointing out is that they basically
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.520]  broke Mandela regardless in 27 years in prison he was going to be the king of
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:53.000]  one of the major tribes the media never points out these royalty I mean of over
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.960]  large areas it's like this is not like some local chief it's like actual
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:01.720]  royalty and very brutal and then they bring him in and then he claims there's
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.120]  all this unity it's just absolutely trading out one group of controllers
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.160]  for another and from all the South Africans I've talked to black white
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.880]  doesn't matter they say South Africa has gotten innumerably worse it has that
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.880]  been your experience or is that not true absolutely it's gone from bad to
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.960]  worse if you ask black people today they say please bring back apartheid because
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:32.400]  it was just so much better for us we so even though it was horrible yeah yeah sorry go ahead now
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:37.720]  everybody says they had work they had so they had livelihood you know it was
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.640]  just that's the great big irony of it is because now you've got the system of the
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.240]  ANC and power that is that is so oligarchic and right of course they
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.600]  coupled with the New World Order make no mistake there's a lot of little
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.000]  minions there in the ANC government that has a business with a higher agenda for
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.680]  example tipping babies they want to start tipping babies in hospitals and in
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:11.440]  Johannesburg I think they want to put e-tags on your car if you want to drive
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:17.200]  on the highway all amazing well we're gonna have to open the phones up again
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:23.360]  when I get back to Austin soon and open the phones up for folks to call in from
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.320]  South Africa and also other regions because the great thing is we have so
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.880]  many listeners around the world we can get a real perspective from people so
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.520]  God bless you Swiss Mountain for calling in and that's what I love about our
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.840]  listeners these are real thinkers it's not Mandela good or Mandela bad it's not
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.600]  it no no it's it's much deeper of like what's really going on what's really
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.320]  happening because the West didn't go in and get rid of apartheid to help South
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.760]  Africa they went in so they could absolutely strip any laws out and make
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.960]  everybody slaves and that's my point is take a take and then we're going to our
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:07.080]  guest take what's happened in Ukraine Ukraine voted to not enter the European
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.080]  Union even though they wanted to for a decade and the and the EU was ready to
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.360]  bring them in because they've seen that the EU is actually there to loot
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.560]  countries and literally steal everybody's pension funds which they've done in
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.240]  Greece and Spain and Portugal and everywhere else because the documents
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:26.000]  came out that's what it was set up for so then they're like oh you're run by
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.920]  Russia now well no I don't think Ukraine should be under Russia or it should be
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.360]  under the EU it should be under the people of Ukraine it's the same deal
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:39.040]  they did not go with the EU because they love Russia the the Ukrainians hate
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.920]  the Russians they use them pretty much as slaves and and you know killed 10
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.120]  million of them and all the rest of them that's white people killing white people
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.880]  man it's the same story over and over again just different skin color and it's
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.800]  they'll use an excuse well you're a Ukrainian so I can kill you I mean it's
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.600]  just like they'll have Christians you know get killed by Muslims in Africa
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.680]  whatever just it's the same people same genetics they just or or one groups
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.880]  animus one groups Christians they kill each other we need to have a culture of
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.840]  liberty regardless what color we are of human liberty and then that's our game
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:14.040]  because we do want to be in tribes well I'm in the tribe of liberty and I don't
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.240]  care what color you are if you are having your rights violated I'm gonna come to
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.400]  your aid because I want people to come to my aid I mean where's the special
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.400]  interest for the individual where's the special interest for families where's
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.160]  the special interest for business owners where is it I want real unity around
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.640]  liberty and it's the only future we have folks and that's why they attack the
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.880]  Bible so much because it's all in there if we'd follow it people say well the
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.640]  religions done all this that's people twisting it alright I'm done ranting and

[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:25.840]  questions but I'm on the road here I go ahead Mr. Lee tell us who your lawyer
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.080]  is Shannon Braille okay well fantastic who would like to speak first tell us
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:39.480]  what happened to you oh I'll start it I was working and I got off work and I
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:45.880]  and on my way to the car I figured I left my gun so I had to run back in the
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.280]  store and get my gun and there were some guys outside this local guy that I know
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.240]  and they was asked me questions want to talk to me and so I talked to him for a
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:59.240]  second before I got my truck and the police pulled up and they said what's
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.280]  going on out here somebody had they had a car probably across the street or
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:07.160]  something they seen us outside and they said you have any drugs any weapons and
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.320]  I said I have a gun on me but it's my store gun and so as I had a gun they
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.920]  just handcuffed me and threw me in the back of the car and I said if you would
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.800]  let me finish I would have put my I could show you my my license in my back
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.000]  pocket so he didn't take the cuffs off they left me cuffed and he went into my
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.640]  back pocket and pulled out my license and ran it and one of the cops they was
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.080]  like they were betting on me one of them said I guarantee you I bet you the gun
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.520]  stolen and so the other guy ran the he ran my license he said well it's not
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:44.080]  stolen and he said he carried cursed and said damn and I said not said to the
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.720]  officer I said are you serious are you back I'm doing the right thing out here
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:53.880]  and he just he just told me to be quiet and he walked off and so the other the
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:58.320]  officer I said just do the right thing man what's gonna happen he said well I
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.720]  can't do nothing right now I gotta wait for my sardine to come and so his sardine
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.480]  finally came with probably like six more police officers and and they told me
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.440]  they came what my gun was registered but they came up as a different caliber
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.720]  caliber gun but my numbers matched and I said well I didn't put the
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.960]  thing in the system I got all my records right here and he said well we can't
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.600]  figure out so just take them to jail and we let the courts figure out and that's
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.400]  what happened and I want to get into what else happened to you and not getting
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.240]  the guns back but but here's the deal and I know the Georgia laws as well and
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.120]  we have your lawyer Shannon Briley who I'm very excited to know that we were
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.440]  able to get on the guys that sent me the list that overlooked it so I apologize
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.160]  for that but but my issue here is is this a case of having self-defense while
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.800]  being black like like driving while black or standing at a bus stop while black
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:53.800]  or is this a case of owning a gun and not being part of the government and
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.320]  because I see this happen to everybody but but I guess particularly black folks
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.880]  are aren't allowed to defend themselves I know in Chicago and DC it seems to be
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.280]  cities a lot of black folks where they deny people the second amendment so
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.640]  only the criminals have it my issue is you could have had a gun anyways as a
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.080]  business owner on your own property or in your car under Georgia law it's just
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.920]  like Texas law they are now arresting people in Texas and other areas who
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.800]  will have a rifle on the back of your truck that's totally legal they just say
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.600]  I'm gonna go ahead and take you in anyways and then as ammo land reported
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:26.360]  you have to spend more on lawyers to get your gun back than what it's worth and
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.800]  so this is really a criminal authoritarian action so tell folks what
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.280]  else happened once you went to jail your lawyer Shannon Briley jump in any time
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.160]  to tell us where this is going but I mean this is basically a kidnapping it's
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.720]  official oppression but because the police are doing it I guess it's okay
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:51.440]  according to them and then what happened next was they uh they they went in took
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:59.720]  me to jail they towed my car and I had a bond out of jail and then paid money to
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:05.080]  get my car back out and that's that's about it on that and then I had a call
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.200]  out went to court and the and the judge and everybody apologized and said they
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:15.120]  shouldn't be here they're sorry that I that I had to go through that and and
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.440]  they just brought the all the charges and they said and they said I would talk
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.640]  to somebody about you have they gotten have they given your gun back yet no
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.080]  sir they gave me the run around when I I went to I got my papers from the court
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.480]  to go get my gun now took it to the place they told me to take it to and they
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.340]  gave me they said I got to get in contact with that officer so I called the
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:45.880]  officers headquarters and they kept giving me the run around they gave me
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.000]  about six different precincts to check they said go here you're not here to
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.280]  try this precinct try this meeting so I got my car and I rolled I took pictures
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.520]  of all the precincts I went to then I called so much that the dispatch they
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.960]  would tell me that you know your best your best option is to just drive up he
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.280]  gets here at like it said like nine o'clock he gets here at nine and just
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.240]  pull out pull up and jump out on them that's your best way to catch him I said
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:19.160]  okay now I mean I think you're alluded to that do you think somebody tattled on
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:25.840]  you for exercising the right to to have a firearm for your own business because I
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:33.200]  see that it's an unclaimed freight and and and a grocery store furniture I mean
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.240]  it's the type of place that would get robbed I mean in the in the business
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:40.480]  owner can't have a gun I mean I guarantee if I ran a convenience store or a
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.960]  store like yours especially outside Atlanta I mean I guarantee I'd be packing
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.160]  yeah what's so egregious about this is that the response time the average
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.120]  response time for officers in this area is well over an hour particularly during
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.440]  ship changes in up late at the evening or early in the afternoon so if he was
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.240]  put into a situation where and he had to defend himself or his family that owns
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.680]  the business he wouldn't be able to do so without a firearm this is an area that
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:10.400]  have repeated robberies and law enforcement had initially suggested to
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:15.120]  him to get a firearm to keep the location and you know what's so egregious
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.600]  about this incident with DeKalb County is that this wasn't just actions of one
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:26.000]  rogue officer this incident was co-signed by a supervisor on every level
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.640]  initially by his immediate supervisor then by the DeKalb County Board of
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.920]  Commissioners and Mr. Lee following a lawsuit with a last resort he didn't
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.160]  just jump into this we sent a letter to DeKalb County internal affairs informing
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.400]  them what happened we sent a letter to the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.560]  informing them what happened and nothing we have gotten no response has been well
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:50.240]  over a year so that's right I mean I should have pointed out this is
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.600]  systemic I should have pointed out this is a year ago you're suing of course I
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.800]  miss making the big point thank you so much for bringing it up Shannon Riley
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.840]  of the lawyer for for Mr. Lee and when Mr. Lee's rights are violated all of our
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.440]  rights are violated obviously mid-level police that are smart say get a gun
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:09.080]  you're having a lot of crime problems but then higher up the politicos want to
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.520]  persecute gun owners and they have persecuted his human rights his civil
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.080]  rights this is a big violation where do you go from here what is the lawsuit
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.400]  calling for right now we isn't this is federal court for they file the motion
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:28.880]  to dismiss but just completely have no basis for but you know he's not trying
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.720]  to punish the taxpayers but you know at this point you know he wants reasonable
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.600]  compensation for what he has been through you know they're the claim you
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.240]  know we have allegations near battery false imprisonment you know we
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.520]  understand and both my parents were police officers and I was a police
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.800]  officer for seven years in Atlanta I know cops have a hard job but the problem
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.920]  with this situation is that the officers weren't a situation where they had to
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.400]  make a split-second decision they had all the facts available to them and they
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.640]  should just spell probable cause and they looked at it and they gave it the
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.000]  middle finger and said no we're going to make an arrest anyway even though he
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.920]  has this private property even though he had the license and even though he's not
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:14.960]  a convicted felon so it how do they claim you can't loiter at a business that you
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:20.360]  work at and own I mean so about I mean I've got like rifles I mean that may in
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.440]  my office at the radio studio I mean if the cops gonna come arrest me because
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.760]  I'm loitering indicate if you live in the cap county they might so where is this
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.160]  coming from and I mean I hope they all lose their job I hope you get a million
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.000]  dollars this is how we punish corruption or my guns are next why are they doing
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.760]  this I mean is this is kind of political direct over well I believe
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:47.000]  there's a lot of pressure on officers to make a rest it is called getting bodies
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.200]  you have to have a certain amount of bodies a week or else you get punished
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:53.920]  in the morning wash instead the upper echelon of the police department they
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.680]  don't need to be looking at who's getting bodies they need to look at who's
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:59.640]  getting convictions they need to look at the case as it's carried out or who's
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.320]  having and making a rest that leads a negotiated please they don't need to be
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.600]  looking at just who's pulling in bodies so it comes from the top scene bring us
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.800]  in the body and you know if they want a job that doesn't require any thought
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.400]  they need to you know get a job at a factory putting bolts on a car or on a
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.040]  machine they don't need to come police officers where people's liberty depends
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:25.560]  on you know their decisions they had all the information absolutely I mean in
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.880]  the past you wanted to get bused and actually get real criminals now it's
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.360]  just get as many of it I've talked to DWI task force police and they're honest
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.600]  about it I've had them in studio former ones that are gone to be lawyers will
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.560]  come back and talk about this that's why no people that have been arrested just
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.320]  for saying no I hadn't been drinking and smarting off they go fine I'm just
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.600]  taking it anyways because it's not about getting a quota on convictions or even
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.080]  indictments or you know things that are real case it's just raw arrest arrest
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.920]  arrest and they I mean an Austin police on the DWI task force folks they will
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.440]  arrest a T totaling church mouse we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen to

[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:19.360]  Knight's riding shotgun got a lot of breaking news coming up in the next
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:25.000]  hour the pastor James David Manning's joining us but Eric Lee who is a family
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.240]  man who owns a furniture store where he was arrested for loitering and carrying
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:35.240]  a firearm in violation of concealed carry law and by the way even went and
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.760]  got to concealed carry which is above and beyond what you gotta have in
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.520]  Georgia a police supervisor came to the scene and approved of the arrest and the
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.120]  county still will not return his gun who's filed a federal lawsuit and I
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.440]  love how his lawyer such a nice lady and he's so nice they're apologizing for
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.760]  the lawsuit you know it's time we start suing when the government violates our
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.040]  rights because they're in Congress having hearings now about Obama becoming a
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:04.560]  dictator basically and doing whatever he wants and the other agencies just acting
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:10.520]  how they want the government is out of control so Eric Lee and your lawyer
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.520]  Shannon Brian Lee anything else you guys would like to add about where this is
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.720]  going please don't apologize for fighting for my rights and everybody else's
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.720]  rights God bless you thank you we just hope that law enforcement can learn from
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.920]  this and understand that their job it's very important and it's our very
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.680]  important purpose and it requires that every single call they go on they put
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:38.920]  the thought into it that and it requires it's like a medical doctor or any other
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.080]  very serious profession and we just want training to occur and learning to
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:50.520]  occur here so this doesn't continue to happen she said she said it all she
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:53.960]  said it all and now all I can say I just wanted to just do the right thing you
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:56:00.160]  know I just want justice for everybody just do the right thing looking at this
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.960]  I mean I'm sure you guys are aware ammo land and the NRA have all reported on it
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:10.720]  they but I know almost everyone I know including a pretty famous gunperson the
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:13.600]  national gun TV show let's leave it at that because I know cuz I'm friends with
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.760]  him and he's had the police repeatedly called to his little ranch with a
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.080]  shooting range and a berm and and there and I'm not trying to be mean it's true
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.680]  it's Californians that have moved here they call the police on you when they
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.640]  hear shooting I know people that have 200 acre ranchettes that are out in the
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.680]  middle of nowhere people hear gunshots and the cops come sometimes and
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:37.320]  actually take your guns or arrest you I had the manager of a store come up just
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:41.560]  last week and said it happened to him on his 200 something acre family piece of
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:45.520]  property the DPS came in and they said your neighbors felt scared here in the
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.400]  gunshot you're going to jail I mean this is a reign of terror any comments on
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:56.080]  that I think with a lot of the the mass shootings they've got there's such a
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.600]  stigma now to weapons in general that the police can go in there and arrest
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.240]  somebody who has the gun just because guns in general have become so
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:10.680]  stigmatized and people don't understand that are yet fundamental basic
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:14.480]  constitutional rights to own a weapon to prevent the government from getting
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.240]  too big and taking away our rights and living in a police state and they don't
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:24.120]  understand the isolated acts of certain individuals who have used weapons should
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:29.760]  not be used to taint you know our rights you know in the entire population so I
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.400]  think well exactly and in any increased gun ownership since 1992 has caused a
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:40.920]  51% drop in violent crime that's the FBI's own numbers right exactly if
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.080]  people were guns are making a safer right if people were afraid that whoever
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:49.080]  they were going up to Rob or burglarize was armed you know they would I mean
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.600]  certainly think twice before going in you know committing these crimes they
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:56.240]  can have sure you know law-abiding sentences in the Metro Atlanta area
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:01.760]  wouldn't be terrorized by crime they should encourage people law-abiding
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:08.440]  citizens to have weapons absolutely Eric in closing did you say I mean I'd be
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.120]  laughing at these police and saying shame on you when they took me to jail for no
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.320]  reason I mean were you what did you say to him on the squad car I was we just
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.960]  talking cuz uh well I couldn't say too much because when he uh when we pulled
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.760]  off I said man why are you doing this I said just do the right thing you know
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.560]  you wrong you know you have no he said well it's not up to me anymore and he
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.680]  turned his music up all the way on full blast and took off flying down the road

[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.640]  alex jones
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:35.640]  all I know is this we have an authoritarian directive in Washington
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:39.760]  it's bipartisan because there's a lot of corruption going on they want a police
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.960]  state and it's up to all of us to to exercise our second amendment that's
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.560]  why I love the open carries that have not caused any problems nationwide like
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:53.840]  we had at the Alamo is because it shows hey it's not dirty that I have a gun and
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:01:00.360]  I liken it to Martin Luther King going into the places where you couldn't give
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:08.560]  you were black the bathrooms the hotels the the restaurants it's the same thing
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:11.960]  with an open carrier it's the same thing shooing when the police arrest you for
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.320]  your legal lawful gun you've got to do it ladies and gentlemen you've got to have
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:19.840]  these marches so in closing Eric anything else you'd like to add you're the
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:26.320]  victim of this the owner going out to their car and any other tidbits or points
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.680]  you think people should know about where this lawsuit's going now this federal
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:37.440]  lawsuit because the county's done nothing I like to say is just uh just be
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:41.880]  aware of the police out there and I don't know where it's going and we're
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:47.080]  trying to push and trying to push and trying to get something done but all I
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.840]  can say is just just pray for us we're trying to work we're trying to get
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:56.760]  something soft for this I mean I just saw the New York police chief came out
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.040]  and said trust us weren't you know we're your friends why are they having to talk
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:04.160]  like that because the police are being given political directives that are
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:08.840]  unconstitutional and aren't common law and aren't common sense the police are
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.920]  wildly popular when they have good departments and follow the bill of
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:17.600]  rights so the police you know you're saying again talking to your lawyer
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.640]  Shannon Braley you know both your police were Atlanta both your parents were
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:25.240]  Atlanta police so I'm you know growing up in that I know you probably have a
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:31.520]  lot of inside baseball on it right now happening here yeah I was an officer
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.600]  for seven years is you know a lot of times people in the community they
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.320]  will contact the city council and make complaints and then they'll complain to
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.640]  the the white shirts the upper echelon and they'll be like instead of thinking
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:48.800]  and having thoughtful dialogue with the officers they'll be like give me bodies
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:52.560]  give me bodies and you know this is again you know I have said before this is a
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.880]  job that requires thought like being a surgeon or or anything else it so you
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:02.080]  know this isn't putting on parts to machine in the factory it requires
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:05.360]  thought every single situation and they don't encourage that they just say give
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:11.160]  me bodies and you know I believe it's gonna take you know you know people you're
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.640]  bringing things like this to light that yes you know it's terrible to have crime
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:20.160]  and yes we want the bad guys to be arrested but not at the sacrifice of you
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:25.360]  know basic fundamental you know human rights we have but they knew we had a
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:28.280]  concealed carry I mean they knew he didn't have a criminal record they knew
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.360]  he was a good guy and they still just said okay instead of saying they were
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:34.800]  wrong which they weren't even wrong instead of just saying okay false alarm
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.040]  have a nice day they had to take him to jail it's that idea of well you know a
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.840]  lot of departments don't want to hire intelligent police now and that's
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:46.160]  because the establishment wants a tyranny exactly and you know he knew he
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:49.200]  was wrong that's why he turned up the radio in the way that the jail knew he
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.760]  was wrong he didn't want to kill guilty but you know Mr. Lee and you know they
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.120]  count on people get sweeping things under the rug so I can arrest is no big
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.800]  deal well it was a big deal for Eric and you know and it was a big deal they

[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:29.080]  my friends I've studied history it's not hard to do tyrants do the same things
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.840]  over and over again their playbooks actually pretty small and they call
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.800]  slavery different things but it's basically the same thing and we know
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.720]  that we're already deep into social engineering the collapse of society and
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.400]  I've been hammering at the last I don't know three four years it's been really
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:52.000]  obvious Obama's been in now for six years that he is becoming a dictator and
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.880]  I remember having Pastor David Manning on Pastor James David Manning I don't
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.320]  know six seven years ago when he's first talking about Obama and he was saying
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:05.120]  he's gonna become a dictator he's not gonna leave I tell you he's pure evil
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.920]  and I'm like come on he's just a front man to push their agenda presidents or
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:14.200]  puppets come on let's not come on that's gonna add to the division here we need
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.320]  to you know they're trying to sell him as the second coming of Christ and Abraham
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:22.720]  Lincoln all rolled into one but can't be that bad and now I've got to say that
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:28.680]  Manning has been correct and I have been wrong and under stating how bad Obama
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:33.240]  would be let me explain something he put our military under NATO UN command when
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.640]  Congress threatened even said this is unconstitutional and illegal he told he
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.160]  said on letters and had the Joint Chiefs testify belligerently that they're
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:44.880]  that they get their orders from the UN and NATO he played those that audio three
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.720]  separate hearings House and Senate Armed Services committees in the last three
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:54.640]  years three times he is shutting down what's over 500 now they're shut down
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.360]  500 more coal power plants that are totally clean supply 50 plus percent of
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:04.160]  our power well they did now plant supply like 30 something they're they're
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:08.400]  shutting us down and then General Electric can scale up and make more money
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:13.560]  they're exempt that's that's martial law he's legalizing all the illegals
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:17.880]  basically this is in the news by fiat without even an order he just tells them
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:23.200]  on the phone what to do like he's beyond Kim Jong-il of North Korea Kim Jong-un
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.600]  at least they'll even do a fake order on paper and put a fake stamp on he just
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  says hey my word is God God Emperor he's now doing it with Obamacare they're
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.280]  saying yes make him a dictator he'll fix it now Democrats are saying let's make
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.280]  him president for a third term or let's just suspend things or let's just and
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:44.480]  and it's a whole bunch of areas folks and they've gotten away with fast and
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:48.800]  furious the IRS persecuting Christians and gun groups and pro-lifers and the
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:53.960]  FBI covering it up and I mean it's been gauzey and fast and furious it goes on
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:11:03.120]  and on and on and on and then I realize Libya and invading Africa with UN
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:07.400]  armies that are just murdering people in mass backed by Muslims and animus
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:11.000]  killing Christians everywhere I mean if it's evil they're doing it they don't
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.880]  even do it for an interest now except a further evil again it's scary when you
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:19.360]  got corrupt boss hog politicians that do bad stuff for power but when they're
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:23.120]  doing it even though it's destroying Obama even though it's making him he
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:29.440]  be hated he they don't care because it is a mission to bankrupt America Obamacare
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.840]  all of it it is on record to bring this country down now the architect of it is
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:37.760]  E. K. Lemanual admits it so he joins us be a phone to the bottom of the hour with
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.640]  a quick pop in I want to get him for a full hour soon via video Skype from his
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:48.260]  otla TV studios there in Harlem where he actually tries to preach a message that's
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:53.600]  gonna get people out of the the plantation that is socialism and he
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.840]  feeds hundreds of children a day and others with their soup kitchens and he
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.040]  joins us right now so he's a really good guy pastor Manning thank you for
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.040]  coming on with us today sir well thank you for having me today real joy well
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:08.280]  pleasure thank you I mean you've got the floor for a little bit of time we've got
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:13.080]  he's he is a dictator now now the question is is he making the office of
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:18.440]  dictatorship will he leave but I think that we need to understand Obama and in
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.680]  terms of modern dictatorship but generally when we think about dictators
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.960]  like Hitler Mussolini or Lyndon or others we think about them using the
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:34.400]  military to deploy their policies and to keep people in control Obama has found
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:41.040]  the way to use an economic racial and social policies as if the military in
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:47.000]  other words what Obama does with his with these policies of economics with
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.600]  racism which is the undergirding of his pop of his presidency and then social
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.440]  issues which are anti-christian anti-god many of them very communist and
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:02.240]  very Marxist is his new army and so he's a modern dictated we have to think
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:08.080]  about him in those terms man you really are you really are smart to I mean the
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:14.000]  way you crystallize things that's it Obama is the modern 2.0 dictator oh
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.960]  absolutely and I think the next thing we need to begin to think about is what
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.880]  are we gonna do about him and in your opening piece you stated that I stated
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.640]  six years ago that he would not leave office and that he would become a
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.680]  dictator in fact he came in as a dictator what we need to think about now is how
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.760]  are we going to move him if we're going to save America how are we going to get
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:41.600]  him out of office because he has such power over the courts Alex I mean the
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.200]  very fact that Obamacare was approved by Judge Roberts in the case this man has
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:51.160]  power over the courts Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the courts so he could
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.720]  get his policies through all Obama has to do is pick up the phone and his
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:59.040]  policies are approved so how are we going to get him out of office what are
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:04.600]  we going to do we can't rely upon the the Republicans or the Conservatives or
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.240]  whoever it is that is supposed to be opposing him because they're not doing
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.760]  that if we're going to save this nation and stop Obama from crashing it and do
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.640]  what he wants to do with it we have to start thinking about strategies and not
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.480]  relying upon the electoral system or the Republicans or the media which is the
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:29.720]  other part of his government to be able to save America very well said and I
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:32.480]  think we've got to communicate to people that it's a modern form of
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:36.760]  technocratic dictatorship and I was thinking they were setting up
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:41.360]  dictatorial divisions and systems so that the office could be dictatorial but
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:45.560]  it they are acting like they don't care what we think now and that and that they
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.760]  are trying to bring the country down and bankrupt it so that he can then pose as
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.800]  a savior how do you expect him to try to stay in office because for the first
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.920]  time I'm starting to think that may be the plan well I suspect that he's most
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:01.720]  probably going to have some sort of a false flag I think he's gonna need
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.080]  martial law he's gonna need the military in order to be able to stay in
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.040]  office and and there's no telling what it'll do in terms of some sort of a
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:15.320]  false flag that he'll create maybe a crisis within America some sort of a
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.520]  possible racial crisis while I don't think that might be it on the other hand
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.320]  Alex the thing that we have to be very mindful of is that there are large
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.200]  number of Americans who are ready now to revolt and they very well may give him
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:37.040]  what he wants on the other hand we need a revolution at this station so we want
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.640]  to be like let's enter concord we want to work to not let it get physical and
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:46.160]  win the info war the the war of ideas but if they start stuff I think we
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:53.080]  should be more you know Christ like and and at key points we should be so
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:56.840]  Christ like unless we're gonna be the Christ of the sword that I preach on
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.520]  the most part I think well let me just finish the statement let me just finish
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:03.560]  the statements you know where I'm coming from okay I'm saying I'm saying we
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:09.840]  have to wait for the right time to where it morally they fire first and then we
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.960]  have the moral high ground we don't want them to trick us into something
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.720]  preemptive the problem is they'll blow up another federal building like okay see
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:20.680]  the same attorney general was deputy then clearly involved to then blame it on
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.320]  the liberty movement so I understand I understand that we may have to defend
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.440]  ourselves my problem is is that they may blow something up and blame it on us so
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.760]  the last thing we want to do is offensively do anything go ahead we
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:36.960]  definitely don't want that to happen you don't want them to blame us 9 11 or
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:41.200]  to some of the event or the Oklahoma event that we don't want to have happen
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:47.400]  well we also have to think about Alex is that Obama controls the economy he
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.560]  controls Wall Street so we're gonna need economic power not just military power
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.200]  or revolutionary power we need economic power and that's the thing that we're
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.080]  lacking most in I mean all of America's arm to the teeth people all over America
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:06.120]  that are ready to rise up if they have to to save this nation not because the
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.320]  belligerent not because they hate the nation not because they just war
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:13.200]  mongering but they realize that we need to be able to save this nation
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.520]  militarily but the problem is this is that we don't have the kind of economic
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:24.320]  power or the media power to be able to withstand a Obama attack which is what
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.720]  he's doing now so how do we get that to get how do we do that is the question I
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.200]  think you're right people better support alternative real media like
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.080]  never before whether it's what you're doing at OTTLA and we're gonna give that
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:41.480]  side out in just a moment and we'll put it up on screen or info wars or drudge
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:45.400]  or any other sites in fact Richard you scroll down so I can put his side up on
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:53.920]  the air for folks it's OTTLA dot ORG ATLAH dot ORG is an excellent site and we
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:56.440]  need to do that I think we need to just get the word out but I'll tell you this
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.240]  I was talking to an Army officer just yesterday I'll just leave it at that and
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.800]  he said 98% of the military knows what's going on now now just six months
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:09.800]  ago he said it was about 80% he said 98% know that there's an attempt to
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.280]  overthrow the country and to bring in tyranny I think we need to get the word
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:17.640]  out that we're not alone and that we but but we're not connected because we don't
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:24.000]  have the media and we don't have the the the financial system so it's it's
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.360]  really a bizarre situation almost like a Mexican standoff well I think we're
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.280]  gonna have to attack the media as the first line of Obama defense the media
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:39.200]  serves as his pawns or as his bishops we're gonna have to go after the media
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.320]  we're gonna support media like you and I'm not patronizing you Alex but we're
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.560]  gonna have to begin to listen to sources like you and other sources that are out
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:53.560]  there but we're gonna have to attack as the first line of defense all of the
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:57.040]  media whether it's conservative or liberal media they all do the exact same
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:02.200]  thing and when we can bring them down we can stop the disinformation campaign
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.240]  because people are sitting there in their comfort comfortable chairs listen
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:09.520]  to Fox News thinking that somehow another Mitt Romney or somebody else is
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:13.360]  gonna overthrow Obama and we're gonna get America back we've got to take down
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.520]  that part of Obama's profits I got to attack him and then we can go after him
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:23.640]  economically no you're right it's the idea the loyal opposition when the when
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:27.520]  those guys are all part of the same power structure and they're also scared I
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.040]  mean those big people it's really hard people that are already part of the
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:34.960]  system to stand up but look at how they're going to for Ted Cruz and Rand
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:40.480]  Paul you can always tell who's real by who they attack absolutely can and I
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:45.600]  think that if we began to work on that strategy and look at how the politicians
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:48.740]  are attacked and look at what Fox News does or what the liberal or whatever the
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:54.760]  MPC does if we began to consider that if we're going to have a revolution let's
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:00.160]  do it the way Obama has taken the nation stay there far yeah this is intriguing
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:04.480]  master-manning amazing the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:09.880]  staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in

[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.000]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.800]  right thing and encourage salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:29.120]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:34.120]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:29.800]  Manning joining us for part of the next when we have a bunch of big news I've
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:34.120]  got to get to but I tell you if I lived in Harlem I know whose church I'd be
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.880]  going to if we had more preachers in this country like pastor Manning we
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:41.320]  would not be in the shape we are people have just become so complacent they've
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:45.120]  got to find their spirit of resistance before things really go to hell in a
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:49.720]  handbasket because Homeland Security all of these top generals and colonels at
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:53.560]  the Navy War College the Army War College you name it West Point we have
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:57.200]  links to it up on info wars.com are saying we're preparing for war with gun
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.560]  owners we're going to come after you we will take your gun from your cold dead
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:04.080]  hand and the military is totally waking up because they're being told prepare for
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.360]  war with America so I think they've miscalculated I mean the military is not
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:15.040]  afraid to go to war and I mean the military people I know that are
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:20.240]  multi-generation military are the most honorable people in my family and let me
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:23.680]  say they're not looking for a fight folks they're very sad about everything but now
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:29.480]  the resolve is beginning to be okay it's going to be a civil war just feel sorry
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:32.080]  for the police and all the idiots they're gonna be part of the new world
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:36.680]  order who want to have this civil war I mean look at this headline Colonel who
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:40.360]  vowed to disarm Americans works with Homeland Security he teaches at West
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:46.000]  Point and it says of violating Colonel also made veiled death threats against
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.720]  bloggers well my goodness if you read his article in Esquire it sounds like a
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:54.760]  little kid like oh yeah we'll kill you we got the army we're big we're tough I
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:58.440]  mean this is obviously somebody who I don't think seeing a lot of combat or
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:02.680]  he's nuts because all the combat vets I know and I mean special forces people I
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:06.080]  mean people that have been in 28 years and seen stuff you I mean just
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.720]  unbelievable they would never I mean I know people that you know that have
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:15.120]  worked in and around the boys from Virginia and I don't mean the CIA the
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:20.520]  Virginia boys are like plain clothes military above Delta Force and and all
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:23.840]  I can pass remaining I've got you here to talk we got four minutes till break
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.280]  I'm gonna shut up you hear what I'm saying this is getting so bad do you
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:33.640]  think Obama's bit off more than he can chew or do you think that this is part
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:38.280]  of the plan well absolutely not he has not been of more than he can chew and I
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:43.920]  think his plan is at place and working right now perfectly the problem is that
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:48.680]  we've got to deal with is that we're into we're in the game very late and if
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.200]  there is a military coup I know there are many generals and people within the
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.000]  military who recognize what's happening to this nation would love to be able to
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.880]  save it but I don't think they're going to get the kind of support that they
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:06.320]  need in order to be able to do it and I don't think that a coup in the
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.600]  military would deliver us from the economic power that Obama is possessing
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.080]  and there's another thing that I that we're not observing as well in terms of
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.680]  the social and racial issue I'm becoming very concerned about Obama's
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:25.080]  alliance with Pope Francis I'm very concerned about them walking along the
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.600]  same social if you will liberal path that destroys the integrity of the word of
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.160]  God and puts these two powers together Alex I'm very concerned about that and
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:43.960]  whether a military response can handle where we are right now I hear you no I'm
[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:47.720]  just we're just I can't believe that the president has become a dictator and
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:51.200]  they're starting to have a few hearings but it's still not a big deal I mean
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.760]  because this is what happens historically countries get to where they put up
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:01.120]  with evil and then we empower the dictator to become a Hitler or a Mao
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:05.520]  Pastor Manning do you think we can turn this around I'm confident that we can't
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:09.360]  but we must take with my knowledge of what I said just a few moments ago we're
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:12.840]  late to the game but we have the majority on our side we have the
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.240]  morality on our side we have all of the issues that we need on our side we just
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:20.360]  need to acknowledge what they are put together a plan
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:23.960]  Obama has been planning this with the New World Order and other three years we
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:27.840]  are late to the game we're just getting in here but we can win and we can win
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:31.920]  handily there's no way we should be defeated so yes but we need to get
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:35.960]  started we need to get started immediately if not beyond before that
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:41.240]  well you say you you know not use their tactics but but beat them know in
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:44.680]  their game what I mean what's your idea well first of all as I said before we
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.320]  got to take down the media Alex I mean we have got to take down what I refer to
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.520]  as the tonguehead media because they've got people pacified into thinking that
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:58.160]  Washington Republicans or whoever politicians are going to solve our
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.040]  problems we got to stop people from thinking that wake them up to the fact
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:06.200]  that they need to get into the streets not necessarily with arms or with margin
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:11.600]  but they need to get into the program of looking at what can we do economically
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.440]  socially and racially to bring this nation back together again and once they
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:19.000]  recognize that Washington is not going to solve it that it must be done by
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.200]  grassroots movement at least we'll have a start at that present time and what
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:28.480]  we'll also discover is that Obama's power is not as as great as one would
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:33.840]  think that it is if the people that know the truth sure they rise up sure well
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:37.160]  somebody can kick your butt if you lay down and let them absolute we just we
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:39.760]  just got to stand up I want to come back and go over some issues with you and
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.480]  pick your brain because I tell you you're just really a smart guy and I mean
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:49.640]  that seriously pastor Manning is really saw stuff long before I did on this
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:55.360]  issue of Obama we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:04.480]  GCN radio network in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our

[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.840]  right thing and encourage salt producers to add iodine it's the good

[02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:04.800]  888-253-3139 a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:08.680]  even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:13.200]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:16.440]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:21.600]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:26.240]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:31.000]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:36.400]  perfect song for Obama go tell that midnight rider tell the rambler the
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:41.560]  gambler the backbiter tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:49.120]  you can see the masterly evil of the establishment grooming Obama we now
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:55.120]  know from a very young age just like it's out of a horror movie where they're
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:01.160]  grooming you know the antichrist it's rosemary's baby it really is the stuff
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:08.600]  of legend how his whole family CIA pastor Manning's at the CIA and FBI come
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:14.000]  to his office and threaten him we've had the same thing FBI Secret Service you
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.800]  name it all sorts of things behind the scenes I mean the minute the minute they
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:21.600]  can folks they want to come after everybody and basically force a civil
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:28.880]  war that's probably going to be their plan and we just need to not have it
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:33.880]  happen and again it sounds real wimpy on air to say you know I don't want a
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:38.880]  military coup or I think we should lay down to an attack by these people this
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:45.520]  isn't about a military fight if we don't respond when they attack us in the first
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:50.640]  wave of a purge even with a controlled press the message will get out that they
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:55.040]  did it but here's the deal they're not gonna do that if they try a purge they
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:00.120]  will blow up federal buildings filled with daycare children we know the names
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:03.960]  of who did Oklahoma City I've interviewed the police officers the head of the
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.520]  canine unit Don Browning from Oklahoma City he knew the feds did it they came
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:11.840]  to his office he's listed their names on air and so we're gonna kill you and your
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.680]  wife you don't shut up by the way I got death threats when I had him on but I
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:21.680]  mean the real ones because you know the people that did that run the justice
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:24.960]  department right now and again I literally it's like stepping on the edge
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:28.800]  of a cliff whenever I get on air and talk about this kind of stuff okay I
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:34.160]  mean I so when I say we need to have restraint it's not that I'm not willing
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:40.200]  to get in a fight it's not gonna hurt the New World Order to have a shootout
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:44.640]  with the state police we've got before we're gonna kill these people we really
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:47.440]  need to go out and try to wake them up that's the point and that's what
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:53.000]  Manning's getting at is we have got to absolutely reach out to police and
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.760]  military right now the military is really woken up police are starting to
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:00.040]  but they kind of pick them to where they'll follow orders so that they see
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:03.240]  the rest of the story and get uncompartimentalized not now Manning
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:06.120]  Pastor Manning I want to give you the last six seven minutes here you've got
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.400]  the floor don't pause for me any other ideas how we turn this around where you
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:16.400]  see this going you know how we how I mean maybe citizens that are at Obama
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:20.920]  events yell out things I mean little stuff like you're a liar in Congress we
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:24.120]  don't know there's all sorts of little things that could that could bring down
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:29.560]  the facade well we talk about a coup in the military a confrontation we have to
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:34.000]  keep in mind that Obama comes from a very violent background though he tries to
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.760]  present himself as the boy next door Obama's the product of Bill Ayers and
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:42.960]  Bernadine Dorn and all that weather on the underground crowd he comes from a
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:48.600]  very violent background keep that in mind his associate with the association
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.800]  with Islam is very violent but I think in terms of strategy Alex one of the
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:58.640]  things that we would probably would look at and after we take down the media
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:01.640]  and we need to do that because without that we're going to be continually be
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:07.120]  beat by Obama we need to go after Obamacare that is McKinley's heel it's a
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.640]  massive tax program that's unconstitutional that's socialist that's
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:18.040]  communist at his core but he needs young people to be able to register and be a
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:23.200]  part of that process if young people don't register Obamacare falls apart
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:28.240]  now the whole business with the rollout and the fact that the computer did not
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.240]  work they're going to get that together at some point time but if we can go out
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.480]  launch a national campaign with a broadcast such as yours and others to
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:43.040]  reach young people that they don't sign up that they're not cowed into signing
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:47.880]  up for Obamacare if that can happen and the whole thing falls apart because at
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:51.920]  that point Obama would not have the financing to be able to keep Obamacare
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:57.080]  alive and what he'll have to do at that point is do something more dictatorial
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.720]  than he's doing right now so I would suggest that what we would do with
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:06.200]  number one is take down the media number two is take down Obamacare and doing
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:11.800]  it through the people pardon me doing it through the young people who don't want
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:17.120]  Obamacare and then then turning them around against him because they were all
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.880]  for him at one point in time but not anymore and then definitely not gonna
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:25.080]  sign up for Obamacare if we do those two things at least we'll begin to put a
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:30.480]  crack in his armor and educate the people and we can take him down
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:36.240]  economically the way he's trying to take us down economically socially again you
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:39.360]  pause for me interject but everything you're saying is just spot-on with the
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.080]  research and great ideas and I just thank God for your leadership and many
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:46.760]  others and I wish there were more people out there who understood all these
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:51.280]  different nuances because it's scary to know people are waking up but that
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.920]  there's not that many prominent people that are willing to come up with a
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:00.120]  battle plan but let me ask you this question I've noticed evil loves to
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:04.880]  betray its own minions historically and I don't understand that as a as a person
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:08.920]  that doesn't know betrayal I don't like betraying even people that are enemies
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:13.920]  and bad in fact crushing them it feels like a betrayal even though I've not
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:17.760]  betraying them I'm standing up for myself but with Obama he loves I mean I
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.240]  here's an example Barton Springs I went down there two months ago you know to the
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:24.680]  big open pool they got like 20 lifeguards one of the biggest natural
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.320]  pools in the US spring fed and one after the other they walked over and
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:33.600]  apologized and they said I thought you were wrong about Obamacare they just
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:37.800]  cut me from 40 hours to 20 and they take more money out of my check now and
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:42.920]  I'm I work another job and I go to UT and I eat ramen noodle my parents are
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.840]  poor I don't have any money they're taking like $50 more out of my check
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:52.960]  like you said they lied on the news and I and I everywhere these poor Obama
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.480]  people apologize how could the communist even betray their own idiot
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:00.920]  followers and I'm not trying to be mean but it's just how do you hurt poor
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:04.680]  people like this and how does he think he'll get away with that I think the
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:07.960]  thing we have to always keep in focus about communism and socialism and
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:13.520]  Marxism and Islam is that it has never worked there is no nation on the planet
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:19.000]  where it has worked where it's proven to win the love of the people where we in
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.360]  a democracy and capitalism here love our nation for what it is most communist
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:28.800]  people that are at the bottom of the communist rung don't care for communism
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:31.960]  and want to get out from underneath it and it takes the military to keep
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.920]  communism going so I think that when we look at what Obama is trying to do with
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.920]  the New World Order thinks that they can accomplish how well they're using more
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:43.840]  hot technology now than they've used and perhaps a mousy tongue or and Lenin's
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:48.720]  communism we're going to have to recognize that communism really at the
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.800]  heart of the matter of what people doesn't work so how do we get the
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:57.600]  message out rather than talking about a different political ideal such as a
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.200]  Republican versus a Democrat we've got to tell people about the the ills of
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:08.080]  communism we got to go into and I think our fourth program would be we've got to
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.440]  get into the universities and then to the schools because that's where they're
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:15.680]  indoctrinating our young people into thinking that communism is a good thing
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:20.560]  and the Obama's programs a good thing so we have to do these basic things we
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:26.640]  win if we don't do them we definitely lose well I want to be clear I mean when
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.560]  you see how Obama tries to take the radical Islamist al-Qaeda people from
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.720]  Saudi Arabia and to inject them into Syria for two and a half years and then
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:39.400]  call that peace I mean it really does show that this particular elite we have
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:43.600]  I mean look how the NFL promotes him look at how the whole system's giving
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.600]  their power to him showing the power structures behind him do you think Obama's
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:52.240]  paying off the way they thought because as you said if Obama cares blowing up
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:55.560]  in their face well they knew it was gonna blow up in the face so he's got to
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:59.480]  become a dictator because because his whole agenda is gonna backfire they're
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:04.480]  gonna end up losing a whole generation to believing in communism because
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.760]  they're giving him a taste of it before before they have full dictatorship in
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:13.040]  well if you look at the stock market when Obamacare is blowing up in its face
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:18.360]  but if you look at the stock market he is greatly rewarding people that have
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:22.680]  invested in him if you're talking about major people in movies or in business
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:27.960]  and entrepreneurship they are reaping great rewards the greatest in the
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.240]  history of this nation they reaping their financial rewards as what's
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.920]  supporting him but they're just a small percentage of the population and they're
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:41.960]  not in control but they are and it's in fiat devalue dollars and and and it's
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:46.440]  not gonna be worth anything it's all a fraud it's all hot air but that's true
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:49.840]  that's true and I think those the American people need to wake up and
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:53.680]  began to end of course prepare themselves for when the financial collapse
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:58.120]  comes and it will come whether Obama's in power or not that's coming and that
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:02.800]  will be another opportunity once the financial collapse comes for those of
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.640]  us who cannot be on the battlefield to take the power take the power reigns at
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:10.400]  that time when the economy is weak and people who have depended on their
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:15.640]  billions to be able to give them power we have power by our commitment we have
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.840]  power by our love for this nation we have the power by our love for one
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:24.480]  another that's our power and we're rich in the billions of that and we want to
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.720]  use it as much as we possibly can I agree I can feel your power of
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:33.360]  Pastor Manning because you have love and I can hear it and see it in other
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.040]  people's voices I just feel sad for the average person doesn't seem to have any
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:40.800]  discernment I mean you could take one look at Obama and tell he's a devil I
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:44.680]  just didn't know how bad what in your spirit told you six seven years ago or
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:49.080]  even longer that Obama was so bad yeah we remember I was on your show very
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:53.360]  early on and talking to you about Obama being the son of faith and a lot of
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:56.720]  people calling me anti-christ and that will work you certainly won't want to
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.240]  throw that out but Obama is inherently evil when you listen to what he is
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:06.840]  saying over against a reality of where we are as the people you know that he is
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:12.480]  lying and that he is lying profusely Obama did this one thing Alex he
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:17.720]  promised the world not just America but he promised the world what they wanted
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.160]  to hear and knew that he could not deliver it he promised the world you were
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:26.560]  gonna have peace and you're gonna have prosperity we're gonna have a unity of
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:30.080]  the people we're gonna bring all the nations to the table we're gonna have a
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:33.800]  unity between Muslims and Jews we're gonna have a unity between blacks and
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:39.320]  whites we're gonna have a wealth where everybody has got wealth and power and
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:44.680]  prosperity he promised that not just to America but to the world and that's why
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:48.200]  people fail for him but the the opposite of that is to look at that and know that
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:53.560]  he can't deliver that he cannot so he's lying why would he deliver the opposite
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:58.640]  he delivered the opposite absolutely and that's not that's my point I knew
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:04.480]  that's exactly what he was going to do so we have to recognize that anyone that
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:08.200]  would lie like that to the American people into the world has to be
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:13.040]  ultimately evil so that he can take away their liberties take away their
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:19.360]  freedom take away their economic base so when you see Obama when I saw him six
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:22.680]  years ago in that perspective and talking to things he was and saying the
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.800]  things he was saying and denying what I knew to be the truth about him it was
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.560]  very easy to see how evil he was and how people were people were searching for
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:35.760]  it looking for and you got also realized that George Bush was such a disaster
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:41.120]  that they were looking for anything to bring them up out of the but look at
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.240]  how now now that I pull back I see the elite behind this but it's even it's
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:49.560]  even more than they could orchestrate the way it was all orchestrated perfectly
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.400]  it really is satanic everything we've seen has been orchestrated as you know
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:58.160]  the Bible talks about the mystery of evil how it works so well together and
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.680]  and you can really now see on Obama a super evil design one of the most evil
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:08.520]  I've ever even heard of in history with a high-tech integration and I shudder to
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:12.800]  think what we're going to see out of this figurehead and you know out of this
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:18.960]  production out of everything behind him out of all the evil behind him I wish
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:21.800]  you would send me the clip of what you just said I love to play on our
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:27.600]  broadcast every day because it puts succinctly what we need to be aware of
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.960]  now that you've said that and that then you demonstrated that true how do we
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.280]  educate the people how do we get out there and tell the people we're still
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.480]  hoping against hope that Obama's going to change that he's going to make the
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:44.280]  world a great place even though they see themselves without jobs they see
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:47.600]  themselves losing their employment there at their their income they see
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:51.640]  themselves losing their family losing their children losing this nation and
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.640]  yet they're still hoping that somehow another that he is going to do what he
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.680]  promised six years ago how do we educate people that the small clip you just
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:04.520]  said just a few moments ago well you look at it he's dangling again that
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:09.320]  that it's coming hopes around the corner give me more power I'll fix it and then
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:12.840]  they consciously try to wreck the country it's not like they're screwing
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:16.880]  things up on accident they want to screw it up you know they're doing I guess you
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.840]  just explained to people that you better follow your gut in your heart and your
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.400]  eyes I mean the thing is it's all right there and I think people are afraid of
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:28.560]  the responsibility they want to like you said earlier think that the
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:31.760]  Republicans are going to save them and they better figure out that praying to
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:36.440]  God is going to save them because if people pray to God and repent and get
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:41.440]  on their knees and and and and seek a reprieve of the nation then God will
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:46.120]  change their heart and give them discernment and rise them up in little
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.840]  ways but also in big ways depending on who you are where you're at and together
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:54.080]  just like evil works through Obama and his people we have to ask God to use us
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:59.160]  as vessels against them in this battle but God knows there's free will so
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:02.600]  gives us free will the devil manipulates against free will we have to
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.240]  consciously and spiritually ask God to cleanse us and use us and sanctify us
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:13.840]  every day and and put on the armor against the enemy doesn't have been in
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:17.400]  the Bible where there were two profit the prophet Elijah and had a young
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:23.040]  protege working with him and they were surrounded by a mighty army that were
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:27.080]  outside of the canyon where they were at and getting ready to come in to kill
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:32.600]  the prophet at the young man and the prophet was the young boy said they're
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.920]  going to kill us they're going to kill us the prophet prayed that the young boy's
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:41.880]  eyes would be open so he could see the mighty host of angels that were standing
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:45.600]  there to protect him against that mighty army and the angels are really going to
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:49.840]  win over power that army what you have just said and what we've got to do is
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:54.760]  that we've got to pray that God will open the eyes of the people so they can
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:49:01.680]  see how evil Obama is and and and you may mention of the 72nd Chronicles 714 if
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:07.480]  we if we pray and repent that God will heal our land but beyond that I am
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:12.160]  convinced Alex that if we launch a campaign of praying for people that
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:18.520]  God would open their eyes when they see Obama they will see unadulterated evil
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:24.200]  in its purest and most evil form there's never been anybody in America in
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:31.400]  leadership as evil is this man is and of course his beauty dazzles everybody and
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:35.120]  so therefore they're not able to get to the core of who he is spiritually
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:40.520]  people's eyes just need to be open to how evil this man is that has taken over
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.440]  our nation and is seeking to destroy but I will say this I know we're gonna win
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:50.480]  God has not established this yes Pastor Manning to give it to Obama I just
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.160]  lost audio to the network can you guys hear me yes we can hear you Alex yeah
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:57.840]  Pastor Manning is still on yes I'm still here yes go ahead and finish up
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:01.320]  Pastor Manning he said that we are going to win and I agree with you I think we
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:06.640]  are going to win but God's not going to give this nation over to Obama even
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:10.240]  though many people are asserting that well but we've been so wicked we've you
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:14.600]  know we've disavowed God God's turned us over to a reprobate nation but no
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:18.920]  that's not the case at all we are going through some struggles right now but we
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.960]  will not lose this great nation we will lose this pinnacle of power and
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:29.280]  presentation of God on this planet we will win well well Pastor Manning I
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:32.200]  think this is the most powerful interview I've ever done with you or heard
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.520]  period I think definitely the spirit of the Lord's with us today let's just
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:39.760]  agree together and I'll have you back soon that that we should both to our
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:44.200]  audiences promote praying that the eyes of America and the world be open and
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:48.120]  that we say that prayer and I know I'll say that during the break I know you'll
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:51.720]  say it Pastor Manning thank you so you know will you stay there and come back
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:55.880]  and say a prayer on air in the final segment yeah I can do that I will okay
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:58.680]  and the show's over in 10 minutes so we're gonna come back he'll say the
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:02.120]  prayer and then I'll hit a few final news stories with David Knight

[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:49.120]  eyes of the people open their eyes Lord that they might see this awful evil that
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:54.080]  is now seated in Washington at the White House and then open their hearts
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:57:00.080]  Almighty God and give them the courage to be able to stand up for truth and to
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:05.480]  stand up for the unborn and to stand up for those that have worked so hard to
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:11.000]  make this great nation what it is to stand up for those that are being maligned
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:17.480]  by and and and duped and pimped by Obama open their eyes and their ears and stuff
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.120]  their hearts full of courage that we might march forward and we are praising
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.480]  you right now for the victory for we know we will not lose but we most
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:30.320]  assuredly will win and the day that you have set aside and you're named Jesus we
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:36.320]  pray amen and amen amen absolutely and that's why that particular preacher that
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.040]  had his own prayer breakfast and mildly criticized Obama they audited him and
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.520]  came after him and it came out that it was ordered and it just shows they're
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:49.360]  afraid of true men of God true women of God who follow that and folks you know
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:54.760]  this is not a preacher show but in great times of evil we have to just get

[02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:33.000]  pyramid and and at the same time he's taking them down with Obamacare he's
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.960]  also putting on saying that he's further their minimum wage being wage explain

[02:59:57.480 --> 03:00:01.720]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:20.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:24.000]  Alex Jones
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:29.080]  show you bring an Obama care that raises the payroll tax on the poorest
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:35.320]  people makes companies have to lay people off or cut from 40 to 20 hours and
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:40.920]  then you raise the minimum wage because you've devalued the dollar but then that
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:45.640]  just makes everybody have to lay folks off it is such a genius plan then you
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:52.480]  go on welfare and then they keep cutting the welfare but the amount you get so
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:56.080]  then you can't even live on that and then you go well give me higher taxes on
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:59.920]  people that do have money even though that could never actually pay for things
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:03.000]  if you do the math David now you were trying to make a point when the break
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.720]  came yeah and it's beyond that even now they're talking about 27 billion dollars
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:12.040]  in new gas taxes that they're going to that's gonna hit the working poor very
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:15.440]  hard and then of course and tracker switches in the cars we told you that
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:18.400]  was coming in that's right they'll add that in addition so you'll still have
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:21.640]  your gas taxes there but then they're going to add an additional transportation
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:26.680]  tax to everybody and then you've got the secret economic nuclear bomb that he's
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:30.240]  going to hit the working poor with and that's a trans-pacific partnership that's
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:33.640]  his goal to do that by the end of the year it's on a fast track so he's doing
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.520]  these things to the people who are suffering and these people who are
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.920]  out there striking as fast food workers and other people who need more of a
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:44.520]  minimum need more wages they are in a very difficult situation but they
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:48.080]  don't understand what's going on and that's why when pastor Manning was
[03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:51.500]  talking about having their eyes open that's what's really important that they
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:54.560]  understand and see what's going on behind this that they're not going to be
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:58.920]  any better off if somebody just gives them more pieces of paper well sure let's
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:02.960]  say you pay an employee $15 an hour you're really last time I did the math
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:08.040]  paying them like $21 an hour with all the FICA and fees and unemployment
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:10.840]  insurance everything else so if you're paying somebody $20 an hour it's more
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:14.360]  like $29 an hour that's right so somebody's getting like $10 an hour it's
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:17.640]  like 12 or 13 people just don't know and then what you do is you just lay
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:23.120]  people off I mean it is just it is unbelievable it's all scientifically
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:28.080]  done it's so frustrating we never go ahead a lot of stuff is hidden just like
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:31.920]  you're talking about the hidden cost go ahead David when you see the FICA the
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:35.800]  social security withdrawals on your paycheck you only see half of it the
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:38.400]  employers paying the other half directly to the government they don't want you to
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:42.080]  see the full cost of your FICA of course the employer sees it self-employed
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:46.040]  people see it but in the same way they want to pretend to make a big show out
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:49.040]  of saying we're going to help you by giving you more dollars when you're
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:52.360]  purchasing power is not going to go up people are going to still have to cover
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:57.320]  their expenses Obama's never run anything he's just put out mandates and he can't
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:02.360]  even produce a website even with $600 million he can't put out a website so
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:06.760]  he's never had any experience having to run something having to pay me to payroll
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:10.360]  anybody that's had a business you know this as well Alex you know many times
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:13.120]  you'll have to go where the business owner who's invested his money invested
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:18.800]  his time will have to not take a pay it will have to go without pay sometimes
[03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:23.800]  just to make ends meet until he can well well sure well exactly I mean for
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:30.240]  about a year I made the decision losing money to spend emergency capital that we
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:33.800]  put in a business account and then I launched some stuff to be able to get
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:37.760]  plenty of capital and to continue and expand to people support us but I love
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:40.760]  folks out there you know the enemies thing is that anybody at a free market
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:44.000]  you know how dare you sell things to have you know your own free and independent
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.920]  media it's better to just get government bailout money like MSNBC or
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:53.160]  or taxpayer money like NPR it's almost 500 million a year last time I checked
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:57.720]  it's so screwed up the idea that we're not supposed to actually pay for things
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:01.520]  ourselves and run our own operations people have no idea what it's like to be
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:06.920]  a quote business owner I mean we're a mission of liberty but but I have to
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.080]  run a business to pay for things and people don't know what it's like to have
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:12.840]  the bureaucrats come into your office they don't know what it's like to be
[03:04:12.840 --> 03:04:15.440]  harassed they don't know what it's like to be audited they don't know what it's
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.680]  like to be screwed with constantly and we don't whine about it on air cuz it
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:23.120]  to me it's like a game I mean the more people attack me the more energy I get
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:26.600]  it can be seven o'clock at night and somebody attacks me makes stuff up I
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:31.320]  just suddenly have all this new energy and God's giving me that gift but we're
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:34.720]  not gonna give up it's important to support info wars.com it's important to
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:40.520]  get the products at info wars life.com, info wars health.com, info wars store.com
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:43.880]  different lines on all those sites and I didn't get to all the news we didn't get
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:48.840]  to the Japan news they're talking about fascism in their parliament in their
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:53.960]  government area and the nightly news is seven o'clock tonight and I'll be back
