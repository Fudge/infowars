[00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.979]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:22.303]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:27.687]  Well, we've got the masters of puppets, the globalists, the neocons, the controlled globalists left.
[00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:30.879]  Openly trying to maneuver the U.S.
[00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.340]  into war with Russia.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:50.246]  And when you saw last Friday, here in our time zone, last Saturday morning in the Middle East, when you saw those strikes, the 100-plus cruise missiles, slamming into their targets and 2,000-pound bombs being dropped on their targets by V-1 bombers, I said, listen,
[00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.502]  Trump has reversed himself on everything he said about Syria.
[00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:55.702]  He knows what's going on there.
[00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:58.623]  He knows the rebels have staged chemical attacks before.
[00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:00.324]  He's tweeted about it.
[00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:04.025]  The Russians warned a month before that that was happening.
[00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.106]  And it was going to happen again.
[00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.146]  The Russians were pulling out.
[00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:08.227]  Trump was pulling out.
[00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:09.987]  Peace was breaking out.
[00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:12.828]  And I said, mark my words.
[00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:14.949]  The hawks will take this as weakness.
[00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.110]  And they will have the fake polling agencies claim the President's polls are up.
[00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:28.970]  And they will start pushing for more military strikes, more sanctions on Russia, to push Russia into some type of response.
[00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.334]  And now Russia is saying that they are looking at responses.
[00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:37.178]  Daily Express reports cyber war alert as Russia hits back.
[00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:39.840]  Who knows if any of that's true.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.122]  Came out in the Vault 7.
[00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:55.747]  If you remember, just last year, CIA leaked documents that they were already using computer programs to frame foreign countries for attacking the US.
[00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:57.708]  But I'll be clear, I'm patriotic.
[00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:58.668]  That's why I've supported Trump.
[00:01:58.668 --> 00:01:59.988]  He is a nationalist.
[00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:01.629]  He's been bringing the country back.
[00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.830]  I'm still glad Trump's in office.
[00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.113]  So when I got mad Friday night, it was because emotionally Mattis had come out and said, we don't have any proof.
[00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:13.093]  We're probably not going to go to war.
[00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:17.843]  And then hours later, you saw that happen.
[00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:23.005]  I had gone home Friday thinking that, good, Trump's still Trump.
[00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.307]  And when it happened, there's the emotion of, we'll rush to strike back.
[00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:28.648]  Well, they didn't.
[00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:33.751]  So now the neocons and others say, must be John Bolton, I guess, advising the president.
[00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.172]  Things sure changed after he got in a few weeks ago.
[00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:36.813]  Bombs away.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.322]  That suddenly, now we've got to have conflict with Russia.
[00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:50.747]  This is really bad, at an intellectual level, at an instinctive gut level, at a spiritual level, we can all feel it.
[00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:55.509]  And so, it's my horror at, is the President being turned?
[00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:05.775]  That said, you see the accelerating combing, with all the corruption he's been involved in, and covering up the Clinton Crime Network, and his whole family voting for Hillary, and him praising Hillary.
[00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:14.140]  And ABC News and NBC News, they'll call him totally non-partisan and, oh, the good boy!
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.942]  Just look at those psychotic eyes.
[00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:20.045]  Look at that con man's eyes, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:25.289]  He makes the skin on the back of your neck crawl, looks like a serial killer.
[00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:33.396]  And it's not just how he looks, with that predator's eyes, smiling and trained to not look vicious, but it just oozes out the corruption.
[00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:47.418]  Mueller can't even hide it, he's just a raving power-mad, raging narcissist loon that covered up all the crimes of the Clintons, of George W., of the NWO.
[00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:52.783]  Mueller, brought in by the Deep State right after 9-11, one week after they cover everything up.
[00:03:52.783 --> 00:04:02.030]  Brennan, all of them completely delusional, megalomaniacs, and the left and the globalists in Hollywood.
[00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.012]  Mueller is the Deep State's president.
[00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.309]  Yes.
[00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:29.604]  To these people, because they're never going to stop.
[00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:33.670]  Trump's a symbol of nationalism and resistance now.
[00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.537]  They will destroy him, for sure, if he becomes compromised and starts working with them.
[00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:42.799]  And this whole Syria thing is a big sign of that direction.
[00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.381]  I get the calculus of doing it to scare North Korea.
[00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.663]  I get other calculus to scare Iran.
[00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:54.267]  Still, it's immoral to back ISIS and al-Qaeda, who've been caught launching the chemical attacks before in Syria.
[00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:57.129]  That's why I'm so upset, and everybody should be really worried.
[00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:01.708]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:11.850]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.351]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.352]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:29.154]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:50.829]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.510]  It is amazing!
[00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.472]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:11.487]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:23.013]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.013 --> 00:06:32.978]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.978 --> 00:06:33.839]  Well, the President
[00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:47.205]  Via Nikki Haley has told the world that we're locked and loaded and we're preparing more airstrikes on Syria and big sanctions to be announced the next few hours against Russia.
[00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:53.289]  Russia is vowing to retaliate much stronger if they have their forces attacked again.
[00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.493]  They are saying the rebels staged the chemical attack.
[00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:03.077]  And they provided evidence the last three times the rebels launched the chemical attack.
[00:07:03.077 --> 00:07:05.499]  President Trump, when he was a candidate,
[00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:12.010]  Tweeted that the rebels have been caught staging chemical attacks before.
[00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:35.980]  But now, without proof, rushing to judgment, right after Trump announced that he wanted to pull out of Syria and that the Russians weren't pulling out, the neocons want to keep a war going, the Democrats want to keep a war going, and so this perfect provocation pops up right on time.
[00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:43.683]  Now remember these headlines from the last few months and the last year.
[00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:54.645]  Show that any so-called Christians or conservatives or libertarians or nationalists or patriots and pro-Trump folks, and I'm still pro-Trump, know the area we're entering in.
[00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:57.646]  This is a major course change.
[00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:59.107]  Hillary Clinton calls for U.S.
[00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.847]  to bomb Syrian airfields.
[00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:03.948]  Asks for Trump to bomb Syria.
[00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:04.248]  Reuters.
[00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:06.356]  U.S.
[00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:10.941]  training Syrian militants for false flag chemical attacks as basis for airstrikes.
[00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.162]  Russian Ministry of Defense.
[00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:14.204]  March 18th.
[00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:14.784]  A month ago.
[00:08:14.784 --> 00:08:19.369]  And then a month later, on Friday the 13th, you see the attacks.
[00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:21.611]  Is that lost on you?
[00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:22.291]  False flag!
[00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:25.595]  Ron Paul says Syrian chemical attack makes no sense.
[00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:26.896]  Probably a false flag.
[00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:27.917]  That's from last year.
[00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:38.184]  Daily Caller reporting on it from the Ron Paul report, the Liberty Report, and he sourced the UN report and our own Pentagon reports.
[00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:52.568]  Google, in an internal document that was leaked to Mike Cernovich that we got, said they wanted Ron Paul and InfoWars delisted because they feared when there was another staged chemical attack, the public would listen to us.
[00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:53.949]  That's why you've seen Google coming after us.
[00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:02.264]  Elizabeth Warren on Friday called for strikes and then later praised Trump.
[00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:04.025]  And so did a bunch of other Democrats.
[00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:20.077]  But the Democrats still online are now calling for Assad to be killed, Russia to be bombed, but simultaneously commenting, oh Alex Jones, haha, you're against Trump bombing Syria.
[00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:21.958]  You said you're upset with Trump.
[00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:22.959]  See, it's your problem.
[00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:23.800]  He's a mad dog.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.320]  He's crazy.
[00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:39.863]  Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar have come out and said Trump's crazy and more dangerous, quote, than Putin and Kim Jong-un because he's struck Syria.
[00:09:39.863 --> 00:09:43.605]  This is what you've been foaming at the mouth for.
[00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:44.586]  This was crazy.
[00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:55.036]  There is an area of no attention span mental illness now in this country for people with smartphones and TVs where the average person has an attention span less than a goldfish.
[00:09:55.036 --> 00:10:04.703]  So Behar may not even remember a week before she was calling for strikes.
[00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:09.166]  But now she's saying Trump's wrong.
[00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:10.967]  Their minds are gone, folks.
[00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:13.569]  They're gone.
[00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:14.990]  It's like Rand Paul's against the war.
[00:10:16.403 --> 00:10:19.585]  One of the biggest critics of Trump on real issues.
[00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:25.809]  And when he got physically attacked, the left celebrated and said, good, too bad he isn't dead.
[00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:27.430]  Big time Democrats.
[00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.411]  Because he's got an R after his name.
[00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:32.333]  They don't even know the policies.
[00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.935]  They don't even know what people stand for.
[00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.796]  And so when you see so much of mainstream news,
[00:10:40.694 --> 00:10:43.875]  Putting out this info, remember, thank God you've got a memory.
[00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:45.476]  Thank God you see through it.
[00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:49.557]  Because it's not like you're a rocket scientist or I'm a rocket scientist.
[00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:55.259]  It's that we still have our memories.
[00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.720]  Most children out there can't even hold conversations.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.621]  I mean, society is collapsing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.282]  And it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:11:04.282 --> 00:11:06.063]  We need rehabs from cell phones.
[00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:07.323]  We need rehabs from internet.
[00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:08.723]  We need rehabs from television.
[00:11:08.723 --> 00:11:10.124]  We need rehabs from the culture.
[00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:29.403]  I'm telling you, if I had the money, I'd set up resorts with no TV, no radio, no newspapers, no telephones, and with, you know, golf and frisbee and swimming pools and volleyball and hiking, and they'd be the biggest hits in the world.
[00:11:29.403 --> 00:11:30.684]  That's what people need.
[00:11:30.684 --> 00:11:36.187]  I know they've got some of these people, people forest bathe and, you know, they got these little places and stay in these little cabins.
[00:11:36.187 --> 00:11:37.347]  It's gotta happen, folks.
[00:11:37.347 --> 00:11:38.628]  We are dying.
[00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:51.669]  Instead of being like a blind person where you can't see the world, young people now only look at their phones.
[00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:55.813]  I'll sit there and watch a group of young teenage girls at their restaurant.
[00:11:55.813 --> 00:11:57.874]  None of them talk the entire time.
[00:11:57.874 --> 00:12:02.158]  They look at their phones and then giggle and laugh and then send each other messages.
[00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:10.164]  And they admit the IQs are dropping, the vocabulary is dropping.
[00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:12.226]  We are dying!
[00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.287]  It has been programmed!
[00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:21.582]  Here's an example, I'm looking at DrugsReport.com and I'll get into all this Mueller news and Comey news and war news and all the new strikes they're gearing up.
[00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:23.664]  And boom!
[00:12:23.664 --> 00:12:30.369]  Japan to lift ban on growing human organs in animals.
[00:12:30.369 --> 00:12:33.912]  Man set to be genetically modified.
[00:12:33.912 --> 00:12:38.435]  So that is World Net Daily.
[00:12:38.435 --> 00:12:42.078]  I'm gonna be covering that article coming up.
[00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:43.079]  And there's another one right here.
[00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:50.217]  Another article.
[00:12:50.217 --> 00:12:52.058]  Man said to be genetically modified.
[00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:54.639]  And then another one.
[00:12:54.639 --> 00:13:01.523]  Battle over gene edited food.
[00:13:01.523 --> 00:13:02.323]  Now that's the Daily Mail.
[00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:09.639]  Now, think about this.
[00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:14.960]  I've told you everything in those articles, word for word, for 20 years.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:21.002]  I've been on air 23, but I didn't really get knowledge of this until about 20 years ago.
[00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:24.143]  And I went and read all the white papers, all governmental reports.
[00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:25.423]  This has all been legal.
[00:13:25.423 --> 00:13:29.265]  It's all been going on for 40 years in the West.
[00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:30.565]  I learned about it 20 years ago.
[00:13:34.653 --> 00:14:01.158]  When listeners would fill my mailbox, back then I got hundreds of pieces a week, still do, but then that was a lot of mail, with people sending me white papers, university reports, a lot of them were scientists, and they said, Alex, you need to really cover this because
[00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:15.597]  They say it's not legal to clone, but if you call it research purposes, and you kill the clones when they're little, when they're embryonic, there are waivers.
[00:14:15.597 --> 00:14:24.685]  And then, soon enough, I saw articles in BBC admitting human-animal splices and clones, and all this.
[00:14:24.685 --> 00:14:28.729]  And how they were already growing humanoids inside cows in China, the US, the UK.
[00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:44.976]  But if you tune into Colbert or you tune into any of these shows, they go, Jones is insane, the chemicals in the water don't exist, and they're not turning you sterile, gay, you name it.
[00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:48.778]  And there's no human clones, and there's no human-animal hybrids.
[00:14:50.506 --> 00:14:55.749]  And they make fun of it and laugh because that is a talking point ahead of it rolling out.
[00:14:55.749 --> 00:15:03.213]  They make fun of you if you say it, so that it gets lined up, gets prepared, gets publicly approved, rolls out, is suddenly everywhere.
[00:15:03.213 --> 00:15:08.395]  It's suddenly at genetic clinics all over town.
[00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:15.119]  Suddenly you can go have a new humanoid made, grown in a tank.
[00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.680]  They'll say, oh it's proprietary, you can't see it.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.501]  The tank is a
[00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:23.137]  Brainless cow.
[00:15:23.137 --> 00:15:26.860]  And this is classified, but I'm gonna, I got this from classified sources.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.304]  Most of this is already public, but they have brainless cows.
[00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:34.428]  All they have is a brainstem so that they don't go through any pain.
[00:15:34.428 --> 00:15:37.270]  That's called the tank and it's all in an enclosure.
[00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.414]  And then the tanks grow the humanoids.
[00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:45.178]  And then they harvest the humanoids of all their organs.
[00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:51.615]  And by the way, that's in all the literature, but the part about how they call them tanks.
[00:15:51.615 --> 00:15:56.022]  They admit they're growing them in cows now, but the new thing is they're going to call them tanks.
[00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:58.326]  So no one even tells you that there's a cow in there doing this.
[00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:00.507]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:02.288]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:16:02.288 --> 00:16:03.928]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:06.769]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:09.050]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.551]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:17.512]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.971]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[00:16:30.971 --> 00:16:39.573]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:00.840]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.163]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:06.163 --> 00:17:07.744]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:07.744 --> 00:17:16.108]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:09.266]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:17.674]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.674 --> 00:18:22.318]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:29.322]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.322 --> 00:18:36.506]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.506 --> 00:18:43.530]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.992]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:51.194]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:59.697]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:18:59.697 --> 00:19:03.198]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.198 --> 00:19:05.158]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:19:05.158 --> 00:19:15.342]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:18.983]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:19:19.483 --> 00:19:19.743]  Absolutely.
[00:19:42.237 --> 00:20:03.356]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:20:03.356 --> 00:20:05.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:38.899]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:44.122]  You know, I was talking about how they have these whole facilities full of cows and pigs.
[00:20:44.122 --> 00:20:46.263]  It's mainly what they use.
[00:20:46.263 --> 00:20:48.184]  They've tested it on other animals.
[00:20:48.184 --> 00:20:51.126]  So they can grow up humanoids
[00:20:52.282 --> 00:20:59.665]  Inside of the animals, they don't just go in and quote grow a liver inside the uterus of a cow.
[00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:03.567]  They grow a whole package.
[00:21:03.567 --> 00:21:11.751]  It is what is called the literature and it is a humanoid.
[00:21:11.751 --> 00:21:13.412]  It's a genetically engineered human.
[00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:17.645]  That then can be harvested for its organs.
[00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:23.668]  And you can grow the humanoid up bigger to get more product.
[00:21:23.668 --> 00:21:27.570]  Larger organs, more organs.
[00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.572]  And look, the guys were even able to find it.
[00:21:31.572 --> 00:21:36.294]  You know, I mentioned and I was told by folks that worked in these areas that they had doors on the sides of the cows.
[00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:43.918]  And I just remembered about a year ago it was even in mainstream news they finally showed how they opened the door up on the side of the cow and how they're harvesting things
[00:21:44.966 --> 00:21:47.627]  I'm going to explain this again to everybody.
[00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:47.987]  20 years ago,
[00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:27.910]  I began to get sent literature, mainline literature, about human gene splicing, gene guns, gene editing.
[00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:34.133]  So everything they tell you about in mainstream news is about 20 to 30 years old generally.
[00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:39.696]  And they don't want to debate about it while it's at the test phase.
[00:22:39.696 --> 00:22:44.239]  They only want you to know about it once they're ready to roll it out.
[00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:44.799]  So they knew
[00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:53.090]  That the 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G causes massive cancer.
[00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.671]  They knew the cell phone towers caused it.
[00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:58.174]  They knew the cell phones caused it back when they approved it in the 1970s.
[00:22:58.174 --> 00:23:05.059]  Yeah, there's PubMed, genome editing in livestock.
[00:23:05.059 --> 00:23:08.821]  Are we ready for the revolution in animal breeding industry?
[00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:10.863]  And that's from last year.
[00:23:10.863 --> 00:23:12.284]  This is all old news.
[00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:15.326]  Open season is seen in gene editing of animals, New York Times.
[00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:37.533]  But remember, the people that watch Stephen Colbert when he makes jokes about this, they'll laugh even when they're driving by the genetic clinics in the next few years, where if they had the money they could get these treatments from harvested humanoids.
[00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:47.965]  And now, oh, the LA Times and everybody, oh, it turns out 5G does grow rats' tumors.
[00:23:47.965 --> 00:23:49.046]  Oh, it does kill you.
[00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:50.227]  Oh, cell phones do.
[00:23:50.227 --> 00:23:52.168]  They knew all this when they got it approved.
[00:23:52.168 --> 00:23:54.729]  And what am I saying here?
[00:23:54.729 --> 00:23:58.112]  This is all being deployed.
[00:23:58.112 --> 00:24:05.076]  Every study shows just regular gene splicing, regular gene stacking in crops.
[00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:11.120]  50-year-old technology causes genetic drift and mutations and massive cancer in lab animals.
[00:24:16.906 --> 00:24:19.347]  So this is being done by design.
[00:24:19.347 --> 00:24:24.009]  So you know what?
[00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:28.392]  I've wanted to support President Trump in that I know he's an anti-globalist.
[00:24:28.392 --> 00:24:30.132]  I know the globalists hate him.
[00:24:30.132 --> 00:24:33.654]  I know the power structure doesn't like him because he actually wants to be the president.
[00:24:33.654 --> 00:24:39.337]  I know he's done some basic things that are good for the economy and the country.
[00:24:39.337 --> 00:24:41.398]  But if he starts going sideways with their agenda,
[00:24:42.802 --> 00:24:49.144]  It's the global awakening to what's happening and nationalism and populism that I am loyal to, not Trump.
[00:24:49.144 --> 00:24:51.884]  And I'm not thinking Trump's even a bad guy.
[00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:53.665]  He's surrounded.
[00:24:53.665 --> 00:24:55.125]  He's being demonized.
[00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:56.465]  He's being persecuted.
[00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:57.866]  He's being lied about.
[00:24:57.866 --> 00:25:01.827]  He's being pressured.
[00:25:01.827 --> 00:25:03.967]  And there's the old trap of, sir, here's the intelligence.
[00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:04.948]  Okay, bomb it.
[00:25:04.948 --> 00:25:06.108]  My approval rating will go up.
[00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:34.396]  But here's the thing, I don't want my support of nationalism and of America to get in the way of the bigger issue here that there's atrazine in the water supply of all 50 states that causes massive cancer in men and women, sexual confusion, asexual behavior, sterilization, and that's only one of these chemicals and they know it's there and they're doing nothing to stop it.
[00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:42.135]  But they'll try to tax somebody for carbon dioxide.
[00:25:42.135 --> 00:25:44.536]  So we're being poisoned as a species.
[00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:49.579]  That's a fact.
[00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:54.662]  And the frogs are becoming sterile in mass, and the ones that live are, quote, gay.
[00:25:54.662 --> 00:25:56.584]  According to scientists, they want males.
[00:25:56.584 --> 00:25:58.545]  And then so there's no eggs, and so they die.
[00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:09.937]  Transgender Fish has captured changing sex in unprecedented details for BBC Planet Blue 2 from Chemicals.
[00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:11.238]  This is the reality.
[00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:20.605]  I'm showing gay frogs on screen, but see, it's all a joke because they pre-inoculate your mind so that when you hear about it, oh, that's just Alex Jones.
[00:26:24.735 --> 00:26:30.099]  But what about England announcing, we're going to have children with four daddies?
[00:26:30.099 --> 00:26:32.580]  Those aren't people.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:39.044]  And the new regulations and the laws about transgendered, you think it's about a man wanting to be a woman or vice versa?
[00:26:39.044 --> 00:26:39.965]  No.
[00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:45.669]  It's about the new humanoids that corporations are going to produce, that families are going to go pay for.
[00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:54.389]  And under the global government, you will not be able, the great law will be, to say, that's not a person.
[00:26:54.389 --> 00:27:00.737]  Or that thing, made by a corporation, does not have more rights than me.
[00:27:00.737 --> 00:27:03.200]  And yeah, they're gonna be six and a half feet tall, they're gonna have 250 IQs.
[00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:09.022]  And they're going to be programmable and controllable.
[00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:12.125]  Because they're not just going in and giving them these other quote, super traits.
[00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:24.019]  They're giving them backdoor control, genetic software, just like everything else the globalists give us has a backdoor, has a Trojan horse, has a whole nother use.
[00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:25.541]  They've been creating humanoids.
[00:27:26.834 --> 00:27:32.295]  From female DNA only, male DNA only, and by every scientific yardstick, they're not human.
[00:27:32.295 --> 00:27:42.398]  But if you can't even say there's only two genders, male and female, then how could you ever even have a debate about a humanoid with no mitochondrial DNA?
[00:27:42.398 --> 00:27:44.418]  No female DNA!
[00:27:44.418 --> 00:27:51.400]  Women have an extra chromosome, women have a double set of DNA.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.740]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.940]  Major Journal.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.661]  Programmable Genomes.
[00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:05.107]  Programmable genome editing tools and their regulation for efficient genome engineering.
[00:28:05.107 --> 00:28:06.968]  Science direct.
[00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:08.229]  And here's the big story.
[00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:17.853]  In every major study of even basic gene splicing, gene gunning, gene editing, or just stacking.
[00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:21.895]  After one generation, you start getting ultra-massive mutations.
[00:28:24.184 --> 00:28:31.091]  And generally, in higher order life forms, erratic and aggressive behavior.
[00:28:31.091 --> 00:28:33.213]  Gene editing is just the beginning though, don't worry.
[00:28:33.213 --> 00:28:37.037]  And Japan to lift the ban on growing humanoids inside animals.
[00:28:38.686 --> 00:28:40.908]  Humans will be genetically modified for the first time in Europe.
[00:28:40.908 --> 00:28:41.629]  Yeah, right.
[00:28:41.629 --> 00:28:43.571]  It's all mainstream news now.
[00:28:43.571 --> 00:28:45.813]  But do I get patted on the back?
[00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:46.915]  No, no, no.
[00:28:46.915 --> 00:28:50.438]  I get ridiculed to teach all of you not to stand up or speak out.
[00:28:50.438 --> 00:28:54.362]  Just shut up while they vandalize the world's genetic code.
[00:28:54.362 --> 00:28:57.886]  After all, taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that's how you save the Earth.
[00:28:59.249 --> 00:29:01.851]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:02.911]  Get back to nature.
[00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:10.096]  Expand your horizons with the highest quality, most versatile, unique slingshots and sling bows on the market at slingbow.com.

[00:29:29.079 --> 00:29:30.580]  You have been lied to.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.062]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:35.765]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.765 --> 00:29:41.089]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.089 --> 00:29:46.794]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.794 --> 00:29:50.217]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:53.319]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.
[00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:57.503]  Get them right now at KillingUncleSamBook.com KillingUncleSamBook.com
[00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:11.655]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:30:11.655 --> 00:30:20.499]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:29.526]  Powerful, 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:30:29.526 --> 00:30:34.550]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:44.838]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:50.223]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[00:30:50.683 --> 00:31:00.065]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our Republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:10.668]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:12.508]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:31:12.728 --> 00:31:15.590]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.071]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:23.895]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.895 --> 00:31:25.976]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:31:25.976 --> 00:31:35.702]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.702 --> 00:31:40.685]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:52.488]  Patriots, stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.488 --> 00:31:55.789]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:58.990]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Field, at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:59.997 --> 00:32:03.739]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:32:03.739 --> 00:32:10.802]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:32:10.802 --> 00:32:15.544]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:32:15.544 --> 00:32:16.305]  It's very simple.
[00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:18.806]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[00:32:18.806 --> 00:32:20.747]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[00:32:20.747 --> 00:32:24.429]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:26.590]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.190]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:32.432]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:32:32.432 --> 00:32:36.873]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:40.714]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:32:40.714 --> 00:32:44.596]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:32:44.596 --> 00:32:47.757]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:51.398]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:32:51.398 --> 00:32:53.998]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:32:53.998 --> 00:32:54.999]  It's amazing.
[00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:57.539]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:33:02.826 --> 00:33:05.438]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:12.065]  Breaking the conditioning!
[00:33:12.065 --> 00:33:13.226]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:14.046]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.046 --> 00:33:14.826]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:15.427]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:18.608]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.608 --> 00:33:28.091]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:33:28.091 --> 00:33:29.952]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:33:29.952 --> 00:33:33.693]  It's time to confirm there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:33:35.383 --> 00:33:39.948]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:33:39.948 --> 00:33:42.611]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:33:42.611 --> 00:33:45.594]  It was almost as if this was a planned implosion.
[00:33:45.594 --> 00:33:47.355]  It just pancaked.
[00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:49.658]  It took the baby's own incubators.
[00:33:49.658 --> 00:33:51.560]  Lucky took him to die on the front lawn.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.422]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:33:54.422 --> 00:34:01.427]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:34:01.427 --> 00:34:01.667]  U.S.A.
[00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:03.908]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:06.330]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.752]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:34:08.752 --> 00:34:09.832]  Some former U.S.
[00:34:09.832 --> 00:34:12.034]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:34:12.034 --> 00:34:16.177]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:34:16.477 --> 00:34:22.123]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:34:22.123 --> 00:34:23.605]  Russian scum!
[00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:24.446]  Denied everything.
[00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:25.947]  He called it all fake news.
[00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:28.911]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:30.853]  This is a national emergency.
[00:34:30.853 --> 00:34:36.619]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:38.581]  This is a FEMA high-level alert.
[00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:42.264]  You know, I think the best thing I can do here
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:15.944]  is just speak directly to the establishment and the social engineers and the rest of the public if anybody cares to listen to me.
[00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:19.966]  There is a global government that's been formed.
[00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:24.748]  It calls itself a scientific technocracy.
[00:35:24.748 --> 00:35:32.531]  It believes that it's going to discover immortality through computers and through genetic engineering.
[00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:35.332]  The British launched a science race in the 1850s
[00:35:38.607 --> 00:35:53.296]  of massive testing using robber baron money and also British imperial money to study, codify, and accelerate human development.
[00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:57.398]  They have founded the whole eugenics movement and the transhumanist movement.
[00:35:57.398 --> 00:36:01.001]  This is all in mainline textbooks.
[00:36:01.001 --> 00:36:06.204]  And they for at least 40 years have had human-animal hybrids, horrible experiments,
[00:36:08.148 --> 00:36:24.712]  They've done countless experiments with chemicals on animals, on how to manipulate the population through aerosol sprays in the atmosphere, and deliberately deployed, but also put into the food chain, chemicals and biologicals.
[00:36:24.712 --> 00:36:32.273]  They have deployed glyphosate for 45 years by the thousands and thousands of tons a week being used.
[00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:36.114]  It massively increases infertility and cancer.
[00:36:38.908 --> 00:36:44.710]  And now they're rolling in the next phases of it.
[00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:52.112]  And so my message to the globalists is this.
[00:36:52.112 --> 00:36:57.834]  Do you think you're ever going to end up having a good world based out of this?
[00:36:57.834 --> 00:37:08.398]  Do you really think you're going to achieve all this immortality and all this power you think you're going to get with all this nightmare stuff you're creating that hurts the general public?
[00:37:12.406 --> 00:37:38.702]  In your great mission to depopulate the planet, while at the same time you believe you're testing it on us to discover the super genes that can live in this nightmare environment you're creating, and that you believe you'll break away like a rocket going into nirvana, and that we're like rocket boosters falling away.
[00:37:41.752 --> 00:37:43.893]  That is the cosmology.
[00:37:43.893 --> 00:37:46.535]  That is your religion.
[00:37:46.535 --> 00:37:58.201]  It is the most selfish, greedy, anti-human, dangerous, Luciferian crud that someone could come up with.
[00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:09.467]  And then there's the general public, not a thought in the world, just obsessed like narcissists, looking at themselves in the pool of water, playing on their little iPhones,
[00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:20.234]  It's merrily, merrily, merrily down the river towards the big waterfalls.
[00:38:20.234 --> 00:38:34.985]  And how they use the stunted public's morals that are still there to manipulate them into not doing anything political that would actually help humanity, lest they be called racist or something else.
[00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:38.708]  It's suicidal.
[00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:40.389]  So I'm here trying to provide leadership.
[00:38:44.284 --> 00:38:55.968]  And point out the negative and the bad things that are going on.
[00:38:55.968 --> 00:39:01.150]  So that hopefully we've got a chance to pull out of this.
[00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:08.813]  Or at least smarter people than me can come up with a plan to, I guess,
[00:39:11.425 --> 00:39:28.817]  Morally and ethically and voluntarily isolate enough of ourselves somewhere from the 5G and the little robot smartphones that are radiating our brains and our genitals, our hearts and our organs.
[00:39:28.817 --> 00:39:37.684]  And the GMO pollen clouds and the aluminum clouds and the Chinese pollution raining down out of the jet stream over the US Midwest.
[00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:47.107]  And just the cultural evil and the spirit that's spreading.
[00:39:47.107 --> 00:40:04.115]  Because I have really believed that we could save America and get a beachhead and save Romania and save Hungary and save the UK and save anywhere else people wake up, save Brazil.
[00:40:04.115 --> 00:40:05.696]  Maybe we could save parts of Mexico.
[00:40:10.993 --> 00:40:13.554]  Save Iceland.
[00:40:13.554 --> 00:40:19.356]  Any places I saw little pockets of resistance.
[00:40:19.356 --> 00:40:24.818]  You know, French farmers burning down fields all over the country of GMO crops.
[00:40:24.818 --> 00:40:29.200]  All they'd say is, all I know is I feed my pig that corn and they die.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.503]  Well yeah, that corn had pesticide that grows in it.
[00:40:35.503 --> 00:40:36.483]  We eat pesticide.
[00:40:37.827 --> 00:40:39.508]  That's 30-year-old technology.
[00:40:39.508 --> 00:40:43.469]  I mean, we are so screwed, folks.
[00:40:43.469 --> 00:40:44.189]  And that's it.
[00:40:44.189 --> 00:40:47.270]  Fighting with the general public.
[00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:58.574]  Fighting with some Trump hater that wants to dump coffee on my head.
[00:40:58.574 --> 00:41:02.216]  What's the point?
[00:41:02.216 --> 00:41:05.897]  I mean, I can become a popular radio show, like we've done.
[00:41:07.622 --> 00:41:10.724]  By telling the truth, trying to turn the world around.
[00:41:10.724 --> 00:41:17.630]  Why would you sell out when selling out means destroying civilization?
[00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:21.693]  And then you look at the people that hate us.
[00:41:21.693 --> 00:41:22.894]  They can't even be reached.
[00:41:22.894 --> 00:41:24.735]  They don't want to be reached.
[00:41:24.735 --> 00:41:28.338]  Because, see, they adapt to being poisoned.
[00:41:28.338 --> 00:41:31.481]  They adapt to dying.
[00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:33.963]  They adapt to being overwritten.
[00:41:33.963 --> 00:41:36.865]  So I'll get into all the geopolitical World War III news and the rest of it, but
[00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:56.127]  That's all secondary to human-animal clones, humanoids that really aren't human, created in a lab, where it's not the normal genetic merger of men and women, in a system that works so well and is so beautiful.
[00:41:56.127 --> 00:42:00.029]  It's all this artificiality, it's all this abomination.
[00:42:00.029 --> 00:42:01.549]  And it's here!
[00:42:01.549 --> 00:42:02.710]  And out of it comes pure death.
[00:42:07.503 --> 00:42:19.627]  But I gotta tell ya, I don't think you can save your family, and I don't think you can save yourself, at this point, being amongst people that are like this.
[00:42:19.627 --> 00:42:26.970]  I think I'm discovering the same thing that the Pilgrims figured out in England and in the Netherlands 450 years ago.
[00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:33.012]  I think I'm figuring out the same thing other people figured out when they involved themselves in an exodus.
[00:42:33.012 --> 00:42:36.353]  The Israelites out of Egypt, you name it, that
[00:42:38.132 --> 00:42:46.295]  I don't think you can live in this modern world and even homeschool your kids and get out of this.
[00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:50.536]  In fact, there's nowhere to hide actually.
[00:42:50.536 --> 00:42:59.560]  It's absolute cancer and it is the end of humanity and it's already got its tentacles all around our throats.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:05.822]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:44:19.085 --> 00:44:21.187]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:44:34.816 --> 00:44:37.457]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:44:37.457 --> 00:44:40.259]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:44:40.259 --> 00:44:42.741]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:42.741 --> 00:44:51.947]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:44:51.947 --> 00:44:56.390]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:44:56.553 --> 00:44:56.638]  Yeah.
[00:45:01.297 --> 00:45:09.841]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:13.342]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[00:45:13.342 --> 00:45:22.867]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:30.050]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one
[00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.873]  Best selling product at Infowarslife.com because it works so well.
[00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:42.100]  This is a gift you want to give yourself and then rest assured you're fighting the Info War so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.884]  Try Alpha Power exclusively available at Infowarslife.com for yourself.
[00:45:46.884 --> 00:45:48.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's non-GMO.

[00:47:03.735 --> 00:47:06.397]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.864 --> 00:47:23.025]  You found it.
[00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:29.207]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:29.207 --> 00:47:32.508]  It's the InfoWar.
[00:47:32.508 --> 00:47:35.589]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:47.934]  The globalists create confusion by design so that people see a smoke screen and can't figure out what's going on and they hope just roll over and give up.
[00:47:49.195 --> 00:47:57.299]  The good news is a lot of people are becoming really concerned about cell phones and radiation and the massive increase of cancer.
[00:47:57.299 --> 00:48:03.842]  But when you go in and get diagnosed with cancer, they're not going to tell you about the chemicals and the radiation and why it's up several thousand percent.
[00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:09.284]  They'll just say, oh, we'll donate more money so we find a cure.
[00:48:09.284 --> 00:48:12.266]  But what's the cure to cancer in children being up over 10,000 percent since 1950?
[00:48:12.266 --> 00:48:13.046]  Look it up.
[00:48:16.906 --> 00:48:21.408]  The cure is finding out why it's all exploding.
[00:48:21.408 --> 00:48:28.132]  Well, they then tell us that, well, your genes are bad.
[00:48:28.132 --> 00:48:37.056]  Well, yes, if you have genes predisposed to, say, lung cancer from toxins, and then you get a bunch of toxins, you'll get cancer.
[00:48:37.056 --> 00:48:40.538]  But people had those supposed bad genes before.
[00:48:40.538 --> 00:48:42.719]  So why now is the cancer manifesting?
[00:48:43.564 --> 00:48:54.209]  Because cell phone radiation vibrates at the exact same frequency, this was in white papers I read 20-something years ago, to break your DNA in pieces.
[00:48:54.209 --> 00:49:10.937]  So, if I try to go out with an Infowars.com flag on the microphone, to any type of leftist march, and I walk up and I say, I've got a study here about 5G really causing cancer, they're gonna say, shut up, fake news.
[00:49:14.286 --> 00:49:23.552]  I was in front of the White House last Wednesday doing a live report trying to stop the strikes that did come.
[00:49:23.552 --> 00:49:27.775]  And high school students by the hundreds walked by and said, hey Alex Jones, hey, we're waving.
[00:49:27.775 --> 00:49:35.561]  But another good percent of them would say, oh look, it's Mr. Fake News, and it was the teachers.
[00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:43.306]  And I was there doing a report about strikes in Syria, how the chemical weapons motive was for the rebels.
[00:49:45.111 --> 00:49:48.513]  And now we should call Congress and the White House and say, don't strike Syria.
[00:49:48.513 --> 00:49:58.921]  But see, instead of actually listening to what I had to say, just say fake news, see, because they had branded my face to that.
[00:49:58.921 --> 00:50:01.503]  I was there covering legitimate issues.
[00:50:01.503 --> 00:50:02.844]  I do cover legitimate issues.
[00:50:02.844 --> 00:50:04.145]  It's why they're demonizing us.
[00:50:04.145 --> 00:50:05.626]  It's why they're attacking us.
[00:50:05.626 --> 00:50:09.068]  It's why they're going after us.
[00:50:09.068 --> 00:50:11.230]  But I proudly hold up that InfoWars flag.
[00:50:12.193 --> 00:50:15.734]  Because it stands for the preservation of humanity on this planet.
[00:50:15.734 --> 00:50:17.735]  It stands for sanity.
[00:50:17.735 --> 00:50:18.635]  It stands for honor.
[00:50:18.635 --> 00:50:20.836]  It stands for courage.
[00:50:20.836 --> 00:50:23.697]  It stands for will.
[00:50:23.697 --> 00:50:37.663]  And I know it's always darkest before the dawn, but a large segment of the public is so dumbed down and so dangerous and so stupid now, that the globalist media can program them
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:44.102]  To believe and act however they want, and they are in incredible danger.
[00:50:44.102 --> 00:50:49.504]  Now next hour we have several guests on the fact that we are steaming towards war with Russia.
[00:50:49.504 --> 00:50:52.586]  More strikes, more sanctions, more attacks.
[00:50:52.586 --> 00:50:55.067]  Paul Craig Roberts is joining us.
[00:50:55.067 --> 00:50:57.428]  Gerald Salente is joining us.
[00:50:57.428 --> 00:50:58.568]  Dr. Pachinic is joining us.
[00:50:58.568 --> 00:50:59.828]  He was on Friday.
[00:50:59.828 --> 00:51:00.489]  Very happy.
[00:51:01.462 --> 00:51:08.507]  That Mattis and others signaled there wouldn't be a strike, that there wasn't evidence that Russia did it, or that Assad did it, and BOOM!
[00:51:08.507 --> 00:51:11.329]  That night it happened.
[00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:19.834]  And I was so concerned the Russians might strike back, as the globalists want, that I was very angry.
[00:51:19.834 --> 00:51:27.960]  And I apologize to some of the audience that saw one of the live feeds that wasn't over the satellites, the TV stations, but I did here in studio, for being angry and being a bit vulgar.
[00:51:29.209 --> 00:51:39.673]  But I try to control myself a lot, and it feels good to let yourself have an outburst occasionally.
[00:51:39.673 --> 00:51:41.593]  It's cathartic.
[00:51:41.593 --> 00:51:42.233]  Was it fake?
[00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:43.354]  Absolutely not.
[00:51:43.354 --> 00:51:44.734]  But did I let the dog out of the chain?
[00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:48.816]  Yes.
[00:51:48.816 --> 00:51:54.558]  Because if they can start to turn Trump one degree, they can turn him 180 degrees.
[00:51:57.005 --> 00:52:00.868]  And it's because I know Trump's been for real on so many issues, that he's under so much pressure.
[00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:02.249]  And I can't stand Comey.
[00:52:02.249 --> 00:52:03.290]  I can't stand all these people.
[00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:07.374]  And I've been trying to defend Trump on a lot of things, even though he's gone sideways some.
[00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:11.817]  Because I understand that once his base goes away, he'll fall like a house of cards.
[00:52:11.817 --> 00:52:15.240]  So I get the fact they're trying to drive us away from him.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.041]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:20.244]  I get mad sometimes and go too far.
[00:52:20.244 --> 00:52:21.826]  So I did go too far.
[00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:23.227]  Most of my audience loved the fact
[00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.471]  I said I was mad at Trump and, you know, F this.
[00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:30.213]  But I was saying F what he did.
[00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:42.498]  F him disagreeing with the old Trump that sent out hundreds of tweets saying the rebels launched the chemical attacks previously, they're Al Qaeda, they're ISIS, Hillary and Obama started the war, this is wrong!
[00:52:42.498 --> 00:52:50.122]  I love Trump and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz because they were the people that had courage, like our military said we don't want to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[00:52:50.122 --> 00:52:52.063]  That was America finding its soul again!
[00:52:54.907 --> 00:52:56.628]  And so it hurts to see that.
[00:52:56.628 --> 00:52:58.369]  I expect McCain to be evil.
[00:52:58.369 --> 00:52:59.730]  I expect Hillary to be evil.
[00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:03.553]  I expect Elizabeth Warren to call for the war.
[00:53:03.553 --> 00:53:09.777]  Modern leftists are warmongering, al-Qaeda backing, jihadist-loving trash.
[00:53:09.777 --> 00:53:20.564]  But when Trump does it, and we know it's a fraud, and you don't like seeing somebody you care about, you know that's embattled, under all that pressure, start to falter.
[00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.385]  Even though I probably would have already faltered more.
[00:53:23.464 --> 00:53:26.766]  It's 71 years old, the stress he's under.
[00:53:26.766 --> 00:53:29.667]  Sometimes I hate myself things I do in hindsight.
[00:53:29.667 --> 00:53:31.548]  I look back and say, why'd you do that?
[00:53:31.548 --> 00:53:32.928]  I get really angry with myself.
[00:53:32.928 --> 00:53:41.352]  We get more angry with people we love, like our families, people we admire, people we're close to, people we put on a pedestal.
[00:53:41.352 --> 00:53:46.955]  But I do say to the neocons and the globalists and Hillary, you're the scum of the earth.
[00:53:48.376 --> 00:53:53.578]  Just like Charlton Heston says at the end of Planet of the Apes, damn you all to hell, you blew it all up.
[00:53:53.578 --> 00:53:54.758]  Can we cue that up please?
[00:53:54.758 --> 00:54:01.401]  We had it cued up Friday when I thought that wasn't going to happen and we never played it for movie clips.
[00:54:01.401 --> 00:54:09.804]  You know, he sees the Statue of Liberty melted by a hydrogen bomb in the ruins of New York and he says, you did it, you crazy bastards!
[00:54:09.804 --> 00:54:10.944]  You really did it!
[00:54:14.423 --> 00:54:15.524]  A new breaking article.
[00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:17.805]  Let's put that on screen because I've been showing what the Russians are saying.
[00:54:17.805 --> 00:54:20.766]  I want to show what Syria strike live updates.
[00:54:20.766 --> 00:54:23.187]  Russia may have tampered with chemical attack sites.
[00:54:23.187 --> 00:54:23.487]  U.S.
[00:54:23.487 --> 00:54:28.729]  envoy says, yeah, they wouldn't let them in the day of the bombing because the road was closed.
[00:54:28.729 --> 00:54:29.790]  So now the U.S.
[00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:33.551]  envoy saying the British group trying to go and test for chemicals might have been blocked.
[00:54:33.551 --> 00:54:34.612]  That's Herat saying that.
[00:54:36.633 --> 00:54:40.157]  Well really, the last three times the inspectors went in, including the UN, they found it was the rebels.
[00:54:40.157 --> 00:54:41.719]  The rebels shot video of them doing it.
[00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:42.600]  So we'll see.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:54.535]  Why would the Russians be pulling out if Assad had just won, Trump was announcing a pullout, why would you hit 50 people who aren't military so then you'd lose?
[00:54:57.022 --> 00:54:59.304]  I'll continue to show what both sides are saying.
[00:54:59.304 --> 00:55:09.031]  Now, I didn't blog hardly any yesterday on the Sunday Show, even though we got a big nut to crack with this operation, and all them taking our sponsors, and Soros Group and Hillary filing fake suits on us.
[00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:12.554]  We got two more suits thrown out the last two weeks, they just filed two more.
[00:55:12.554 --> 00:55:14.696]  They've also learned about another big one they've got set up.
[00:55:14.696 --> 00:55:16.818]  This will be the big kahuna that's totally fake as well.
[00:55:16.818 --> 00:55:18.639]  We'll be exclusively telling you about that today or tomorrow.
[00:55:20.711 --> 00:55:22.632]  We need your financial support.
[00:55:22.632 --> 00:55:27.735]  We've got incredibly high quality products that are changing the world.
[00:55:27.735 --> 00:55:33.117]  And X2 is the purest, cleanest form of iodine out there from a deep earth through atomic source.
[00:55:33.117 --> 00:55:36.379]  That's 99999.
[00:55:36.379 --> 00:55:42.262]  Unfortunately, they're going up on the price on us at the mines that get it, the drilling.
[00:55:42.262 --> 00:55:45.644]  And we're not even sure after another few runs, we're going to have it.
[00:55:45.644 --> 00:55:47.385]  We're trying to find another source of it.
[00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:48.005]  Haven't yet.
[00:55:50.049 --> 00:55:51.811]  But necessity is the mother of invention.
[00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:52.972]  We'll see what comes out next.
[00:55:52.972 --> 00:55:55.034]  But this is the last day to get 25% off X2.
[00:55:55.034 --> 00:55:57.136]  It's going to have to go back to full prices.
[00:55:57.136 --> 00:55:58.117]  We're not getting more until June.
[00:55:58.117 --> 00:56:02.021]  I think it'll sell out way before then.
[00:56:02.021 --> 00:56:11.050]  So, 6,229 reviews, five-star reviews, 98% rating, nothing on Power Reviews has a rating that high.
[00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:11.870]  It's that incredible.
[00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:12.591]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.681]  Also, Super Metal Vitality.
[00:56:15.681 --> 00:56:17.863]  We did a huge run of it.
[00:56:17.863 --> 00:56:20.264]  Concentrated organic herbs.
[00:56:20.264 --> 00:56:21.125]  They're not heated up.
[00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:22.306]  It's cold pressed.
[00:56:22.306 --> 00:56:23.286]  Each batch is different.
[00:56:23.286 --> 00:56:26.068]  Each batch is proprietary.
[00:56:26.068 --> 00:56:26.408]  Each day.
[00:56:26.408 --> 00:56:28.870]  But they all are great.
[00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.192]  And we're doing 50% off the retail.
[00:56:32.192 --> 00:56:33.333]  Unprecedented.
[00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:36.135]  It's very expensive to make this.
[00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:37.175]  For Super Metal Vitality.
[00:56:37.175 --> 00:56:38.796]  For those of you that love it like I do.
[00:56:38.796 --> 00:56:41.018]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:56:41.018 --> 00:56:41.238]  50% off.
[00:56:41.238 --> 00:56:42.219]  That is the new special.
[00:56:43.803 --> 00:56:53.372]  Whatever happens, I've got to stop X2 tomorrow because, again, we need to sell it at full price to be able to run the operation, and we think we'll sell out of it even before we get more in.
[00:56:53.372 --> 00:57:00.058]  At the full price, you can also get Supermell Vitality and the real Red Pill that go together great for 50% off and get free shipping.
[00:57:00.058 --> 00:57:02.260]  That's a new special.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.002]  We also have one other big special.
[00:57:04.002 --> 00:57:05.223]  I haven't told you about this.
[00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:14.180]  And that is a special that we're running, dealing with super high quality, storable food.
[00:57:16.172 --> 00:57:21.235]  Where you get a very high quality, free, $200 value water filter.
[00:57:21.235 --> 00:57:26.459]  When you get a 3 month supply of high quality, swearable food powered by MyPatriot at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:26.459 --> 00:57:27.379]  It's called InfoWars Select.
[00:57:27.379 --> 00:57:28.480]  We can private label it.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:35.425]  It would do for even lower by one, by a 3 month food supply and get one free Alexa Pure Pro for free.
[00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:37.206]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:37.206 --> 00:57:40.328]  Your purchases fund this whole operation, so thank you all.
[00:57:40.328 --> 00:57:43.710]  Whatever you do, spread the live links in the local stations you're listening to.
[00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.012]  That's how we get around the censors and warn humanity.
[00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:49.195]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:57:49.195 --> 00:57:51.997]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:57:51.997 --> 00:58:02.467]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[00:58:02.467 --> 00:58:03.268]  Scalability.
[00:58:03.268 --> 00:58:05.690]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.131]  There's a lot of product and a lot
[00:58:11.395 --> 00:58:13.977]  It's the other side of the equation.
[00:58:13.977 --> 00:58:23.783]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotic self-displays.
[00:58:23.783 --> 00:58:26.845]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[00:58:26.845 --> 00:58:32.629]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:58:32.629 --> 00:58:38.613]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:58:39.053 --> 00:58:41.876]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:58:41.876 --> 00:58:47.402]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:58:50.222 --> 00:58:56.685]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in Fort Worth's life, it'd take hours.
[00:58:56.685 --> 00:58:59.126]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:58:59.126 --> 00:59:00.307]  It's stronger.
[00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:01.908]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:59:01.908 --> 00:59:05.129]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:59:05.129 --> 00:59:06.250]  It's back in stock.
[00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.431]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:13.213]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:59:13.213 --> 00:59:16.315]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[00:59:16.315 --> 00:59:17.195]  So you can upload it.
[00:59:17.195 --> 00:59:18.656]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[00:59:19.096 --> 00:59:21.856]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:59:53.298 --> 01:00:04.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.682]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:11.682 --> 01:00:16.103]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:21.224]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.184 --> 01:00:41.186]  The Allies are lining up.
[01:00:41.186 --> 01:00:49.854]  A significant body of information, including intelligence, indicates the Syrian regime is responsible for this latest attack.
[01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:57.101]  I cannot tell you everything, but let me give an example of some of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion.
[01:00:57.101 --> 01:01:01.625]  Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals.
[01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:12.791]  Multiple open source reports claim that a regime helicopter was observed above the city of Douma on the evening of the 7th of April.
[01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:17.133]  The opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs.
[01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:25.096]  Macron went on to claim that he had convinced President Donald Trump to keep US troops in Syria and to keep the strikes limited.
[01:01:25.096 --> 01:01:28.677]  Ten days ago, President Trump was saying the United States should withdraw
[01:01:32.832 --> 01:01:40.337]  We also persuaded him that we needed to limit the strikes to chemical weapons after things got a little carried away over tweets, as you know.
[01:01:40.337 --> 01:01:46.080]  The president likes communicating, oftentimes through Twitter, as he has about what's going on in Syria.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.483]  He tweeted earlier in the week and yesterday in response to the airstrikes.
[01:01:51.483 --> 01:01:57.026]  And part of the tweet that's been getting hammered by many in the media when he ended it saying, mission accomplished.
[01:01:57.026 --> 01:01:57.927]  Your reaction to all of that?
[01:01:58.467 --> 01:02:03.515]  Yeah, look, saying that is an acknowledgement that the strikes worked.
[01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:05.598]  As well as the opposition.
[01:02:05.598 --> 01:02:13.250]  China understands that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will send experts to Syria to conduct investigations.
[01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:20.123]  We call on relevant parties to maintain restraint to ease tensions as quickly as possible.
[01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:24.807]  But I think it's wrong for the United States to fight terrorism with the YPG or PYD.
[01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:29.690]  This is something I've shared with the higher echelons of the United States.
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.432]  We need to fight these terrorists with the United States.
[01:02:32.432 --> 01:02:36.255]  And we are not able to acquire those weapons from the United States.
[01:02:36.255 --> 01:02:41.258]  Why are you giving weapons to those terrorists is the question that we ask our friends in the United States.
[01:02:42.519 --> 01:02:43.921]  Now, lies are worthless.
[01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:44.721]  They don't serve anyone.
[01:02:44.721 --> 01:02:47.403]  They only serve those who lie just once.
[01:02:47.403 --> 01:02:48.805]  They're useful for whoever lies just once.
[01:02:48.805 --> 01:02:49.866]  When the lies keep being repeated,
[01:03:02.443 --> 01:03:09.627]  Well, that person who lies only underscores the fact that the person lying is a liar.
[01:03:09.627 --> 01:03:21.254]  While the United Nations picked the winners and losers in a narrative fomenting World War, a totalitarian narrative that chooses to ignore the investigation that never had a chance.
[01:03:21.574 --> 01:03:30.899]  The organizers of the aggression didn't even wait for the elementary establishment of facts by an international organization which was authorized to do that.
[01:03:30.899 --> 01:03:35.701]  They supposedly determined everything for themselves and determined who was guilty.
[01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:40.824]  We can all see that a Russian disinformation campaign is in full force this morning.
[01:03:40.824 --> 01:03:45.887]  But Russia's desperate attempts at deflection cannot change the facts.
[01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:55.151]  A large body of information indicates that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in Douma on April 7th.
[01:03:55.151 --> 01:04:00.333]  There is clear information demonstrating Assad's culpability.
[01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:03.934]  The pictures of dead children were not fake news.
[01:04:03.934 --> 01:04:07.896]  They were the result of the Syrian regime's barbaric inhumanity.
[01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:12.637]  I believe there was a chemical attack and we're looking for the actual evidence.
[01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:15.338]  The Pentagon's lies about that investigation.
[01:04:15.338 --> 01:04:19.140]  Why didn't you wait for that investigation to end?
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:28.483]  Well, let's remember that OPCW and others have been blocked from entering Gouda and Douma.
[01:04:29.415 --> 01:04:44.465]  And the video evidence that the FSA were staging chemical weapons attack training simulations based on the hope and hubris of the globalist technocratic machine's notion that most of us are too stupid to notice their deception.
[01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:51.790]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:56.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with the former head of policy at the Department of Treasury.
[01:04:58.467 --> 01:05:07.957]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:12.661]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:14.163]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:14.523]  I think?
[01:05:34.025 --> 01:05:39.389]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:44.412]  Read the facts at Infowarslife.com about Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[01:05:44.412 --> 01:05:50.357]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:05:50.357 --> 01:05:52.478]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:05:52.478 --> 01:05:55.100]  Visit Infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:11.173 --> 01:06:13.816]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:13.816 --> 01:06:15.237]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.352]  Well, Trump has been far from perfect.
[01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.433]  But they say you know a man by his enemies.
[01:06:23.433 --> 01:06:25.614]  The globalists have hated him so much.
[01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.735]  They try to destroy Infowars viciously.
[01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:32.577]  Because I've supported Trump because he got us a decent Supreme Court justice.
[01:06:32.577 --> 01:06:35.959]  He was trying to bring billions of dollars a year of jobs back.
[01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:42.302]  He's gotten trillions of dollars in commitments, hundreds of billions in new startups.
[01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:46.024]  We've seen a lot of good jobs numbers and things.
[01:06:46.024 --> 01:06:46.365]  We've got a
[01:06:47.305 --> 01:07:06.240]  Great economist joining right now to actually look at that, but when you then see his tweets, hundreds of them, I've got right here, we'll go over some of them, where he says the rebels have been caught launching chemical attacks, Hillary founded ISIS, Obama founded ISIS, they invaded Syria, we shouldn't be their air force.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:12.505]  We had all these debates five years ago, and four years ago, and three years ago, and two years ago in the campaign.
[01:07:12.505 --> 01:07:14.927]  So then he announces two weeks ago we're going to pull out.
[01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:32.603]  A week later there's a chemical attack, right after the Russians warned the rebels were getting ready to stage it, and no one goes, wait a minute, the President says we're pulling out, the Russians are pulling out, Assad's won, the British Head of Special Forces came out and said, I don't believe Assad did this, he doesn't have the motive.
[01:07:32.603 --> 01:07:33.904]  The rebels have done this before.
[01:07:33.904 --> 01:07:36.466]  Two British ambassadors have said that.
[01:07:36.466 --> 01:07:38.888]  Ron Paul has said that.
[01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:43.812]  We got internal Google documents last year where they wanted to delist myself and Ron Paul, Google admitted they were real.
[01:07:45.526 --> 01:07:52.249]  Because, quote, we put out the fake news that rebels have been caught doing chemical attacks and that we were helping Assad.
[01:07:52.249 --> 01:08:05.236]  It was a multi-million dollar contract to delist us, which you've seen much of myself and Ron Paul off Google, because they were directed by the deep state that runs Google.
[01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:06.337]  I mean, that's on record.
[01:08:07.341 --> 01:08:10.624]  And coordinates with it to shut us up ahead of this.
[01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:14.367]  And now Trump, as I said he would do Friday, that's why I flipped out.
[01:08:14.367 --> 01:08:23.635]  I said, of course this isn't World War III, but now this will invite the rebels to stage more, more, more, more, and more sanctions on Russia until Russia responds.
[01:08:23.635 --> 01:08:26.438]  And that's what a lot of the neocons like John Bolton want.
[01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:34.247]  And someone predicting this is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, best-selling author, paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:40.432]  He's the father of Reaganomics, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and so much more.
[01:08:40.432 --> 01:08:42.574]  And he joins us to talk about this.
[01:08:42.574 --> 01:08:45.437]  He's been on some of the biggest think tanks in D.C.
[01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:46.518]  as well.
[01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:48.220]  He's former editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:08:49.395 --> 01:08:58.257]  This is really, really bad, and I just don't think some of my audience that's mad at me for being mad at Trump understands this is not blowing up one base last year.
[01:08:58.257 --> 01:09:07.818]  This signifies, as Haley said over the weekend, we're locked and loaded, we're ready to go, we want to topple Assad, and the Russians have said that's a red line.
[01:09:07.818 --> 01:09:14.040]  Now maybe the Pentagon thinks Russia's going to blink, but we're going to remove Assad to put al-Qaeda and ISIS in charge?
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.400]  This is so immoral!
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:15.740]  And again,
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.163]  If Trump didn't have a history of understanding this, it wouldn't be as bad in the balance, Dr. Roberts, but we've read his tweets.
[01:09:22.163 --> 01:09:25.164]  We're going to show some of them now while you speak.
[01:09:25.164 --> 01:09:26.465]  What in the world's going on?
[01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:30.867]  Has he been compromised by the raid on his lawyer?
[01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:34.229]  I don't know if it was the raid on the lawyer.
[01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:45.594]  He's clearly under attack, or has been, from the military security complex because of his original statement that he would normalize relations with Russia.
[01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:52.769]  That statement was a huge threat to the budget and the power of the military security complex.
[01:09:52.769 --> 01:10:02.863]  And that's where Russiagate and all the other false accusations that have been used against Trump to force him into a militarist position.
[01:10:04.008 --> 01:10:16.632]  So that he now seems to be part of the military security complex that he was going to offend by normalizing relations.
[01:10:16.632 --> 01:10:22.274]  So instead, we have the worst relations ever with Russia.
[01:10:22.274 --> 01:10:28.616]  So I do think he's compromised, but I don't know that has anything to do with his lawyer.
[01:10:30.529 --> 01:10:48.197]  But undoubtedly, if you look at the incredible Russiagate propaganda in the news, that's meant to put pressure on Trump so he can't have good relations with Russia, and I believe has driven him into the arms of the military-industrial complex that then placed a good cop and says, sure, we'll show them you're not with Russia.
[01:10:48.197 --> 01:10:52.319]  We'll basically put more troops on their border, sanctions, new sanctions every week.
[01:10:52.319 --> 01:10:55.360]  I mean, I think that goes into the calculus.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.202]  Yes, that's what I meant by he's been compromised, yes.
[01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:17.559]  You know, Alex, what's so disturbing about this is the willingness of the top officials in the United States government to lie through their teeth, to tell blatant, transparent lies to the whole world.
[01:11:17.559 --> 01:11:24.341]  And what's even more worrisome is the world sits there and doesn't say, why don't you stop lying to us?
[01:11:24.341 --> 01:11:25.762]  We don't believe you.
[01:11:25.762 --> 01:11:28.583]  They act as if the Americans are telling them the truth.
[01:11:30.047 --> 01:11:32.809]  And it's an extraordinary thing.
[01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:44.577]  So when the Russians actually raise real questions and ask, you know, provide real evidence, they're said to be engaging in propaganda.
[01:11:44.577 --> 01:11:52.903]  But when Nikki Haley, for example, lies through her teeth, she's telling the truth.
[01:11:52.903 --> 01:11:53.864]  Assad's guilty.
[01:11:54.868 --> 01:11:56.029]  Russia is guilty.
[01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:58.311]  We don't need any evidence.
[01:11:58.311 --> 01:12:01.593]  You see, they never give you any evidence.
[01:12:01.593 --> 01:12:04.655]  There was never any evidence of anything.
[01:12:04.655 --> 01:12:13.301]  Of the Malaysian airliner shot down, the scarab for poisoning, any of the alleged chemical attacks.
[01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:20.093]  It appears that this last alleged chemical attack by Assad didn't take place.
[01:12:20.093 --> 01:12:21.735]  There was no chemical attack at all.
[01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:28.805]  It wasn't even a chemical attack staged by the mercenaries that the CIA has there.
[01:12:29.065 --> 01:12:40.318]  I was about to say, I mean we showed some footage earlier, and we have a government that got caught lying about babies out of incubators, had a fake actress go up and say it all, it was really, you know, 20 and said she was 15 or whatever.
[01:12:40.318 --> 01:12:47.246]  So we have a right to question all these, and I'm sure chemical attacks happen, but we showed footage earlier where, I mean, it looks like
[01:12:47.987 --> 01:12:52.231]  Bad acting out of, you know, a high school play of the people collapsing from nerve gas.
[01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:53.812]  And they're saying it's VX.
[01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:59.196]  As anyone knows, even get around VX, even treat people that have been VXed, it kills you.
[01:12:59.196 --> 01:13:04.281]  So, I mean, this whole thing, the white helmets have been caught chopping people's heads off.
[01:13:04.281 --> 01:13:07.343]  They've been caught working for Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:13:07.343 --> 01:13:08.164]  It's just insane.
[01:13:09.773 --> 01:13:23.702]  Oh yeah, the White Helmets are an American propaganda organization and their function is to pretend that there's been a chemical attack or some such thing and to film it.
[01:13:23.702 --> 01:13:27.525]  Quite clearly, there's no chemical attack.
[01:13:27.525 --> 01:13:31.548]  The people who are allegedly treating them don't have gloves on.
[01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:33.169]  That's fake.
[01:13:35.971 --> 01:13:39.214]  And how come he falls over but not the other guy?
[01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:42.096]  Well, did you see how he winks at the camera before he falls over?
[01:13:42.096 --> 01:13:43.758]  Yeah.
[01:13:43.758 --> 01:13:48.502]  And then we're not even supposed to... I mean, it's insane!
[01:13:48.502 --> 01:13:53.507]  Well, people fall for this because they don't know.
[01:13:53.507 --> 01:13:58.452]  They don't know what a real chemical attack is like, and so they fall for it.
[01:14:00.112 --> 01:14:03.093]  Just like they fell for the Boston Marathon bombing.
[01:14:03.093 --> 01:14:05.514]  Just like they fall for all of these things.
[01:14:05.514 --> 01:14:06.355]  Because they don't know.
[01:14:06.355 --> 01:14:13.998]  They have no experience and they live in virtual reality.
[01:14:13.998 --> 01:14:20.840]  So, but what's difficult about it, Alex, is that it's leading to war.
[01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:31.240]  The Russian government, I think, is very responsible and sidesteps these provocations.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:31.860]  Let's just say it.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:36.522]  I mean, Russia has been taking it on the chin to not start World War III.
[01:14:36.522 --> 01:14:46.206]  Yeah, they sidestep the provocation rather than take the risk that, you know, massive numbers of people will be killed.
[01:14:46.206 --> 01:14:53.149]  So, in fact, it's the Russians that are honorable and have a moral conscience.
[01:14:54.604 --> 01:15:09.736]  And are taking it on the chin, and not because they're afraid of us, certainly not in a Syrian context, but because they realize they're dealing with psychopaths.
[01:15:09.736 --> 01:15:18.543]  If you look at the United States in the last 17 years, it has destroyed, in whole or part, seven countries.
[01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:26.443]  There's millions of dead, maimed, orphaned, dispossessed Muslims.
[01:15:26.443 --> 01:15:30.069]  And so the Russians know they're dealing with psychopaths.
[01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:39.786]  And so they keep sidestepping these provocations because they don't want to see the world go up in a massive war.
[01:15:39.786 --> 01:15:40.987]  I agree.
[01:15:40.987 --> 01:15:44.348]  Let's stop here and come back and break this down.
[01:15:44.348 --> 01:15:46.149]  And to be clear, there are real chemical attacks.
[01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:47.230]  There are real things that happen.
[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.091]  Some of these attacks have killed people.
[01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:54.913]  It's just the White Helmets and others have been caught also staging PR stunts that they show to exacerbate and tag on to things.
[01:15:54.913 --> 01:15:55.554]  And they've been caught.
[01:15:55.554 --> 01:15:56.054]  That's a fact.
[01:15:57.287 --> 01:15:59.168]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:59.168 --> 01:16:02.390]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:16:16.919 --> 01:16:18.360]  Or warm and served.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.401]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.

[01:19:01.965 --> 01:19:09.030]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.

[01:19:14.534 --> 01:19:17.015]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.

[01:20:01.354 --> 01:20:13.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:17.504]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:17.504 --> 01:20:20.766]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.766 --> 01:20:27.610]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, back when it was a real newspaper, is here.
[01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:29.752]  Also the father of Reaganomics and much more.
[01:20:30.765 --> 01:20:34.286]  We were showing some footage of one of the reported latest chemical attacks.
[01:20:34.286 --> 01:20:37.127]  The rebels have been caught launching real chemical attacks.
[01:20:37.127 --> 01:20:40.248]  The whole Arab Spring has killed over a million people.
[01:20:40.248 --> 01:20:41.069]  It's a horrible crime.
[01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:43.309]  Women are being sold as sex slaves in Libya again.
[01:20:43.309 --> 01:20:44.830]  So there's real suffering.
[01:20:45.794 --> 01:20:59.839]  But if you get into the Middle East, and the whole history of them staging things for PR purposes, and the White Helmets have been caught re-enacting attacks and things like that, and our media puts it out as real, you cannot deny this latest footage is fake.
[01:20:59.839 --> 01:21:02.480]  In fact, let's just back it up for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.522]  So you have one of the supposed doctors, pro-rebel activist, appear to have staged
[01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:13.123]  Last hug photo, it went viral, claiming to show young victims of the Doma gas attack in their last embrace.
[01:21:13.123 --> 01:21:22.486]  Victims can be clearly seen on two separate floors in aftermath footage, placed in positions at collection identification point.
[01:21:22.486 --> 01:21:23.226]  Very, very sad.
[01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:29.028]  I don't even make jokes about that, because there have been some real chemical attacks, and it always goes back to the rebels.
[01:21:29.028 --> 01:21:31.149]  But here's some of this footage.
[01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:32.370]  Back it up slowly for TV viewers.
[01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:33.530]  I'm going to scrub it for radio listeners.
[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:35.991]  Okay, here's the supposed doctor.
[01:21:37.096 --> 01:21:40.678]  Pumping air into the young boy who is supposedly convulsing there.
[01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:46.422]  Now look, he winks at the camera person, looks over at the other doctor like, get ready.
[01:21:46.422 --> 01:21:48.683]  He falls back.
[01:21:48.683 --> 01:21:52.286]  Both cameras then zoom in right as he falls back.
[01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:53.026]  Oh!
[01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:54.487]  In between the two children.
[01:21:54.487 --> 01:21:56.969]  And the other little kid there starts laughing.
[01:21:56.969 --> 01:22:02.012]  He stops convulsing and starts laughing and smiling because this is so ridiculous.
[01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:02.953]  But there you go.
[01:22:04.031 --> 01:22:08.016]  Notice, he falls back from the chemical attack, but not the other doctors.
[01:22:08.016 --> 01:22:11.121]  Now, the media will say Jones says no chemical attacks ever happened.
[01:22:11.121 --> 01:22:18.210]  Oh no, our CIA in the 1980s trained Saddam on how to spray folks with a gas in the Iran-Iraq war.
[01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:19.321]  Yes.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.402]  Secretary of Defense Mattis saying we don't have evidence that they launched it.
[01:22:38.402 --> 01:22:40.023]  We had him the day after at the U.N.
[01:22:40.023 --> 01:22:40.743]  saying it.
[01:22:40.743 --> 01:22:42.785]  But then that night, an attack is launched.
[01:22:42.785 --> 01:22:45.046]  And we have that clip from John Bowne's report queued up.
[01:22:45.046 --> 01:22:52.570]  I want to play a little excerpt of this because we went from we don't know they did it, the rebels have done it before, to Trump strikes.
[01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:54.872]  And our media then just started saying Assad did it.
[01:22:54.872 --> 01:22:59.314]  So our media was halfway admitting that, OK, there's no proof.
[01:22:59.314 --> 01:23:01.556]  But then as soon as the strikes happened, it's fake news.
[01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:03.017]  If we say investigate, here it is.
[01:23:03.857 --> 01:23:08.982]  We can all see that a Russian disinformation campaign is in full force this morning.
[01:23:08.982 --> 01:23:15.048]  But Russia's desperate attempts at deflection cannot change the facts.
[01:23:15.048 --> 01:23:23.336]  A large body of information indicates that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in Douma on April 7th.
[01:23:23.336 --> 01:23:27.459]  There is clear information demonstrating Assad's culpability.
[01:23:28.499 --> 01:23:32.102]  The pictures of dead children were not fake news.
[01:23:32.102 --> 01:23:36.866]  They were the result of the Syrian regime's barbaric inhumanity.
[01:23:36.866 --> 01:23:42.550]  I believe there was a chemical attack and we're looking for the actual evidence.
[01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:56.312]  Green regime's barbaric inhumanity.
[01:23:56.312 --> 01:24:00.294]  I believe there was a chemical attack and we're looking for the actual evidence.
[01:24:00.294 --> 01:24:02.955]  The Pentagon's lies about that investigation.
[01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:06.777]  Why didn't you wait for that investigation to end?
[01:24:06.777 --> 01:24:16.102]  Well, let's remember that OPCW and others have been blocked from entering Gouda and Douma.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:32.098]  And the video evidence that the FSA were staging chemical weapons attack training simulations based on the hope and hubris of the globalist technocratic machine's notion that most of us are too stupid to notice their deception.
[01:24:32.098 --> 01:24:35.181]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:24:36.232 --> 01:24:38.673]  All right, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:43.974]  We're looking at all of this, and it's very, very sick to fake this stuff.
[01:24:43.974 --> 01:24:45.555]  We know some of it's been real in the past.
[01:24:45.555 --> 01:24:47.855]  The rebels have been caught doing it.
[01:24:47.855 --> 01:24:51.776]  But that's why we have to question this, because our government's been caught, other governments doing this so much.
[01:24:51.776 --> 01:24:56.678]  Trump talked about how Hillary was the head of ISIS and al-Qaeda, along with Obama, and how
[01:24:57.718 --> 01:24:59.159]  All of this has been going on.
[01:24:59.159 --> 01:25:02.082]  He suddenly appears to be going with the neocons.
[01:25:02.082 --> 01:25:03.703]  How can we avert this?
[01:25:03.703 --> 01:25:05.225]  What does this signify?
[01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:07.927]  The deep state's only intensifying their attack on Trump.
[01:25:07.927 --> 01:25:12.231]  If he's rolling over to them, why?
[01:25:12.231 --> 01:25:14.052]  You're asking me that question.
[01:25:14.052 --> 01:25:16.874]  There are two reasons.
[01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:25.462]  One, Israel intends to use the American military to destabilize Syria and Iran.
[01:25:26.306 --> 01:25:30.087]  Just as occurred in Libya and Iraq.
[01:25:30.087 --> 01:25:47.093]  And the reason is that Syria and Iran supply Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that has twice chased the Israeli army out of southern Lebanon, which Israel has tried to occupy because they want the water resources.
[01:25:47.953 --> 01:25:59.637]  So if Syria and Iran are destabilized, there's no one to supply Hezbollah and the Israeli army would be able to occupy southern Lebanon.
[01:25:59.637 --> 01:26:00.537]  That's one reason.
[01:26:00.537 --> 01:26:05.519]  And of course, the neoconservatives are tightly allied with Israel.
[01:26:05.519 --> 01:26:08.459]  Many of them are joint Israeli citizens.
[01:26:08.459 --> 01:26:16.162]  The other part of the answer is that the neoconservatives have an ideology of American world hegemony.
[01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:24.125]  The easiest place for them to practice that, to establish that, is the Middle East.
[01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:38.457]  And they were succeeding until the Russians stepped in at Assad's request to help the Syrian army clear out the mercenaries that the United States had armed and sent there, calling them rebels.
[01:26:39.495 --> 01:26:46.077]  And so the neoconservatives do not want to give up their hedge enemy.
[01:26:46.077 --> 01:26:50.759]  They can't stand to be defeated on that score.
[01:26:50.759 --> 01:26:54.340]  And so the attacks on Syria are going to continue.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.281]  This is not over.
[01:26:56.281 --> 01:27:04.524]  And it'd be a mistake for the Russians to think that this is over, that the fake attack that was pulled off the other night is the end of it.
[01:27:06.016 --> 01:27:15.678]  I don't think the Russians fully appreciate that when they step aside from these confrontations, they encourage more confrontations.
[01:27:15.678 --> 01:27:19.059]  And I think the provocations will get worse.
[01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:23.520]  And I see in this a highly dangerous situation.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:34.843]  If the Russians had very firmly put their foot down and said no attack, not even a fake attack that we agreed to so Trump can save face, no attack.
[01:27:36.179 --> 01:27:47.142]  Then this would have forced, I think, the Congress to come up and ask Trump why he was taking the nation to war when they had not been consulted.
[01:27:47.142 --> 01:27:50.522]  And that probably would have stopped the whole enterprise.
[01:27:50.522 --> 01:27:52.003]  But it's going to continue.
[01:27:52.003 --> 01:27:57.664]  It's going to get worse and worse until finally the Russians have to respond in some major way.
[01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:07.191]  And that, of course, will have a much greater danger in World War III than had they stopped this make-believe attack.
[01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:12.853]  And I totally agree with you, and I voted for Trump amongst all the reasons, mainly because he was right on Syria.
[01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:14.854]  I understood this trigger of the danger.
[01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:18.095]  Russia and others were told, hey, it's just so they get off my back, so we said okay.
[01:28:18.795 --> 01:28:19.615]  Look forward to it, Alex.
[01:28:40.984 --> 01:28:42.206]  Hopefully there's not a nuclear war.
[01:28:42.206 --> 01:28:45.169]  We'll be back with Steve Pucinich.

[01:32:32.919 --> 01:32:34.280]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.942]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:32:35.942 --> 01:32:37.083]  And I love you guys.

[01:32:53.778 --> 01:33:01.443]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.735 --> 01:33:45.295]  You know, we've got a lot of folks working at the office that were in the military, and some of them were, you know, involved in not just your standard special operations stuff, but some of the most elite groups out there, and they've heard me talk about this fact on air, and they go, you're absolutely right, Alex, you should talk more about that.
[01:33:46.337 --> 01:33:54.019]  Only because I followed C-SPAN, I interviewed Dr. Doug Rockey, the DU expert, I've interviewed the other top head of the U.S.
[01:33:54.019 --> 01:33:56.500]  chemical weapons program.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:03.922]  That is the removal and destruction process that got appointed by Congress 20-plus years ago to try to get rid of it.
[01:34:03.922 --> 01:34:13.685]  And they couldn't even get rid of it at Anderson, Alabama, because even incinerators that have special filters, it was still getting out and making people really sick in the town and killing workers.
[01:34:16.551 --> 01:34:30.440]  And in 1991, hundreds of chemical sites that Saddam had got blown up, including Kamasia, that was the biggest chemical weapons dump in the world at one site.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.043]  And remember, chemical weapons detectors 500 miles away went off.
[01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:35.504]  The tanks had the special tape on them.
[01:34:36.803 --> 01:34:40.065]  Where if they hit chemicals, it puts a stripe down them.
[01:34:40.065 --> 01:34:41.026]  And they said, oh, don't worry.
[01:34:41.026 --> 01:34:43.567]  And a lot of people fell down, had convulsions, got sick.
[01:34:43.567 --> 01:34:49.431]  It was low exposure, but tens of thousands then got neurological disorders the next year and died.
[01:34:49.431 --> 01:34:52.313]  And I watched the congressional hearings.
[01:34:52.313 --> 01:34:58.137]  Back in high school and college, I turned into a soap opera person when I was studying.
[01:34:58.137 --> 01:35:01.919]  Especially in college, where I would watch C-SPAN as a soap opera.
[01:35:01.919 --> 01:35:03.961]  Then I watched the Waco stuff, but before that,
[01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:06.591]  The Waco hearings.
[01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:13.653]  I watched the Congressional hearings on Gulf War illness and they knew it was the chemical weapons from Kamachia and they admitted it.
[01:35:13.653 --> 01:35:20.396]  They'd have Marine Corps majors in there going, you know, here's a picture of me just two years ago and I weighed 250 pounds in perfect shape.
[01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:21.356]  Now I can hardly talk.
[01:35:21.356 --> 01:35:22.237]  I'm in a wheelchair.
[01:35:22.237 --> 01:35:24.558]  We ought to pull that famous footage up.
[01:35:24.558 --> 01:35:27.659]  And he goes, and you know, half my unit is already dead or dying.
[01:35:27.659 --> 01:35:31.260]  Don't tell me that it's an imaginary illness.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.641]  Now, why do I raise all that?
[01:35:34.906 --> 01:35:38.568]  Because you don't blow up chemical weapons above ground.
[01:35:38.568 --> 01:35:51.856]  And that was an insane move to, quote, destroy Saddam's weapons in place, to go in and then pull out and blow up Qamishli, just a search engine Qamishli, a chemical weapons dump Iraq.
[01:35:51.856 --> 01:35:53.838]  It's very famous.
[01:35:53.838 --> 01:35:56.639]  Now, why do I raise that?
[01:35:56.639 --> 01:36:00.542]  They claim that they blew up more than six chemical weapons dumps
[01:36:02.964 --> 01:36:08.009]  Now either they didn't target chemical weapons dumps or Assad really gave up his chemical weapons like he agreed to five years ago.
[01:36:08.009 --> 01:36:14.676]  Because you don't bomb chemical weapons dumps and not have, like last year they said they bombed that chemical weapons dump at the airfield.
[01:36:14.676 --> 01:36:17.799]  49 cruise missiles hit it.
[01:36:17.799 --> 01:36:22.784]  And there was a town a couple hundred yards away.
[01:36:22.784 --> 01:36:26.207]  The airfield's built in a town.
[01:36:26.207 --> 01:36:26.968]  Nobody died.
[01:36:29.434 --> 01:36:42.102]  You rupture one of those VX or sarin nerve gas containers, one of those shells, you're going to have a whole town of people dead and dying.
[01:36:42.102 --> 01:36:44.123]  So, we've got Dr. Steve Pchenik joining us.
[01:36:44.123 --> 01:36:46.925]  He's been to Syria, knew the father Assad, didn't like him.
[01:36:46.925 --> 01:36:49.267]  Got arrested by him, knows his son.
[01:36:49.267 --> 01:36:49.767]  Covered all this.
[01:36:49.767 --> 01:36:58.473]  Friday he was on, we were pretty happy that, look, they weren't going to strike because Madison said no evidence and Trump was saying, I never said I'd hit him.
[01:36:59.571 --> 01:37:01.552]  And then they hit him.
[01:37:01.552 --> 01:37:04.834]  Have they turned the president?
[01:37:04.834 --> 01:37:05.774]  Because we know they hate him.
[01:37:05.774 --> 01:37:06.715]  We know he's a nationalist.
[01:37:06.715 --> 01:37:08.115]  We know he's bringing the country back.
[01:37:08.115 --> 01:37:12.117]  I love Trump, but I'm not going to go against my morals and facts.
[01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:16.440]  We have Trump in hundreds of tweets saying the rebels have staged chemical attacks.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.241]  Don't go in there.
[01:37:18.241 --> 01:37:19.941]  It's a quagmire.
[01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:23.003]  The rebels are worse than Assad.
[01:37:23.003 --> 01:37:24.184]  So what has changed?
[01:37:24.184 --> 01:37:26.785]  And now people said, Alex, settle down Friday night.
[01:37:29.141 --> 01:37:33.203]  When I start to think all my sacrifice is going to get lost.
[01:37:33.203 --> 01:37:36.744]  If Trump sinks, I'm getting angry because he was really doing a good job.
[01:37:36.744 --> 01:37:40.986]  And this is a serious blow because I'm ready to lose everything, my life, you name it.
[01:37:40.986 --> 01:37:41.886]  I'm not just bragging.
[01:37:41.886 --> 01:37:46.709]  People know that I am totally committed and feel great as long as we're winning.
[01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:54.932]  But man, when we start losing, then I fundamentally really do start going crazy.
[01:37:54.932 --> 01:37:56.393]  Because this is a war, folks.
[01:37:57.878 --> 01:37:59.640]  We got troops on the Russian border.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.663]  Our government overthrew Ukraine.
[01:38:01.663 --> 01:38:11.375]  I get America First and all that, but not to replace it with Al Qaeda and ISIS and cause a big civil war where a bunch of US troops get killed.
[01:38:11.375 --> 01:38:12.937]  Assad's moving towards stepping down.
[01:38:12.937 --> 01:38:15.700]  He said that that would be what they would do after it was defeated.
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:16.701]  Trump declares victory.
[01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:21.580]  Russia declares victory, we start pulling out, and then a week later this happens.
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:22.580]  How obvious is this?
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.861]  I know that Steve McShannock has a lot of great sources in the Pentagon, you name it.
[01:38:26.861 --> 01:38:30.581]  My sources say, last Friday, the drums are beating.
[01:38:30.581 --> 01:38:33.502]  They said, Alex, it's going to continue with more sanctions, more calls for strikes.
[01:38:33.502 --> 01:38:36.142]  They're going to encourage the rebels to launch more strikes.
[01:38:36.142 --> 01:38:39.703]  This is a nightmare scenario, and that more is coming.
[01:38:39.703 --> 01:38:42.083]  My listeners, some of them, are like, oh, Jones, don't fear monger.
[01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:44.544]  That's not happening.
[01:38:44.544 --> 01:38:45.564]  That's not happening at all.
[01:38:46.983 --> 01:38:47.984]  You guys found the U.S.
[01:38:47.984 --> 01:38:49.385]  Congressional hearings on Camasilla.
[01:38:49.385 --> 01:38:50.086]  Wow, good job.
[01:38:50.086 --> 01:38:55.190]  On... On... On YouTube.
[01:38:55.190 --> 01:38:56.471]  Amazing.
[01:38:56.471 --> 01:38:57.772]  So we'll have to play some of those sometimes.
[01:38:57.772 --> 01:39:00.174]  Yeah, the secret casualties of Iraq's abandoned chemical weapons.
[01:39:00.174 --> 01:39:00.795]  Yeah.
[01:39:00.795 --> 01:39:02.296]  Abandoned because you blew them up.
[01:39:02.296 --> 01:39:02.697]  Yeah.
[01:39:02.697 --> 01:39:05.479]  Well, there's the... Remember back when the New York Times actually reported some truth?
[01:39:05.479 --> 01:39:06.520]  There is the mushroom cloud.
[01:39:09.244 --> 01:39:11.105]  Just click on the photo, that's how you'll get it.
[01:39:11.105 --> 01:39:12.366]  There's the mushroom cloud from Kamasuya.
[01:39:12.366 --> 01:39:15.007]  It can be seen 50 miles away.
[01:39:15.007 --> 01:39:16.428]  We go to Steve Pichinik.
[01:39:16.428 --> 01:39:20.871]  Steve, I imagine you're pretty hot on this, or you may have some intel we don't have.
[01:39:20.871 --> 01:39:21.931]  What is going on with Trump?
[01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:36.040]  This is the first big sideways flip-flop move I've seen, and if it was some other area, it wouldn't be that big a deal, because, you know, he's not God, he's not a dictator, but this is something he was in control of as the president, and at 180 now, what's going on?
[01:39:37.952 --> 01:39:41.455]  Well, number one, we're not going to war, Alex.
[01:39:41.455 --> 01:39:56.806]  Number two, whatever you've seen in terms of the strike or the non-strike, you have to look at it if in fact there was a gas attack by Bashar in terms of proportionality.
[01:39:56.806 --> 01:40:02.910]  What I really have to say is we are not interested in remaining in Syria.
[01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:05.312]  We really don't care about Syria.
[01:40:05.312 --> 01:40:06.833]  I've said it a long time ago.
[01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:10.252]  I was part of that product.
[01:40:10.252 --> 01:40:13.433]  Our military, in fact, is part of that product.
[01:40:13.433 --> 01:40:19.655]  And when you read the headlines very carefully, Alex, it says we hit the heart.
[01:40:19.655 --> 01:40:23.516]  And if you look at the word heart, it's in quotation marks.
[01:40:23.516 --> 01:40:28.918]  Now, why would the New York Times quote Jim Mattis, a brilliant
[01:40:29.605 --> 01:40:37.249]  Secretary of Defense and a general who in fact has been in combat, has had massive attacks.
[01:40:37.249 --> 01:40:40.570]  Why would he use the word HAR?
[01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:41.250]  You tell me.
[01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:45.752]  Go ahead.
[01:40:45.752 --> 01:40:46.633]  No, you tell me.
[01:40:47.361 --> 01:40:48.962]  Yeah, you brought this up.
[01:40:48.962 --> 01:40:52.005]  You said, and that reason why I came on was this.
[01:40:52.005 --> 01:40:56.609]  Well, after I heard what you said last night and all, I'm not defending anybody.
[01:40:56.609 --> 01:41:04.596]  But what I want to know is how is it that all of your guests immediately knew that we were going into combat?
[01:41:04.596 --> 01:41:09.720]  We had kinetic warfare and all of this was ready when in fact, none of this was ready.
[01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:21.475]  Well, the fact that they're saying they're locked and loaded, and Haley's saying we need to have more strikes, and the fact that they're saying more sanctions on Russia, I mean, Zack's a good guess.
[01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:22.956]  I know exactly who he is.
[01:41:22.956 --> 01:41:28.699]  And certainly, obviously, when you start striking Russian installations, you've got to be ready for a counterattack.
[01:41:28.699 --> 01:41:33.862]  And so to say that CENTCOM and all that wasn't ready for war, I think that's another canard.
[01:41:33.862 --> 01:41:35.362]  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:41:35.362 --> 01:41:37.503]  What Russian installations was hit?
[01:41:39.295 --> 01:41:46.118]  Well, they've given a whole list of some of these Russian airfields they said could have been delivering these and these so-called chemical weapons production dumps.
[01:41:46.118 --> 01:41:48.759]  Well, go back and answer my question first.
[01:41:48.759 --> 01:41:49.879]  Chemical weapons.
[01:41:49.879 --> 01:41:50.920]  Do you blow those up?
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.541]  Do you really believe we struck chemical weapons bunkers?
[01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.721]  No.
[01:41:55.721 --> 01:41:56.762]  Okay, well the news says we did.
[01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:11.850]  I don't care what the news said, I'm on your show, but basically I was there under Schultz when I saw very clearly that we, the United States, provided Saddam Hussein with all the chemical weapons and we said they were his.
[01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.551]  No, they were ours.
[01:42:13.551 --> 01:42:25.201]  Many of the guys who were in the Iraq war didn't just get sick from the chemical weapons, they got sick from something the military didn't want to talk about, which was irradiated shells that go through tanks.
[01:42:25.201 --> 01:42:26.302]  To you, yeah, that was a big part of it.
[01:42:27.330 --> 01:42:30.412]  Well, no, that's a big, big issue.
[01:42:30.412 --> 01:42:34.234]  We did a hundred shows with Dr. Doug Rockey.
[01:42:34.234 --> 01:42:36.555]  He was the head of the DU program, we know.
[01:42:36.555 --> 01:42:39.016]  I'm trying to get Alex.
[01:42:39.016 --> 01:42:40.097]  I'm not playing games with you.
[01:42:40.097 --> 01:42:53.984]  I came on the show to basically say, when a Secretary of Defense and the President puts down, in quotation marks, the head of chemical industry, what does that really mean?
[01:42:53.984 --> 01:42:54.985]  I'll come back and talk about it.
[01:42:57.469 --> 01:43:00.491]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:43:00.491 --> 01:43:04.693]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:43:04.693 --> 01:43:11.377]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:43:11.377 --> 01:43:15.140]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:29.705]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[01:43:29.705 --> 01:43:35.908]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:43:35.908 --> 01:43:39.469]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:43:40.029 --> 01:43:51.259]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:43:51.259 --> 01:43:57.224]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:43:57.224 --> 01:43:59.586]  InfoWars Live is launching its newest product.

[01:45:15.811 --> 01:45:18.332]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:45:18.332 --> 01:45:22.554]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:45:22.554 --> 01:45:24.995]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.

[01:47:28.339 --> 01:47:29.720]  Let's go live!
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:30.741]  Woo!
[01:47:30.741 --> 01:47:35.225]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:35.225 --> 01:47:38.007]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.007 --> 01:47:38.768]  Show coming up!
[01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:43.871]  Russians reveal they're planning major retaliation against U.S.
[01:47:43.871 --> 01:47:46.392]  as World War III fears rise.
[01:47:46.392 --> 01:47:48.473]  So that's a scary headline.
[01:47:48.473 --> 01:47:51.234]  Russia reveals they're planning major retaliation against U.S.
[01:47:51.234 --> 01:47:53.615]  as World War III fears rise.
[01:47:53.615 --> 01:47:58.336]  That's the Sunday Express, RT, state-run Russian media.
[01:47:58.336 --> 01:48:00.077]  Moscow is irrefutable evidence.
[01:48:00.077 --> 01:48:01.557]  Kim attacked in Syria.
[01:48:01.557 --> 01:48:03.438]  Indoma was staged.
[01:48:03.438 --> 01:48:05.439]  Russian envoy to OPCW.
[01:48:06.755 --> 01:48:11.580]  Trump wanted to bomb Russian and Iranian targets amidst Syrian strikes, report.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:23.272]  And 71 of the 100-plus missiles reportedly got shut down by Soviet-era anti-aircraft systems, when the word is we were using very old, antiquated cruise missiles they're just getting rid of because they're all basically
[01:48:24.562 --> 01:48:25.703]  Have their expiration date.
[01:48:25.703 --> 01:48:27.444]  I'm not saying that to go, our missiles are good.
[01:48:27.444 --> 01:48:29.746]  Trump says, oh, really good ones, really fast ones coming.
[01:48:29.746 --> 01:48:33.288]  He's just dumped a bunch of crappy, junky ones on it for a PR function.
[01:48:33.288 --> 01:48:34.569]  I get all that.
[01:48:34.569 --> 01:48:36.411]  But Trump is being, Patrionic's laughing.
[01:48:36.411 --> 01:48:37.251]  I already know all this stuff.
[01:48:37.251 --> 01:48:40.654]  The point is, they are sucking us into a larger war.
[01:48:40.654 --> 01:48:41.995]  The globalists are out of their minds.
[01:48:41.995 --> 01:48:43.716]  The very same people gave us all these wars.
[01:48:43.716 --> 01:48:50.060]  We'll talk to Patrionic here in just a minute, who's got some really weird pornographic Hulk art.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.261]  It's like these military things.
[01:48:52.622 --> 01:48:57.066]  People that look like demons or vampire bats that are green, hauling naked women around.
[01:48:57.066 --> 01:48:59.868]  I'm going to ask him, is this some of your own personal art?
[01:48:59.868 --> 01:49:03.231]  We'll talk to him in a minute, but they just reminded me.
[01:49:03.231 --> 01:49:05.472]  If you're a radio listener, there's a TV dimension to this.
[01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:08.475]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.196]  But I'll narrate the other stuff here for you.
[01:49:10.196 --> 01:49:14.399]  We got big sales that are ending today, new ones that are starting.
[01:49:14.399 --> 01:49:17.362]  We have a three-month high-quality, storable food supply.
[01:49:19.648 --> 01:49:26.493]  At very, very low affordable price for my patronage supply, private label by InfoWars, so we can get around the contractual agreements they have and get it even lower.
[01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:35.479]  It's called InfoWars Select, fresh, high quality, and get a free Alexa Pure Pro high quality water filtration system with it.
[01:49:35.479 --> 01:49:42.984]  We have Supermel Vitality and Real Red Pill that are amazing, together 50% off, or Supermel by itself 50% off, we rarely do that.
[01:49:42.984 --> 01:49:49.068]  We are going to end today, X2 25% off, because I'm not sure I can even get another supply of that.
[01:49:50.165 --> 01:49:55.269]  For a while, they've already gone up on the price for us, because it comes from oil and gas drilling.
[01:49:55.269 --> 01:49:57.731]  It comes from 7 to 12,000 feet down.
[01:49:57.731 --> 01:49:59.292]  They've tried to put us over a barrel.
[01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:01.114]  We're looking for another supplier right now.
[01:50:01.114 --> 01:50:03.456]  In two years, we've not found the supplier.
[01:50:03.456 --> 01:50:08.300]  So each time we buy it, the price goes up, and I'm just not going to be put over a barrel, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:11.202]  They're like, fine, they're not going to be available anymore.
[01:50:11.202 --> 01:50:12.743]  So there you go.
[01:50:12.743 --> 01:50:14.825]  X2, this may be one of the last shipments we get.
[01:50:16.112 --> 01:50:20.133]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:20.133 --> 01:50:28.456]  And you totally checkmate Soros and the Globalists and Google trying to delist us and trying to block our advertising when you buy the products.
[01:50:28.456 --> 01:50:30.257]  So they're all there at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:30.257 --> 01:50:32.298]  And in April, double Patriot points.
[01:50:32.298 --> 01:50:36.199]  For every dollar you spend, you get five points.
[01:50:36.199 --> 01:50:40.441]  Well, right now it's ten points in rewards in your little account, totally free.
[01:50:40.441 --> 01:50:41.221]  Cancel anytime.
[01:50:43.359 --> 01:50:47.801]  That's 10% extra off future purchases.
[01:50:47.801 --> 01:50:50.223]  Free shipping on all orders, $50 or more.
[01:50:50.223 --> 01:50:52.084]  Many of the combo deals already have free shipping.
[01:50:52.084 --> 01:50:57.547]  But when you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off on coffee and things you're going to reorder, you get Patriot points.
[01:50:57.547 --> 01:51:00.928]  It's 20% off with these points we've got.
[01:51:00.928 --> 01:51:05.791]  Okay, Doc, I know you're being cryptic here, and I get what you're saying.
[01:51:05.791 --> 01:51:07.492]  Last year, I lost a lot of support with listeners.
[01:51:08.976 --> 01:51:14.340]  When Trump blew up that Russian Air Force Base and said they blew up a chemical dump.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.381]  We know that's pure crap.
[01:51:15.381 --> 01:51:17.703]  There was a town built 200 yards from it.
[01:51:17.703 --> 01:51:18.604]  Would have killed them.
[01:51:18.604 --> 01:51:21.646]  You blow up tons of chemical weapons, it kills the neighbors.
[01:51:21.646 --> 01:51:23.988]  Kills people five miles away if you blow up that much.
[01:51:23.988 --> 01:51:26.410]  If it's a windy day, as you know.
[01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:32.775]  And so, we've got this whole cocktail of DU being used, blowing up Camasilla, that hurt our troops.
[01:51:32.775 --> 01:51:36.097]  I watched congressional hearings, I saw them confirm, that's it.
[01:51:36.097 --> 01:51:38.179]  I've interviewed the experts that you were just mentioning.
[01:51:39.210 --> 01:51:46.827]  On this, though, the rhetoric immediately went to, we need more sanctions and if you do chemicals again, we're going to have a bigger response.
[01:51:46.827 --> 01:51:49.372]  And I'm not a Russophile, but at the end of the day...
[01:51:51.172 --> 01:51:56.075]  We've caught the rebels doing the chemical weapons attacks, so I'm asking you, what do you think this is really about?
[01:51:56.075 --> 01:52:02.639]  I hope you're right that this is limited like you said it would be last year, and like we thought it would be.
[01:52:02.639 --> 01:52:08.242]  And I get it, you know, it's for consumption here, and it's for optics, and they're trying to get rid of Trump.
[01:52:08.242 --> 01:52:10.804]  We don't need to play those Machiavellian games.
[01:52:10.804 --> 01:52:14.106]  We need Mueller and all these traitors to be indicted for the crimes they've committed.
[01:52:14.326 --> 01:52:20.071]  We need to have the whole out-of-control FBI law enforcement arm to get in some serious trouble.
[01:52:20.071 --> 01:52:20.851]  That's my view.
[01:52:20.851 --> 01:52:22.753]  Not placating them.
[01:52:22.753 --> 01:52:25.575]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:52:25.575 --> 01:52:27.657]  Alex, you and I agree.
[01:52:27.657 --> 01:52:35.283]  The key issue has not been, nor will it be, Syria and the Middle East, if anything.
[01:52:35.894 --> 01:52:39.796]  We want to get out of there, and we want to get out of there in total.
[01:52:39.796 --> 01:52:42.598]  We don't want to be the exemplar.
[01:52:42.598 --> 01:52:44.919]  We don't want to even be involved with Syria.
[01:52:44.919 --> 01:52:48.961]  We just have a few people there in order to maintain the stability.
[01:52:48.961 --> 01:52:51.322]  But our interests are not in Syria.
[01:52:51.322 --> 01:52:55.805]  They really are towards... And Trump has said that that's his pragmatic policy, real politic.
[01:52:55.805 --> 01:52:56.825]  I've supported it.
[01:52:56.825 --> 01:52:59.587]  Are you saying this is to placate neocons, domestic press in Israel?
[01:53:00.658 --> 01:53:10.917]  This is basically to say, look, one of the things that Trump wrote about in the art of the deal is to cover my downside or cover the downside.
[01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.300]  What would be the downside?
[01:53:13.385 --> 01:53:22.093]  For Trump in this situation where, quote, weapons of mass destruction or chemicals were used.
[01:53:22.093 --> 01:53:26.958]  So what he did was to cover his downside so he wouldn't look like Obama.
[01:53:26.958 --> 01:53:30.081]  But basically he's pissed with the Israelis.
[01:53:30.081 --> 01:53:32.203]  He is very angry with Netanyahu.
[01:53:32.823 --> 01:53:41.675]  Contrary to your guest who said that it was Kushner, I've said a lot about Kushner in the beginning and I've still maintained that he's not an asset.
[01:53:41.675 --> 01:53:46.822]  The reality of this is this is political psychology in quantum.
[01:53:47.495 --> 01:53:53.138]  Basically, what he had to do was to cover his downside because he didn't want to look like Obama.
[01:53:53.138 --> 01:53:55.880]  He wants to get out of the Middle East.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.521]  He reprimanded Netanyahu.
[01:53:57.521 --> 01:54:01.063]  And it's a big message to North Korea coming up out of these deals.
[01:54:01.063 --> 01:54:02.423]  Now you got it.
[01:54:02.423 --> 01:54:04.584]  This was not about Russia.
[01:54:04.584 --> 01:54:07.426]  That's where your guests were completely wrong.
[01:54:07.426 --> 01:54:08.527]  I don't know them.
[01:54:08.527 --> 01:54:10.508]  I have no idea who they are.
[01:54:10.508 --> 01:54:13.289]  The real message was to North Korea.
[01:54:13.289 --> 01:54:16.091]  This was his way of saying, look guys,
[01:54:16.838 --> 01:54:27.548]  I'm in the business of creating peace, but if in fact there is any problem whatsoever, and you don't really want to test me out, let me show you what I can do.
[01:54:27.548 --> 01:54:31.432]  And by the way, this is Mattis' theory as well.
[01:54:31.432 --> 01:54:35.055]  Talk is not the most effective way to deliver a message.
[01:54:35.055 --> 01:54:37.737]  Yeah, what it's saying is, okay, now I get the scripting.
[01:54:37.737 --> 01:54:38.718]  This was what's happening.
[01:54:38.718 --> 01:54:40.140]  Mattis says we're probably not going to strike.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.462]  But truthfully, we've never had a president with all due respect, Alex.
[01:54:58.897 --> 01:55:01.118]  You sometimes can be confusing.
[01:55:01.118 --> 01:55:02.298]  I can be confusing.
[01:55:02.298 --> 01:55:07.980]  But when I go in and do what I have to do, I'm never going to go in as the simple doctor.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.241]  I have to create all kinds of illusions, distortions, deception.
[01:55:12.241 --> 01:55:13.362]  That's what's going on.
[01:55:13.362 --> 01:55:15.682]  He's not being irresponsible.
[01:55:15.682 --> 01:55:23.725]  You have James Mattis there, who's the Secretary of Defense, who understands very well what a limited strike or psychological warfare is about.
[01:55:24.205 --> 01:55:28.248]  The most important element that we have now is not the Middle East.
[01:55:28.248 --> 01:55:29.169]  It's not even... No, I agree.
[01:55:29.169 --> 01:55:31.771]  And I will... I take the Russians' continued restraint.
[01:55:31.771 --> 01:55:39.997]  I take the Russians' continued restraint as they see this as that, and about Kabuki theaters, you would say, for the South China Sea.
[01:55:39.997 --> 01:55:41.058]  That said, still...
[01:55:41.994 --> 01:55:56.499]  When Trump says all this during the campaign that's so accurate about the Middle East and how we shouldn't be there and signals that we're going to be there, I have to signal to the general world that that's not a good idea and it's a betrayal of his previous statements.
[01:55:56.499 --> 01:56:02.380]  I have to be the person that doesn't engage in the quantum manipulations.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:02.861]  Do you understand?
[01:56:04.662 --> 01:56:05.883]  That's why I'm on the show.
[01:56:05.883 --> 01:56:07.685]  Alex, I'm not against what you're saying.
[01:56:07.685 --> 01:56:09.167]  You hit it right on the target.
[01:56:09.167 --> 01:56:16.455]  I was just concerned as a friend that you got a little bit anxious, you weren't taking your own products, and that you weren't calm.
[01:56:16.455 --> 01:56:19.959]  What I'm trying to tell you is this is geared for North Korea.
[01:56:20.479 --> 01:56:26.881]  As a matter of fact, today North Korea, Mr. Kim Jong-un has been elevated to the first family.
[01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:27.841]  That's amazing.
[01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:31.922]  So the wife is no longer a cult figure, she's the first lady.
[01:56:31.922 --> 01:56:35.723]  Kim Jong-un is the first president of North Korea.
[01:56:35.723 --> 01:56:38.644]  So what's happening... That's a symbol that they're now buying into U.S.
[01:56:38.644 --> 01:56:44.225]  propaganda in that whole orbit and preparing to have a whole new phase with merging with South Korea.
[01:56:44.705 --> 01:56:45.646]  Right.
[01:56:45.646 --> 01:56:46.327]  Now you got it.
[01:56:46.327 --> 01:56:49.471]  Whether they merge with South Korea, that's one limitation.
[01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:56.218]  Because having been involved with the merger of East Germany and West Germany, we learned a very important lesson.
[01:56:56.218 --> 01:56:58.381]  Let me tell you what that is.
[01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:01.905]  East Germany, we didn't calculate how much money had to be
[01:57:02.597 --> 01:57:02.837]  For
[01:57:19.753 --> 01:57:21.814]  Well sure, but let's go further than that.
[01:57:21.814 --> 01:57:29.800]  It then supplied all the weird communist ideology and bureaucracy to West Germany that's helped them become more socialist.
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.602]  And so they picked up a lot of the communist disease from that.
[01:57:32.602 --> 01:57:36.625]  We'll be back in two minutes to continue this discussion then and ask where this is going.
[01:57:36.625 --> 01:57:37.686]  I agree with your analysis.
[01:57:37.686 --> 01:57:39.987]  I still back Trump.
[01:57:39.987 --> 01:57:43.310]  I just flipped out on Friday because I have a lot of other stresses as well.
[01:57:48.257 --> 01:57:53.744]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:57:53.744 --> 01:57:54.606]  I take this.
[01:57:54.606 --> 01:57:55.727]  My family takes this.
[01:57:55.727 --> 01:58:00.013]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.

[01:58:09.241 --> 01:58:10.381]  I don't feel good.
[01:58:10.381 --> 01:58:14.142]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:58:14.142 --> 01:58:16.823]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:22.626]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:58:22.626 --> 01:58:25.587]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:58:25.587 --> 01:58:29.108]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:58:29.108 --> 01:58:31.349]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:58:31.349 --> 01:58:31.709]  I love it.
[01:58:31.869 --> 01:58:34.671]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:58:34.671 --> 01:58:35.691]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:35.691 --> 01:58:41.355]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.

[01:59:51.671 --> 01:59:54.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:03.782 --> 02:00:09.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.104 --> 02:00:26.825]  Alright, I want to get into the big picture here with Dr. Steve Pichetnik, because in this segment and the next, we'll play some of these Mueller clips.
[02:00:26.825 --> 02:00:28.386]  It is so lawless.
[02:00:28.386 --> 02:00:31.006]  I'm not on Team Trump, I'm on Team Reality.
[02:00:31.006 --> 02:00:37.827]  And the Clinton crimes with the Russians and the Chinese and all of it, and then they're just always going after Trump, and then there's nothing there.
[02:00:37.827 --> 02:00:43.469]  So now it's his lawyer, and now it's some other Republican paid a million and six to some woman.
[02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.069]  Who cares, man?
[02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.709]  It's crazy!
[02:00:46.974 --> 02:00:49.075]  But this art, let me analyze it.
[02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:54.398]  Last Friday's Patronic was on, he doesn't normally have this, a grotesque deviant art up here.
[02:00:54.398 --> 02:00:58.341]  And I couldn't really analyze it, I didn't think to analyze it.
[02:00:58.341 --> 02:01:06.245]  I saw it was like military folks, it looked like vampire bats, you know, out, you know, doing something, or maybe showing how the evil of war has corrupted the human soul.
[02:01:06.245 --> 02:01:08.987]  But this one, this one, I'm going to describe it right now.
[02:01:08.987 --> 02:01:10.328]  That's a Lucifer figure.
[02:01:11.188 --> 02:01:11.368]  I don't
[02:01:26.935 --> 02:01:38.739]  You know, the Mary, Earth Goddess, Christ figure image that's been struck down by Lucifer and this whole system and it shows the struggle between these two archetypes there.
[02:01:38.739 --> 02:01:42.300]  So I would call this the fruit of Lucifer is the name of this art piece.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.140]  What is it really according to you Pachinic?
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:46.021]  What is the message in it?
[02:01:46.021 --> 02:01:50.502]  I know the other messages like rock and roll, the CIA, other maps you've had behind you.
[02:01:50.502 --> 02:01:53.403]  But this iconography, this cryptic stuff, what is it really?
[02:01:54.415 --> 02:02:03.982]  It's really a painting by a man by the name of Delgado from Mexico, and he did a series of 13 paintings where he's showing the indictment.
[02:02:03.982 --> 02:02:14.030]  He's indicting every one of the Mexican cartel, the police, and the government in showing how it's corrupted the soul of Mexico with drugs.
[02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.851]  And this goes on.
[02:02:14.851 --> 02:02:15.912]  His name is Delgado.
[02:02:15.912 --> 02:02:16.772]  But what does it really show?
[02:02:16.772 --> 02:02:20.035]  Because that looks like the devil that's like a satellite, and you've got the earth goddess.
[02:02:21.068 --> 02:02:21.868]  You're right.
[02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:23.169]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:30.712]  Except, you know, we had a backdrop, and I don't have the kind of money you do to have the same backdrop, so I use my paintings.
[02:02:30.712 --> 02:02:31.653]  That's a joke.
[02:02:31.653 --> 02:02:34.294]  I don't have the money you have to have the same backdrop.
[02:02:34.294 --> 02:02:36.755]  No, this is just a basic backdrop here.
[02:02:36.755 --> 02:02:39.456]  Sometimes we put documents and things up, but mainly we put it on the front.
[02:02:39.456 --> 02:02:42.657]  Hey, crank up.
[02:02:42.657 --> 02:02:43.838]  I want to see the devil's face.
[02:02:45.138 --> 02:02:49.301]  I can't, I mean, I can't, I can show it to you, but let's get back to it.
[02:02:49.301 --> 02:02:51.303]  No, no, no, we'll do serious next segment.
[02:02:51.303 --> 02:02:53.064]  Get the painting.
[02:02:53.064 --> 02:02:54.245]  You want to do these gotcha moments.
[02:02:54.245 --> 02:02:56.947]  Come on, tilt it up.
[02:02:56.947 --> 02:03:00.610]  Oh, let me get away from that.
[02:03:00.610 --> 02:03:00.870]  All right.
[02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:01.590]  We can't see it.
[02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:05.473]  We need to see the top of the painting.
[02:03:05.473 --> 02:03:06.194]  I can't.
[02:03:06.194 --> 02:03:07.315]  Oh, is that it?
[02:03:07.315 --> 02:03:07.775]  There it is.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:16.846]  Basically, it's indictment of Mexico and its cartels and its politicians and all the presidents that have been there.
[02:03:16.846 --> 02:03:19.808]  And also the US assistance in the drug cartels.
[02:03:19.808 --> 02:03:23.110]  So was I right that that's supposed to be on the top like an evil angel?
[02:03:23.110 --> 02:03:24.031]  Yes.
[02:03:24.031 --> 02:03:25.272]  Yeah, you were right.
[02:03:26.396 --> 02:03:27.717]  You're very good.
[02:03:27.717 --> 02:03:29.678]  You know, you want to collect paintings.
[02:03:29.678 --> 02:03:30.898]  I'll help.
[02:03:30.898 --> 02:03:32.999]  We have a lot of them.
[02:03:32.999 --> 02:03:36.501]  I have a whole funding idea where we do like prints of things.
[02:03:36.501 --> 02:03:38.222]  I know it'll be successful.
[02:03:38.222 --> 02:03:38.942]  Why not?
[02:03:38.942 --> 02:03:41.003]  That's a great idea.
[02:03:41.003 --> 02:03:45.025]  He's a very famous painter and basically... Yeah, once you've said his name, I get it.
[02:03:45.025 --> 02:03:45.905]  How do you have 12 of those?
[02:03:45.905 --> 02:03:46.265]  I guess you're 13.
[02:03:46.265 --> 02:03:47.206]  You're an art dealer?
[02:03:48.388 --> 02:03:52.190]  Well, I go around the world and collect dissident art.
[02:03:52.190 --> 02:03:55.773]  I used to collect it in the Soviet Union for political dissidents.
[02:03:55.773 --> 02:03:57.273]  Boy, that's really valuable.
[02:03:57.273 --> 02:04:01.316]  I looked at an art display when I was in Colorado of dissident art.
[02:04:01.316 --> 02:04:02.737]  The average price was like 50 grand.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:11.123]  Well, when I bought it, it was 30, 40 years ago, and quite frankly, the art that they had was very difficult to acquire.
[02:04:11.123 --> 02:04:20.268]  So, many of the dissident artists I've supported for 30, 40 years... Hey, I'm not there to patronize or virtue signal, but Mexican art is some of the best out there.
[02:04:20.268 --> 02:04:20.948]  So are their films.
[02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:23.452]  That's correct.
[02:04:23.452 --> 02:04:30.023]  And he is particularly talented because these pictures were forbidden to be shown in Mexico.
[02:04:30.023 --> 02:04:31.726]  Literally, they were expropriated.
[02:04:31.726 --> 02:04:32.968]  And I learned about it.
[02:04:32.968 --> 02:04:33.589]  And in turn,
[02:04:34.341 --> 02:04:37.324]  I asked to get the whole collection in Delgado.
[02:04:37.324 --> 02:04:39.886]  Why don't you help me sell some of them in a big fundraiser?
[02:04:39.886 --> 02:04:41.807]  I'm telling you, I want to go into art here on the air.
[02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:45.430]  I'm telling you, the whole next level of us financing.
[02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:47.872]  I would go with you, Alex.
[02:04:47.872 --> 02:04:49.073]  I think it's a great idea.
[02:04:49.073 --> 02:04:49.894]  Why not?
[02:04:49.894 --> 02:04:52.216]  You got to wear a little black beret though and smoke a cigarette.
[02:04:52.216 --> 02:04:54.378]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.112 --> 02:04:59.535]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:59.535 --> 02:05:03.499]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.499 --> 02:05:06.842]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:06.842 --> 02:05:09.384]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:09.384 --> 02:05:14.108]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:14.108 --> 02:05:16.450]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:16.450 --> 02:05:22.856]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:23.456 --> 02:05:31.665]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:31.665 --> 02:05:36.710]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:36.710 --> 02:05:43.697]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:05:44.338 --> 02:05:49.261]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[02:05:52.322 --> 02:06:05.489]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:05.489 --> 02:06:07.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.427 --> 02:06:39.789]  We're back live.
[02:06:39.789 --> 02:06:41.029]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:41.029 --> 02:06:53.351]  Coming up the next three segments of this hour, we're going to open the phones up for your take on what President Trump did striking Assad and aiding the Al-Qaeda ISIS rebels.
[02:06:53.351 --> 02:06:56.892]  As I guess a pretext to keep a small force there so that Iran or
[02:06:58.843 --> 02:07:07.229]  Saudi Arabia doesn't take control of it, and so that it doesn't collapse so that the globalists can let the Islamists flood into Europe through Turkey.
[02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:10.652]  If Trump would just say that, then I'd support it.
[02:07:10.652 --> 02:07:17.597]  But instead, it goes into the whole narrative that Assad's got the chemical weapons, so now the rebels stage more, we've got to go to war.
[02:07:17.597 --> 02:07:20.199]  That's the problem with the calculus of this whole thing.
[02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:27.325]  And of course, I knew the answer from the beginning, but I, fundamentally at a gut level, got angry about it, so I went wild Friday.
[02:07:28.646 --> 02:07:32.929]  Because my gut doesn't like it, and my gut's never wrong.
[02:07:32.929 --> 02:07:45.557]  Now my gut still tells me, I saw Trump in there giving a speech earlier about tax cuts, and I went, oh, I like the tax cuts, oh, I like the good Supreme Court justice, oh, I like the globalists hating him, oh, I like getting out of the TPP and all the new jobs, and oh, boy, I like Trump.
[02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:48.219]  Okay, so I still like Trump.
[02:07:48.219 --> 02:07:49.340]  Which means I'll get persecuted.
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:55.264]  It'd be so easy to turn against him and the whole world would love me and I'd be on Bill Maher and be a soulless person.
[02:07:55.264 --> 02:07:58.346]  So a lot of it is how much I've been persecuted for supporting Trump.
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:10.167]  Built up, not angry at Trump, just angry at all the dumb people out there that have been sucked into this civil war the country's facing culturally.
[02:08:10.167 --> 02:08:17.352]  And so then when he just starts to budge a little bit, it makes me get really, really upset.
[02:08:17.352 --> 02:08:18.372]  So people said, was that an act?
[02:08:18.372 --> 02:08:20.153]  He started yelling and screaming and cussing.
[02:08:20.153 --> 02:08:22.015]  Wasn't on the main satellite.
[02:08:22.015 --> 02:08:23.175]  I knew it was a live feed.
[02:08:23.175 --> 02:08:24.256]  I didn't say go live.
[02:08:24.256 --> 02:08:25.417]  I was irritated they went live.
[02:08:25.417 --> 02:08:27.338]  It wasn't their fault.
[02:08:27.338 --> 02:08:28.439]  I was like, we're going to go live in here.
[02:08:28.439 --> 02:08:29.420]  You're going to go live with that.
[02:08:30.267 --> 02:08:32.188]  And then I wasn't clear, so we thought, oh, go live now.
[02:08:32.188 --> 02:08:39.234]  10 minutes before he went live in there, and then I realized it was live when I was sitting there venting, going, these damn neocons, this is crap.
[02:08:39.234 --> 02:08:40.495]  Then I realized I was on.
[02:08:40.495 --> 02:08:41.776]  He's going, yeah, you're live.
[02:08:41.776 --> 02:08:43.097]  So then I really start venting.
[02:08:43.097 --> 02:08:45.558]  And then I said, delete it.
[02:08:45.558 --> 02:08:47.880]  And then at the end of the day, I said, don't delete it.
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:49.221]  So you could say it was kind of staged.
[02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:50.962]  It started out being staged.
[02:08:50.962 --> 02:08:51.883]  Then I thought, delete it.
[02:08:51.883 --> 02:08:53.444]  Then I thought, you know what?
[02:08:53.444 --> 02:08:54.065]  Don't delete it.
[02:08:54.065 --> 02:08:56.226]  Just leave it.
[02:08:56.226 --> 02:08:58.408]  So I don't know anymore.
[02:08:58.408 --> 02:08:59.469]  All I can tell you is,
[02:09:01.107 --> 02:09:02.289]  You know a man by his enemies.
[02:09:02.289 --> 02:09:04.171]  The globals are coming after Trump big time.
[02:09:04.171 --> 02:09:04.972]  The toll free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:09:04.972 --> 02:09:05.012]  877-789-2539.
[02:09:10.985 --> 02:09:13.446]  I don't expect Trump to be perfect, okay?
[02:09:13.446 --> 02:09:14.867]  I know he goes with his gut as well.
[02:09:14.867 --> 02:09:15.808]  I know the globalists hate him.
[02:09:15.808 --> 02:09:17.248]  He's done a lot of good things.
[02:09:17.248 --> 02:09:24.272]  It's just Pachinik, and I'm going to go to Miller with you, I'm really worried, and Comey, I'm really worried.
[02:09:24.272 --> 02:09:25.193]  I get why he did it.
[02:09:25.193 --> 02:09:26.253]  It was all about North Korea.
[02:09:26.253 --> 02:09:27.534]  It was all about red lines.
[02:09:27.534 --> 02:09:28.955]  It was all about sending a message.
[02:09:28.955 --> 02:09:30.776]  It was all about killing domestic opposition.
[02:09:30.776 --> 02:09:31.196]  I get it.
[02:09:32.173 --> 02:09:32.914]  They get it too.
[02:09:32.914 --> 02:09:36.198]  They're only increasing the attacks now, saying, oh look, we got him.
[02:09:36.198 --> 02:09:45.809]  And again, when the rebels launch more chemical attacks, which they'll do like night following day and day following night, now Trump has put himself in a trap.
[02:09:45.809 --> 02:09:46.830]  What do you say to that?
[02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:52.642]  Trump isn't going to address that issue very clearly.
[02:09:52.642 --> 02:10:01.866]  Basically, you know, we will have what's called proportionality in terms of the psychological warfare or the political warfare.
[02:10:01.866 --> 02:10:10.871]  What you hit on, and nobody's really concentrating as well as you are, is the fact that Mueller's getting closer and closer and closer
[02:10:11.871 --> 02:10:17.155]  And that's why I got fundamentally mad is that I love Trump so much.
[02:10:17.155 --> 02:10:19.877]  I can tell they didn't get any Russia's because that's fake.
[02:10:19.877 --> 02:10:21.278]  They got something with that lawyer.
[02:10:21.278 --> 02:10:22.359]  They're already leaking it.
[02:10:22.359 --> 02:10:28.304]  As you predicted Friday, they would do the 1.6 million for some Republican donor to, you know, a Playboy money to kill a baby.
[02:10:28.304 --> 02:10:30.025]  I mean, all this is going on.
[02:10:30.025 --> 02:10:34.288]  That's what I'm saying is I just sensed the whole energy level went up that much danger.
[02:10:34.288 --> 02:10:35.209]  And that's why I got pissed.
[02:10:36.007 --> 02:10:40.449]  Well, you are correct in terms of, I understand you, we understand each other.
[02:10:40.449 --> 02:10:41.869]  It's not an issue.
[02:10:41.869 --> 02:10:55.755]  You can get angry, and we talked about this for a long time, and you and I were wondering why was Newland still around, but Newland now has what lawyers have explained to me, which is called the Crime Fraud Exception Act, which means that he went in,
[02:10:56.455 --> 02:10:56.595]  Yes.
[02:11:18.075 --> 02:11:24.679]  How is that possible to pierce the special relationship between a lawyer and his client?
[02:11:24.679 --> 02:11:36.245]  And they did it showing that they say Cohen was using the office of a lawyer as a push-through thing for himself, for Republican donors as a money laundering operation, or kind of a mini Clinton Foundation.
[02:11:36.245 --> 02:11:38.306]  And my issue is international security.
[02:11:38.306 --> 02:11:44.109]  If Trump's for the country and the globalists have committed crimes a thousand times worse, I say we move against them.
[02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:47.231]  I say Trump has waited too long and it's time to stop this.
[02:11:48.303 --> 02:11:50.164]  I agreed with you months ago.
[02:11:50.164 --> 02:11:54.407]  You and I were making the same statement.
[02:11:54.407 --> 02:11:56.048]  I don't know why Mueller was there.
[02:11:56.048 --> 02:11:58.310]  I don't know why Rodenstein was there.
[02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:00.992]  I had no idea why Comey was allowed.
[02:12:00.992 --> 02:12:14.201]  I mean, basically, this is the issue that's now at hand, and we're talking about a couple of months, if not weeks, when you pierce that type of... Within days of them raiding him, they're already illegally leaking out of the stash.
[02:12:14.847 --> 02:12:15.988]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:12:15.988 --> 02:12:18.029]  And that's what you really responded to.
[02:12:18.029 --> 02:12:20.710]  The Syria issue is not a relevant issue.
[02:12:20.710 --> 02:12:22.471]  The North Korea issue is relevant.
[02:12:22.471 --> 02:12:26.813]  No, it's beginning to know he may be, quote, compromised in that they've got the motherlode.
[02:12:27.512 --> 02:12:28.193]  That's correct.
[02:12:28.193 --> 02:12:29.755]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:12:29.755 --> 02:12:31.898]  That is the the gold of gold.
[02:12:31.898 --> 02:12:46.156]  And that's why I wanted to get on the show to basically say the focus has to be shift to the Crime Exception, Crime Fraud Exception Act, which I had to go and find out myself because I could not understand how you can pierce
[02:12:46.716 --> 02:12:56.601]  That relationship between the lawyer and the client, and they say they can do it all the time if you invoke that warrant or that act, the Crime Fraud Exception Act.
[02:12:56.601 --> 02:13:01.444]  And apparently, Bob Cohen has been highly compromised and he may have been flipped.
[02:13:01.984 --> 02:13:03.925]  That is a whole other issue.
[02:13:03.925 --> 02:13:09.887]  But the issue in Syria, the issue of all of that is much, it's secondary, quite frankly.
[02:13:09.887 --> 02:13:13.649]  It's really, Matt has had a very judicious approach to it.
[02:13:13.649 --> 02:13:15.170]  Trump had a very judicious approach.
[02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:19.031]  But I'm just saying, Trump is clean compared to most other presidents.
[02:13:19.031 --> 02:13:22.353]  And the stuff is all about cleaning up stuff for Republicans and people.
[02:13:22.353 --> 02:13:23.453]  This is nothing.
[02:13:23.453 --> 02:13:25.914]  Hillary was in bed with the Chinese, the Russians, everybody.
[02:13:25.914 --> 02:13:27.475]  I'm sick of their crap.
[02:13:27.475 --> 02:13:30.056]  I want the real enemy, the globalists, removed now!
[02:13:30.376 --> 02:13:31.777]  They're trying to start a civil war.
[02:13:31.777 --> 02:13:32.458]  They're crazy.
[02:13:32.458 --> 02:13:33.038]  They're corrupt.
[02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.079]  They're nuts.
[02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:36.041]  And I think it's time for the President to act.
[02:13:36.041 --> 02:13:37.662]  They're doing all this extra-judicially.
[02:13:37.662 --> 02:13:39.224]  They're doing all this rogue.
[02:13:39.224 --> 02:13:41.506]  And I just don't see how we sit here and take this crap anymore.
[02:13:42.619 --> 02:13:48.263]  Well, we've made that, you know, we've made it very clear for years what we wanted.
[02:13:48.263 --> 02:13:51.466]  We made it very clear what the 9-11 issue was.
[02:13:51.466 --> 02:14:00.453]  But I got to tell you, since the very beginning, the fact that Mueller, Comey, even Gorsuch all came back from the George Bush Jr.
[02:14:00.453 --> 02:14:03.035]  administration, it really befuddled me.
[02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:03.916]  It was almost as if
[02:14:04.096 --> 02:14:11.019]  Well, Trump thought he could get what he wanted, but he thought he could get them in the fold and share power and they'd leave him alone.
[02:14:11.019 --> 02:14:15.821]  No, they're dedicated to global government and dominating this country and doing the same crap.
[02:14:15.821 --> 02:14:21.363]  And that was Trump's fatal mistake, was trying to share power and bring them under the tent and keep his enemies closer.
[02:14:21.363 --> 02:14:23.104]  These people don't know any honor.
[02:14:23.104 --> 02:14:24.064]  They can't help it.
[02:14:24.064 --> 02:14:25.385]  They came from cowards.
[02:14:25.385 --> 02:14:27.465]  They came from scum to sell the country out.
[02:14:27.465 --> 02:14:28.406]  They cannot stop it.
[02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:35.443]  I would agree that I think Trump made a serious mistake by trying to think that he could co-opt them.
[02:14:35.443 --> 02:14:38.484]  That was a very, very serious mistake.
[02:14:38.484 --> 02:14:42.385]  Because once you bring in one of them, it kept on going on.
[02:14:42.385 --> 02:14:45.326]  It was like a long trail of the 9-11 false flaggers.
[02:14:45.326 --> 02:14:47.027]  It's like metastasizing cancer.
[02:14:47.027 --> 02:14:49.568]  It's all one hive brain.
[02:14:49.568 --> 02:14:51.648]  Well, it's there now.
[02:14:51.648 --> 02:14:53.049]  And he's surrounded by it.
[02:14:54.355 --> 02:14:58.476]  Even in the domestic side, that's where he was the weakest.
[02:14:58.476 --> 02:15:01.337]  And he understood that, but he thought he could co-opt it.
[02:15:01.337 --> 02:15:05.558]  Legally, I can't get into that discussion because I really don't know as much.
[02:15:05.558 --> 02:15:09.800]  I have to go out and find out what this Criminal Fraud Exception Act does.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:17.862]  No, see, if the lawyer is engaged in criminal activity and the lawyer is like a conciliary for a mafia, the entire client privilege is stripped under the racketeering laws.
[02:15:18.812 --> 02:15:20.834]  You hit it right on the head, Alex, as usual.
[02:15:20.834 --> 02:15:23.976]  That's exactly what the issue is about.
[02:15:23.976 --> 02:15:28.359]  It is basically back to the racketeering, the RICO Act, all that.
[02:15:28.359 --> 02:15:39.066]  Which is exactly what Hillary and Mueller and Comey are doing with that organized crime operation at the Justice Department, giving their wives and husbands all money for coming up with the fake poopoos, peepee stuff.
[02:15:39.066 --> 02:15:40.768]  We're going to come back and do a little bit more on
[02:15:41.408 --> 02:15:48.732]  Where this goes, wargaming this, how we stop this, but at a gut level, I saw Syria as a sign of him trying to appease them, as a sign of major fear.
[02:15:48.732 --> 02:15:53.335]  I mean, as soon as he said we're going to pull out of Syria, they raided his offices.
[02:15:53.335 --> 02:15:55.216]  And I just think, you know, Trump can only take so much.
[02:15:55.216 --> 02:15:57.757]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[02:18:01.496 --> 02:18:04.358]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:18:04.358 --> 02:18:06.340]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.

[02:20:19.753 --> 02:20:24.621]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:20:24.621 --> 02:20:26.785]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:29.089]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:20:29.089 --> 02:20:33.537]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:20:35.771 --> 02:20:38.252]  Alright, we're not talking points here.
[02:20:38.252 --> 02:20:42.994]  I don't get my talking points like Hillary Clinton would put them out even a decade ago.
[02:20:42.994 --> 02:20:48.017]  The New York Times, The Washington Post, she's like been the shadow president of the country even when Obama was in.
[02:20:48.017 --> 02:20:49.797]  She probably had more power than Obama did most of the time.
[02:20:49.797 --> 02:20:53.139]  Those two didn't really like each other because they were two different crime networks, but...
[02:20:55.714 --> 02:21:11.931]  You saw Obama trying to parlay himself into an Arab Spring with his cousin, Odinga, and Kenya, and the Middle East, and then trying to... I mean, it's all about individuals in the system trying to get this power for themselves by leveraging nation-states into some type of global system.
[02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:15.235]  But the global system can't ever work, because all these sharks inside of it...
[02:21:16.323 --> 02:21:19.286]  They're all trying to set up their own little personal things.
[02:21:19.286 --> 02:21:25.952]  So the global government can never actually even take place, which is a good thing, because their global system is absolutely nightmarish.
[02:21:25.952 --> 02:21:35.701]  We need a global system of ideas and people working together through individualism and nation states, not a forced global government, but that's a whole other subject.
[02:21:35.701 --> 02:21:37.803]  We're here looking at this nightmare scenario.
[02:21:39.347 --> 02:21:44.256]  Of Mueller and Comey, and just how incredibly corrupt they are, and the things they've done.
[02:21:44.256 --> 02:21:45.378]  I'm finishing up with Steve Pacino.
[02:21:45.378 --> 02:21:52.550]  We're going to your phone calls here in the next segment, I promise, but this is not a good sign either way you slice it.
[02:21:54.153 --> 02:22:06.378]  And what do you think, Steve Pucinich, talking to your sources, what is the view of people who are patriotic in the deep state about where Trump's going and the prognosis of things and this whole thing with Michael Cohen?
[02:22:06.378 --> 02:22:10.900]  Because I've just seen seismic shifts in the behavior of the leftists, the globalists.
[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:13.761]  They think they've got the mother load right now.
[02:22:13.761 --> 02:22:15.161]  And then I wasn't sure.
[02:22:15.161 --> 02:22:16.422]  And then Trump flips on this.
[02:22:17.242 --> 02:22:24.284]  And I get the optics are good for him overall, but it's a desperate thing for Trump that doesn't even like to play tricks, in my experience.
[02:22:24.284 --> 02:22:29.666]  So what's the real tea leaves here in your expert view?
[02:22:29.666 --> 02:22:40.130]  My expert view is that if he makes a deal with North Korea, which I think he will, and it can afford him an opportunity for a Nobel Peace Prize,
[02:22:40.871 --> 02:22:44.695]  There may be a chance here to save his presidency.
[02:22:44.695 --> 02:22:48.258]  I'm concerned that on the domestic side... I got to interrupt you.
[02:22:48.258 --> 02:22:49.579]  Saturday I thought about this for hours.
[02:22:49.579 --> 02:22:50.520]  I totally agree.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.244]  They're going to try to sabotage this North Korea thing because they want ongoing tension and the old policy anyways.
[02:22:55.244 --> 02:23:05.474]  But it all rests on a North Korea deal and continuing the economy getting better and some bold moves by the Justice Department that's so compromised against the real criminal networks.
[02:23:05.794 --> 02:23:13.601]  Which, if they're successful at bringing down Trump, we've got a real Praetorian Guard coup inside our country like a third world nation.
[02:23:13.601 --> 02:23:18.004]  I mean, Hillary and her stay-behind network... Let me ask that question first.
[02:23:18.004 --> 02:23:21.287]  If they successfully remove Trump, what are they going to do next?
[02:23:21.287 --> 02:23:24.790]  They are going to be emboldened mad dogs.
[02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:32.256]  Well, what'll happen next is that Pence is in line for the presidency, and then we have to see what in fact happens.
[02:23:34.392 --> 02:23:41.876]  I don't want to see, I hope that he remains there and I hope he can deal with this legal issue very quickly.
[02:23:41.876 --> 02:23:48.739]  Because quite frankly, if I had to go to see a lawyer about this very matter, that concerned me.
[02:23:48.739 --> 02:23:50.760]  And for me, that was a time clock.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:59.644]  Not so much the Syrian attack or anything else on the international side, but on the domestic side, where in fact, he is exceedingly vulnerable.
[02:23:59.644 --> 02:24:01.344]  And as he said, I mean, he's
[02:24:03.248 --> 02:24:06.650]  He's given an apology and a pardon to Scooter Libby.
[02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:09.211]  I mean, I've known about Scooter Libby for a long time.
[02:24:09.211 --> 02:24:10.571]  He's an Andover graduate.
[02:24:10.571 --> 02:24:12.792]  He's a George Bush man.
[02:24:12.792 --> 02:24:17.094]  Why do you have to pardon Scooter Libby if, in fact, he doesn't get something in return?
[02:24:17.094 --> 02:24:22.417]  And that's because the whole deep state Bush arm is about half of the deep state globalist equation.
[02:24:22.417 --> 02:24:30.120]  He's going to that deep state, kissing their ass so that they'll leave him alone when they don't even have control over the whole Hillary Clinton crime network.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:30.940]  It's not going to work.
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:31.941]  Appeasement isn't going to work.
[02:24:33.021 --> 02:24:47.743]  Well, you may be right because I didn't quite calculate, I couldn't understand why Scooter Libby was pardoned when in fact he was very much a part of the Cheney and Bush false flag and
[02:24:48.444 --> 02:24:48.744]  Well...
[02:25:05.629 --> 02:25:26.876]  I don't know very much about Eric Prince other than the presentation he made to a group of us in the intelligence unit about 10-15 years ago where he explained why he was cheaper and more effective at Blackwater and he used the Revolutionary War as an example and I pointed out to Eric that was not a very good example considering we didn't have any money
[02:25:27.483 --> 02:25:30.684]  For the Continental Congress and the Continental Army.
[02:25:30.684 --> 02:25:33.826]  Also at the same time, Eric Prince was not a very good SEAL.
[02:25:33.826 --> 02:25:42.029]  Well wait a minute, he did set up a successful company, but I mean, Washington didn't like the militia until later, then in his memoirs he had to admit that the militia was critical of the win.
[02:25:42.029 --> 02:25:48.692]  I mean, I think guerrilla warfare, one of the Frenchmen in war, is a critical example that would translate.
[02:25:48.692 --> 02:25:51.353]  I don't want private contractors taking over the military, but I don't know.
[02:25:52.264 --> 02:25:53.085]  But you're right.
[02:25:53.085 --> 02:25:56.389]  Honestly, you know, American history better than most of us.
[02:25:56.389 --> 02:26:03.018]  The French-Indian War was far more critical in terms of the outcome of where we came.
[02:26:03.018 --> 02:26:07.123]  But in terms of Prince, you know, again, that's questionable.
[02:26:07.123 --> 02:26:09.947]  Jones, that's a highly questionable entity as well.
[02:26:10.787 --> 02:26:16.089]  And, in fact, whether he's co-opting him or he thinks he's in control, that's the big question.
[02:26:16.089 --> 02:26:20.651]  No, but I mean, that's who runs Trump's security, on top of everything, with the Department of Defense.
[02:26:20.651 --> 02:26:22.271]  He's left that in there from the beginning.
[02:26:22.271 --> 02:26:24.092]  So I'm just, that's an open secret.
[02:26:24.092 --> 02:26:24.832]  The Intercept reported it.
[02:26:24.832 --> 02:26:26.813]  I knew it during the campaign.
[02:26:26.813 --> 02:26:31.194]  I'm just, those guys ought to want to side with Trump over these globalists.
[02:26:31.194 --> 02:26:32.535]  These globalists are crazy, man!
[02:26:34.295 --> 02:26:35.676]  Well, crazy enough.
[02:26:35.676 --> 02:26:40.599]  I mean, Hillary is an insane witch demon whose expiration date's over.
[02:26:40.599 --> 02:26:44.061]  All these crazy Democrats that want civil war and thought the U.N.
[02:26:44.061 --> 02:26:47.383]  would come in under Loretta Lynch and take over the police departments?
[02:26:47.383 --> 02:26:49.884]  I mean, I always heard old-timers saying that U.N.
[02:26:49.884 --> 02:26:51.545]  was going to take over and I didn't believe it.
[02:26:51.545 --> 02:26:52.906]  That's crazy.
[02:26:52.906 --> 02:26:54.227]  That will never fly.
[02:26:54.227 --> 02:26:57.749]  They will start a real civil war and I'm sick of this crap.
[02:27:00.495 --> 02:27:03.336]  Well, I don't think we're going to have a real civil war.
[02:27:03.336 --> 02:27:12.197]  I'm saying if these maniac leftists that have some weird score to settle with flyover country get their way, Steve, they're going to start a physical fight.
[02:27:12.197 --> 02:27:12.917]  You understand?
[02:27:12.917 --> 02:27:23.899]  They have serious, I'm not a psychiatrist like you, but they have major deficiency issues and have a fundamental, like a baby duck imprinted training to hate America, Christians, gun owners and veterans.
[02:27:23.899 --> 02:27:28.840]  You know they won't hire any veterans to anything real because they fundamentally are pieces of crap cowards.
[02:27:29.767 --> 02:27:31.427]  Okay, like Brian Williams and Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:31.427 --> 02:27:34.508]  So what I'm saying to you is they're the real threat.
[02:27:34.508 --> 02:27:38.009]  And all I want to say is they will never get control of this country.
[02:27:38.009 --> 02:27:40.869]  Ever.
[02:27:40.869 --> 02:27:44.070]  Well, that's pretty well stated.
[02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:52.312]  The key question is, you know, how do we maintain the stability of the republic both financially and politically?
[02:27:52.312 --> 02:27:58.773]  And that's really what the biggest concern we have in our administration and in our
[02:27:59.873 --> 02:28:05.756]  In our fellowship of people who are involved in keeping the Republic stable.
[02:28:05.756 --> 02:28:11.179]  And I don't think they're going to have, I don't think we're going to relinquish power that easily.
[02:28:11.179 --> 02:28:14.281]  And the Republic remains quite intact.
[02:28:14.281 --> 02:28:15.142]  No, I agree with you.
[02:28:15.142 --> 02:28:20.745]  You're saying for the first time since Trump's been in a year and a half, there are some chinks in the armor right now.
[02:28:20.745 --> 02:28:24.607]  Yes, the chinks are domestic as opposed to foreign.
[02:28:25.479 --> 02:28:29.560]  And those chains that are domestic could be a very gaping hole.
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.901]  And that's what concerns me as it does you.
[02:28:31.901 --> 02:28:33.041]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:28:33.041 --> 02:28:33.641]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28:33.641 --> 02:28:38.602]  We already have outside foreign globalist powers running rampant in the country and harassing and terrorizing and killing people.
[02:28:38.602 --> 02:28:40.503]  So at this point, the rules have already changed.
[02:28:40.503 --> 02:28:42.703]  And I think the president's in dereliction of duty.
[02:28:42.703 --> 02:28:46.764]  If he doesn't just gut up and move against these cowards, they will fall like a house of cards.
[02:28:46.764 --> 02:28:48.385]  It's time to move against the traitors.
[02:28:48.385 --> 02:28:49.545]  Thank you, Dr. Sipochenek.
[02:28:49.545 --> 02:28:51.085]  We'll be back with your phone call straight ahead.
[02:28:51.085 --> 02:28:53.426]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm never selling out or backing down.
[02:28:54.983 --> 02:28:56.884]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:28:56.884 --> 02:29:00.107]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:29:00.107 --> 02:29:01.708]  Savory and delicious.
[02:29:01.708 --> 02:29:04.530]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:29:28.106 --> 02:29:36.252]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[02:29:56.046 --> 02:29:59.650]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:59.650 --> 02:30:01.412]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:01.412 --> 02:30:12.684]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.465 --> 02:30:22.650]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:22.650 --> 02:30:28.613]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:28.613 --> 02:30:33.715]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.715 --> 02:30:36.317]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.317 --> 02:30:38.037]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.037 --> 02:30:42.840]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:48.022]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:48.022 --> 02:30:50.662]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:50.662 --> 02:30:55.964]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:30:55.964 --> 02:30:57.465]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:30:57.465 --> 02:31:00.166]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[02:31:00.166 --> 02:31:07.328]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:31:07.648 --> 02:31:18.311]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:31:18.311 --> 02:31:26.133]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:31:26.133 --> 02:31:31.554]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:31:31.894 --> 02:31:36.341]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:31:36.341 --> 02:31:38.404]  And this part is most important.
[02:31:38.404 --> 02:31:45.213]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:31:45.213 --> 02:31:46.656]  That means it's clean.
[02:31:46.656 --> 02:31:47.537]  That means it's pure.
[02:31:47.757 --> 02:31:50.680]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:31:50.680 --> 02:31:53.463]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:53.463 --> 02:31:55.685]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:55.685 --> 02:31:58.468]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:31:58.468 --> 02:32:06.176]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic.
[02:32:06.656 --> 02:32:08.938]  Manufacturer and producer.
[02:32:08.938 --> 02:32:09.718]  Scalability.
[02:32:09.718 --> 02:32:13.701]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39.
[02:32:13.701 --> 02:32:14.161]  50% off.
[02:32:14.161 --> 02:32:18.984]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZx.
[02:32:18.984 --> 02:32:20.445]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[02:32:20.445 --> 02:32:26.289]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[02:32:26.289 --> 02:32:29.471]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotic self-displacement.
[02:32:30.231 --> 02:32:33.294]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[02:32:33.294 --> 02:32:39.098]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:32:39.098 --> 02:32:45.543]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[02:32:45.543 --> 02:32:48.346]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[02:32:48.346 --> 02:32:53.490]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[02:32:59.072 --> 02:33:01.686]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.876 --> 02:33:40.366]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.366 --> 02:33:41.066]  Trump is good.
[02:33:50.438 --> 02:33:52.179]  Because the globalists legitimately hate him.
[02:33:52.179 --> 02:33:52.940]  It's not a fake.
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:53.800]  It's not a feint.
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:55.161]  It's not a game.
[02:33:55.161 --> 02:33:57.222]  It's not a smoke and mirrors.
[02:33:57.222 --> 02:33:58.203]  And he's not perfect.
[02:33:58.203 --> 02:34:00.064]  And I don't expect him to get everything done that's right.
[02:34:00.064 --> 02:34:03.166]  But he knows all about Syria.
[02:34:03.166 --> 02:34:06.128]  He knows all about the rebels being sent in by the globalists.
[02:34:06.128 --> 02:34:06.568]  He knows.
[02:34:06.568 --> 02:34:08.770]  He told McMaster, no, we're not toppling Assad.
[02:34:08.770 --> 02:34:09.930]  Assad's already agreed to leave.
[02:34:09.930 --> 02:34:10.411]  He wants to.
[02:34:10.411 --> 02:34:11.451]  He just grew up in England.
[02:34:11.451 --> 02:34:12.752]  He doesn't want to be there.
[02:34:12.752 --> 02:34:14.273]  He said, stabilize it, have elections.
[02:34:14.273 --> 02:34:15.974]  I'm gone.
[02:34:15.974 --> 02:34:17.135]  They've almost killed him.
[02:34:18.814 --> 02:34:23.558]  They've had bombs go off within hundreds of yards of him.
[02:34:23.558 --> 02:34:26.901]  Last time I read, like over 50 times.
[02:34:26.901 --> 02:34:29.663]  Think Assad growing up in London?
[02:34:29.663 --> 02:34:32.206]  Once out of there?
[02:34:32.206 --> 02:34:35.849]  So, it's just incredible.
[02:34:35.849 --> 02:34:37.210]  We're being sabotaged.
[02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:40.673]  And you know, when I talk about Hillary and people, here's the thing.
[02:34:40.673 --> 02:34:44.676]  The bottom has fallen out.
[02:34:44.676 --> 02:34:46.418]  I don't know exactly what's going on.
[02:34:47.915 --> 02:34:56.522]  I know the Globalist push depopulation and I know they're doing all sorts of stuff behind the scenes and testing things on us, trying to find cures for diseases for themselves.
[02:34:56.522 --> 02:35:03.107]  The best way to do that is hit people with stuff that's lethal and then you find a very small percentage that are resistant.
[02:35:03.107 --> 02:35:13.235]  One quick way to research just one small faction of that or one factor point is immortal cell lines, Lazarus genes, things like that, which are real.
[02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:19.580]  The archetype's zombies, but it's not at that level, but it is once you can get it at the building blocks.
[02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:23.302]  There are cells that are zombie.
[02:35:23.302 --> 02:35:25.162]  They don't need oxygen, they don't need anything.
[02:35:25.162 --> 02:35:29.864]  You have to kill them with a blowtorch.
[02:35:29.864 --> 02:35:32.866]  They discovered it in the 1940s with a black lady.
[02:35:32.866 --> 02:35:35.307]  Cancer killed her in one week.
[02:35:35.307 --> 02:35:38.648]  They can't kill the cells, they're still alive today.
[02:35:38.648 --> 02:35:40.969]  You put them on fresh flesh, they start replicating.
[02:35:47.327 --> 02:35:52.852]  So, the globalists are all obsessed with this, while we're watching football and basketball, and I get it.
[02:35:52.852 --> 02:35:58.456]  I grew up with my mom and dad, you know, watching the Boston Celtics and the L.A.
[02:35:58.456 --> 02:35:59.897]  Lakers and the World Championship.
[02:35:59.897 --> 02:36:03.020]  I mean, you know.
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:03.300]  I get it.
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:06.563]  I can watch it, get into it, and like it, and it's great, and sit back and eat pizza, and it's great, you know.
[02:36:07.861 --> 02:36:09.802]  But that's all there to divert us.
[02:36:09.802 --> 02:36:11.363]  I'm not judging you if you're into it.
[02:36:11.363 --> 02:36:19.008]  I'm saying they've got secret space stations and immortal cell lines and huge underground railways all over the U.S.
[02:36:19.008 --> 02:36:19.929]  I know, believe me.
[02:36:19.929 --> 02:36:21.930]  I can't get into how I know.
[02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:27.373]  A lot of it's been admitted.
[02:36:27.373 --> 02:36:33.357]  And then anybody really involved at this high level, scientists, doctors, researchers, are scared to death.
[02:36:33.357 --> 02:36:34.418]  Almost all of them quit.
[02:36:35.828 --> 02:36:42.770]  They run off to the countryside with their family and they just prepare.
[02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:48.292]  And then if they talk to anybody, they die in a car wreck or they drown in about a week.
[02:36:48.292 --> 02:36:52.613]  There's more than 10,000 microbiologists and scientists that are, you know, they'll run over them.
[02:36:52.613 --> 02:36:53.914]  One of them got killed here at UT.
[02:36:53.914 --> 02:36:59.256]  They ran over him with a truck and backed back over him.
[02:36:59.256 --> 02:37:00.596]  By the way, I never played the, uh,
[02:37:05.933 --> 02:37:06.633]  Clip I wanted to play.
[02:37:06.633 --> 02:37:09.795]  What was that clip I wanted to play earlier that I didn't play last week?
[02:37:09.795 --> 02:37:10.655]  Yeah, Planet of the Apes.
[02:37:10.655 --> 02:37:13.297]  Let's play that and then I'll go to calls.
[02:37:13.297 --> 02:37:16.058]  But remind me to talk about the people that died this weekend in the next segment.
[02:37:16.058 --> 02:37:21.481]  I'm going to start the show with that because even though it's not that important in the scheme of things, we have to celebrate humanity.
[02:37:21.481 --> 02:37:26.063]  And, you know, the gunny sergeant guy died that was so interesting and a good actor and actually a real sergeant.
[02:37:26.063 --> 02:37:27.084]  And then of course Art Bell died.
[02:37:31.144 --> 02:37:38.006]  Art Bell was one of the slickest best talk show hosts when it came to just really being so focused and so professional.
[02:37:38.006 --> 02:37:40.886]  He was just a real talent, one of the greatest ever.
[02:37:40.886 --> 02:37:47.848]  And I even saw the media try to time me to him in some way to like just get my name in the news and attack him for it.
[02:37:47.848 --> 02:37:49.149]  I was never on Art Bell's show.
[02:37:49.149 --> 02:37:54.370]  For whatever reason, Art Bell didn't like me.
[02:37:55.794 --> 02:37:56.355]  But you know what?
[02:37:56.355 --> 02:37:57.576]  I like Art Bell.
[02:37:57.576 --> 02:38:00.699]  Art Bell, mysterious narrator of the American Nightscape, is dead at 72.
[02:38:00.699 --> 02:38:17.135]  And I'll cover the other guy in the next segment, but... See, if anything's in the news, the mainstream media attaches it like Sinclair gets caught doing fake news.
[02:38:17.135 --> 02:38:18.457]  Oh wow, regional news does that.
[02:38:18.457 --> 02:38:19.438]  Jones worked for Sinclair.
[02:38:19.438 --> 02:38:19.658]  Didn't.
[02:38:22.699 --> 02:38:23.299]  Art Bell dies.
[02:38:23.299 --> 02:38:23.840]  Tie me to it.
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:28.262]  Make it somehow... I mean, it's like... And it's not that it hurts me.
[02:38:28.262 --> 02:38:32.584]  It actually makes the show bigger for us.
[02:38:32.584 --> 02:38:44.370]  It's that the media outlets doing it is to infect people's brains on every topic that is in the news, my name is attached, with something negative.
[02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:51.293]  So that when people hear me warning them about something, they don't listen because they've been told a lie about me, like I'm racist.
[02:38:53.448 --> 02:38:57.230]  Oh my God, that makes me really want to throw up.
[02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:00.271]  Do I dislike people that are a different color than me that hate me because they're racist?
[02:39:00.271 --> 02:39:00.611]  You bet.
[02:39:00.611 --> 02:39:02.832]  Because I hate racists.
[02:39:02.832 --> 02:39:05.213]  Whether they're white or black or whatever.
[02:39:05.213 --> 02:39:10.695]  But I really don't want to... I'm not going to get into it.
[02:39:12.395 --> 02:39:23.241]  See, I'm metaphysically connected to everybody, and I get if I hate somebody for no reason, or I want to screw them over, or I get into some type of weird tribal thing with them, it lowers me.
[02:39:23.241 --> 02:39:28.765]  It doesn't mean I don't get caught up in it and catch myself doing it, and I'm like, oh my God.
[02:39:28.765 --> 02:39:37.650]  It's just so horrible to read the WikiLeaks, where they're telling CNN and MSNBC how to create race war in America, and to watch them do it, and it's so horrible.
[02:39:39.383 --> 02:39:46.748]  I'm gonna go to Sean, I'm gonna go to Dr. X, I'm gonna go to Uncle Sam, I'm gonna go to Carlos, Dennis, Sean, Jim, Judy, Ernie, Cameron.
[02:39:46.748 --> 02:39:48.929]  I'm gonna try to get to everybody here in just a minute.
[02:39:48.929 --> 02:39:50.330]  If I don't do this, we won't be here though.
[02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:55.194]  And this is a real bittersweet thing.
[02:39:55.194 --> 02:39:59.617]  Because X2's going up for us to get the deep earth crystals from the old companies that drill it during gas drilling.
[02:40:00.942 --> 02:40:05.324]  And it's already gone up before, and then it takes longer to get it, and I've been trying to find another source.
[02:40:05.324 --> 02:40:10.807]  So when we say it's the only deep-earth crystals out there anybody knows about that are pure iodine and a good allergen, it's the truth.
[02:40:10.807 --> 02:40:16.170]  Because I want to go find another source that's lower price, so I don't have to pay this, and then have to jack the price up.
[02:40:16.170 --> 02:40:20.773]  But the next batches we get are not going to be at sell price, and then they may be gone.
[02:40:20.773 --> 02:40:23.294]  There's like, I guess enough for two more batches.
[02:40:23.294 --> 02:40:26.195]  Well, this is about to sell out, so I'm going to end the 25% off on X2 today.
[02:40:28.075 --> 02:40:28.636]  It's got to end.
[02:40:28.636 --> 02:40:29.516]  They're finally a week late.
[02:40:29.516 --> 02:40:30.577]  I'm not mad at them.
[02:40:30.577 --> 02:40:36.202]  Got... ...Brain Force off the deal.
[02:40:36.202 --> 02:40:38.183]  That's almost sold out.
[02:40:38.183 --> 02:40:39.705]  But we've got Super Mel Vitelli.
[02:40:39.705 --> 02:40:42.607]  We've got a good supply of that, though it's a best-seller.
[02:40:42.607 --> 02:40:46.190]  Concentrated cold-pressed herbs, known for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:47.091]  That's critical.
[02:40:47.091 --> 02:40:49.313]  Everybody else doesn't do cold-pressed.
[02:40:49.313 --> 02:40:53.936]  It takes something like five, six times, depending on the batch, of the herbs to cold-press.
[02:40:53.936 --> 02:40:56.679]  It means they smash the herbs, squeeze out the juice and the oil,
[02:40:58.462 --> 02:41:03.666]  And then they throw away, you know, 90 plus percent of it, and it takes way more product to do it.
[02:41:03.666 --> 02:41:04.366]  Way more of the herb.
[02:41:04.366 --> 02:41:11.792]  That's why, you know, we're putting, we're not paying like $20 a thing for this.
[02:41:11.792 --> 02:41:17.576]  I mean, other tinctures and stuff, you're talking $2 a product, and we're paying 20 bucks for this, and there's all the other expenses that go into it.
[02:41:17.576 --> 02:41:20.318]  So it's 50% off right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:20.318 --> 02:41:21.879]  It is a big sale.
[02:41:21.879 --> 02:41:24.781]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:29.065 --> 02:41:32.006]  And we've also got super high quality My Patriot Supply.
[02:41:32.006 --> 02:41:34.747]  There's a nexus point for how much food costs versus the quality.
[02:41:34.747 --> 02:41:37.408]  It is super high quality for a low price.
[02:41:37.408 --> 02:41:40.349]  It's what I chose for my family going back six, seven years ago.
[02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:43.590]  And when the food gets older, I give it to charity.
[02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:46.471]  It lasts 25 years, but I just reordered more food last year.
[02:41:46.471 --> 02:41:55.835]  You can get a three month supply and get a free Alexa Pure Pro, $200 plus value, stainless steel water filtration, gravity fit system for free.
[02:41:57.068 --> 02:42:03.056]  It's only $499 for the food, so $200 value on top of that, it's almost a lost liter.
[02:42:03.056 --> 02:42:06.621]  And of course, this is put together in Utah by the experts that know how to do it.
[02:42:06.621 --> 02:42:14.111]  When they started 10 years ago, they were a small company, they got big, they bought up some of the other well-known good companies, and now they're the biggest company out there.
[02:42:16.294 --> 02:42:17.335]  Private-labeled.
[02:42:17.335 --> 02:42:19.076]  That's how we get around it contractually.
[02:42:19.076 --> 02:42:19.816]  We couldn't do this for a while.
[02:42:19.816 --> 02:42:21.497]  It was actually a shake-up of the company.
[02:42:21.497 --> 02:42:22.437]  They told me I could do it.
[02:42:22.437 --> 02:42:23.138]  It was a shake-up.
[02:42:23.138 --> 02:42:24.919]  We couldn't do it for about a year.
[02:42:24.919 --> 02:42:25.719]  Now I can do it again.
[02:42:25.719 --> 02:42:30.422]  I can private-label it, InfoWare Select, or MyPatriot, and give you prizes nobody else gets.
[02:42:30.422 --> 02:42:32.783]  Because the other distributors and stuff get mad.
[02:42:32.783 --> 02:42:35.905]  It's not cutting into you with your audience if you sell it for more.
[02:42:35.905 --> 02:42:37.005]  People have different audiences.
[02:42:37.005 --> 02:42:38.626]  I'm sorry I have the lowest prices.
[02:42:38.626 --> 02:42:39.087]  We really do!
[02:42:39.927 --> 02:42:43.791]  So much it changes the whole industry and a corporate shakeup, but hey, whatever.
[02:42:43.791 --> 02:42:45.773]  You can get it again at the lowest prices anywhere.
[02:42:45.773 --> 02:42:50.057]  Infowarsstore.com and get a free gravity-fed filter at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:50.057 --> 02:42:55.042]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.042 --> 02:42:55.883]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:42:55.883 --> 02:42:56.964]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:42:56.964 --> 02:42:57.245]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.187 --> 02:43:00.110]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:09.481]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:43:10.289 --> 02:43:17.071]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:43:17.071 --> 02:43:19.312]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:43:19.312 --> 02:43:20.372]  Thank you.
[02:43:20.372 --> 02:43:22.873]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:43:22.873 --> 02:43:27.194]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:43:27.194 --> 02:43:30.215]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:43:30.215 --> 02:43:31.535]  They are quality.
[02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:33.256]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:43:33.256 --> 02:43:36.137]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:43:36.137 --> 02:43:36.677]  Absolutely.
[02:43:36.997 --> 02:43:37.418]  That's right.
[02:43:54.912 --> 02:43:58.655]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:43:58.655 --> 02:44:05.719]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:44:05.719 --> 02:44:10.463]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:44:10.463 --> 02:44:11.223]  It's very simple.
[02:44:11.223 --> 02:44:13.705]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[02:44:13.705 --> 02:44:15.666]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[02:44:15.666 --> 02:44:17.467]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[02:44:17.467 --> 02:44:18.628]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:44:18.628 --> 02:44:19.369]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:44:24.312 --> 02:44:27.353]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:44:27.353 --> 02:44:31.794]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:44:31.794 --> 02:44:35.634]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[02:44:35.634 --> 02:44:39.515]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:44:39.515 --> 02:44:42.676]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:44:42.676 --> 02:44:46.316]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[02:44:46.316 --> 02:44:48.897]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[02:44:48.897 --> 02:44:49.917]  It's amazing.
[02:44:49.917 --> 02:44:52.238]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.

[02:45:55.712 --> 02:46:01.293]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fort Worth's life.
[02:46:01.293 --> 02:46:02.174]  It'd take hours.
[02:46:02.174 --> 02:46:04.594]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:46:04.594 --> 02:46:05.775]  It's stronger.
[02:46:05.775 --> 02:46:07.395]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:46:07.395 --> 02:46:10.616]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:46:10.616 --> 02:46:11.736]  It's back in stock.
[02:46:11.736 --> 02:46:14.897]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:14.897 --> 02:46:18.218]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:18.678 --> 02:46:19.058]  That's right.
[02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:37.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:09.932 --> 02:47:12.322]  Well, it just broke.
[02:47:12.322 --> 02:47:12.783]  That's right.
[02:47:16.861 --> 02:47:21.203]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:21.203 --> 02:47:24.644]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.644 --> 02:47:33.068]  Just like night followed this day, a couple weeks ago, Oregon said we're going to reject President Trump's request for National Guard troops on the collapsing southern border.
[02:47:33.068 --> 02:47:39.970]  And I said, you watch, California's already in sanctuary cities, saying we don't care what's MS-13 criminals, we tell them to resist you.
[02:47:39.970 --> 02:47:40.751]  True racketeering.
[02:47:41.653 --> 02:47:46.414]  Well, AP reports, California rejects border duties for troops.
[02:47:46.414 --> 02:47:52.415]  Headline, California tells Trump they will withhold border patrol.
[02:47:52.415 --> 02:47:57.876]  California tells Trump they're going to withhold National Guard from defending the border.
[02:47:57.876 --> 02:48:04.098]  California announces plan to block National Guard troops aiding Trump.
[02:48:04.098 --> 02:48:05.918]  There's your headline.
[02:48:05.918 --> 02:48:06.658]  Treason!
[02:48:06.658 --> 02:48:11.059]  California says National Guard troops will be withheld in their state from border duties.
[02:48:12.355 --> 02:48:13.315]  I mean, how do you say that?
[02:48:13.315 --> 02:48:15.016]  How do you quantify that?
[02:48:15.016 --> 02:48:16.997]  You talk about criminal racketeering.
[02:48:16.997 --> 02:48:23.639]  Instead, we're hearing about Trump's lawyer and did some hooker get money ten years ago.
[02:48:23.639 --> 02:48:25.059]  That's all these porn stars are.
[02:48:25.059 --> 02:48:26.680]  They're a star!
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:30.081]  They're a star!
[02:48:30.081 --> 02:48:35.383]  No, hookers learn they can have sex on 35mm and 8mm and make money.
[02:48:35.383 --> 02:48:36.463]  Fine!
[02:48:36.463 --> 02:48:37.163]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:48:37.163 --> 02:48:39.484]  I say decriminalize it, but don't lionize it.
[02:48:42.014 --> 02:48:47.218]  And so, oh my gosh, reportedly Trump had sex with a hooker 11 years ago.
[02:48:47.218 --> 02:48:48.860]  He never said he was goody two-shoes.
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:50.601]  Now the whole country has to go down.
[02:48:50.601 --> 02:48:58.047]  Well, the coyotes kill people on the border every day when they shake their families down for more money.
[02:48:58.047 --> 02:49:02.631]  And it's been reported by Amnesty International that 80% of the women trekking over the Mexico-U.S.
[02:49:02.631 --> 02:49:05.273]  border say they're raped as part of their payment.
[02:49:09.384 --> 02:49:16.670]  A lot of them take abortion pills, not the morning after pills, as they prepare to cross the border, just so they're just getting ready for the rape.
[02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:25.576]  Imagine the pigs, that like, part of you, they have daughters, they have wives, part of you coming across is, I'm going to rape you.
[02:49:25.576 --> 02:49:29.279]  No movies, no Netflix about that, no nothing.
[02:49:29.279 --> 02:49:38.506]  Just Robert Rodriguez shows Don Johnson, the white cowboy, with a 30-odd six-shoot, the pregnant Mexican in the belly, a simulation of the evil gringo.
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:41.941]  Meanwhile, Mexico rapes and kills hundreds of thousands of women.
[02:49:41.941 --> 02:49:44.022]  It's okay.
[02:49:44.022 --> 02:49:46.944]  As long as it's in the Raza, right?
[02:49:46.944 --> 02:49:53.907]  And that's how the Nazis and everybody use race as a way to abuse their own people within the cult, like a prison.
[02:49:53.907 --> 02:49:55.588]  Oh, you're in the white supremacist group.
[02:49:55.588 --> 02:49:56.648]  You know, we can abuse you.
[02:49:56.648 --> 02:49:57.869]  You're in the black supremacist group.
[02:49:57.869 --> 02:50:00.170]  You're within your little cult.
[02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:04.112]  Sean, Dr. X, Ernie, Cameron.
[02:50:04.112 --> 02:50:06.613]  Let's go to Sean in New Jersey.
[02:50:06.613 --> 02:50:07.414]  You're on the air, Sean.
[02:50:07.414 --> 02:50:07.754]  Go ahead.
[02:50:09.707 --> 02:50:11.288]  Hey Alex, thanks for putting me on, brother.
[02:50:11.288 --> 02:50:12.449]  How you doing today?
[02:50:12.449 --> 02:50:16.351]  You know, I am not very, very pleased.
[02:50:16.351 --> 02:50:17.431]  Look, Trump's still a good guy.
[02:50:17.431 --> 02:50:18.672]  They're after him because he's a good guy.
[02:50:18.672 --> 02:50:27.437]  But it's, you know, to see your quarterback get basically, you know, sacked and has a concussion, bleeding from the nose, it's not a good deal.
[02:50:27.437 --> 02:50:33.641]  And anybody that says him not flip-flopping on Syria isn't a big problem is smoking something.
[02:50:33.641 --> 02:50:34.201]  No, you're right.
[02:50:34.201 --> 02:50:35.742]  It's a big gut punch.
[02:50:35.742 --> 02:50:37.823]  It's a big gut punch to his constituency.
[02:50:39.738 --> 02:50:44.220]  Well, let me tell you, Trump knows it's bad, and of course, it's a sugar high.
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:50.283]  Those fake pollsters gave him an extra 10 points where he thinks if he goes along with them, he'll get support.
[02:50:50.283 --> 02:50:54.746]  No, they're only going to get him to think he's got support while they wear him out with his actual constituency.
[02:50:54.746 --> 02:50:59.068]  They're trying to trick him into killing his constituency right now.
[02:50:59.068 --> 02:51:00.429]  Brother, you're not lying.
[02:51:00.429 --> 02:51:04.771]  They gave him 10 points, though he already had those 10 points going into it, and you know it.
[02:51:04.771 --> 02:51:06.492]  They always doctor the polls.
[02:51:08.868 --> 02:51:10.490]  Well, he probably had 15 points.
[02:51:10.490 --> 02:51:11.011]  Exactly.
[02:51:11.011 --> 02:51:13.975]  They just let Trump have his real poll when he did the strike.
[02:51:13.975 --> 02:51:15.216]  They're like, oh, our job's easy.
[02:51:15.216 --> 02:51:16.458]  We don't have to cook it today.
[02:51:16.458 --> 02:51:17.820]  Just do the real poll.
[02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:20.022]  Run the real poll!
[02:51:20.022 --> 02:51:21.805]  Yeah, we can actually tell the truth for once.
[02:51:24.704 --> 02:51:28.007]  Well, you can see the nomenclature, you can see the language of the polls.
[02:51:28.007 --> 02:51:31.069]  They had 10 to 15 points on the polls that are more fair.
[02:51:31.069 --> 02:51:33.170]  CNN does like 30, 40 points.
[02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:36.033]  Remember they had Hillary winning at 69% and stuff?
[02:51:36.033 --> 02:51:39.335]  They were oversampling 40 plus points for Democrats!
[02:51:39.335 --> 02:51:43.758]  That means Hillary was 30% in the CNN poll!
[02:51:43.758 --> 02:51:48.562]  Yeah, I laughed the entire way through the election.
[02:51:48.562 --> 02:51:50.143]  Because I knew Trump was winning.
[02:51:50.143 --> 02:51:52.165]  Look, I'm a vet, brother.
[02:51:52.165 --> 02:51:52.405]  You know?
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:57.422]  Trump is the American man and woman's president.
[02:51:57.422 --> 02:52:00.944]  That's why he was elected, to end this corruption.
[02:52:00.944 --> 02:52:05.066]  To return sovereign power back to the people of this country.
[02:52:05.066 --> 02:52:16.792]  And now you have Democrats running all over, giving illegal citizens driver's licenses so that they can go vote in local elections, so they can cling on to their little power and keep patting their back.
[02:52:16.792 --> 02:52:20.514]  And then Trump needs to leave office, not for Russia, but over a bimbo?
[02:52:22.293 --> 02:52:22.813]  I know, right?
[02:52:22.813 --> 02:52:23.994]  It's disgraceful.
[02:52:23.994 --> 02:52:27.276]  These people have no honor, which is why I'm calling, brother.
[02:52:27.276 --> 02:52:29.137]  I got a question for you.
[02:52:29.137 --> 02:52:30.578]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:52:30.578 --> 02:52:33.139]  You should pull this.
[02:52:33.139 --> 02:52:39.523]  Get a petition going, and there has to be something in the Constitution that can allow this to happen.
[02:52:39.523 --> 02:52:40.643]  Our government, these...
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:50.885]  Lifetime and repeat politicians who are no, they have broken their oaths of office.
[02:52:50.885 --> 02:52:54.708]  They are no longer working in the interest of the American people.
[02:52:54.708 --> 02:53:13.882]  There has to be a way where we can get a petition together and get 20 to 40,000 voters from every district, Democrat, Republican, Senate, so that we can have them removed, have them tried for treason, and get
[02:53:14.609 --> 02:53:19.594]  Normal, average, everyday, non-career politician, American citizen.
[02:53:19.594 --> 02:53:26.340]  Yeah, listen, I'm not going to knock on what you're saying, but there's no silver bullets in this whole system with Robert's rules and all, but I get what you're saying.
[02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:31.265]  The President knows crimes have been committed by the Clintons, by Comey, by Mueller, by all of them.
[02:53:31.265 --> 02:53:32.326]  They've been caught.
[02:53:32.326 --> 02:53:37.311]  The fact that the Justice Department is penetrated and so filled with Clinton criminal operatives
[02:53:39.723 --> 02:53:41.224]  That's where we are.
[02:53:41.224 --> 02:53:43.445]  And so, I'm just going to say it.
[02:53:43.445 --> 02:53:49.987]  If Trump doesn't move with the military, and I never want this, but we're already under a globalist coup.
[02:53:49.987 --> 02:53:57.010]  If he doesn't move to just remove all those people and have the indictments and have the tribunals, then there's no hope.
[02:53:57.010 --> 02:53:59.111]  Because we are overrun by a foreign globalist power.
[02:53:59.111 --> 02:54:00.311]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:00.311 --> 02:54:02.092]  And I'm not calling for that at this point.
[02:54:04.284 --> 02:54:20.576]  I'm simply saying, if you've got foreign globalist powers manipulating our military, manipulating our police, manipulating the highest levels of the Justice Department, and all their crimes are ignored, and the Justice Department won't go after it, and the left is so arrogant and Hollywood's so arrogant, I don't know what you do.
[02:54:26.124 --> 02:54:33.947]  See, the average leftist thinks if Trump goes down, not that the economy will implode or all this bad, they just think like a lottery ticket, like, I'll be a winner if Trump goes down.
[02:54:33.947 --> 02:54:36.128]  That's how dumb they are.
[02:54:36.128 --> 02:54:38.689]  They don't get that Trump's trying to reboot the country.
[02:54:38.689 --> 02:54:41.050]  They don't care the country's coming back.
[02:54:41.050 --> 02:54:42.231]  Because they're losers.
[02:54:42.231 --> 02:54:45.492]  Because they've already had everything given to them.
[02:54:45.492 --> 02:54:48.734]  Or they're so stupid.
[02:54:48.734 --> 02:54:50.234]  Thank you, Sean.
[02:54:50.234 --> 02:54:51.975]  Dr. X in Atlanta, Georgia, go ahead.
[02:54:54.514 --> 02:54:58.635]  Hey Alex, long time listening, first time calling.
[02:54:58.635 --> 02:54:59.555]  Welcome.
[02:54:59.555 --> 02:55:02.216]  I'm going to make this fast and furious, got a lot of stuff for you.
[02:55:02.216 --> 02:55:18.460]  So one of the quick things was with the Clinton arrest, if she is arrested, I would suggest watching the outcomes of one of her friends in the Philippines, Arroyo, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:22.681]  So we should watch those two as a comparison to see what exactly is going to go on with Hillary.
[02:55:23.177 --> 02:55:27.202]  Now, first thing, um... Iodine, I can't say enough about this.
[02:55:27.202 --> 02:55:30.366]  Now, what you were talking about a couple of days ago, about the cell phones.
[02:55:30.366 --> 02:55:39.578]  A couple of years ago, the Italian Supreme Court ruled, landmark decision, that the brain tumor caused in Enosunze Marcovini was actually caused by his cell phone.
[02:55:39.578 --> 02:55:40.499]  Landmark decision.
[02:55:40.499 --> 02:55:41.020]  I remember that!
[02:55:41.952 --> 02:55:46.295]  It goes right down the side of his face and gets roasted by the radiation.
[02:55:46.295 --> 02:55:49.376]  Now, inside your phone, it will tell you that you should not put it against your head.
[02:55:49.376 --> 02:55:50.837]  You should always use an air gap.
[02:55:50.837 --> 02:55:52.358]  Five millimeters, something like that.
[02:55:52.358 --> 02:55:53.919]  Who uses their phone like that?
[02:55:53.919 --> 02:55:54.920]  Nobody.
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:56.401]  That's something we really have to be conscious about.
[02:55:56.401 --> 02:55:57.461]  Now, let's look at iodine.
[02:55:57.461 --> 02:56:00.723]  Since we're talking about nerves, all nerves of the body operate on iodine.
[02:56:00.723 --> 02:56:03.205]  They are all darkly colored when you look at them.
[02:56:03.205 --> 02:56:03.645]  First thing,
[02:56:04.437 --> 02:56:06.718]  When you're talking on the phone, you're frying your brain bag.
[02:56:06.718 --> 02:56:11.780]  There's a little baggie that holds your brain, that holds some juice around it so it doesn't get bopped around.
[02:56:11.780 --> 02:56:15.102]  When you talk on it for more than 30 minutes, grease bleeds from the blood-brain barrier.
[02:56:15.102 --> 02:56:16.502]  That is the little baggie.
[02:56:16.502 --> 02:56:18.003]  So that makes it more penetrable.
[02:56:18.003 --> 02:56:20.624]  And that baggie you've done your research has been about iodine.
[02:56:20.624 --> 02:56:21.585]  No, exactly.
[02:56:21.585 --> 02:56:27.287]  They just put iodine in toothpaste, in everything, because scientists knew that you have to have it.
[02:56:27.287 --> 02:56:29.208]  Instead, they take it out and they put the fluoride in.
[02:56:30.498 --> 02:56:31.299]  Exactly.
[02:56:31.299 --> 02:56:34.002]  Now, here's another thing with the iodine.
[02:56:34.002 --> 02:56:36.285]  Iodine's a metal, right?
[02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:37.286]  It's an element, yes.
[02:56:37.286 --> 02:56:38.747]  I mean, it's in that class.
[02:56:38.747 --> 02:56:42.892]  We know not to put iodine in a microwave.
[02:56:42.892 --> 02:56:43.252]  Right?
[02:56:43.252 --> 02:56:44.213]  Or else what will happen?
[02:56:44.213 --> 02:56:46.156]  That's right, it explodes.
[02:56:46.156 --> 02:56:48.798]  It's like ray shielding for your brain and your cells.
[02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:50.741]  I mean, what you're getting at is it's a Faraday cage.
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:57.783]  Yep, now you go and you apply microwave to your metal, just on a microscopic scale.
[02:56:57.783 --> 02:56:58.403]  What does that do?
[02:56:58.403 --> 02:57:00.104]  It causes firing in the system.
[02:57:00.104 --> 02:57:02.065]  It causes electrochemical explosions.
[02:57:03.024 --> 02:57:03.604]  Exactly.
[02:57:03.604 --> 02:57:08.187]  Now, here's where iodine is really, really, really, really, really, really nice.
[02:57:08.187 --> 02:57:10.008]  Well, I'm going to go on one other thing.
[02:57:10.008 --> 02:57:17.432]  You can, for people that have neurological disorders, I like combining Red Pill with Co-DNA Force.
[02:57:17.432 --> 02:57:18.553]  I love those two together.
[02:57:18.553 --> 02:57:25.536]  Now, if you add, of course, iodine and some MSM, Opti-MSM, you can have a very nice fix for a lot of neurological things.
[02:57:25.536 --> 02:57:26.157]  Now, here's another thing.
[02:57:26.157 --> 02:57:28.038]  With your iodine, anyone with
[02:57:28.618 --> 02:57:29.980]  Hold on, I want to hear more about this.
[02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:30.721]  We're back in a minute.
[02:57:30.721 --> 02:57:31.302]  Salente's coming up.
[02:57:31.302 --> 02:57:31.723]  I promise.
[02:57:31.723 --> 02:57:33.125]  I'm going through your calls, though.
[02:57:33.125 --> 02:57:34.687]  I'm sure Salente's going to want to take your calls.
[02:57:34.687 --> 02:57:36.650]  We'll see if he'll let me ride shotgun with him.
[02:57:36.650 --> 02:57:40.055]  This is all coming up straight ahead on AlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[02:57:40.055 --> 02:57:41.518]  I'm telling you, folks.
[02:57:41.518 --> 02:57:42.820]  Iodine is the next level.
[02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:44.142]  I couldn't have the energy I have without it.
[02:57:45.117 --> 02:57:55.705]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.705 --> 02:57:57.767]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.767 --> 02:58:00.629]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.629 --> 02:58:02.130]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:05.253]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:58:05.493 --> 02:58:08.936]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:58:08.936 --> 02:58:11.017]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:58:11.017 --> 02:58:20.744]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:58:20.744 --> 02:58:33.293]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:58:33.493 --> 02:58:37.535]  Reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.535 --> 02:58:40.836]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.836 --> 02:58:44.198]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com
[02:58:46.010 --> 02:58:57.456]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:58:57.456 --> 02:59:06.381]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[02:59:06.601 --> 02:59:15.327]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[02:59:15.327 --> 02:59:20.351]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[02:59:20.351 --> 02:59:30.638]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:59:30.638 --> 02:59:36.022]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:59:36.482 --> 02:59:48.750]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:59:48.750 --> 02:59:59.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.258 --> 03:00:05.502]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.977 --> 03:00:20.220]  New story up on Infowars.com by Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[03:00:20.220 --> 03:00:23.803]  New Loretta Lynch revelations shot come he's booked her.
[03:00:23.803 --> 03:00:26.845]  Loretta Lynch offered a Supreme Court seat if she exonerated Hillary.
[03:00:26.845 --> 03:00:27.766]  We've got the documents.
[03:00:27.766 --> 03:00:29.768]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:29.768 --> 03:00:30.528]  That's pretty big.
[03:00:31.567 --> 03:00:35.730]  But none of that matters if we got cell phones and 5G, giving everybody brain cancer.
[03:00:35.730 --> 03:00:43.676]  None of it matters if they're growing humanoids that aren't human genetics completely, but are humans and have no rights inside cows to harvest their organs.
[03:00:43.676 --> 03:00:46.458]  That's all over mainstream news today.
[03:00:46.458 --> 03:00:55.465]  It's just crazy to see the talking points by the establishment trying to keep the public ignorant of this, so we don't have a real debate about it and turn it around.
[03:00:55.465 --> 03:00:59.889]  We've got the great trends forecasters room, Corsi, coming up in a little while, but right now, Dr. X in Atlanta.
[03:00:59.889 --> 03:01:01.150]  Go ahead and finish up your points.
[03:01:02.492 --> 03:01:03.173]  Alright.
[03:01:03.173 --> 03:01:04.034]  Hey, how's the sound now?
[03:01:04.034 --> 03:01:06.015]  It's a little bit better than it was.
[03:01:06.015 --> 03:01:07.096]  Go ahead.
[03:01:07.096 --> 03:01:07.457]  Okay.
[03:01:07.457 --> 03:01:19.308]  Alright, so the other thing was if you're having skin issues, people having, let's say, razor bumps, rash, things like that, maybe even scars, I love the X2 as an aftershave.
[03:01:19.308 --> 03:01:22.391]  Or just slather it on to give yourself a little facial.
[03:01:23.772 --> 03:01:25.473]  By the way, that's what the studies show.
[03:01:25.473 --> 03:01:28.134]  Iodine deficiency causes all sorts of problems.
[03:01:28.134 --> 03:01:33.077]  Like, I remember when I first wanted it five years ago, Dr. Gribbs said, watch your sunspots.
[03:01:33.077 --> 03:01:36.079]  I had all this sun damage spots.
[03:01:36.079 --> 03:01:37.260]  80% of it, 90% went away.
[03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:38.500]  And he said, yes.
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:42.903]  I mean, I'm not saying that's going to happen for everybody, but it was crazy how healthy my skin got.
[03:01:44.142 --> 03:01:49.504]  Well that's because the skin grows from bottom up and iodine penetrates the skin extremely well.
[03:01:49.504 --> 03:01:53.566]  It goes all the way down to the bottom layer where the axon actually starts.
[03:01:53.566 --> 03:01:59.649]  So you actually cause yourself to generate new tissue by applying the iodine topically.
[03:02:02.097 --> 03:02:10.019]  And the problem is all they've got is this bound toxic iodine at the store that's for like topical cuts that makes you even worse.
[03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:13.640]  And almost no one, I don't be the only one selling this, it's crazy.
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:15.100]  Why don't other people put it in palm oil?
[03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:17.441]  Why don't they get the pure iodine?
[03:02:17.441 --> 03:02:22.422]  And why suddenly do the oil companies, Dr. Axe is not a smart guy, not want us to even get access to it?
[03:02:24.369 --> 03:02:28.133]  Well, you can go back to what you were talking about, the iodine conspiracy.
[03:02:28.133 --> 03:02:30.816]  As you mess with iodine, you dumb down the population.
[03:02:30.816 --> 03:02:32.798]  You also make them sterile.
[03:02:32.798 --> 03:02:36.061]  So that takes us back to all the stuff that the globalists have been planning.
[03:02:36.061 --> 03:02:37.122]  That's another study!
[03:02:37.122 --> 03:02:37.523]  Search it!
[03:02:37.523 --> 03:02:38.564]  There's hundreds.
[03:02:38.564 --> 03:02:40.226]  Iodine deficiency and infertility.
[03:02:40.226 --> 03:02:41.247]  You're a smart guy, Dr. X.
[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:46.781]  No, but I'd forgotten all this stuff.
[03:02:46.781 --> 03:02:48.621]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[03:02:48.621 --> 03:02:50.342]  Like, without vitamin C, you die.
[03:02:50.342 --> 03:02:51.703]  Without oxygen, you die.
[03:02:51.703 --> 03:02:52.783]  Without iodine, you die.
[03:02:52.783 --> 03:02:55.304]  I mean, there's certain things you gotta have.
[03:02:55.304 --> 03:02:57.505]  And then, why isn't iodine just everywhere?
[03:02:57.505 --> 03:03:02.107]  Why did they used to put it in salt, used to put it in toothpaste, and only we ever did a report on it.
[03:03:02.107 --> 03:03:06.669]  And now, they attack me everywhere because I sell iodine, and they call it quack BS.
[03:03:13.086 --> 03:03:13.547]  That was H.G.
[03:03:13.547 --> 03:03:13.727]  Wells.
[03:03:25.993 --> 03:03:29.976]  The behavior is caused by nutrition.
[03:03:29.976 --> 03:03:31.977]  Nutrition and behavior are directly correlated.
[03:03:31.977 --> 03:03:36.540]  Dr. Russell Blalock has a whole presentation on that.
[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:37.481]  Oh, that's it.
[03:03:37.481 --> 03:03:40.884]  They absolutely feed us GMO and crap because you're right.
[03:03:40.884 --> 03:03:48.329]  When you go back to Japan or ancient Europe, the nobility was like a foot taller than the serfs because they kept them in starvation.
[03:03:49.690 --> 03:03:52.953]  And then that goes back to iodine again, because iodine makes up your bones.
[03:03:52.953 --> 03:03:54.475]  Iodine makes up all tissue.
[03:03:54.475 --> 03:03:56.998]  Every single tissue in your body is made of collagen, collagen.
[03:03:57.921 --> 03:04:05.684]  There are several people that meet at that meeting table, that conference table, to make a piece of tissue or collagen, and iodine is there.
[03:04:05.684 --> 03:04:10.567]  Iodine has to talk to vitamin C. They've got to coordinate moves with copper.
[03:04:10.567 --> 03:04:15.109]  They've got to then coordinate more moves with dirt or, well, sand, silica.
[03:04:15.109 --> 03:04:18.270]  You know, some people pick that from diatomaceous earth, so on and so forth.
[03:04:18.270 --> 03:04:22.852]  But back to iodine, the reason why you have these differences between the rulers and rules
[03:04:23.388 --> 03:04:27.750]  Well, that's another thing.
[03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:29.171]  They make fun of women all over the world.
[03:04:29.171 --> 03:04:30.032]  They call it a disorder.
[03:04:30.032 --> 03:04:32.673]  Women go to clay, smell it, and eat it.
[03:04:32.673 --> 03:04:41.558]  But now we know it has the trace elements in it, and that women particularly will go out and eat the clay if they can't get minerals, just like the deer and everything else does.
[03:04:41.558 --> 03:04:43.859]  Amazing, Dr. X. You're absolutely on target.
[03:04:43.859 --> 03:04:46.340]  Gerald Cilente and more phone calls straight ahead.
[03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:51.583]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Gerald Cilente, TrendsResearch.com.
[03:04:54.881 --> 03:04:55.681]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.681 --> 03:05:05.823]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.823 --> 03:05:14.345]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.345 --> 03:05:23.127]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.216 --> 03:05:30.518]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:05:30.518 --> 03:05:33.419]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:33.419 --> 03:05:44.802]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.802 --> 03:05:47.483]  It is amazing!
[03:05:47.483 --> 03:05:52.445]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:05:55.165 --> 03:05:55.786]  We've got it.
[03:05:55.786 --> 03:06:02.314]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:06:02.314 --> 03:06:06.699]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:06.699 --> 03:06:12.366]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:23.382 --> 03:06:25.164]  Carol Salente is hosting this hour.
[03:06:25.164 --> 03:06:25.704]  I ran over.
[03:06:25.704 --> 03:06:26.485]  We had a bunch of callers.
[03:06:26.485 --> 03:06:27.226]  He's gracious enough.
[03:06:27.226 --> 03:06:28.147]  He wants to hear from your calls.
[03:06:28.147 --> 03:06:31.129]  The next few segments then I'll punch out, but he'll be riding shotgun with us.
[03:06:31.129 --> 03:06:40.838]  But just as a citizen, as an American, it is such an affront to see the Vice President of the Deep State, James Comey, and the President of the Deep State, Robert Mueller.
[03:06:41.559 --> 03:06:50.963]  Being worshipped everywhere, all over national television, when they're deep in bed with the Russians, the Chinese, creating this whole fake PPGate dossier.
[03:06:50.963 --> 03:06:52.504]  That's all been disproven.
[03:06:52.504 --> 03:07:00.367]  So they raid the President's lawyer, and find out the lawyer, they're now leaking it, was like doing Republicans favors.
[03:07:00.367 --> 03:07:04.169]  Because he's a lawyer, they're like, hey, will you handle this payoff to a woman?
[03:07:04.169 --> 03:07:06.029]  I got pregnant.
[03:07:06.029 --> 03:07:07.330]  And guaranteed the President doesn't know.
[03:07:07.330 --> 03:07:08.330]  He famously delegates.
[03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:09.591]  But who cares?
[03:07:11.192 --> 03:07:18.638]  I mean, I'm not into corruption, but people paying people off for affairs?
[03:07:18.638 --> 03:07:30.387]  You've got the sellout of the country, you've got the Arab Spring, you've got open borders, you've got the sellout to China, a $900 billion trade deficit, and notice we're hearing about Trump and Bimbos.
[03:07:30.387 --> 03:07:36.732]  And then now we're hearing about other donors and his lawyer a few days after he gets raided, and then suddenly Trump starts to roll over.
[03:07:38.012 --> 03:07:45.734]  Despite all his hundreds of tweets about Syria, and how the rebels are staging it, and we shouldn't go there, and the rebels are worse than Assad, on and on and on, suddenly this happens.
[03:07:45.734 --> 03:07:48.254]  And I know it's about North Korea, and sending a message.
[03:07:48.254 --> 03:07:49.134]  Whatever!
[03:07:49.134 --> 03:07:50.715]  Trump's not been about Machiavelli.
[03:07:50.715 --> 03:07:52.615]  He's been about pretty much straight shooting.
[03:07:52.615 --> 03:07:56.396]  He'll Machiavelli leftist in, and draw him in and say, oh, what do you want on DACA?
[03:07:56.396 --> 03:07:57.496]  Oh, total open borders?
[03:07:57.496 --> 03:07:58.356]  What do you want on guns?
[03:07:58.356 --> 03:07:59.637]  Oh, repeal the Second Amendment?
[03:07:59.637 --> 03:08:04.458]  I mean, he'll do that, but Trump and his 40 chests have been pretty much straight shooting.
[03:08:06.323 --> 03:08:07.503]  I know the globalists hate Trump.
[03:08:07.503 --> 03:08:08.724]  He's better than Hillary, obviously.
[03:08:08.724 --> 03:08:17.007]  But at a gut level, I see this as a real sign that they've got stuff on him.
[03:08:17.007 --> 03:08:23.030]  And my gut level tells me that his attempt to appease them is going to go over like a lead balloon.
[03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:24.470]  But you're a smart guy.
[03:08:24.470 --> 03:08:28.992]  You know, you've been a bestselling author, worked as a top consultant, worked, you know, you name it.
[03:08:28.992 --> 03:08:30.353]  You know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:08:30.353 --> 03:08:31.273]  What does your gut tell you?
[03:08:32.608 --> 03:08:38.291]  Well, I'm on the same page as you, is that the globalists is the first thing he has said.
[03:08:38.291 --> 03:08:40.352]  The globalists are against him.
[03:08:40.352 --> 03:08:42.113]  So, what's the big thing with Trump?
[03:08:42.113 --> 03:08:45.035]  Why would the globalists hate Trump?
[03:08:45.035 --> 03:08:52.879]  Well, the first thing is, of course, he wants to renegotiate those globalist trade packages that Bill Clinton put together.
[03:08:52.879 --> 03:08:57.101]  And pulled us out of their whole TPP, where they were about to transfer all the power.
[03:08:57.101 --> 03:08:58.021]  That's right.
[03:08:58.021 --> 03:08:59.042]  Let's go back again.
[03:08:59.042 --> 03:09:00.683]  Who did he run against?
[03:09:00.683 --> 03:09:01.043]  Clinton.
[03:09:01.636 --> 03:09:03.019]  And what did Bill Clinton do?
[03:09:03.019 --> 03:09:11.694]  Clinton sold this country out, as I view it, and you know the motto of the Trends Journal, think for yourself, just about more than any other president.
[03:09:12.242 --> 03:09:16.565]  I mean, Obama lied more than anybody, but Clinton really sold us out.
[03:09:16.565 --> 03:09:19.727]  Yeah, he's the one that really began the total sellout to China.
[03:09:19.727 --> 03:09:20.087]  Exactly.
[03:09:20.087 --> 03:09:22.909]  Trump's not perfect, but he's not out to get the country.
[03:09:22.909 --> 03:09:27.712]  And he's just bringing back a meat, like, they do $900 billion on us, he goes, okay, $50 billion tariff.
[03:09:27.712 --> 03:09:31.694]  Or he tries to lower our taxes just to match China, and they flip out.
[03:09:31.694 --> 03:09:35.157]  Because, exactly, he's not out to get the country.
[03:09:35.157 --> 03:09:38.939]  And you look at Clinton's track record, beginning with NAFTA.
[03:09:38.939 --> 03:09:40.240]  What do we, you know,
[03:09:40.945 --> 03:09:47.289]  But about 800,000 jobs shorter or something, you know, since that happened, that we lost.
[03:09:47.289 --> 03:09:48.010]  What else?
[03:09:48.010 --> 03:09:50.371]  So we have a trade deficit now.
[03:09:50.371 --> 03:09:58.436]  We had a positive trade balance, and now we have a negative one of... 500 billion.
[03:09:58.436 --> 03:10:00.598]  No, I'm talking about with... Globally, it's 1.3.
[03:10:00.598 --> 03:10:01.458]  Mexico's 71 billion.
[03:10:01.458 --> 03:10:01.598]  Yeah.
[03:10:05.622 --> 03:10:12.386]  Then he gave us, he brought China into the World Trade Organization, and people don't realize this.
[03:10:12.386 --> 03:10:14.927]  China joined, by the way, two weeks after 9-11.
[03:10:14.927 --> 03:10:19.670]  That's when they officially came in, so no one was paying any attention.
[03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:27.275]  So he lost 3.5 million jobs since then, and that's according, you know, to the economic policy.
[03:10:27.275 --> 03:10:28.095]  No, you're right.
[03:10:28.095 --> 03:10:29.016]  Let me ask you this.
[03:10:29.016 --> 03:10:32.118]  Why do the globalists go out of their way to screw America over?
[03:10:32.318 --> 03:10:36.820]  When they would get even more power, keeping us powerful, and then parlaying that.
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:41.042]  Why do they fundamentally have a giant raging you-know-what for the country?
[03:10:41.042 --> 03:10:42.203]  Because they're making money.
[03:10:42.203 --> 03:10:52.828]  And again, going back to the Clinton deal, and why the globalist, hey, Trump, on the biggest issue I can come up with is, again, redoing the trade agreements.
[03:10:52.828 --> 03:10:54.669]  And when, for example,
[03:10:55.510 --> 03:11:00.074]  China, you go back, you know, a few years ago, they were hardly manufacturing cars.
[03:11:00.074 --> 03:11:02.676]  Oh my gosh, they're making B-2 bombers now.
[03:11:02.676 --> 03:11:03.436]  They've ripped everything off.
[03:11:03.436 --> 03:11:04.457]  So let me ask you this.
[03:11:04.457 --> 03:11:05.518]  Well, they didn't rip it off.
[03:11:05.518 --> 03:11:06.939]  That's the thing I'm trying to say.
[03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:09.942]  Is what happened was, the deal is this.
[03:11:09.942 --> 03:11:14.683]  You want to make them over here, you become a minority owner in the company.
[03:11:14.683 --> 03:11:15.784]  Our company.
[03:11:15.784 --> 03:11:18.304]  And you have to bring over all your technology.
[03:11:18.304 --> 03:11:20.425]  So they did this knowingly.
[03:11:20.425 --> 03:11:21.145]  And let's expand.
[03:11:21.145 --> 03:11:23.345]  This year they doubled down.
[03:11:23.345 --> 03:11:28.946]  When Trump said, I'm lowering from 40 to 15 your corporate tax rate to move jobs here, China, we're going to zero.
[03:11:28.946 --> 03:11:37.388]  And as long as you make it state run and join us, you said, have a house here, as you said, everything's tax free, move to China, everything's tax free for rich people.
[03:11:37.648 --> 03:11:42.990]  Well no, so exactly, and then the trade deficit got even bigger this month to counter Trump.
[03:11:42.990 --> 03:11:46.931]  It's a total sellout, and the average American doesn't even know, doesn't even care.
[03:11:46.931 --> 03:11:49.532]  The average leftist wants higher taxes in America.
[03:11:49.532 --> 03:11:52.953]  They are the biggest idiots I've ever seen, and you are exactly right.
[03:11:52.953 --> 03:11:54.173]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:11:54.173 --> 03:11:57.734]  And then no one's backing Trump, so we're surprised he's starting to roll over.
[03:11:57.734 --> 03:12:00.175]  I'm starting to think America doesn't want to be free, Gerald.
[03:12:01.209 --> 03:12:01.849]  Oh, I agree.
[03:12:01.849 --> 03:12:02.290]  They aren't.
[03:12:02.290 --> 03:12:05.251]  This is a courageless nation.
[03:12:05.251 --> 03:12:09.253]  Anyway, going back to Clinton and the sellout and the globalists.
[03:12:09.253 --> 03:12:14.335]  Why is the major media so pro-Clinton?
[03:12:14.335 --> 03:12:27.241]  It couldn't be because slimy slick Willie Clinton's 1996 Federal Communications Act where he deregulated the entire communications industry.
[03:12:27.241 --> 03:12:28.402]  So foreign corporations could buy it up?
[03:12:29.304 --> 03:12:30.791]  Exactly!
[03:12:30.791 --> 03:12:32.359]  So it's payback!
[03:12:33.012 --> 03:12:34.413]  That's all this is.
[03:12:34.413 --> 03:12:36.554]  It's a joke.
[03:12:36.554 --> 03:12:41.778]  So the Clintons, why did the Clintons foundation worth a billion bucks or whatever it is?
[03:12:41.778 --> 03:12:43.639]  Because of the great things they've done?
[03:12:43.639 --> 03:12:46.401]  And that's why they hate Trump and call him crazy.
[03:12:46.401 --> 03:12:47.882]  They go, we already own the country.
[03:12:47.882 --> 03:12:49.663]  We already de-sixed it.
[03:12:49.663 --> 03:12:50.684]  We already sold it out.
[03:12:50.684 --> 03:12:52.005]  You think you schmuck.
[03:12:52.005 --> 03:12:53.466]  You're going to walk in here and turn it around.
[03:12:53.466 --> 03:12:54.466]  We're going to show you.
[03:12:54.466 --> 03:12:55.667]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[03:12:55.667 --> 03:12:57.709]  They already sold it out so hard.
[03:12:57.709 --> 03:12:58.889]  Gang raped it so hard.
[03:12:58.889 --> 03:13:02.512]  They're just laughing, saying the dumb ass public will never wake up, Trump.
[03:13:03.032 --> 03:13:05.633]  And that's why they thought Trump was crazy.
[03:13:05.633 --> 03:13:08.895]  And again, it goes back to dollars and money.
[03:13:08.895 --> 03:13:10.736]  That's all this is about.
[03:13:10.736 --> 03:13:19.940]  And as I said, so as I see it, the biggest problem the deep state has with Trump is the money problem.
[03:13:19.940 --> 03:13:24.342]  And the money problem is he wants to bring the jobs back to the United States.
[03:13:24.342 --> 03:13:28.844]  And you hear countries like China, how wonderful globalization is.
[03:13:29.344 --> 03:13:39.534]  The European Union, how wonderful globalization is, as the standard of living of everybody in Europe and America has dramatically declined.
[03:13:39.534 --> 03:13:41.076]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:13:41.076 --> 03:13:41.837]  You're a political atheist.
[03:13:41.837 --> 03:13:43.539]  We're going to break him out with calls and you're going to take over.
[03:13:44.161 --> 03:13:48.003]  But clearly Trump's policies are common sense and were good overall.
[03:13:48.003 --> 03:13:49.223]  Some of them were bad.
[03:13:49.223 --> 03:13:57.627]  But the left's hatred of America, like a baby duck that's been imprinted or something, and their hatred of Trump trying to bring it back, and their cheerleading of war.
[03:13:57.627 --> 03:13:58.908]  What happened to the left?
[03:13:58.908 --> 03:14:01.649]  Because they are the most foaming at the mouth crazy people.
[03:14:02.574 --> 03:14:04.695]  Well, look at the left under Obama.
[03:14:04.695 --> 03:14:08.558]  How wonderful the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner was.
[03:14:08.558 --> 03:14:11.440]  Didn't he do a great job over there in Libya?
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:14.242]  Folks, how about that troop surge?
[03:14:14.242 --> 03:14:16.223]  Folks in Afghanistan.
[03:14:16.223 --> 03:14:19.325]  No, you know, one, how about, look what he did with Syria.
[03:14:19.725 --> 03:14:29.787]  He's the guy that started all this, along with the other freaks out there, the Saudis and the rest of them, that have killed, what, over half a million Syrians already?
[03:14:29.787 --> 03:14:33.268]  Because they got involved in a place they had no business?
[03:14:33.268 --> 03:14:38.850]  So they don't have the courage to call out the people that they voted for.
[03:14:38.850 --> 03:14:40.590]  It's a courageous nation.
[03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:43.813]  And that's why the liberals are the way they are.
[03:14:43.813 --> 03:14:47.676]  Obama is... How many... Quote, I'm really good at killing people?
[03:14:47.676 --> 03:14:49.237]  From the book Double Down?
[03:14:49.237 --> 03:14:50.759]  What did he kill?
[03:14:50.759 --> 03:14:51.479]  4,000 people?
[03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:54.002]  Innocent people with drone strikes?
[03:14:54.002 --> 03:14:55.663]  That's your liberals.
[03:14:55.663 --> 03:14:57.325]  They're liars and cowards.
[03:14:58.698 --> 03:15:13.467]  And again, I also agree with you that Trump, with this unprecedented FBI going in and stealing his lawyers, private lawyers' information, they got a lot of stuff on this guy.
[03:15:13.467 --> 03:15:19.710]  And could you imagine being married and having all this stuff coming out, what your life would be like?
[03:15:19.710 --> 03:15:27.035]  So there's a lot of turmoil, and I think the pressure coming onto him is making him do things that he probably wouldn't have normally done.
[03:15:28.208 --> 03:15:30.809]  We need to really pray for President Trump.
[03:15:30.809 --> 03:15:31.429]  Don't believe in that.
[03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:32.329]  Some positive energy.
[03:15:32.329 --> 03:15:32.710]  Whatever.
[03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:36.771]  Because at an intellectual level and a gut level, I've never been more upset.
[03:15:36.771 --> 03:15:38.472]  That's why I blew up Friday night.
[03:15:38.472 --> 03:15:40.612]  It wasn't even over these stupid strikes.
[03:15:40.612 --> 03:15:44.014]  It was over the fact that they finally got his arm on his back.
[03:15:44.014 --> 03:15:46.394]  And you can't deny it, man.
[03:15:46.394 --> 03:15:48.455]  They are putting the screws to Trump right now.
[03:15:48.455 --> 03:15:49.556]  And God help us.
[03:15:49.556 --> 03:15:50.036]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:50.036 --> 03:15:50.436]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.450 --> 03:15:55.331]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.331 --> 03:16:03.914]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:17:26.558 --> 03:17:29.259]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:17:29.259 --> 03:17:34.580]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:40.301]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:17:40.301 --> 03:17:43.702]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[03:17:43.702 --> 03:17:46.823]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:57.991]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:17:57.991 --> 03:18:05.035]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:18:05.035 --> 03:18:09.798]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:18:09.798 --> 03:18:10.538]  It's very simple.
[03:18:10.538 --> 03:18:13.040]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:14.981]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:18:14.981 --> 03:18:16.822]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:18:16.822 --> 03:18:17.963]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:18:17.963 --> 03:18:18.703]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:18:23.646 --> 03:18:26.568]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:18:26.568 --> 03:18:31.131]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:18:31.131 --> 03:18:34.974]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:18:34.974 --> 03:18:38.836]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:18:38.836 --> 03:18:42.018]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:18:42.018 --> 03:18:45.641]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:18:45.641 --> 03:18:48.242]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.

[03:20:08.082 --> 03:20:10.504]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.504 --> 03:20:18.130]  Just a good old boy, never meaning no harm.
[03:20:18.130 --> 03:20:22.734]  They told you never saw a man in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[03:20:36.544 --> 03:20:38.045]  TrendsResearch.com.
[03:20:38.045 --> 03:20:40.967]  Gerald Celentes riding shotgun with us.
[03:20:40.967 --> 03:20:42.888]  I appreciate him hosting an hour each week.
[03:20:44.580 --> 03:21:09.511]  Um, I'll be honest, I'm mad at the American people, but I know they were born into all the Hollywood stuff and sucked into entertainment, but really bad stuff's going on all over the planet, and this country's been so screwed over, and our success that we've got left is so papered, and to see Trump now getting sucked into things that fundamentally he was against, when just a week before Cohen got raided, he was against it, shows me they flipped him.
[03:21:09.511 --> 03:21:11.992]  We'll see if other stuff follows, but I'm really worried.
[03:21:13.206 --> 03:21:15.747]  Because they're not going to even let him limp along.
[03:21:15.747 --> 03:21:18.188]  They want to destroy a nationalist.
[03:21:18.188 --> 03:21:20.689]  They want to send a message.
[03:21:20.689 --> 03:21:23.530]  And there's nationalism and stuff popping up all over the world.
[03:21:23.530 --> 03:21:25.571]  That's the big positive.
[03:21:25.571 --> 03:21:27.951]  They want to send a message.
[03:21:27.951 --> 03:21:31.913]  And I think they're going to try to take the president down.
[03:21:31.913 --> 03:21:38.015]  And just like Hillary and all them said, once they get him out, they're going to really go target everybody.
[03:21:38.015 --> 03:21:39.996]  And there's only so much people can take.
[03:21:41.329 --> 03:21:42.691]  There's only so much people can take.
[03:21:42.691 --> 03:21:45.794]  I mean, I'm not afraid of the globalists.
[03:21:45.794 --> 03:21:47.916]  I'm afraid of my response.
[03:21:47.916 --> 03:21:50.018]  And I'm not saying that to act tough.
[03:21:50.018 --> 03:21:52.000]  But we built Infowars to counter these people.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:53.702]  And let me tell you something.
[03:21:53.702 --> 03:21:55.164]  There's only so much people are going to take.
[03:21:57.179 --> 03:22:02.981]  Then I see so many of the top globalists running away the last year to New Zealand, and they think a big collapse is coming.
[03:22:02.981 --> 03:22:05.482]  This is just a crazy, crazy time.
[03:22:05.482 --> 03:22:10.243]  Gerald, we're going to go to a few calls here and let you take over, and I appreciate you being here today, but what do you think about this time?
[03:22:10.243 --> 03:22:15.045]  I mean, do you at a gut level have as much concerns, or as an intellectual, as a political analyst?
[03:22:15.045 --> 03:22:20.226]  I mean, I just right now feel more spidey-sense concern than I've ever felt.
[03:22:20.226 --> 03:22:25.868]  I just feel like one side of me wants to get my family and get out of the U.S., and the other side of me just says,
[03:22:27.108 --> 03:22:28.829]  You know, are people even worth it?
[03:22:28.829 --> 03:22:33.091]  I just don't get it.
[03:22:33.091 --> 03:22:35.233]  To me, it's the greatest freak show on earth.
[03:22:35.233 --> 03:22:37.574]  I've never seen anything like this before.
[03:22:37.574 --> 03:22:53.903]  I mean, look at... I mean, when I got to hear Lindsey Graham being put out there as somebody who knows something, Mitch McConnell, or Nancy Advermind-Pelosi, or Diane Not-So-Feinstein, these are the people that are supposed to... Little Chuckie Schumer over here?
[03:22:53.903 --> 03:22:55.164]  I mean, it's a joke!
[03:22:55.905 --> 03:22:57.808]  It's a bad joke and it's worldwide.
[03:22:57.808 --> 03:23:07.181]  And Matt Damon and all of them are moving to Australia and New Zealand because Rob Reiner says they're about to launch a civil war and we've got the internal intel from law enforcement.
[03:23:07.181 --> 03:23:10.827]  The left is preparing to go out and just start shooting police, burning things.
[03:23:10.827 --> 03:23:12.149]  They're totally insane!
[03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:16.883]  Well, I don't think the left has the courage to do that.
[03:23:16.883 --> 03:23:23.948]  But going back to what's going on and how it... Again, it goes back to dollars.
[03:23:23.948 --> 03:23:28.751]  And again, that little clown Macron over there, Theresa May's in trouble.
[03:23:28.751 --> 03:23:31.713]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:23:31.713 --> 03:23:34.335]  And that's what's going on as I see this.
[03:23:34.335 --> 03:23:41.620]  And again, it goes back to Trump is the biggest thing against him going from the establishment
[03:23:42.424 --> 03:23:47.527]  Is renegotiating these lousy trade deals that take money away from the whole economy.
[03:23:47.527 --> 03:23:47.807]  No, no, I agree.
[03:23:47.807 --> 03:23:50.368]  Trump's real because they hate him doesn't mean he's perfect.
[03:23:50.368 --> 03:23:55.150]  So, I probably shouldn't have blown up so bad Friday, but I thought they weren't going to strike.
[03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:56.271]  I thought they'd done the right thing.
[03:23:56.271 --> 03:23:57.531]  I just couldn't help it.
[03:23:57.531 --> 03:23:59.012]  I started blowing up at them, Gerald.
[03:23:59.012 --> 03:24:00.653]  Look, I don't blame you.
[03:24:00.653 --> 03:24:02.374]  I'm really upset about this.
[03:24:03.078 --> 03:24:05.140]  Yeah, this is against the Constitution.
[03:24:05.140 --> 03:24:07.562]  And you know, I put my money where my mouth is.
[03:24:07.562 --> 03:24:10.004]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:24:10.004 --> 03:24:13.968]  I mean, what do I got, a Nikki Haley saying we're locked and loaded?
[03:24:13.968 --> 03:24:15.069]  Don't talk to me like that!
[03:24:15.069 --> 03:24:17.671]  Yeah, what is it about Nikki Haley who is a known moron?
[03:24:18.652 --> 03:24:19.413]  They're smart women.
[03:24:19.413 --> 03:24:24.836]  I'm not putting her down because she's a woman, but it's something about a woman calling for war, talking about locked and loaded, we'll blow the Russians up.
[03:24:24.836 --> 03:24:27.598]  Pompeo's like, oh, we killed a lot of Russians a month ago.
[03:24:27.598 --> 03:24:30.860]  Yeah, a bunch of innocent contractors invited in by us to beat ISIS.
[03:24:30.860 --> 03:24:32.801]  And he's up there going, hey, Congress, don't worry.
[03:24:32.801 --> 03:24:35.383]  We killed 200 of them just a few weeks ago.
[03:24:35.383 --> 03:24:37.064]  Yeah, and they didn't do anything.
[03:24:37.064 --> 03:24:38.565]  And then they go, we'll see their wimps.
[03:24:38.565 --> 03:24:39.525]  No, they have restraint.
[03:24:39.525 --> 03:24:40.926]  They're not maniacs.
[03:24:40.926 --> 03:24:43.568]  So Pompeo and Haley, they piss me off.
[03:24:45.823 --> 03:24:47.524]  I'm as angry as you are.
[03:24:47.524 --> 03:24:49.285]  This is totally unconstitutional.
[03:24:49.285 --> 03:24:50.646]  What did it prove?
[03:24:50.646 --> 03:24:52.828]  And it's all based on nothing.
[03:24:52.828 --> 03:24:54.669]  Nobody could suspect it alone.
[03:24:54.669 --> 03:25:02.595]  And it's against Syrians that have fought for seven years against a Western-backed Al-Qaeda attack and people who throw gays and women off buildings and kill priests.
[03:25:02.595 --> 03:25:10.380]  We're sided with bad guys and I thought Trump was going to stop it and he tried to stop it and now we're sided with it again and it makes me feel dirty!
[03:25:10.380 --> 03:25:11.441]  That's why I'm pissed off!
[03:25:12.523 --> 03:25:14.905]  Well, you shouldn't feel like that because it's he did it.
[03:25:14.905 --> 03:25:16.107]  You're not responsible for it.
[03:25:16.107 --> 03:25:19.110]  You believed in him as I believe in him for many different things.
[03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:26.097]  You know, I did on Inauguration Day, I hosted an hour on your show and I believed in the things that he said.
[03:25:26.917 --> 03:25:30.500]  So knowing he's a good guy then, how did they get him to do this?
[03:25:30.500 --> 03:25:34.663]  And I'm trying to say, you got it when you said it in the beginning.
[03:25:34.663 --> 03:25:43.790]  This, when they're going, the FBI going into his lawyer's information, all his personal stuff, they probably got some stuff on this guy.
[03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:46.973]  And that, you know, he'd rather not come out with.
[03:25:48.979 --> 03:25:58.464]  I mean, you know, this guy doesn't have a great reputation in the business world, and there's another part in his personal life.
[03:25:58.464 --> 03:26:00.985]  So I believe they have a lot on him.
[03:26:00.985 --> 03:26:04.386]  And here's my forecast.
[03:26:04.386 --> 03:26:06.648]  I believe they're not going to stop.
[03:26:06.648 --> 03:26:11.430]  And the Democrats are going to do very well in the midterm election.
[03:26:12.313 --> 03:26:23.469]  And then the last year and a half left after that, it's going to be total hell for him on the way out, the way this thing is trending now.
[03:26:23.469 --> 03:26:28.236]  And then a bunch of criminals that have committed all these huge crimes, Hillary, all of them, Comey, they all just get away with it?
[03:26:29.178 --> 03:26:30.259]  They're mass murderers.
[03:26:30.259 --> 03:26:32.020]  I mean, Obama's a mass murderer.
[03:26:32.020 --> 03:26:33.381]  Look at Bill Clinton.
[03:26:33.381 --> 03:26:56.576]  Hey, you know, you mentioned this thing about, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[03:26:59.779 --> 03:27:00.540]  You got it.
[03:27:00.540 --> 03:27:01.761]  Under Bill Clinton.
[03:27:01.761 --> 03:27:06.106]  Oh, that Bernie, I'm gonna give you free education and free healthcare?
[03:27:06.106 --> 03:27:09.350]  Get voted for that.
[03:27:09.350 --> 03:27:10.932]  So, they're all criminals.
[03:27:10.932 --> 03:27:11.913]  It's a criminal operation.
[03:27:11.913 --> 03:27:14.937]  So you're saying Trump is starting to go the way of Jimmy Carter?
[03:27:16.067 --> 03:27:19.888]  No, I'm saying they got a lot on Trump.
[03:27:19.888 --> 03:27:24.249]  They got probably enough on him, enough dirt to build Mount Everest.
[03:27:24.249 --> 03:27:26.729]  And they're going to keep him under pressure.
[03:27:26.729 --> 03:27:29.290]  And they're going to do what he's going to do what they tell him to do.
[03:27:29.290 --> 03:27:30.450]  And of course, that's what I'm saying.
[03:27:30.450 --> 03:27:31.871]  I'm saying one term like Carter.
[03:27:31.871 --> 03:27:39.412]  I'm saying none of this Russiagate, it's all just going to be business dealings behind the scenes that they can claim wasn't conducted exactly properly.
[03:27:39.412 --> 03:27:41.873]  And we're talking about thousands of charges of wire fraud.
[03:27:42.987 --> 03:27:49.911]  And not only that, also, you know, whatever personal relationships he had that you rather your wife not know about.
[03:27:49.911 --> 03:27:53.593]  So I think they got a lot on him.
[03:27:53.593 --> 03:27:55.334]  And that's why he's doing this.
[03:27:55.334 --> 03:27:57.496]  And by the way, very interesting.
[03:27:57.496 --> 03:28:02.018]  They did this on Friday night after the markets closed.
[03:28:02.018 --> 03:28:02.819]  The Friday the 13th too.
[03:28:04.628 --> 03:28:17.856]  Yeah, and after the markets closed, if this happened when the markets were open, considering the volatility that's going on, and every time you heard something going on that may happen, you see the markets diving.
[03:28:17.856 --> 03:28:21.038]  That's why they did it, I believe, late Friday night.
[03:28:21.038 --> 03:28:23.159]  All right, I've been a bad boy.
[03:28:23.159 --> 03:28:25.761]  I promise your calls are coming up, because I need to get out of here.
[03:28:25.761 --> 03:28:28.703]  It's Gerald's show, and I'm all wound up, so I take your calls.
[03:28:28.703 --> 03:28:29.563]  I love talking to Gerald.
[03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:30.724]  I got a bunch of meetings to go to.
[03:28:32.359 --> 03:28:34.281]  Oh man, I just wanted to turn the country around.
[03:28:34.281 --> 03:28:35.543]  I just wanted to try to fix things.
[03:28:35.543 --> 03:28:42.030]  And Trump's done so good so far in many ways, but... And to watch the left praise me for getting mad at him, that made me even sicker.
[03:28:42.030 --> 03:28:43.592]  And drove me right back over to Trump.
[03:28:43.592 --> 03:28:46.235]  I just... God, I can't stand this.
[03:28:46.235 --> 03:28:49.759]  Is America good enough to get out of this crap?
[03:28:49.759 --> 03:28:50.460]  I don't know.
[03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:50.841]  We'll be back.
[03:28:53.075 --> 03:28:55.716]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.

[03:31:24.795 --> 03:31:25.676]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:25.676 --> 03:31:28.739]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.

[03:31:33.003 --> 03:31:35.145]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[03:33:23.703 --> 03:33:25.125]  Alright, Joel Salinde is riding shotgun.
[03:33:25.125 --> 03:33:28.588]  In the interest of time, I'm just going to say we're selling out of X2.
[03:33:28.588 --> 03:33:33.253]  They're jacking up the prices where they do the deep earth drilling to get at the pure cyanide out there.
[03:33:33.253 --> 03:33:34.455]  We've got a few more runs after this.
[03:33:34.455 --> 03:33:36.257]  The price is going up.
[03:33:36.257 --> 03:33:37.798]  I'm going to end the 25% off today.
[03:33:37.798 --> 03:33:39.881]  We've got 50% off of Surmel Vitality.
[03:33:39.881 --> 03:33:42.844]  We never do that special, but we've got a lot of that we ordered.
[03:33:42.844 --> 03:33:43.565]  We've also got...
[03:33:44.548 --> 03:33:45.309]  We're good to go.
[03:34:08.444 --> 03:34:14.927]  If you want to thumb your nose at the establishment and get great products, we've got non-GMO heirloom seeds, great storable food with a free water filter right now.
[03:34:14.927 --> 03:34:18.309]  A lot of great stuff that everybody needs, and you fund the operation.
[03:34:18.309 --> 03:34:18.990]  Gerald Cilente.
[03:34:19.915 --> 03:34:21.777]  He's with us from TrendsResearch.com.
[03:34:21.777 --> 03:34:24.359]  Follow him on Twitter at Gerald Salente.
[03:34:24.359 --> 03:34:27.402]  And he let me kind of co-host with him here today in the fourth hour.
[03:34:27.402 --> 03:34:30.164]  I should get him on the next few days on the main broadcast.
[03:34:30.164 --> 03:34:32.306]  So the fourth hour is the main broadcast.
[03:34:32.306 --> 03:34:35.549]  But I was just talking to crew about why I'm so upset.
[03:34:35.549 --> 03:34:40.393]  Trump's plan was just classic Eisenhower, JFK, normal economics.
[03:34:40.393 --> 03:34:41.494]  It wasn't even anything special.
[03:34:41.494 --> 03:34:43.516]  It was kind of like what made America great.
[03:34:44.662 --> 03:34:50.803]  And then now to see him starting to roll over and do all this, it's just a sign of the power of evil.
[03:34:50.803 --> 03:35:01.546]  And the fact that so many people have gone to sleep, and to know that the globalists now realize that they're in so much trouble worldwide, they're going to swing for the bleachers.
[03:35:01.546 --> 03:35:06.567]  They're going to swing for the parking lot, to use a baseball metaphor.
[03:35:09.656 --> 03:35:15.102]  If the globalists weren't so bad, they were just some outside powerful group wanting to take over, I'd be like, eh, whatever.
[03:35:15.102 --> 03:35:25.913]  They're so anti-free market, so anti-family, so anti-prosperity for people, that just where's the average person's instinct to really be serious?
[03:35:25.913 --> 03:35:29.296]  Well, let me tell you, you're going to get serious if the globalists get their way.
[03:35:29.296 --> 03:35:31.538]  Like seriously working in a Chinese slave laboratory.
[03:35:32.529 --> 03:35:34.911]  So we're talking to Gerald Cilente right now, Dennis in Ontario.
[03:35:34.911 --> 03:35:36.472]  Carlos, we're going to your calls now.
[03:35:36.472 --> 03:35:38.593]  Let's go to Dennis in Ontario, then Carlos.
[03:35:38.593 --> 03:35:39.354]  Dennis, you're on the air.
[03:35:39.354 --> 03:35:41.095]  Go ahead.
[03:35:41.095 --> 03:35:42.236]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:35:42.236 --> 03:35:42.636]  Good, buddy.
[03:35:42.636 --> 03:35:46.359]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[03:35:46.359 --> 03:35:50.062]  Hey, Gerald, I want to say good work as well.
[03:35:50.062 --> 03:35:53.244]  As I usually do, I just want to say great products, Alex.
[03:35:53.244 --> 03:35:59.748]  I want to encourage everybody to buy the products because the past few years I've bought anything from the water filters to
[03:36:01.312 --> 03:36:01.732]  We're good to go.
[03:36:24.176 --> 03:36:32.320]  And now, even though Infowars and you were actually pretty powerful how many years ago, you guys are much more powerful now.
[03:36:32.320 --> 03:36:51.609]  So I just wanted to say, my actual point, I know for a fact that Donald Trump, you know, how he's actually struck Syria, he's also done it with, you know, a statement that's in complete contradiction to what he was usually saying during the campaign, but also years and years ago.
[03:36:52.129 --> 03:37:09.934]  He was saying, specifically in his tweets, he was saying that the rebels were just as bad as the current regime, and he was saying that President Obama and the State Department should completely stay outside of Syria altogether, right?
[03:37:11.654 --> 03:37:12.035]  We're good.
[03:37:27.333 --> 03:37:27.453]  It's
[03:37:44.176 --> 03:37:46.037]  Uh, some sort of different opinion.
[03:37:46.037 --> 03:37:55.159]  You know, he was, he was maintaining through the entire campaign that, that Syria is, is, you know, a bad regime in some ways, but, you know, Assad should not be messed with.
[03:37:55.159 --> 03:38:04.861]  And now he's taken a stance that he just can't really back up on right now because he's saying... Well, that's right, because if the rebels stage more chemicals, he says, any more chemical attacks, I'll blow Assad up.
[03:38:04.861 --> 03:38:08.382]  Well, now the rebels will do it for sure if they didn't do it before, which they've been caught doing.
[03:38:08.382 --> 03:38:09.022]  And that's a great point.
[03:38:09.022 --> 03:38:10.302]  Let me go to Joe Celenti on that.
[03:38:10.302 --> 03:38:11.063]  Great points, Dennis.
[03:38:11.063 --> 03:38:12.763]  But let me just briefly say about the whole network thing.
[03:38:14.008 --> 03:38:18.552]  We built three studios so that we can have 24 hours a day live and have news feeds.
[03:38:18.552 --> 03:38:21.434]  We're just trying to hire the reporters, trying to train the people.
[03:38:21.434 --> 03:38:23.316]  They send in infiltrators on us.
[03:38:23.316 --> 03:38:27.139]  We've now learned that start all these fights and make stuff up and you see it in the news.
[03:38:27.139 --> 03:38:34.625]  So this is like, this is like a real intelligence operation, but I'm just a citizen and I'm dealing with all these techniques they use, the amount of evil they've got.
[03:38:35.165 --> 03:38:35.225]  The
[03:38:56.594 --> 03:38:57.775]  But I'm trying really hard there.
[03:38:57.775 --> 03:39:05.759]  But kind of what you were just saying, Dennis, and I appreciate your call, is kind of what I was saying earlier, is that it is a flip-flop.
[03:39:05.759 --> 03:39:09.742]  And I think the point here is that he's been compromised to a certain extent.
[03:39:09.742 --> 03:39:11.223]  Gerald?
[03:39:11.223 --> 03:39:16.626]  Well, you know, you mentioned Eisenhower and Kennedy.
[03:39:16.626 --> 03:39:18.587]  You know what they did to Kennedy.
[03:39:18.587 --> 03:39:22.249]  And what was Eisenhower's farewell address to the world, to the nation?
[03:39:23.038 --> 03:39:32.302]  That the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[03:39:32.302 --> 03:39:34.343]  And that's what's happened.
[03:39:34.343 --> 03:39:38.625]  And so it is the military-industrial complex that's still in charge.
[03:39:38.625 --> 03:39:43.988]  And you know, there are a lot of speculation about why Kennedy was killed.
[03:39:43.988 --> 03:39:48.690]  And one of them is that he didn't want to escalate the Vietnam War.
[03:39:48.690 --> 03:39:51.231]  And so we saw what happened with that one.
[03:39:52.003 --> 03:40:01.617]  So that's what I think the bottom line is, that anybody that gets in there that tries to stop the war machine, and again, let's go back to business here.
[03:40:02.671 --> 03:40:10.954]  Where has there been any success that anything that America has done in the Middle East that has improved matters?
[03:40:10.954 --> 03:40:13.415]  Isn't Iraq a wonderful place?
[03:40:13.415 --> 03:40:17.176]  Why don't we spend the summer vacation over there in Tripoli?
[03:40:17.176 --> 03:40:17.916]  No, no, no.
[03:40:17.916 --> 03:40:19.837]  Let's go to Damascus.
[03:40:19.837 --> 03:40:20.737]  Look what they've done.
[03:40:20.737 --> 03:40:22.018]  And they're doing the same thing here.
[03:40:22.018 --> 03:40:25.039]  It is a de-industrialization, de-stabilization global plan.
[03:40:25.039 --> 03:40:25.559]  That's admitted.
[03:40:26.849 --> 03:40:35.711]  It's again, it's a, it's a, you know, you look at the, you mentioned before about being a slave laborer for a Chinese company?
[03:40:35.711 --> 03:40:39.072]  How about getting a job with Amazon?
[03:40:39.072 --> 03:40:40.332]  I got a better one for you.
[03:40:40.332 --> 03:40:42.633]  Why don't you go to work at Walmart?
[03:40:42.633 --> 03:40:44.673]  Maybe Target's for you.
[03:40:44.673 --> 03:40:46.974]  Nah, come on, Alex.
[03:40:46.974 --> 03:40:48.054]  Maybe Kohl's.
[03:40:48.054 --> 03:40:50.094]  McDonald's, you would be great.
[03:40:50.094 --> 03:40:50.815]  Just think of the future.
[03:40:50.815 --> 03:40:54.656]  The argument is the average McDonald's worker wants to bomb Syria because they love Hillary.
[03:40:54.656 --> 03:40:56.276]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:40:58.792 --> 03:41:07.562]  A very, very important defining moment in the presidency, not just of President Trump, but in fact, the presidency of the United States.
[03:41:07.562 --> 03:41:16.151]  I want to say this with a lot of candor because of the fact that I do agree with Gerald Salenti's trend.
[03:41:16.151 --> 03:41:20.616]  However, there is a Spanish word, which is vulgar, that says cojones.
[03:41:21.306 --> 03:41:27.048]  And it means that at some point, the President of the United States has the power with the Secretary of State.
[03:41:27.048 --> 03:41:27.328]  That's right.
[03:41:27.328 --> 03:41:29.950]  If he's got the balls, he can crush these people right now.
[03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:34.091]  But he signals that he just now blinked with this attack on Syria.
[03:41:34.091 --> 03:41:34.511]  Correct.
[03:41:34.511 --> 03:41:36.092]  He has the big hands.
[03:41:36.092 --> 03:41:40.554]  And I believe that as a businessman, he should not forget his own dictum.
[03:41:40.554 --> 03:41:42.114]  Look at the downside.
[03:41:42.114 --> 03:41:44.255]  Look at the downside potential.
[03:41:44.255 --> 03:41:48.497]  He has to take Jeff Sessions and take the risk of saying, listen,
[03:41:49.102 --> 03:41:50.743]  Thank you very much for your services.
[03:41:50.743 --> 03:41:53.485]  You serve at the pleasure of the President.
[03:41:53.485 --> 03:41:54.865]  I'm not pleased.
[03:41:54.865 --> 03:42:01.129]  And face the downside risk, which is, okay, so some sort of effort by some leftists, you know, to get him impeached.
[03:42:01.129 --> 03:42:02.210]  No, no, no, I agree.
[03:42:02.210 --> 03:42:04.591]  They always kept saying, don't fire Mueller or you're done.
[03:42:04.591 --> 03:42:06.272]  And Stone was right six months ago.
[03:42:06.272 --> 03:42:07.493]  That was the answer.
[03:42:07.493 --> 03:42:08.694]  Fire all their asses.
[03:42:08.694 --> 03:42:10.255]  They're all Hillary leftovers.
[03:42:10.255 --> 03:42:11.395]  They're all criminals.
[03:42:11.395 --> 03:42:13.757]  Clinton fired all the people when he got in.
[03:42:13.757 --> 03:42:14.817]  Why can't Trump?
[03:42:14.817 --> 03:42:15.257]  Exactly.
[03:42:16.860 --> 03:42:17.800]  No, I agree.
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:23.763]  But again, now that the FBI has all that information on him, I believe he's under a lot of pressure.
[03:42:23.763 --> 03:42:24.864]  Mueller just metastasized it.
[03:42:24.864 --> 03:42:27.445]  He just spread the cancer.
[03:42:27.445 --> 03:42:29.386]  That's right.
[03:42:29.386 --> 03:42:32.287]  So he's very limited in what he can do.
[03:42:32.287 --> 03:42:34.208]  So now the FBI is the president.
[03:42:34.208 --> 03:42:36.149]  It takes over the final segment straight ahead.
[03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:36.949]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:36.949 --> 03:42:38.650]  Thank you all for tuning in and watching.
[03:42:39.858 --> 03:42:44.988]  Hey, at least nationalism's spreading, globalism's got problems, but man, we're in a fight for our lives.
[03:42:44.988 --> 03:42:46.631]  I told you when Trump won that election.
[03:42:46.631 --> 03:42:48.675]  This is gonna make the deep state come out of their rat hole.
[03:42:48.675 --> 03:42:50.278]  So the fight is now.
[03:42:50.278 --> 03:42:51.300]  This is not a spectator sport.
[03:42:53.151 --> 03:42:56.894]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:42:56.894 --> 03:43:03.959]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:43:03.959 --> 03:43:08.723]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:43:08.723 --> 03:43:09.464]  It's very simple.
[03:43:09.464 --> 03:43:10.405]  We went out and looked.
[03:43:10.405 --> 03:43:11.045]  What is the top?
[03:43:11.045 --> 03:43:11.966]  What is the best?
[03:43:11.966 --> 03:43:13.207]  We'll just put even more product in.
[03:43:13.207 --> 03:43:13.907]  We'll make it better.
[03:43:13.907 --> 03:43:17.590]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:19.752]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:43:19.752 --> 03:43:20.352]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:43:22.554 --> 03:43:25.776]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:43:25.776 --> 03:43:30.039]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:43:30.039 --> 03:43:33.882]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:43:33.882 --> 03:43:37.764]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:43:37.764 --> 03:43:40.926]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:43:40.926 --> 03:43:44.569]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:43:44.569 --> 03:43:47.170]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:43:47.170 --> 03:43:48.171]  It's amazing.
[03:43:48.171 --> 03:43:50.773]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:43:53.094 --> 03:43:58.678]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in full or its life.
[03:43:58.678 --> 03:43:59.558]  It'd take hours.
[03:43:59.558 --> 03:44:01.980]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:44:01.980 --> 03:44:03.161]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.161 --> 03:44:04.782]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:04.782 --> 03:44:08.003]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.003 --> 03:44:09.124]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.124 --> 03:44:12.306]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.306 --> 03:44:16.068]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.068 --> 03:44:19.170]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[03:44:19.170 --> 03:44:20.071]  So you can upload it.
[03:44:20.071 --> 03:44:21.512]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[03:44:22.112 --> 03:44:29.217]  The Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:44:29.217 --> 03:44:30.177]  That's a spray you do.
[03:44:30.177 --> 03:44:31.458]  You can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.458 --> 03:44:36.802]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[03:44:36.802 --> 03:44:38.183]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:44:38.183 --> 03:44:48.089]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:44:48.089 --> 03:44:51.171]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:44:54.810 --> 03:45:00.293]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:45:00.293 --> 03:45:01.133]  I take this.
[03:45:01.133 --> 03:45:02.254]  My family takes this.
[03:45:02.254 --> 03:45:06.556]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:45:06.556 --> 03:45:11.018]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:45:11.158 --> 03:45:15.780]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:45:15.780 --> 03:45:16.921]  I don't feel good.
[03:45:16.921 --> 03:45:20.662]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:45:20.662 --> 03:45:23.363]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:45:23.363 --> 03:45:29.166]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:45:29.166 --> 03:45:32.127]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:45:32.127 --> 03:45:35.649]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:45:35.649 --> 03:45:37.890]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:45:37.890 --> 03:45:38.250]  I love it.
[03:45:38.410 --> 03:45:41.215]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:45:41.215 --> 03:45:42.237]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:42.237 --> 03:45:47.886]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing, that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:47.886 --> 03:45:50.070]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:52.274]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.

[03:46:57.223 --> 03:46:59.845]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.442 --> 03:47:19.563]  Big Brother.
[03:47:19.563 --> 03:47:21.385]  Mainstream media.
[03:47:21.385 --> 03:47:23.287]  Government cover-ups.
[03:47:23.287 --> 03:47:24.968]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:47:24.968 --> 03:47:26.610]  Well, so does he.
[03:47:26.610 --> 03:47:31.255]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:34.628 --> 03:47:38.951]  Well, not exactly Alex Jones, but on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.951 --> 03:47:40.452]  It's always great being here.
[03:47:40.452 --> 03:47:42.414]  It's a real honor for me.
[03:47:42.414 --> 03:47:56.624]  And it's so important to really support what Alex Jones is doing, all the people at InfoWars, because the propaganda being put out every day in the mainstream media press is just disgusting.
[03:47:56.624 --> 03:47:59.066]  It's been around a long time, and I know the deal.
[03:47:59.066 --> 03:48:00.747]  I've never seen it like this.
[03:48:01.981 --> 03:48:09.007]  Once upon a time, I used to be on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, all of them, everybody.
[03:48:09.007 --> 03:48:10.067]  Oprah.
[03:48:10.067 --> 03:48:14.871]  And now it's just a one-sided deal any way you go.
[03:48:14.871 --> 03:48:17.653]  But with Alex Jones, you get all the sides.
[03:48:17.653 --> 03:48:27.981]  And just as he was very upset about Trump's Syrian strike, it showed that he has the integrity that means a lot to him.
[03:48:29.719 --> 03:48:33.600]  Went the other way, he doesn't bend over and take it.
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:45.584]  And so that's why I'm very happy to be a part of the broadcast and doing the show once as I'm hosting it and to support it because it's really important.
[03:48:45.584 --> 03:48:51.326]  And one of the products of my favorite is Supermail Vitality.
[03:48:51.326 --> 03:48:51.826]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:53.127 --> 03:48:55.929]  And again, you know, I'm not a young cat anymore.
[03:48:55.929 --> 03:48:59.951]  I need that extra boost to get some energy going during the day.
[03:48:59.951 --> 03:49:04.514]  And Supermail Vitality does it for me.
[03:49:04.514 --> 03:49:15.280]  And when you look around, we keep hearing all about the news coming out from the media and like the Cartoon News Network, CNN.
[03:49:15.280 --> 03:49:15.860]  You know what they are?
[03:49:15.860 --> 03:49:17.101]  You Google it up.
[03:49:17.101 --> 03:49:20.503]  Look at their prime time ratings at night.
[03:49:21.391 --> 03:49:25.113]  Anywhere in the country, what, 320 million people?
[03:49:25.113 --> 03:49:30.015]  They've got about 900,000 people that tune in at prime time.
[03:49:30.015 --> 03:49:31.455]  That's nothing.
[03:49:31.455 --> 03:49:33.556]  But that's all we're hearing.
[03:49:33.556 --> 03:49:38.018]  And all we're hearing is the propaganda from the one side.
[03:49:38.018 --> 03:49:41.080]  And I'm going to give you an example.
[03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:48.383]  This is from, as I affectionately call it, the toilet paper of the record, the New York Times.
[03:49:48.383 --> 03:49:50.724]  And how pro-war the media is.
[03:49:52.230 --> 03:49:53.251]  One after another.
[03:49:53.251 --> 03:50:03.820]  As a matter of fact, this is from CNN on their website.
[03:50:03.820 --> 03:50:11.787]  This was the lead story on Saturday, the day after the Syrian strike.
[03:50:11.787 --> 03:50:14.649]  This was the big story.
[03:50:14.649 --> 03:50:17.792]  Syrian refugee wants to buy Trump a beer.
[03:50:18.706 --> 03:50:21.547]  He survived chemical attacks and says the U.S.
[03:50:21.547 --> 03:50:27.428]  response shows Trump has a big heart, bigger than Obama.
[03:50:27.428 --> 03:50:31.049]  First, let's go back to this chemical attack.
[03:50:31.049 --> 03:50:37.030]  There's been no proof at all.
[03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:41.031]  Mattis had already said before this happened that there was no evidence.
[03:50:42.085 --> 03:50:44.447]  You read all the language.
[03:50:44.447 --> 03:50:47.709]  It's suspected, alleged, we believe.
[03:50:47.709 --> 03:50:50.591]  And chemicals are so bad!
[03:50:50.591 --> 03:50:53.654]  Chlorine gas, ooh, that's so bad!
[03:50:53.654 --> 03:50:54.734]  I mean, what is this?
[03:50:54.734 --> 03:50:59.318]  I mean, not hard to make chlorine gas.
[03:50:59.318 --> 03:51:05.522]  You know, you want a lot of chlorine, you know, go clean some swimming pools.
[03:51:05.522 --> 03:51:07.404]  You'll get a lot of chlorine, man.
[03:51:07.404 --> 03:51:10.106]  Hey, how about carpet bombs?
[03:51:11.556 --> 03:51:14.057]  How about cluster bombs?
[03:51:14.057 --> 03:51:15.117]  I know.
[03:51:15.117 --> 03:51:19.978]  You love those depleted uranium bombs.
[03:51:19.978 --> 03:51:21.538]  No, no, man!
[03:51:21.538 --> 03:51:25.259]  The mother of all bombs!
[03:51:25.259 --> 03:51:26.239]  They're fine.
[03:51:26.239 --> 03:51:38.742]  The United States and its coalition of the killing have incinerated cities across the Middle East.
[03:51:38.742 --> 03:51:39.982]  In Iraq.
[03:51:39.982 --> 03:51:40.562]  In Libya.
[03:51:41.974 --> 03:51:44.094]  In Syria.
[03:51:44.094 --> 03:51:46.855]  In Afghanistan.
[03:51:46.855 --> 03:51:48.975]  Mother of all bombs, fine.
[03:51:48.975 --> 03:51:54.677]  But don't use that, oh, that chlorine gas is so bad.
[03:51:54.677 --> 03:51:57.977]  Oh, and to see those children suffering.
[03:51:57.977 --> 03:52:02.858]  Hey, what's going on over there in Yemen?
[03:52:02.858 --> 03:52:05.399]  Oh, yeah, the crown prince is over here.
[03:52:05.399 --> 03:52:07.359]  And you know how he became a prince, everyone.
[03:52:07.359 --> 03:52:10.740]  The princess kissed the frog and the frog became a prince.
[03:52:10.740 --> 03:52:11.440]  It's a mafia.
[03:52:12.856 --> 03:52:19.557]  And from 1934 they invented this group, this gang that's running the joint.
[03:52:19.557 --> 03:52:23.438]  They have a cholera epidemic in Yemen.
[03:52:23.438 --> 03:52:27.639]  Over 10,000 innocent people have been killed by Saudi bombings.
[03:52:27.639 --> 03:52:31.920]  Hey, bombing them apart in little pieces, man, that's okay!
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:35.761]  But no gas, no gas, yeah!
[03:52:35.761 --> 03:52:39.982]  Yeah, but you blow them up, you don't have any parts to look at, that's okay.
[03:52:40.993 --> 03:52:44.574]  Where's the outrage over that?
[03:52:44.574 --> 03:52:46.575]  None!
[03:52:46.575 --> 03:52:50.156]  Not by the prestitute media.
[03:52:50.156 --> 03:52:53.117]  So here's the New York Times editorial.
[03:52:53.117 --> 03:52:54.638]  Just part of it.
[03:52:54.638 --> 03:53:05.082]  Under the United Nations Charter, there are two justifications for using force against another country without its consent.
[03:53:05.082 --> 03:53:06.062]  In self-defense,
[03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:15.135]  And with the United States, with the United Nations Security Council's permission.
[03:53:15.135 --> 03:53:17.816]  The former does not apply in this case.
[03:53:17.816 --> 03:53:20.098]  Obviously, there's no self-defense.
[03:53:20.098 --> 03:53:22.799]  Are you ready for this?
[03:53:22.799 --> 03:53:29.183]  Perfect propaganda from arrogant little boys and girls.
[03:53:29.183 --> 03:53:31.265]  Call themselves the paper of record.
[03:53:31.265 --> 03:53:36.028]  And the latter would be impossible
[03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:41.723]  Given Russia's veto power in the council.
[03:53:41.723 --> 03:53:45.066]  That would be impossible, huh?
[03:53:45.066 --> 03:53:47.667]  Yep.
[03:53:47.667 --> 03:53:48.488]  So what did they do?
[03:53:48.488 --> 03:53:51.850]  They just vetoed Russia.
[03:53:51.850 --> 03:53:57.154]  For calling this strike against international law.
[03:53:57.154 --> 03:54:00.136]  But they only turned it on one side.
[03:54:00.136 --> 03:54:01.617]  So here are the facts on this.
[03:54:06.337 --> 03:54:17.680]  An act of, again, an act of violence committed by one government against another government without lawful justification amounts to a crime of aggression.
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:28.483]  The supreme international crime which carries with it the evil of every other international crime as noted by the International
[03:54:30.515 --> 03:54:35.676]  Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946.
[03:54:35.676 --> 03:54:49.539]  So this violates also the War Powers Act and the Nuremberg Agreement.
[03:54:49.539 --> 03:54:52.740]  War Powers Act resolution passed by Congress
[03:54:54.116 --> 03:54:56.697]  Permits the President to introduce U.S.
[03:54:56.697 --> 03:55:21.910]  troops into hostilities or imminent hostilities only when Congress has declared war, when Congress has passed specific statutory authorization for use of military force, or when there is, quote, a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States, its territories, or possessions, or armed forces.
[03:55:23.391 --> 03:55:32.813]  None of these, none of these were present in what happened.
[03:55:32.813 --> 03:55:40.074]  So when we're talking about the loss of a constitution, it keeps going on and on.
[03:55:40.074 --> 03:55:43.234]  There's no proof of this.
[03:55:43.234 --> 03:55:50.556]  Could you get away with attacking somebody because you suspected them?
[03:55:50.556 --> 03:55:51.616]  What would happen to you?
[03:55:54.901 --> 03:56:00.324]  What if you suspected somebody of robbing you, and you went over and you shot him?
[03:56:00.324 --> 03:56:02.526]  Or her?
[03:56:02.526 --> 03:56:04.767]  And you had no proof.
[03:56:04.767 --> 03:56:08.269]  Would that stand up in a court of law?
[03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:10.871]  Absolutely not.
[03:56:10.871 --> 03:56:14.933]  So, that's where we're at with this.
[03:56:14.933 --> 03:56:19.436]  We're at the loss of our rights in so many different levels.
[03:56:19.436 --> 03:56:21.197]  The fish rots from the head down.
[03:56:22.685 --> 03:56:33.109]  So if they rob our rights of the most important element of a country, and that is to engage in war, guess what?
[03:56:33.109 --> 03:56:36.270]  You lose all your rights all the way down.
[03:56:36.270 --> 03:56:37.370]  And that's what's happening.
[03:56:37.370 --> 03:56:40.211]  To me, that's the bigger message here.
[03:56:40.211 --> 03:56:42.452]  Where are we, the people?
[03:56:42.452 --> 03:56:46.073]  Don't we have a say in this?
[03:56:46.073 --> 03:56:48.974]  I didn't elect one person to decide for me.
[03:56:51.112 --> 03:56:53.794]  We're supposed to have a Congress.
[03:56:53.794 --> 03:56:55.775]  Yeah, they're freaks alright.
[03:56:55.775 --> 03:56:57.956]  Well, let the freaks vote too.
[03:56:57.956 --> 03:57:01.018]  Let's see where they're coming from.
[03:57:01.018 --> 03:57:03.700]  So this is really unprecedented.
[03:57:03.700 --> 03:57:17.429]  As I mentioned with Alex, I believe that Trump is doing this because of the investigation going on and the FBI going in and seizing all those documents from his private attorney.
[03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:19.630]  Unprecedented in American history.
[03:57:20.777 --> 03:57:24.199]  So do what you can to keep supporting Alex Jones.
[03:57:24.199 --> 03:57:26.040]  Let freedom ring.
[03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:26.320]  Thank you.
[03:57:43.527 --> 03:57:46.549]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:57:46.549 --> 03:57:50.733]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:57:50.733 --> 03:57:57.438]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:57:57.438 --> 03:58:01.201]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:58:01.901 --> 03:58:21.423]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:58:21.963 --> 03:58:26.087]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:58:26.087 --> 03:58:37.319]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:58:37.319 --> 03:58:42.424]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
