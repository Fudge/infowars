[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  music
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.000]  before America can be great again she must be free
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  again you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  listen in the light night
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  if you ever wanted front row seats to the fall of this republic
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  you have got them
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  if you ever wanted front row seats living in a dystopic science fiction dream world
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  you've got them
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  if you ever wanted front row seats for the fall
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  the second fall
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  the great fall of humanity
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  you've got them
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  the illogic of the propaganda coming out of the establishment media
[01:01.000 --> 01:11.000]  creating absolute abject division in this nation is so transparent
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  is so weaponized
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  is so nasty
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  and it then just generates a nasty response
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  from the so-called other side
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  and the clash of civilizations that the globalist use
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  in different permutations in different combinations
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  across this world to keep humanity in ignorant squalor
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  there is so much news to cover
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  a lot of it really exciting, a lot of it really positive, a lot of it horrifying
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  in fact I know I mentioned it yesterday
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  but you guys reprint me Paul Joseph Watson's article that links to the Chinese People's Daily
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  where the Chinese president says prepare for war
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  with the United States and that it could be imminent
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  I know that's two day old news
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  but I've got all these hundreds of news articles in front of me and they're important
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  and I'm sitting back thinking what am I going to cover first
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  because I don't cover first what I think will get the ratings
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  or what I think is the most popular topic
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  sometimes I do but I think it's interesting
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I tend to focus on what I think is really most important
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  look at that headline here TV viewer
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  Chinese president orders People's Liberation Army to prepare for combat
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  Beijing vows to ignore a ruling of international tribunal in South China Sea
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  Jiang Ziping, that's how I pronounce it
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  has ordered the People's Liberation Army to prepare for combat
[02:40.000 --> 02:48.000]  as a massive fleets basically on both sides build up in the area
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  he says there's a measure against possible hostile U.S. action in the South China Sea
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing had no exclusive control of the area
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  and yes people can point out there are Chinese maps going back a thousand years ago
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  that claim some of those islands
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  I mean I can show you maps Genghis Khan had claiming all of the old world
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  the point is there's a bunch of other countries in the area
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  it's an international shipping lane
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  and China is now expanding control into that area
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  and they had to deal with the Anglo-American establishment
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  that they would be given the Panama Canal
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  they would be given basically exclusive control over manufacturing household goods
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  and crap but also a lot of electronics
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  and that they had an exclusive over rare earth minerals
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  as part of the globalist system of dividing up power into different sectors
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  and then playing it off against each other
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  but now as we get towards the end game of world government
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  you notice the double crossing is going into the stratosphere
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  they're launching huge space programs
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  they're weaponizing space
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  they are copying U.S. weapons technologies
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  they are shelling it to enemies
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  and some folks will say well then who's bad and who's good
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  our government's bad and so is the Chinese government
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  and it's rapidly deteriorating very very very quickly
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  and here's a headline
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  war is coming and the global financial situation is a lot worse than you may think
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  the conditions for a perfect storm are coming together very rapidly
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Michael Schneider writes for economic collapse blog
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  WorldWarZ.com
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  it's not just Schneider saying and he links to all the top analysts saying this
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  meanwhile I turn on the television or just read the newspaper
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  I can't get away from it
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  we have to cover it it's like half the website
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  are all these social change globalist disinformation operatives
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  out just beating the drum for class warfare with a nice icing of idiotic racism
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  I have an exciting announcement from articles by viewzone.com and transpersonal.de
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  our physical bodies run on light
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  that's right
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  Russian scientist Alexander G. Gerfitsch discovered biophotons in 1923
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  with further research supported in the 1970s by Fritz Albert Popp
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  a theoretical biophysicist
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  this system of light could possibly cure disease and cancer
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  the process is called photo repair
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Fritz Popp found that cancer cells actually distort light they absorb
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  while normal cells let light pass through them untampered
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  if you blast a cell with harsh amounts of UV light until the cell is almost destroyed
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  you can repair the cell by illuminating it with the same UV at a lower intensity
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  but this is old news to the scientific community
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Fritz Popp concluded that cancer is a result of light already in the body
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  that is blocked and scrambled by cancer causing compounds
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  if the body's photo repair process could itself be repaired
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  could that mean the end of cancer and eventually the end of deception by big pharma in the medical industry
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  this is Gabe Goldiman for infowars.com
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  it discounts on the amazing products and free shipping when you sign up for auto-ship

[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  but I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  designed for maximized effects
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.000]  the ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  that means it's clean, that means it's pure
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  that's infowarsteam.com and vitamin mineral fusion
[07:58.000 --> 08:27.000]  take action now before we sell out
[08:28.000 --> 08:38.000]  it's the 14th day of July 2016 on this live global Thursday broadcast
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  I intend to open the phones up and take a lot of calls today
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  and one of my favorite investigative journalists James O'Keefe of Project Veritas
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  will be joining us
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  he's had several big coups as of late
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  burrowing inside an anti-gun congressman's meeting
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  where some very interesting information was discovered about these hypocrites
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  he'll be popping in for 30 minutes in the second hour
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  Anthony Gucciardi will host the fourth hour of overdrive
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  if you're tuning in to us on a local MRFM station
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  please spread the word about this wonderful affiliate
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  and please don't take it for granted that they're willing to put information on the air
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.000]  post on the air that are actually defending this republic in some of its most dangerous hours
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  it's also important to note we simulcast the radio show at infowarsteam.com
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  forward slash show where anyone can find the free video feed
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  the free podcast feeds later after each show that are sent out
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  so you can subscribe to that for free
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  the iPhone apps all of it and a lot more
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  and the audio streams infowars.com forward slash show
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  we're going to be finding out obviously very very soon about Trump's VP
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  and I have talked to a lot of big pollsters who are doing private polls
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  to actually really gauge what's going on
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  not just political polls paid for to find out what the candidate wants to hear
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  so they can then put that back out to the public and create a self-fulfilling prophecy
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  but I will tell you Trump is not in this realm
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  Trump just like he's not taking big money from the establishment
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  is not paying for push polls where you call up and basically have the questions arranged
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  so that it makes it more opportunistic
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  makes it sound more moral to be for one candidate or the other
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  or polls that basically ask you questions that are so horrible about a candidate
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  that it turns you against them
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  it's a way to put this info out there and say basically did you know that
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Donald Trump was convicted of rape which isn't true
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  but your company calls up and asks that question
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  and says are you aware of it
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  and then it starts rumors
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  and there's all sorts of dirty tricks that they can do with these systems
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  they can also pre-program them so that when they call you
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  even though you vote one way it votes another
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  but the biggest thing they do is they have a list of people that have been polled before
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  and then they have the so-called phone lists that they claim are clean
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  and they call them and it's predominantly old landlines
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  so it's older folks
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  and they can be basically guided into answering the questions the way they want
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  then the national news can put that information out
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  and it creates the perception that Hillary Clinton is really ahead when she's not
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  then weak-minded people who just want to feel like they're on a bandwagon
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  and voting for the winner so they can have bragging rights
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  go ahead and vote for Hillary
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  that's basically the corrupt form of polling
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  the real form of polling is to see how your message is getting out in a particular area
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  a particular demographic, a particular voting block
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  a particular state, a particular region
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  so that you can tweak your messaging to see what is more effective
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  it's a guidance system
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  and Facebook and Google have admitted that they're pledged
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  to getting Hillary elected into mobilizing as many young people
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  and other internet users as they can to do that by the news
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  by the search engine queries, by the crafting of headlines
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  about how they direct you, where they direct you
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  the fix is totally in at a level never before seen
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  and Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple and Microsoft
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  just the entire establishment is lined up against Donald Trump
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  and all the big money is lined up against him
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  and the mainstream media is lined up against him
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  and almost all the foreign leaders from the communist Chinese
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  to the corrupt Saudi Arabians to the corrupt Mexican leadership
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  they are all
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  ALL lined up against Trump
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  it is just such a no brainer
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  that he's the guy to vote for
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  but separately from that
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  Rasmussen poll, Trump takes 7 point lead over Hillary
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  we're going to be getting into that report
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  also and I told you 2 weeks ago
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  multiple polls show him 7 points ahead
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  and it's not just Rasmussen but I'm not at liberty to talk about it
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  because those are private internal polls
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  there's actually some thought in the Trump campaign
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  that they don't want to put out 2 positive news
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  or the troops will stop fighting us hard
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  and then Hillary can pull some scams down the road
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  and we're going to lose the whole ball game
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  just because we're one touchdown ahead
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  it's not even halftime yet folks
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  but that's the allegory, that's the analogy
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  we're 7 points ahead
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  7 points ahead
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  and we're going into halftime next week
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  and then boom it's into the third and fourth quarter it is on
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  this is it and it's all accelerated
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  those last 3 months
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  first 2 quarters is a year and a half
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  and then it all compresses like a quickening
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  or a singularity in those last few months
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  get ready because you're going to see the dirty tricks
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  you're going to see the stops being pulled out here
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  but I really want to say to the Bernie Sanders supporters
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  I really want to say to
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  just the general public at large
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  how could you not be for Trump
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  you know the big banks are totally against him
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  these are the big banks that launder the drug money on record
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  these are the people that run the whole show
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  these are people that fund the open borders
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  that fund coming after our guns
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  that fund breaking up the family and all these disinformation campaigns
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  and third wave feminism and all of it
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  I mean you go look at who's financing all of it
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  bringing in the quote refugees
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  it's all the same totally cold-blooded multinationals
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  that if you see what they do in Africa and Latin America
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  in places I mean it's slavery
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  but here they fund all this fake, gooey, modern
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  neoliberalism that is cyanide
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  Donald Trump is like the fibulators on a country that's had a heart attack
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  it's electricity, it's dangerous
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  he could turn into a megalomaniac
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  and take us in directions, who knows
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  I mean I could speculate all day but the evil that's running things
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  is scared to death of him, for real
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  he's a nationalist, he's exposing the globalist campaign
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  the Saudi Arabians roll in 9-11
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  he's exposing China's bottle for politicians
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  and giving speeches that no one covered
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  they would not show any clips of what he said other than five seconds long
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  it was so historic I had tears in my eyes
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  I'm not trying to go off in a Trump love fest here
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  but that's just a fact
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  if you want to read some of the ways to manipulate polls
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  there's a zero-hedge article we have posted on InfoWars.com
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  from zero-hedge.com
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  more questions emerge about skewed Hillary polls
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  you can really see the skewing
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  I have all these other independent scientific ones
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  that show Trump dead even or ahead
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  and then all of these other polls just show her like just massively ahead
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  you know 10, 12 points, 9 points
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  it's just total bull
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  I mean look at that photo you just had on screen
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  of her supporters
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  I mean the arrested development
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  vapid, stupid looking
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  and there's this wicked alpha predator
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  just flaming evil
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  with a list of crimes behind her
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  and wreckage
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  there's just unbelievable
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  and they love the gimmick she's a woman
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  it's just truly sickening
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  truly sickening
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  meanwhile there's new video we're going to be playing coming up
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  Hillary Goon attacks elderly woman
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  holding Bernie Sanders sign
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  at a unity rally
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  he comes up and attacks her that's how they operate
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  they've blocked our aircraft
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  never been done before
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  for the entire four days
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  they're doing it five days out actually
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  the early five days of the convention
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  oh 30 mile exclusion zone
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  never been done before
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  in Cleveland and in Philadelphia
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  so we're going to be looking at all of that
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who you know
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  is an ultra massive critic of George W. Bush
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  total credibility
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  he's come out and said to stop all America
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Adolf Hitler is alive and well in the United States
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  and he is fast rising to power
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  and it gets into the FBI, the Democrats
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  the Republicans all of it
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  the establishment is together
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  they're different in name only
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  the Republican establishment hates Trump
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  you line up every enemy of this country
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  every evil group
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  the people that put in the racist
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  minimum sentencing
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  that targets blacks
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  particularly
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  there's even statements from Hillary and Mill
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  about blacks are super predators
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  blacks need to be made to heal
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  like a dog
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  but it's okay
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  because the media said
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  Donald Trump's a racist
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  he's a racist
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  and speaking of that
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  the weaponized ignorance
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  of the entire MTV
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  CBS, ABC, CNN
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  fiction, nonfiction
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  the universities, the high schools
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  everywhere
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  pulling out the stops to create total hysteria
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  an Obama meeting for three hours
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  yesterday with the head of black lives matter
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  he doesn't meet with foreign leaders for three hours
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  behind closed doors
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  after a photo op
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  to plan the summer of rage
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  and speaking of that
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  be aware but not there
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  we'll have our crew there tomorrow
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  day of rage scheduled for July 15
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  that's tomorrow
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  2016 we'll tell you about that
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  we'll do a talking point
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  when I say this I want you to understand
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  I don't say this to be shocking
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  or for rhetoric or because there's a small connection
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  what is now being announced
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  by Obama through black lives matter
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  in the UN is state department
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  memorandum 7277
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  and public law
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  we're printing all that off right now
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  I want to show that to you when we come back
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  this is actually a US
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  government plan
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  a world government through the UN
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  from 1962
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  freedom from war
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  the name of it
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  to a professional trader
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  in precious metals the key is
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  spot price
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  spot price is market price
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  what gold or silver actually costs on the exchange
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  regular people looking to invest
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  never get spot price
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  because resellers add fees for everything
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  refining, minting, brokerage
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  costs, commissions
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  never offered spot price

[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  a 10 ounce bar of silver
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  at spot price

[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  thank you for watching
[24:00.000 --> 24:28.000]  we have Roger Stone on tomorrow
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  20-30 minutes before the actual announcement
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  of who it really is
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  and I'm not saying it isn't Pence
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  to hopefully give us the first scoop
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  but we did tell you a few weeks ago
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  that he had been the front runner
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  but that
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  Senator Sessions
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  has tried to bow out himself
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Trump may crazily still try to pick him
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  that was the way it was told to me by another insider
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  but they're really going to dig up the Alabama stuff
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  and did he ever go to some meeting
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  where there's 200 people
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  and there's Klan guys there
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  and they'll just go to town with that
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Hillary Clinton
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  her mentor can be a grand dragon
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  that's okay
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  but regardless
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  the word is
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  this is up on DrudgeReport.com
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  from Role Called
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  you're hired
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  Trump picks Pence
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  Trump to pick Mike Pence says
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  Source
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  that is one of the best choices
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  it's a lot better than Newt Gennrich
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  because let me tell you
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  as much as I dislike Hillary and everything
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  if he would have picked Gennrich
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  or if he does pick Gennrich
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  and Gennrich by the way is attacking Trump today
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  which as soon as I saw that this morning
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  it's like Hallelujah
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  because he just can't help but backbite
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  that's just how he is
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  and if he puts
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Gennrich too close to him
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  he's crazy
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  if you keep your enemies closer I get that
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  I'm going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  so I see what he starts delivering on
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  like getting our jobs back
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  like defending our sovereignty
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  so
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  there's different strategies out there
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  it's just that
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  time will have to tell
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Donald Trump is planning to announce
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  that Indiana Governor Mike Pence is his choice
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  for his vice presidential running mate
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  of course he had a meeting in private
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  with four of the guys yesterday
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  in Indiana according to a Republican
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  with direct knowledge of the decision
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  as Trump narrowed
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  in on his choice of Pence the two men
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  spent time at both Trump's golf resort
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  in New Jersey in early July
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  and at the Indiana Governor's mansion this week
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  that's right
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  in addition to testing the men's chemistry
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Trump also reportedly
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  impressed with Pence's calm demeanor
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  his experience on Capitol Hill
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  and as a Governor
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  and Pence's potential to assist Trump
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  in governing should the ticket win in November
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  the announcement will be made publicly
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  at an event at Trump Tower
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  at 11 a.m. Friday morning
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  in addition to Pence
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  Trump is considered former Speaker of the House
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Newt Gennrich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Army General Michael Flynn
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  the number two spots on his ticket
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  some contenders include Senator Bob Corker
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  that was never the case
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  Corker went to him of Tennessee
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  and he goes on from there
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  so we'll see
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  all I know is
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  Hillary Clinton
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  is seven points behind
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  a new scientific Rasmussen poll
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  and a whole other index of polls
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  that are up on infowars.com
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  showing that he's pulled ahead
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  three to four points in almost every poll
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  except for the polls being put out
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  by Democratic Party pollsters
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  or affiliated media groups
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  and you can write a poll
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  and ask the questions however you want
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  you can use the demographics who you called
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  I already talked about that but
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  I tell you, you can really see
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  how the establishment is going to strike back
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  and I'm going to tie all this together
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  when we come back from break here in a few minutes
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  to the original
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  Rand Corporation Slash
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  U.S. Government Carnegie Endowment for Peace
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  program
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  you want to know where the U.N. comes from
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  want to understand why this is happening
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  want to understand Obama's
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  brigades and what Black Lives Matter is
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  this is a
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  shaping of things to come
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  and
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  where this country is going to go
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  and so I'm going to break it down
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  as calmly as I can without getting upset
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  why it's such a travesty
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  and a tragedy what's happening
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  but you want to see the political takeover of America
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  this is what it is
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  by the offshore
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  ignorance
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  now before I go any further
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  because I want to plunge right into this when we come back from break
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  we are ending the special
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  today and it will end
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  we already extended it expanded it

[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  it's not like a few of the things are 40% off
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  a lot of the food is 40% off
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  20 to 40% off bare minimum 20%

[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  that's going to end today

[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com
[29:50.000 --> 30:06.000]  I have an exciting announcement from articles by viewszone.com and transpersonal.de
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  our physical bodies run on light
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  that's right, Russian scientist Alexander G. Gerfisch
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  discovered bio photons in 1923
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  with further research supported in the 1970s
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  by Fritz Albert Papp
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  a theoretical biophysicist
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  this system of light could possibly cure disease
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  and cancer
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  the process is called photorepair
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  Fritz Papp found that cancer cells actually distort light they absorb
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  while normal cells let light pass through them
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  untampered
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  if you blast a cell with harsh amounts of UV light
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  until the cell is almost destroyed
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  you can repair the cell by illuminating it
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  with the same UV at a lower intensity
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  but this is old news to the scientific community
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  Fritz Papp concluded that cancer is a result
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  of light already in the body that is blocked
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  and scrambled by cancer causing compounds
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  the body's photorepair process could itself be repaired
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  could that mean the end of cancer
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  and eventually the end of deception
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  by big pharma and the medical industry
[30:54.000 --> 31:18.000]  this is Gabe Golddiamond for Infowars.com

[32:00.320 --> 32:02.280]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[32:02.280 --> 32:03.560]  It took you over a year to do it.
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.760]  Why is this so good?
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.640]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[32:07.640 --> 32:10.080]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[32:10.080 --> 32:12.640]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[32:12.640 --> 32:15.320]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[32:15.320 --> 32:19.240]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[32:19.240 --> 32:21.840]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[32:21.840 --> 32:23.560]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[32:23.560 --> 32:27.360]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[32:27.360 --> 32:29.920]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:29.920 --> 32:31.240]  These are all parasites.
[32:31.240 --> 32:32.400]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[32:32.400 --> 32:33.680]  There's so many things that are in it.
[32:33.680 --> 32:34.920]  You have the neem in there.
[32:34.920 --> 32:38.120]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:38.120 --> 32:41.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:41.400 --> 32:43.120]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.520]  because I'm going back on it today.
[32:44.520 --> 32:45.520]  It just came back in yesterday.
[32:45.520 --> 32:47.480]  Living Defense, infowarstore.com.
[32:47.480 --> 32:49.240]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff
[32:49.240 --> 32:51.080]  that's great for your body, period.
[32:51.080 --> 32:54.480]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarstore.com.
[32:54.480 --> 32:56.720]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:56.720 --> 32:58.080]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir,
[32:58.080 --> 33:00.760]  on this great product.
[33:00.760 --> 33:26.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.760 --> 33:51.520]  All right, I want to just succinctly give you the facts.
[33:51.520 --> 34:00.240]  Not rhetoric, not hype, but reality.
[34:00.240 --> 34:07.120]  For so long, the Liberty Movement has warned about a world government U.N. takeover, that
[34:07.120 --> 34:12.200]  even though it's now here and now happening, I'll have somebody on like Dr. Paul Craig
[34:12.200 --> 34:15.560]  Roberts, former head of the Treasury Department, father of ergonomics.
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.340]  And I'll say, you know, this is six months ago, hey, did you see the Associated Press
[34:20.340 --> 34:26.200]  and Breitbart and everybody, the attorney general just met and says, the new attorney general
[34:26.200 --> 34:35.920]  at the time, Loretta Lynch, she just met with government leaders from around the country,
[34:35.920 --> 34:42.800]  and they're going to set up U.N. offices to oversee human rights in every U.S. city with
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.800]  federal funding.
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.360]  And he goes, oh, Alex, the U.N. doesn't run anything.
[34:49.360 --> 34:52.440]  Look it back to the war with China or whatever they're talking about.
[34:52.440 --> 34:53.880]  And see, I respect him.
[34:53.880 --> 34:56.040]  I'm not arguing or debating.
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.040]  It's all perspective.
[34:58.040 --> 35:06.360]  He's absolutely right that it's Washington and the European globalist and the U.K. globalist
[35:06.360 --> 35:10.080]  that run the Anglo-American establishment, and they're the big families and the power
[35:10.080 --> 35:11.360]  brokers.
[35:11.360 --> 35:17.840]  And the U.N. is a U.S. puppet, and it gets 50% of its funding from the U.S. and the Rockefeller
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.840]  and Rothschild families gave basically 100% of the money to found it.
[35:23.840 --> 35:25.240]  I've had the experts on.
[35:25.240 --> 35:28.800]  I've read the congressional reports that Anthony Sutton put together.
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.320]  The Carnegie Endowment for Peace runs the whole show, but you have to understand when
[35:35.320 --> 35:38.760]  the rubber meets the road, it is a U.N. takeover.
[35:38.760 --> 35:45.000]  The globalists need to create a new government that they can transfer our powers to away
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.680]  from the people, away from the states, and then have it come back in with the stirred
[35:50.680 --> 35:55.160]  up, angry populations mad at what the globalists are doing here.
[35:55.160 --> 36:01.400]  And then here comes the good cop, the U.N. to save everyone, the IMF, the World Bank.
[36:01.400 --> 36:03.760]  That's what this is.
[36:03.760 --> 36:10.280]  Just like the TPP, 10 years being secretly prepared, Congress not allowed to see it,
[36:10.280 --> 36:11.280]  lawsuits get filed.
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.720]  So for a few months, you can go into a room with tens of thousands of pages and different
[36:15.720 --> 36:23.200]  drafts and look at one page at a time and no notes.
[36:23.200 --> 36:29.640]  How did Congress get in the position where they're told by some shadowy group, we don't
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.480]  even know who, that okay, you can look at it one piece of paper at a time.
[36:34.480 --> 36:35.960]  That isn't just world government.
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.560]  It's totally draconian, secretive, and over the top.
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.120]  You guys queue up Obama talking about a domestic security force just as big, just as strong.
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.720]  It's 23 seconds.
[36:49.720 --> 36:56.200]  So so many times, I sit here jumping to pieces of evidence trying to prove it to you, and
[36:56.200 --> 36:58.040]  I'm still going to do that neurotically.
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.600]  But at a certain point, I've done a lot of videos, I noticed reports that are really
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.200]  popular where I just show one article with some links and then just tell you what's going
[37:05.200 --> 37:08.440]  on instead of like, and look at this and look at that and read this quote, see, they really
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.440]  are doing it.
[37:09.440 --> 37:11.360]  Look, you know they're really doing it, okay?
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.000]  They really did Obamacare.
[37:13.000 --> 37:23.120]  The White House sent Obama to Dallas two days ago, and he actually got up there for like
[37:23.120 --> 37:29.040]  15 minutes and said, oh, we're really sorry, you know, it's never okay to kill cops.
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.040]  But I tell you, we're really a racist, horrible country, we got to reform the police and it's
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.560]  blah, blah, blah, blah.
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.840]  Just adding support to this whole movement and every corporate media outlet pushing it
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.960]  and every globalist computer outfit pushing it and foreign governments pushing it and
[37:43.960 --> 37:50.400]  the UN coming and having meetings and advising and filing lawsuits and running the refugee
[37:50.400 --> 37:56.240]  program, it's happening.
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.560]  And I've got stacks of news every day now where the UN is running all of this.
[38:02.560 --> 38:09.720]  It's the consortium that sets the curriculum for the public schools and the colleges, UNESCO,
[38:09.720 --> 38:16.800]  it sets the global standards for light bulbs, toilets, and then we just adopt it.
[38:16.800 --> 38:23.360]  How cold your thermostat can go, how hot your hot tub can get, I mean, we haven't implemented
[38:23.360 --> 38:24.360]  all this yet.
[38:24.360 --> 38:30.800]  Some countries have, Germany has banned the new construction of single family dwellings
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.480]  saying we don't want families to be alone, that's a cult, we want you in a big building.
[38:37.480 --> 38:40.680]  I first saw that in German newspapers like six, seven years ago, people didn't believe
[38:40.680 --> 38:41.680]  it.
[38:41.680 --> 38:47.560]  It's now in place.
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.560]  And now it's coming here.
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.280]  I remember 10 years ago when they were banning space heaters and outdoor heaters and fireplaces
[38:52.280 --> 38:54.360]  all over Europe, people laughed.
[38:54.360 --> 38:59.160]  It's now happening in the United States.
[38:59.160 --> 39:04.360]  I've tell you five years ago about coffin apartments that are going to be 225 square
[39:04.360 --> 39:09.960]  feet, but you pay more for them, less for more money.
[39:09.960 --> 39:10.960]  People didn't believe it.
[39:10.960 --> 39:19.720]  Now many of the new buildings being built in Austin are 200, 300 square foot folks.
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.840]  They mean business, okay, business.
[39:24.840 --> 39:28.960]  We're following a global, I'm getting chills right now, a total global government
[39:28.960 --> 39:34.480]  program meant to shut resources off incrementally till you're totally dependent and then they're
[39:34.480 --> 39:37.680]  going to start killing everybody with bio weapons.
[39:37.680 --> 39:40.800]  But they're just getting a sick right now and getting us ready for it.
[39:40.800 --> 39:43.080]  And that's why people want me to at least pay lip service.
[39:43.080 --> 39:46.560]  Like I've been told privately, you ought to be nicer to black lives matter and you know,
[39:46.560 --> 39:48.240]  say some nice things like you care and all this.
[39:48.240 --> 39:50.200]  I'm not, of course I care.
[39:50.200 --> 39:53.640]  I'm not going to sit here and play lip service, you understand?
[39:53.640 --> 39:56.160]  You need to slap up beside your fricking head.
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.760]  I don't care if you're white, whatever damn color you are.
[39:58.760 --> 39:59.760]  Excuse me.
[39:59.760 --> 40:00.840]  I said I'm not going to get mad.
[40:00.840 --> 40:03.360]  I'm so angry lately.
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.080]  We are under scientific attack.
[40:06.080 --> 40:07.640]  We're under medical attack.
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.720]  They're geo engineering spending tens of billions a year.
[40:11.720 --> 40:14.760]  The plants are dying all over the Northern Hemisphere.
[40:14.760 --> 40:20.800]  Aluminum levels in some cases are 50 times what they were 20 years ago.
[40:20.800 --> 40:28.040]  The globalist scientists won a Nobel Prize in 1992 for the plan they implemented in 1996.
[40:28.040 --> 40:36.360]  It's not funny, you know, either social justice warriors either laugh at these warnings or
[40:36.360 --> 40:41.240]  they, or they just ignore it and move on to, did you hear two more black guys got shot
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.240]  last week?
[40:42.240 --> 40:45.080]  Yeah, did you hear 50,000 black babies got killed?
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.160]  I mean, just, do you understand what a joke that is?
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.560]  You got a mosquito biting you.
[40:49.560 --> 40:54.760]  Meanwhile, they got your head in the guillotine and you're bitching about the mosquito.
[40:54.760 --> 40:59.440]  It's a total diversion.
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.360]  And I sit here watching it done scientifically, having all the proof, all the documents, their
[41:04.360 --> 41:08.920]  whole plan, telling people what to go read, what to go look at for yourself.
[41:08.920 --> 41:17.120]  The US law, US code, title 50, chapter 32, subsection 1520A, paragraph B. And then people
[41:17.120 --> 41:20.720]  go read it and don't even know what they're saying, they go, Alex, this says they can't
[41:20.720 --> 41:30.200]  do secret testing, honest, unless it's for law enforcement or research purposes, including
[41:30.200 --> 41:33.120]  lethal.
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.320]  It's on the books, they can kill us.
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.360]  You're like, well, wait a minute, you said the cops are our friends, but they're allowed
[41:39.360 --> 41:40.360]  to kill us.
[41:40.360 --> 41:43.560]  It's for, it's the top law enforcement purposes.
[41:43.560 --> 41:51.840]  Your enemy is not the average cop down the street that's just as compartmentalized as
[41:51.840 --> 41:52.840]  you are.
[41:52.840 --> 41:55.840]  I said I was going to walk to this and I was going to take your calls.
[41:55.840 --> 41:56.840]  Excuse me.
[41:56.840 --> 41:58.840]  See, I try to not think about this stuff all the time.
[41:58.840 --> 42:07.560]  I really, just the ignorance, the mind control, the enemy winning makes me sick to my stomach
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.720]  and to know where all this is going and to know the institutional division it's creating
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.520]  and then they'll have this whole political correct system to fix it, which is a cult
[42:16.520 --> 42:20.440]  attacking words and language, an independent free thought.
[42:20.440 --> 42:26.160]  It is just so incredibly over the top obvious.
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.840]  And one level, this is incredibly exciting and entertaining though.
[42:30.840 --> 42:36.120]  I mean, we're living in a science fiction movie with an elite who believes they're going
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.400]  to merge with machines and become God and who believe we're obsolete and are planning
[42:40.400 --> 42:43.920]  an organized, clean way to kill everybody off.
[42:43.920 --> 42:45.760]  Wow.
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.720]  That's more entertaining than Moonraker, isn't it?
[42:49.720 --> 43:05.960]  Written by MI6, getting a little taste of what's on the drawing board.
[43:05.960 --> 43:11.080]  The big megabags, the royal houses, the royal families.
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.560]  I was looking at this morning when you guys Google the royal families, the world meet
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.800]  and it shows less than 30 heads of state and you look at them and I know what a lot of
[43:18.800 --> 43:19.800]  those families own.
[43:19.800 --> 43:26.920]  I mean, you're looking at folks that own more than half the world's wealth and then the
[43:26.920 --> 43:36.640]  robber baron, new royalty, less than 30 families and you look at them and they're above the
[43:36.640 --> 43:42.360]  law, their wealth is a state secret, their tax exempt and everyone kisses their butt.
[43:42.360 --> 43:57.800]  The oldest dynasty is the Japanese, 660 BC, still in charge today.
[43:57.800 --> 44:02.520]  I got a new report on that.
[44:02.520 --> 44:06.200]  You just type into Google, royal families of the world meet, royal families of the
[44:06.200 --> 44:07.200]  world gather.
[44:07.200 --> 44:08.200]  I have it here on my phone.
[44:08.200 --> 44:09.200]  I was looking at it earlier today.
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.920]  I can pull it up for TV viewers, it's right here.
[44:13.920 --> 44:20.040]  Look at this, you're giving me a document cam shot.
[44:20.040 --> 44:21.040]  Look at that.
[44:21.040 --> 44:28.320]  I was doing research on the Japanese and British royals and all the little secretive meetings
[44:28.320 --> 44:29.320]  that are going on.
[44:29.320 --> 44:30.840]  This photo came up.
[44:30.840 --> 44:38.000]  Pull it up guys, anyways.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.120]  You know what I'm going to do?
[44:41.120 --> 44:52.360]  I'm going to just give you the places to look and if media folks out there don't get
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.640]  upset about this, you think it's cute, you think it's funny, you think the public's
[44:55.640 --> 44:58.880]  all done, so let's just go along with the elite or whatever.
[44:58.880 --> 45:01.440]  You deserve what happens to you because I'm going to tell everybody something right now
[45:01.440 --> 45:08.360]  and I'm going to tell especially the rich people and they're of every race, color and
[45:08.360 --> 45:09.360]  creed.
[45:09.360 --> 45:11.680]  The people that think you're established because you got $10 million in the bank and
[45:11.680 --> 45:15.320]  live in a mansion or maybe $100 million or maybe $1 billion and you go along with this
[45:15.320 --> 45:20.480]  whole thing and you make jokes about it because I don't really find many billionaires or rich
[45:20.480 --> 45:22.800]  people that don't know this is all true.
[45:22.800 --> 45:25.880]  A lot of times they say, yeah, that's why the world's always been so what, get with
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.880]  the program.
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.480]  Yeah, we all hadn't always been like this because we're getting down to the end game
[45:30.480 --> 45:38.760]  right now, hadn't always been like this where everybody on that stage that we just showed
[45:38.760 --> 45:44.080]  for TV viewers, look them up house by house is tax exempt, their wealth is a state secret
[45:44.080 --> 45:52.480]  and they're guarded by the government and they are establishing a planetary world government
[45:52.480 --> 45:59.280]  because they think you are stealing resources by existing and they say you're a dumb animal
[45:59.280 --> 46:06.720]  and they say you are going to be first dumbed down your psyche ripped from you so that they
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.560]  metaphysically are authorized to kill you because you're an animal but first you must
[46:11.560 --> 46:17.160]  be turned into an animal metaphysically.
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.560]  The allegory of the prince was a frog.
[46:19.560 --> 46:22.760]  She kissed him and recognized he was a prince and became a man.
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.200]  Instead you take the prince and you turn him into the frog.
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.440]  He doesn't even know he was a man.
[46:29.440 --> 46:39.820]  He's an animal, he's chattel, he's controlled, he's manipulated.
[46:39.820 --> 46:48.000]  You could snap your fingers and he'll operate under the stimuli you put him under.
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.880]  So what you're hearing here is the facts.
[46:52.880 --> 47:00.560]  The inbred royalty of the world established ruling classes to control global systems.
[47:00.560 --> 47:10.320]  They are eugenicists and they do not want you to receive the future that you could have.
[47:10.320 --> 47:15.560]  They see you as a giant, ugly scourge that they haven't been able to control with wars
[47:15.560 --> 47:23.480]  since the days of Plato, 2,300 years ago, king of the philosophers, he wrote that they
[47:23.480 --> 47:30.840]  should have wars to lower the population and they should basically breed the general public
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.600]  to be like dumb cattle to serve the intellectual elite.
[47:35.600 --> 47:45.320]  And Plato's thoughts have been adopted by every major empire.
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.000]  In fact, empires that hadn't even read Plato's thoughts.
[47:51.000 --> 48:01.240]  Empires that existed before Plato, in Persia and Japan and other places followed almost
[48:01.240 --> 48:07.520]  the exact same systems.
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.120]  And now they've decided you're obsolete, they're going to get rid of you, and I said
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.280]  I'd get into Black Lives Matter, but it's just ridiculous.
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.960]  You take a bunch of people that are obsessed, white, black, it doesn't matter, with hype
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.240]  and culture and watch the Kardashians and they're wondering why they got to go work
[48:22.240 --> 48:29.160]  at a hamburger place and they want free tuition because Bernie Sanders said so and they just
[48:29.160 --> 48:37.160]  see these videos everywhere, every day of cops killing people in the wrong in many cases.
[48:37.160 --> 48:47.840]  And it doesn't matter if statistically more people die in a middle sized town every day
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.000]  in car wrecks than get killed by the cops in a week, it doesn't matter.
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.400]  Because again, it's a victory of the hallucination, it's the victory of the lie over the truth.
[48:58.400 --> 49:03.840]  Now to some of the cops at Bazaar, do they act authoritarian, do they act scared, do
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.280]  they treat you with disrespect, absolutely in many cases, that's a real issue.
[49:08.280 --> 49:15.000]  And what this is all about is hyping people up to be politically aggressive, to prepare
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.760]  them to quote take political power, but in their own downfall.
[49:20.760 --> 49:29.760]  And in the crisis that comes out of that, establishing an even greater authoritarian
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.760]  tyranny, just like they're going to use weaker bio weapons to get us into a medical tyranny
[49:35.760 --> 49:38.760]  and then of course the more hardcore ones come in the future.
[49:38.760 --> 49:49.240]  It's all ratcheted up, the attacks just get bigger and bigger and bigger because we adapt
[49:49.240 --> 49:54.000]  to conform to the attack, that's what the nanny state's all about.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.400]  Conform, give up your individualism, become weaker when there's an attack and let stronger
[50:00.400 --> 50:07.080]  specialized groups, warrior ants protect you.
[50:07.080 --> 50:13.840]  But you're not really a queen down in the mound, you're being taught not to protect
[50:13.840 --> 50:25.160]  yourself because you're being prepared for the fire, you're being prepared to have your
[50:25.160 --> 50:33.320]  humanity sucked out of you before you're blown away like dust into the atmosphere.
[50:33.320 --> 50:38.200]  Now I got a little angry earlier, I didn't actually get into 7277 and the UN and all
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.280]  the rest of it, I'm gonna try to just focus briefly in five minutes, I'm back and give
[50:42.280 --> 50:47.280]  you a special report on it, then we have a guest joining us for 30 minutes and then
[50:47.280 --> 50:53.280]  I'm gonna open the phones up for the rest of the broadcast for Bernie Sanders supporters
[50:53.280 --> 51:00.560]  to tell me why you're supporting Hillary Clinton, we'll be back, I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[51:00.560 --> 51:04.920]  Are you prepared to bug out Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high speed

[51:33.240 --> 51:34.800]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[51:34.800 --> 51:38.880]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years, I've helped thousands and I can
[51:38.880 --> 51:43.120]  help you too, I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing
[51:43.120 --> 51:44.600]  as a hopeless case.

[51:59.640 --> 52:04.600]  To a professional trader in precious metals, the key is spot price.
[52:04.600 --> 52:06.320]  Spot price is market price.
[52:06.320 --> 52:09.920]  But gold or silver actually costs on the exchange.
[52:09.920 --> 52:14.400]  Regular people looking to invest never get spot price, because resellers add fees for
[52:14.400 --> 52:15.400]  everything.
[52:15.400 --> 52:18.480]  Refining, minting, brokerage costs, commissions.
[52:18.480 --> 52:22.520]  The public is never offered spot price, until now.
[52:22.520 --> 52:27.320]  In a limited new customer outreach, JM Bullion offers you the chance to own a 10-ounce bar

[53:57.000 --> 54:11.160]  We can pull the quote up, but famously Henry Kissinger and Evian France called the Bilderberg
[54:11.160 --> 54:16.040]  group, meaning that if they could stir up enough civil unrest to the United States down the
[54:16.040 --> 54:22.560]  road, that Americans would welcome UN troops on our streets.
[54:22.560 --> 54:28.720]  The Euro is saying in response to a majority of the nations wanting to leave the Euro because
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.400]  they never voted to enter the Euro, that oh, we're just going to nationalize your military
[54:32.400 --> 54:33.400]  and not let you leave.
[54:33.400 --> 54:36.760]  Oh, and by the way, we're not going to let you have national teams anymore.
[54:36.760 --> 54:42.000]  That's racist to say you have the Spaniards, you have the French, or you can't have that
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  anymore.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  This is being announced.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.400]  You can have no identity.
[54:47.400 --> 54:53.120]  The TPP and the NAU and all these other secret agreements are going to rule your life.
[54:53.120 --> 54:56.520]  Well, I don't try to lionize JFK.
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.600]  I think he was manipulated at many levels, really believed he was trying to establish
[55:00.600 --> 55:03.280]  some type of planetary government for peace.
[55:03.280 --> 55:09.640]  He didn't want war with the Russians, but one of the reasons he got killed, or at least
[55:09.640 --> 55:15.080]  they used the right wing out of Texas to do it, Texas is the reason the president's dead.
[55:15.080 --> 55:24.760]  They kind of had cold feet up in Chicago and cold feet in Miami and places, is because
[55:24.760 --> 55:29.760]  Kennedy did not want to have a preemptive nuclear war with the Russians.
[55:29.760 --> 55:37.120]  And so there was already a Carnegie endowment for peace plan from the 30s to establish the
[55:37.120 --> 55:43.000]  UN, the whole system we see funded by the Rockefellers, but also the Carnegie endowment, obviously.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.680]  This is the Carnegie endowment for peace.
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.160]  Many of their minutes are now public from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s.
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.720]  And you can see them charting out the whole future we live under, and they had a plan
[55:54.720 --> 55:57.520]  to merge us with the Soviet Union.
[55:57.520 --> 56:03.800]  Now, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reemergence of some Christian Orthodox
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.120]  roots, that's thrown that into question.
[56:07.120 --> 56:10.080]  We were then told that, oh, it was all a sleeper deal with the Russians.
[56:10.080 --> 56:13.840]  They were really going to reemerge in all this.
[56:13.840 --> 56:16.640]  There were certainly factions that wanted to do that, but the Russians have tripled
[56:16.640 --> 56:17.920]  across the globalist.
[56:17.920 --> 56:22.720]  That is my educated view on this, seeing their real actions, and the globalist actions against
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.520]  them.
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.480]  But if you look at this system and this dialectic, it was codified in 1962.
[56:31.480 --> 56:34.160]  And Kit Daniels wrote an article about this last year.
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.360]  Did you know a law is on the books to disarm all Americans?
[56:37.360 --> 56:43.080]  A law provides impetus for ultimate world disarmament and UN control over military.
[56:43.080 --> 56:47.600]  And you can go to the United Nations Uniteer Treaty, and it says, Civilian-Artship of Firearms
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.040]  threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state, or dictatorship.
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.400]  And then he links to the public law 87-29.
[56:55.400 --> 56:57.760]  This is on the books.
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.480]  And the original memorandum, you might want to read it.
[57:01.480 --> 57:03.920]  You can still send off the State Department and get a copy of these, last time I checked
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.680]  for like a dollar.
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.320]  The United States Program for General and Complete Disarmament in the Peaceful World,
[57:09.320 --> 57:10.320]  through the UN.
[57:10.320 --> 57:19.160]  And it shows the Russian weapons being downgraded down to zero in the graphs, and ours being
[57:19.160 --> 57:23.520]  downgraded to zero, and then our police are disarmed, but first the citizens.
[57:23.520 --> 57:29.120]  So the military's phased down, the citizens are disarmed, and then the police are disarmed.
[57:29.120 --> 57:34.560]  And then you turn on the news today, CNN, Fox News, you name it, I've got the clips right
[57:34.560 --> 57:43.000]  here, and they've got all these leftist groups saying, disarm the police.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.600]  The police should not be able to have firearms.
[57:44.600 --> 57:48.400]  We're going to play these clips coming up in the next hour and take your phone calls.
[57:48.400 --> 57:54.560]  So sitting there watching all this, and seeing the new community organize their setting up,
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.160]  there's going to be jobs in the future, is a quasi-government employee, like the head
[57:58.160 --> 58:04.520]  of Black Lives Matter, who has this $160,000 a year job as a board member on a school board,
[58:04.520 --> 58:07.240]  that looks like he's 20 years old.
[58:07.240 --> 58:11.800]  He lives in a house paid for by George Soros.
[58:11.800 --> 58:15.360]  Let's go out to break with Obama, talking about the domestic security force, just as
[58:15.360 --> 58:16.760]  big as our military.
[58:16.760 --> 58:20.720]  That's what they're setting up, specialist groups that'll just run around and engaging
[58:20.720 --> 58:21.720]  in racism and infighting.
[58:21.720 --> 58:22.720]  Here it is.
[58:22.720 --> 58:29.080]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[58:29.080 --> 58:30.600]  objectives that we've set.
[58:30.600 --> 58:37.120]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[58:37.120 --> 58:38.120]  just as well.
[58:38.120 --> 58:39.120]  We'll be back.
[58:39.120 --> 58:40.120]  Stay with us.

[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:17.160]  Well, they're saying we are on the march.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.280]  The empire is on the march.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.880]  I don't want folks to have to hold, so I'm going to give the number out at about 20 after.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.960]  So you can call in.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.320]  After James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project joins us with some breaking news but also
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.600]  his take on election 2016.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.240]  What do you think of this supposed pick?
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.920]  They say that Pence is scheduled with a bunch of Fox TV and other channels tomorrow in the
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920]  hours after Trump set to make the announcement.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.640]  He stayed at his home for a few days.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:05.880]  I thought that was a big sign but they had the other people, Gennrich and Sessions and
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:11.920]  General Flynn, to the same meeting in Indiana.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.240]  So I think this is probably accurate information.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:21.480]  This from the Hill judge seems to have a good instinct for these things.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.720]  Talking to Stone, he said that nothing had been decided but that he pretty much thought
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:34.640]  who he knew Trump was going to pick now.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.120]  He didn't tell us what he talked to Trump about but then he kind of brought it up.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.160]  I said, well, I think it's going to be Sessions even though it'll be politically incorrect
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160]  and make a big deal out of it.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]  They're going to do that anyways.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160]  He goes, well, you really read my mind.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.680]  Yeah, that's what I told him but Sessions wants to bow out.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:55.040]  So that was the inside info there and the word was it was probably going to be Pence
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.160]  but we didn't want to go there.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:06.240]  I was kind of hoping to promote my own little way, Flynn, because the media put out the
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.520]  whole thing about him being a Democrat to throw everybody off.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.600]  Turns out that's not true.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.700]  But regardless, he has a good background of integrity and really exposing corruption
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:22.640]  and bucking corruption and giving the information, working with General Dempsey to the Russians
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.840]  four years ago when he was the head of defense intelligence.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.800]  He was the head of defense intelligence a year and a half ago.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.480]  He got fired by Obama for that, folks.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.960]  They weren't about to arrest him for espionage because the whole military went in and confronted
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.080]  Obama and said, you're backing al-Qaeda and ISIS doing this.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.000]  Is it okay if we share intelligence with people to stop them?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Obama's like, well, if you drop flyers two hours before and it's only certain areas and
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.280]  the Russians kept publishing the satellite photos of the hundreds of trucks an hour lined
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.800]  up going into Turkey and said, we're going to blow that up.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.600]  They started blowing it up and Turkey flipped out and started shooting down Russian aircraft.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.560]  This is a circus, folks, but Trump's got good instincts.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.960]  Trump's the guy in the arena.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:17.240]  Trump is the guy that turned down Adelson's 200 million to take Gennrich.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:25.960]  If he does a curveball and picks Gennrich, that's one strike for Trump.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.880]  But I'm waiting to see what he does once he gets in, but he just keeps amazing.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.880]  I mean, he's just done things right down the line that are unprecedented, super courageous,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.840]  super dangerous.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.480]  He wants to basically downgrade NATO that's running around starting wars and backing
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:50.320]  the Arab Spring and really try to start a new Cold War that will try to bankrupt Russia.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.880]  Trump talks about, he has a lot of generals advising him that they have a bunch of pork
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.080]  barrel, a bunch of weapons that don't work.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.840]  We're giving the Chinese everything we got.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840]  He says, don't worry.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.440]  We're going to have real weapons systems.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:05.360]  We're going to be the strongest, but we're not going to start wars with Russia and we're
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.760]  not going to let China get the secrets because it's the Chinese that have infiltrated.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.560]  It's the Chinese that are in our defense intelligence system.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.460]  They're the ones robbing everything.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.400]  They're the ones with mobile execution vans.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.560]  They're the Communist.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:22.120]  They're in bed with Walmart and the billionaires and the oligarchs screwing everyone.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.600]  They're the enemy, not the Chinese people, but the Communist Party of China is the most
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  powerful.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.440]  Every science fiction movie you go see, the Chinese run the space program and run the
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.680]  world basically.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:42.560]  The New Independence Day, the Martian movie, I mean, man, you go see movies now.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:49.680]  I mean, there's Chinese government red flag propaganda everywhere, running the planetary
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]  government.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:56.640]  I've seen basically any movie I see that's military or space, the Chinese are running
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.360]  them, I mean, this country's in trouble, folks.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.920]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones, but recent studies link
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.920]  cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.360]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.000]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable, so keep
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.040]  the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.640]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.640]  sperm.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.240]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.880]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.360]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.320]  actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.880]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.160]  Hello, weight gain.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.440]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]  radiation.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.680]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.240]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240]  Use headphones.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.240]  When you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.040]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo with your InfoWars tip of the week.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.440]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.520]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.960]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.160]  scientific research that puts together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.

[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.240]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.440]  the iodine conspiracy.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.800]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.040]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.760]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.240]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in, and when the Fukushima
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.880]  crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.400]  yourself and your family.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.880]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.680]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.280]  ever concerning iodine.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.240]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.480]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.440]  any optimum health regimen.

[51:39.300 --> 01:08:34.520]  stack of news articles here in front of me where students mildly criticizing
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:40.320]  people on their own Facebook are being threatened or being kicked out of major colleges.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320]  There's two more today.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.680]  There was one just yesterday, and Paul Watson's written a new article for infowars.com, Black
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.920]  Lives Matter organizer triggered by white people demands money for being a fat black
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.760]  bitch, that's a quote, be ready to write checks and give up your car keys.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.880]  And what it is, is just lazy, crazy social justice warriors, I don't care if you're
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:13.400]  black, white or whatever, that are in their own fantasy land and see every major media
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.680]  outlet, movies, TV shows, the White House, blaming the police, well, white people better
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:28.320]  listen up, Hillary said, Obama said, we need to reform things, implying it's the police
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.600]  fault someone randomly went and shot them.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:37.720]  It's not right if a crazy cop shoots somebody innocent, and it's not right if another crazy
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.240]  person goes and shoots five cops, then they say it's racist to say all lives matter.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.200]  It's an inversion of reality, that's the opposite of racism is to say all lives matter, it's
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.320]  racist to say black lives matter only.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.480]  But the issue here is, this is weaponization of media, this is the next phase of what the
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.880]  globalists are gonna do in this country, with the UN advising and setting up meetings to
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:06.640]  watch the police in every US city.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.600]  Meanwhile, Trump is reportedly, according to sources at Fox and sources at the Hill,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.640]  it's gonna be Pence, the governor of Indiana, we're gonna be going over that at the bottom
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:23.080]  of the hour, taking your phone calls, we're gonna be talking to Bernie Sanders supporters,
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.880]  I mean, why would you now not go for Trump?
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.240]  The whole establishment's against him, you claim your anti-establishment, what a joke,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.520]  truth is you like a big government, don't you?
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:38.200]  You just want a piece of it, now joining us to the bottom of the hour is James O'Keefe,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.200]  projectveritas.com, best-selling author, I think the consummate investigative journalist,
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:47.240]  not gonna go over all of his amazing feats with his crew, bring down Acorn, you name
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.440]  it, he is a leading expert on fighting social justice warriors, but they have gone into
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.720]  an overdrive level, they've got some calculus at the White House where they believe they're
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  gonna win.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.240]  O'Keefe has a new video where the congressman admitting, oh no, you know, we're gonna have
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.240]  guns, you know, I mean, we're not gonna say that our homes are gun-free zones, no, no,
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.000]  just the schools and places, so we're gonna play a clip of that video, the full video
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.680]  is on inforwars.com, projectveritas.com, in fact, we have a short clip of that that
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.920]  I wanna go ahead and play right now, Hidden Cam shows anti-gun congressman and staffers
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:47.600]  refusing to promote homes as gun-free zones, here it is.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:58.800]  So, that's, well, you know, we'll get into the whole story with him right now and then
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.200]  talk about the bigger picture, great to have you on with us.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.360]  Hey, Alex, great to be with you.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:11.120]  Well, I tell you, you wanna tackle this story first or just get into the state of the activation
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.800]  of what I call like mal-youth brigades or something, this day of rage coming up tomorrow,
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]  this is crazy.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.440]  Well, maybe let's start with this gun-free zone story, because I think it plays into
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:28.160]  the hypocrisy of our elected officials and they're not believing what they actually write
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.200]  in the legislation, so maybe let's start there.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.800]  Yeah, tell us who the players are in this video.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.720]  So this is interesting, when we did this four years ago in New York, Westchester, New York,
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.800]  we caught people on tape, the idea is simple, approach these individuals and say, I wanna
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.160]  talk with a sign on your lawn saying your home is a gun-free zone, because these guys
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.080]  are anti-gun, of course they would do that because they write legislation.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.280]  So what you're seeing right now is this guy is working for John Conyers, he's a legislative
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:02.240]  aide, he writes legislation, his name is Eric Sperling, and he says in the video that, oh,
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.640]  you can see the wheels turning inside of his head, he says, I'm a big gun control advocate,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.440]  this is a new angle I hadn't thought about before, it makes me nervous, it makes me
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.400]  quote a target for criminals.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.240]  So these legislators, these congressional people are on video saying that it would draw
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.640]  attention to their homes if they advertise them as gun-free zones.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.600]  Now this is obvious to me and you, it's obvious to our audience, but to see the democratic
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.400]  legislators say this when confronted with the truth, I think it's really groundbreaking.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.560]  And I'm sure people have other ideas, but this is a start, they're actually saying,
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.720]  you know what, I don't know if this is such a good idea to advertise gun-free zones.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.360]  Well, obviously it's common sense the places that have all the gun laws have the highest
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.560]  crime rates in the world, they know this, I mean, the rich elite that are liberal all
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.920]  have got bodyguards, it's so hypocritical, I love the fact that Trump keeps saying,
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.760]  hey, give up your security, Hillary, I mean, it's an oxymoron.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.120]  What point do you think, just as someone that's been following this so long, and what point
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.560]  have we reached, are the social justice warriors, and black lives matter, and of course, they
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.920]  have a longer clip with Wrangel coming out and talking, I mean, do they actually believe
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.760]  anything they're saying, or is this just pure divide and conquer?
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.360]  I do not believe they, I do not think they believe most of what they're saying, I wrote
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.440]  a column, a drudge link to it on Friday after the shootings last week.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:35.560]  We are entering uncharted territory, there is a brave new world of unregulated video,
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.800]  I think it's a good thing, I think it was very tragic last week what happened, and these
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.760]  shootings with the police, the shootings in Minnesota as well, but the video is really
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.280]  catalyzing the masses, it's creating these social movements, and I think unfortunately
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:57.120]  it's creating these mobs, these violent mobs, but I think it also can be harnessed, and
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.400]  this is the point I made, it can be harnessed for good to promote government transparency.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.760]  For example, we know that Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch, we know that there are
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.640]  bribes of federal judges taking place, well that should be live streamed, and we can harness
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:19.840]  this technology, this live streaming technology for example, for good, and I'm a representative
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.440]  of an organization, Project Veritas, which is beta testing, hidden camera video streaming
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.280]  to our servers, that way if anything happens, we have a copy of the video, the law enforcement
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.400]  takes it, we have a copy of it, and I think that this is a power that can be used to promote
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.760]  government transparency as much as it can be used to hold police office.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.240]  Well I'm all for citizens having hidden cameras, I think making police wear body cams all the
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.880]  time, I wouldn't want to work and live like that, I think it's big brother, it sets the
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.200]  precedent for everybody to have to have that at work, and I don't like it, I mean I think
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.200]  if a company wants to make you do it, that's your option to do it, and I think police when
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:03.520]  they're on calls should have a camera on for them and everybody else, I used to be for
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.040]  that, but now I realize it will be selectively enforced, because in liberal areas, when cops
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.840]  do bad things, they just cover it up mostly, but then if it happens in a more freer area,
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.200]  they will then come in and use it as a way to politely take over, and kind of cherry
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.840]  pick things, I mean I saw, I think there's a problem with too many cameras.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.040]  I agree with you, I agree with you on that, I want to make a clear distinction that this
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.120]  is about little brother holding big brother account, exactly, the entire point of the
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.240]  American experiment, giving big brother cameras and all that, we've already lost our expectations.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.000]  Oh cops are having to wear body cams in many cities now, when they use the bathroom.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.240]  That's right, I'm sure they are, and you know, the point Ed Snowden made on vice recently,
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.560]  as he said, Shane Smith asked him, well why aren't more Americans outraged by all those
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.520]  surveillance, and Ed Snowden said, well they would be if we had the politicians on tape
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.880]  admitting it in plain words, so the whole point of this technology, I really think it's
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.360]  a transformative moment in American politics, because the technology is unregulated, it's
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.240]  proliferating, anybody can live stream video now, now we use hidden camera devices that
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.960]  are not, you can't buy them in most stores, but the fact that we can hold big brother
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:19.160]  accountable and make them lose their expectations of privacy, that's what this movement is all
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160]  about.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.600]  Basically they know that at least the people in the 5th of state, the new 5th of state
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.560]  are watching, also it really allows us to show that the so-called left are the most
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.000]  ignorant anti-liberal weirdos the world's ever seen, I mean this is, I mean just the
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.760]  video camera and YouTube and the proliferation of basically everybody getting on it now and
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.680]  having millions of providers of news, not just thousands or hundreds, it's almost like
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.440]  a singularity, it's showing how monstrous the social justice warriors are to a person,
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:57.160]  I mean these really are mentally ill, weirdos, bizarro land, I mean it's even forcing the
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:02.200]  left who are more trendy but aren't stupid to go ahead and admit, okay something's wrong
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.840]  here, I mean when you look at Triglypuff, Age Scree-Lick, I mean when you look at these
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.720]  people, Carl the Conk, I mean when you look at these people they are scary.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.840]  Ma'am a citizen journalist named Mike Strickland was detained, this was a cover on your website
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:21.040]  yesterday for unholstering his gun, he felt threatened and there were videotapes of the
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.000]  Black Panthers right before he had holstered his gun threatening to take out their guns,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.840]  so things are all caught on video, my greater point is that we can use this as a movement
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.480]  for good and I think-
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.840]  And they just sat down the street, pull your guns out and shoot cops, 10 minutes before.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.520]  That's right, that happened right before Mike Strickland was, Mike Strickland is sitting
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.440]  in jail, his bail is set at $250,000, Mike Strickland is a friend of mine, he's worked
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440]  with me-
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.560]  And by the way that's a liberal town you notice, now they're throwing the book at him, I mean
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.440]  it's crazy, so we think of the cops are all bad, oh they're not bad when they're liberal
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.680]  cops and allow people to be abused.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.960]  Right, and they originally charged him with a misdemeanor for menacing behavior but then
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.200]  they charged him with two felonies, and Mike Strickland was assaulted at the last year,
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.800]  he was assaulted, he broke his arm in three places, he was tackled to the ground and
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.280]  right before this event, Black Panther said, take out your guns and use them, basically.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.600]  So that's all on video, there's a picture of Mike Strickland, he didn't want to hurt
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600]  anybody-
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.960]  He's got the gun pretty much aimed down at the ground, he's got his hand back saying
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.000]  stay back, as people say we're pulling guns on.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.880]  Right, right exactly, so this is a friend of mine, a citizen journalist but you know,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.120]  what I draw from that whole thing is that everything is on video.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.080]  Who was attacked the year before?
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.880]  Mike Strickland was assaulted by someone who disagreed with him, someone disagreed with
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.000]  him and through Mike Strickland, that guy you just saw, threw him to the ground, he
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.920]  broke his arm in three places, he couldn't work for six months, so he's been physically
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.280]  violently assaulted in the past.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.400]  And then he just simply says back off and they've arrested him, stay there, final segment
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.720]  straight out with our guests and your phone calls.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.480]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.640]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message, here's why.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.120]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse, so please
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:19.480]  listen, solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:25.600]  generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and it's dangerous
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.440]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.800]  through it like the rest of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.200]  this week, Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.680]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.760]  to the low price for M4Wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:54.000]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com, it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  with minimum money.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.360]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.480]  Think about this, your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.280]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia,
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.520]  chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.120]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.960]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.800]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.120]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.760]  My name is Jay, I'm 26 years of age, and I just want to thank the makers of the One
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.280]  World Way protein powder.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.280]  After having chronic abdominal pain and pressure for months, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280]  Colitis.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.880]  The medical doctor told me there was nothing I could do to treat it, other than taking
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.440]  pain and nausea medication.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:20.640]  Then, I came across an ad for One World Way on the radio and read the claims that it can
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.360]  help with all types of inflammation.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.800]  I took the One World Way protein powder every day for a month and the chronic pain and pressure
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.480]  sensations went away completely, and I never took the pain or nausea medication.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.600]  To this day, my intestines are free of pain.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600]  Nature is kind.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.720]  When we consume foods we're designed to eat, then she gives back health when it was once
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]  lost.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.120]  One World Way consistently supports the body's production of glutathione and overall repair.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.520]  Glutathione stops inflammation, removes heavy metals, and toxins of all kind.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.160]  When inflammation is gone, the body can complete its healing process.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:56.120]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:04.560]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.240]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-year survival food on hand in
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.720]  case of an emergency.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.960]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.280]  given away to listeners while supplies last.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.360]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360]  for the company.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.080]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.920]  food impossible in an emergency.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:36.520]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.960]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated four and a half
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.480]  out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.400]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 in shipping.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.120]  Go to freefood1.com right now.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.680]  The supplies are limited and the program may end at any time.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.880]  Go to freefood1.com now.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:22.880]  That's freefood1.com.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:52.160]  That's freefood1.com.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.600]  That's the quote.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.040]  So whoever did, it's going to get in trouble with Trump.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.000]  I'm not going to give you Roger's quote, but it's a big deal.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.720]  But we'll see if this is even accurate.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720]  So I don't know.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.080]  I'm still in the dark here.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.280]  I think it probably is, folks.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.600]  Going back to James O'Keeffe, James, looking at this, this day of rage tomorrow, all the
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.560]  establishment behind this, Hollywood behind it, you're taking this issue statistically
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.880]  258 black people were killed by cops.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.600]  Let's just say none of it was justified.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.640]  Obviously most of it was in last year.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.480]  That's not even a blip, but you'd think it was the end of the world.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.560]  What do you think the Obama end game is on all this?
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:42.160]  Well, I will say that the convention is coming on Monday and there's going to be some violent
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160]  protests.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.440]  And here's what I can comment on because I can only comment on the investigations I do.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:55.720]  We have people who are actually meeting with some high, high-level left-wing operatives
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:02.240]  and exposing and planning the activities for the convention next week.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.360]  And our goal is to try to preempt the violence and preempt the social justice warriors and
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.920]  their violence and their mob mentality by exposing it.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.320]  Who's funding it and what activities are they doing that's fraudulent?
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.760]  For example, we've got one of these guys on tape saying they're going to bust people
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  from state to state commit voter fraud for the presidential election.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.600]  It's all about the fraud and as evidenced by our gun-free zone video, these legislators
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.200]  don't want to put signs in their homes saying their guns are, or their homes are gun-free
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200]  zones.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.200]  These people are hypocrites.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.200]  They don't believe in what they even say publicly.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.920]  We just got to expose it.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:37.920]  That's the name of the game.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.920]  Get it on video.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920]  Release the video and outrage.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.720]  Well, James, you just dropped a bombshell and I'm talking to some of the folks today.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:48.400]  We've had multiple people contact us that are in the media and who are more libertarian
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.000]  but seen as liberal.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.800]  And they're saying, listen, we're at newspapers, we're at major firms, we're at major meetings
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:02.520]  with people planning to go to Cleveland with the Info Wars, make America white again.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.040]  They're also planning dirty tricks.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.640]  But they're trying to figure out how to do it and coordinate with Black Lives Matter
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.960]  that it's a false flag.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.520]  So they're scared to get beat up.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.520]  But it's stuff like that.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.920]  That's the type of intel you've got.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:21.960]  Well, no, we actually have people who've been working since January, building relationships
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.080]  with some of these high profile, I call them operatives, people behind the scenes.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080]  Oh, wow.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.680]  So you've actually penetrated into the people that are being run by the White House of Soros,
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680]  some of the actual minions.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.680]  Yeah.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.840]  When one of our people got burned in the process, we still have a few of them, half a dozen of
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:42.240]  them that have relationships with some of these operatives and they're on video describing
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.160]  what they're going to do.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.160]  And we have meetings this week with these other operatives.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.680]  I want to just ask you, why not let them come out and do it?
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.560]  I mean, no, that's kind of aiding the crime.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.920]  I guess we can't do that.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.360]  But then let them come out and do it and then let them blame it on us and then show it was
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360]  really them.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  Isn't that more powerful?
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.360]  But that's a moral dilemma.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  I think that's a very good idea, Alex.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.240]  I think you, I mean, as long as it's not, if they say we're going to bomb the place,
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.000]  I'd have to, I'd have to, obviously, I'd have to tell whoever it is, but if they say we're
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.480]  going to do this activity and make it look authentic, which is what they've been saying,
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:16.480]  we have this on video, I'm holding on to this and they're still planning for the convention
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.480]  next week.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.760]  My, there are meetings taking place, you know, over the weekend about what they're going
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  to do.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.760]  So that's what I'm doing.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.600]  And I'll be sure to report back to you and your audience about what I find.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.600]  Well, thank you.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.680]  I got to say about five, six years ago, there was stuff at Breitbart being written about
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.680]  Democrats and mall off cocktails and stuff.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.320]  And I kind of, you know, thought it was exaggerated or the FBI might have set them up.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.160]  But now in retrospect, looking at it and researching it more, no, this is the left is really this
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.860]  violent and really being directed by the establishment.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.360]  I think it's a major miscalculation.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.280]  It is a major miscalculation, but let's, let's, and that's their Achilles heel.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:56.160]  That's, that's their Achilles is a miscalculation for the attorney general to meet on an airplane
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.480]  with the former president, who's the husband of the nominee.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.640]  It's a huge miscalculation, but it doesn't mean anything unless we get on.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640]  Sure.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.880]  Is it arrogance or is it ignorance?
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.200]  I mean, what is it on average?
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.120]  I mean, that's a study in human nature, but I think it's, they think they can get on
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  it away with it.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.880]  It's really comes down to the fact they think that they will get away with it because people
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.360]  are too afraid to do anything about it.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.600]  And that's where people like you and I have to tape it.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.600]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.600]  I think, I mean, you're smarter than I am at a lot of those James O'Keefe project,
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.600]  veritas.com.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.600]  Let's get his book there.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:35.120]  Blueprints how to do all this safely in the best way, but I mean, maybe blow their cover
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.480]  right before they do it.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.800]  And then on some of the stuff blow it after that'll be even bigger, but I can't wait
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.800]  to see it.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]  I'm going to be there.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.800]  I know you're going to be there as well.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.800]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.800]  Project Veritas.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800]  I'm Alex Jones in full wars.com.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]  Big news.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]  Straight ahead.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.480]  We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:03.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network is George Clooney ready for his panic room.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.800]  Clooney's been a proponent of open borders and unlimited immigration, but now the chickens
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.240]  have come to his home to roost.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.520]  Clooney's $11 million Italian mansion is in a favorite vacation spot of the rich and
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.520]  famous.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:21.640]  Barbara Streisand, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Brad and Angelina, Madonna and other A-list
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.640]  liberals have all enjoyed champagne wishes and caviar dreams here.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.680]  But now the place is overrun with migrants.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:33.280]  As one resident said, a small number of immigrants is not a problem, but there's simply too many
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.280]  of them.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.160]  They're not poor, hungry refugees.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.640]  They're big and strong.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:41.520]  Clooney's building a fireproof, bombproof, attack resistant panic room.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.880]  The problem is Clooney's panic room is at one of his other mansions in the UK, so he
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.160]  may have to be ready to bug out in his own private jet.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.320]  Such are the problems, so the one percent.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:56.120]  Run away with the rich and famous.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.120]  GrandpaWars.com.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.120]  I'm David Knight.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:12.720]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.440]  I get in here at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.440]  to make it.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.360]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of Brain Force
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.360]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.960]  just kind of clears up.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:31.560]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why, third
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:36.320]  party, Neuphrocytical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.720]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.680]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680]  it without Brain Force.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.640]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.000]  Force and came in.

[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.600]  The day of rage all across the country tomorrow.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:28.600]  Social justice warriors, socialists, communists running around with their red flags,
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:32.600]  spewing anti-white racism, most of them white.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600]  It's all part of the dialectic of control.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:44.600]  Total and complete manipulation, hypocrisy on steroids.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.600]  Matt Damon of course is called for immediate gun ban.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.600]  That's the headline in the Daily Mail.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600]  He actually called for his banning guns.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600]  See, they're more honest now.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  New York Times.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.600]  New York Times killed Donald Trump.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.600]  Okay, you know, he's allowed to say that.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600]  They're allowed to say that.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  All these other publications coming out.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600]  Rolling Stone.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  And then Matt Damon, who isn't a bad actor.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  I don't even dislike the guy.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600]  I don't want to dislike him.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.600]  But he's such a fraud with bodyguards and armed bodyguards.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600]  I'll tell you what, I like to kill on a rave, man.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.600]  He is pro-gun.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.600]  Amazing at the range.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.600]  Knows his stuff super smart.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600]  Doesn't talk to the media.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600]  Nobody knows what he thinks.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600]  The media says he's dumb because he won't talk to him.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.600]  Well,
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.600]  I ought to try to get a hold of him on a rave sometime because
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.600]  he was in the movie, A Scanner Darkly.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600]  And I could sold him on it and I was in it.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600]  I got to know him pretty good.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600]  And then he opened up some.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.600]  And he was just super smart.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.600]  What?
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.600]  He got some incredible motorcycles too.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.600]  But let's just say,
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  he's kind of like a modern Steve McQueen,
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600]  but nobody knows it.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600]  Motorcycles, guns, whole nine yards.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600]  But I mean, pretty wild stuff.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  Steve McQueen riding, you know,
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600]  winning races and off-road stuff.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600]  Back before they had dirt bikes, remember all that?
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600]  That kind of stuff.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600]  But notice, you don't hear him shooting his mouth off
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]  against the Second Amendment, do you?
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.600]  He's made so much of his money in movies with guns.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600]  He's not an hypocrite.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600]  But Matt Damon.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600]  Matt Damon is a whole other bird.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600]  In fact, I'm going to stop with the
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600]  Keanu Reeves stuff.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600]  I'm not pursued Hollywood.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  I'm not pursued people in Hollywood.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600]  But I kind of look back and wish
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  I would have a little more with Keanu Reeves
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  because he's a really interesting guy.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  I know over the years, he got more of my films
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.600]  and stuff and his assistant would reach out
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  and invited me out there.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  I went out to L.A. and I said,
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.600]  I wouldn't let him do that.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600]  I'm not going to let him do that.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600]  He invited me out there, but I went out to L.A.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.600]  and I said, I wouldn't let him do that.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600]  I mean, I got to tell you, I really like Kurt Russell.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.600]  I mean, to learn that he says,
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600]  I'm not liberal, I'm not conservative.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.600]  I'm 1776, pro-gun, pro-Americana.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.600]  We need to bring Americana back.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600]  It's the greatest system in the world.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.600]  And that's why it's under attack today
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600]  by the controlled left and the controlled right.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.600]  Wow, I love Kurt Russell.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  Isn't it great? He's a patriot.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600]  See, I don't want to talk bad about Matt Damon.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.600]  I don't talk about people I like.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600]  It's just incredible
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600]  for what he's done
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600]  and what he stood for
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600]  and the amount of films he's produced
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.600]  and just everything.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  It's just how old he is.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.600]  It's still just an example of a real man.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.600]  Of course, he's a Michael Savage listener.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600]  Been on the show.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600]  See, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.600]  Thank God we're not like
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600]  these people, Matt Damon.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.600]  Matt Damon.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.600]  The guy is a nightmare on every issue.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600]  He's so horrible.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600]  He spews whatever the establishment wants
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600]  and they just keep giving him the big rolls.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.600]  Let me tell you,
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600]  there's very few people in Hollywood
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600]  that have got the clout like a Clint Eastwood
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.600]  to be able to say and do what they want
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  and not be attacked.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600]  Kurt Russell had a lot of courage when he came out.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600]  They blackball you. They come after you.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600]  I had. I don't mean to go off on this jack,
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  but he's a pretty big Hollywood producer.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600]  He's put out some of the biggest movies
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600]  and been married to one of the most
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.600]  beautiful stars and produced
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.600]  a whole bunch of big TV shows,
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600]  HBO, U-Name, and I mean top shows.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600]  Shows I actually watch
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600]  or have watched.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  And he was pretty much
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  just inviting me out to LA.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600]  He said, listen, yeah, the secret society,
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600]  the Abe Lincoln Society,
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600]  he's been kind of broken up.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.600]  And
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.600]  but he said, you know, it's still there.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600]  There's a lot of good folks out in Hollywood
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600]  who want to meet with you, you know,
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600]  if you ever want to come out there
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600]  or come down to Houston.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600]  And I said, yeah, I'm just so busy.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.600]  Man and these guns here, but I'd love to go out
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.600]  and talk about some projects or something.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.600]  And I said, so it's really that bad.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600]  He was like, oh, yeah.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.600]  I mean, they're surveilling us and they know
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  when we meet.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600]  60 years ago, communists had to meet in secret
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600]  conservatives
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  beyond Tom Selleck.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600]  Some of the biggest names folks go in
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.600]  secret meetings, 30, 40 people.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  And then Hollywood has
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  infiltrators that go in and report it
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600]  to the big bosses.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  And then you don't get your project done.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  And then this guy's a big producer.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600]  I was flattered he came here to see me.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  I mean, it's like so much of stuff.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  I don't watch a lot of TV or movies.
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  It was like go down the list.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  It's like, wow, you know,
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  to actually meet the people behind it.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  It's just to know I'm in a country
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  where there's secret societies
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  for conservatives.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  And all conservative means is
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  you don't want to turn your guns in.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600]  You don't hate America.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.600]  You believe in free market.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  You call these people 50 years ago liberals.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  What they call conservatives today are guys
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.600]  that don't hate America
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.600]  and who are married to a Buddhist.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  I mean, you know,
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.600]  and then they're not even against gay marriage.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.600]  It's like that has to meet in secret
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.600]  in Hollywood.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  The pedophiles don't though.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600]  Let me tell you, it isn't liberal folks.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:44.600]  And they want control of this culture
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600]  and they've got an agenda and they like screwing stuff up.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600]  And that's why nothing makes sense
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.600]  and why everything's upside down and why.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  There's all these entitled people
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.600]  running around with, you know,
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.600]  complaining about everything
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600]  and saying, I'm a victim.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.600]  They're like babies.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.600]  They're like toddlers.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.600]  Paul Watson did that analysis.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  Six times more likely to steal.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  Many more times likely to not give to charity.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600]  That's the modern liberal.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.600]  They're not liberal.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.600]  They want to tell real open-hearted good people
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.600]  that we're bad because they know it works on us
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600]  and we'll try to cozy up and make them feel better
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.600]  like we're their mommy.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  I'm not your mommy.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.600]  I'm done.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.600]  I remember driving out of here that afternoon
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  and I was just like leaving work and I'm just like,
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.600]  it's bizarre to have a big, big producer here.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600]  And I've had so many of those bizarro meetings
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600]  over the years.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600]  I don't even have those anymore.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.600]  The guy came here and it's just surreal
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600]  that our country is in that much trouble
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  and then Hillary Clinton can have her goons
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  at public unity rallies with Bernie supporters.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.600]  This is what it's built as.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  Pull down Bernie signs and attack free speech
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.600]  and attack Bernie supporters after you stole their votes.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600]  Was this guy a jihadi or something?
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600]  You don't let that woman have speech.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.600]  Give that man a medal.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.600]  That's probably jihadi in a suit, you know.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  Keep it a little poor socialist.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  And then the women getting up on it.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.600]  What are you doing? They're going after a woman.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  Yeah, where's the men around there
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.600]  to smack that guy right in the nose?
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.600]  How does that feel, punk?
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.600]  Put your nose back together now.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  You just grabbed a woman.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.600]  Oh no, Corey Lewandowski, he didn't do that.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.600]  That guy just grabs her and rips it out of her hands.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.600]  But it's okay because it's Hillary.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.600]  It's fellow women.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.600]  When she's not overthrowing moderate Muslim countries
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.600]  and bringing in the hordes of hell,
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  the hordes of hell finance her.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.600]  She's got the whole Muslim caliphate
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.600]  wired up.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600]  That woman's a puppet.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.600]  They got their arm right up there running that show.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.600]  But it's okay because Matt Damon,
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.600]  Matt Damon, he calls for immediate...
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  I always love how they have the desperate sounding,
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.600]  oh, we care so much.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.600]  I call for immediate.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.600]  And then George Clooney with all his bodyguards
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  and palaces as they're taking one refugee in
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.600]  is up there in Europe giving a speech
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.600]  and he's fopping around.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.600]  This is Trump's evil.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.600]  What's my lines?
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.600]  Bad man.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.600]  No, it's going to happen.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600]  You're so intellectual.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:51.600]  I want to hear from Bernie supporters.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  I want to hear...
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  You can call in and say whatever you want.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.600]  I'm not going to censor your calls.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:00.600]  And if you want to make it about me
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.600]  and about how capitalism is evil and everything,
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.600]  that's fine.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  But I actually want to reach out to you,
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.600]  not in a butt-kissing way.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.600]  Because you've already been robbed.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:13.600]  You've been screwed over.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.600]  I told you that was going to happen.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.600]  And if you're planning to vote for Hillary,
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  I think you are one of the biggest morons on the planet.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.600]  How could you vote for her when the big banks are behind her,
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.600]  the corrupt elements of Wall Street,
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  foreign governments, the communist Chinese,
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.600]  12 different Gulf states?
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.600]  I mean, can you imagine if Donald Trump was financed
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.600]  by Gulf states, 20% of his campaign,
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.600]  that literally chop homosexuals' heads off?
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:53.600]  How fast that little Bernie fad blowover dodo's
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.600]  got conned by the old con man.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.600]  Never worked a day in his life.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.600]  Fix was in on you the whole time.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:09.600]  Now he says Hillary represents everything that's wonderful and good.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600]  Matt Damon called for...
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.600]  Matt Damon called for a ban on guns in, quote,
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.600]  one fell swoop.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.600]  You ever thought about what will happen?
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.600]  I think he probably has.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.600]  They've gone from saying, we don't want your guns.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.600]  Just let us register them.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.600]  Say, yeah, we're going to take all your guns.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.600]  We got camps ready.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.600]  We're ready for a war with you.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.600]  Matt Damon called for a ban on guns in one fell swoop
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.600]  while promoting his newborn film in Australia.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.600]  No irony, just running around machine gunning
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  and killing the whole time.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.600]  The 45-year-old actor also said he admired the way
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.600]  Australia passed gun laws.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.600]  Just 12 days after the 96-port author massacre,
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:57.600]  that was staged.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.600]  Total hypocrite.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.600]  Lena Dunham, whoever she is.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600]  Just look at the self-importance on her face
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.600]  for your TV viewer.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.600]  Calls for altering of gun toning Jason Bourne subway ads.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  How about we stick stickers on their saying,
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.600]  hypocrite, I'm protected by bodyguards, infowars.com.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.600]  How about some of our listeners go to that?
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.600]  Get aggressive with these people.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:25.600]  Oh, no, they're putting flowers in his hands instead of a gun.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  Because the image of a human defending themselves is evil.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600]  No, these are tyrants conquering us,
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.600]  and they want to make that idea in your psyche,
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.600]  anathema, they want you domesticated.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:42.600]  It'd be like breeding legless, eyeless, toothless gerbils
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.600]  to feed to a boa constrictor.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.600]  Now, a boa wants a little bit of struggle.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600]  So does a cat, or it eats something.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600]  But you know, not these globalists.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  They want you, well, they want you to have eyes,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.600]  those of you who can be horrified when they
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]  metaphysically suck you dry.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600]  So I guess no arms, no legs, no teeth.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600]  And you're just like, ooh, ooh.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600]  And then, and then here comes,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.600]  here comes one of these, you know,
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.600]  domestication vampires.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.600]  Or she's more of a Renfield handler.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.600]  And she's like, just turn those in.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:17.600]  We're going to take real good care of you cupcake.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:21.600]  Matt Damon talks gun control ahead of born release.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.600]  No, Matt Damon.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:27.600]  Meanwhile, it's all part of a World Government UN plan
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.600]  created by our own government and the robber barons
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.600]  to disarm our nation finally and have us under
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  a one-world government ending with the citizens
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.600]  and the police being disarmed.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:45.600]  Only special UN tactical units in every area.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  This is the official plan, we're allowed to be, have guns.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.600]  And now it's all over the news on infowars.com,
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.600]  Black Lives Matter, saying there's a new
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:57.600]  Black Lives Matter support group of white people
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:03.600]  that says disarm the police now.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.600]  You know, I didn't want to militarize the police.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.600]  I knew they were cooking up the Civil War America scenario.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600]  I tried to stop all that.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.600]  But now that they brought the drug cartels in,
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600]  now that they've engaged in all this,
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:22.600]  it's like the, one of the leaders in West Texas was a,
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.600]  it was a county judge, the head of the County City Council.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.600]  He came out a few years ago and said we need armored vehicles
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.600]  to fight Obama when he comes to confiscate the guns.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.600]  Was that love it?
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.600]  So we've got all that unfolding.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.600]  But I want to take your phone calls right through
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.600]  to the end of the next hour, starting in the next segment,
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:47.600]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.600]  If you're a Bernie supporter and I'm screening your calls
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:53.600]  here on air, which means I'm going to get a little angry
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.600]  if it's a joke or a side issue.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  I mean, I really want to hear from Bernie supporters.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  There's two different topics, okay?
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  I usually have the open, most free-for-all show you can imagine.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.600]  But I sometimes want to actually hear from you on a certain topic.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:10.600]  And what do you think of the leak that it's supposedly Mike Pence?
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.600]  And it looks like it's leaking out of Fox News
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.600]  because they already have interviews with him scheduled tomorrow
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.600]  to roll call into a bunch of other places there at the Hill.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.600]  So what do you think about that if it's true?
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.600]  I'm glad it's not new again, Rich.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.600]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:41.600]  But hey, do I get another apology from the thousands of publications
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.600]  that said I was insane and I believe there's a plan to get our guns
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.600]  when it's all on paper?
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.600]  And I have all these senators saying it on video
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.600]  and a handgun control incorporated saying it doesn't matter
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  what Mr. Jones does with his rallies.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600]  We have your children in the public schools
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  and we are indoctrinating them and we will get your guns.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  That's what the head of the Violence Policy Center,
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.600]  a.k.a. Handgun Control Incorporated said in the front page
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.600]  of the metro and state in 2000
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.600]  when I caught bribery down at the Capitol
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:14.600]  and blew a bunch of their bills sky high.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.600]  I caught it on video by the grace of God.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600]  And that's why we're going to bring them down
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.600]  because they're a bunch of arrogant scum
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.600]  and we're going to keep catching them.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  But he actually said we got your kids.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600]  We got your kids.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600]  We got your kids.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.600]  And the reason they got our kids is we put them in these systems
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.600]  and these day camps and these systems.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  We pay for these worthless college degrees
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:42.600]  to turn out a bunch of brain damaged idiots.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.600]  Now let's go out to break with Matt Damon.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.600]  Matt Damon, here he is.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.600]  And gun control, for example.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.600]  How much do you think that's a debate that's coming up?
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.600]  It's really just...
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.600]  You know, it's...
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  You guys did it here in one fell swoop
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.600]  and I wish that could happen in my country.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.600]  But it's not...
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.600]  It's such a personal issue for people
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.600]  that we don't...
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.600]  We cannot talk about it sensibly.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  We just can't.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.600]  Sensible.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  It gets people get so emotional and so that...
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600]  That's enough.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.600]  I'm going to play him later.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600]  One fell swoop.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:19.600]  New York Times.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:20.600]  Rolling Stone.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  Time to repeal it.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:22.600]  LA Times.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  Time to repeal.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]  The White House.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.600]  All admitting that's your plan.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.600]  But we're crazy.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:28.600]  We're just not being reasonable.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600]  Because we just want a big shadow government
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:31.600]  to have all the weapons.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.600]  That's a great idea.
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  Don't forget.
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:34.600]  I barely have been plugging this.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  Man, this is the last day to get upwards of 40...
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.600]  Up to 40% off on all the storable foods

[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:45.600]  You need to be independent.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  And 10% off on all the nutraceuticals across the board.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.600]  And 25% off DNA force.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:50.600]  The incredible...
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.600]  I mean the ultimate nutraceutical.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  It really is the most powerful formula
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.600]  for detoxifying the cells.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.600]  Nerve growth regeneration.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.600]  This is it.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.600]  This is it.

[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:25.600]  And look, when I was growing up or even in college,
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  I was, quote, conservative on guns and things,
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  but I'm attracted to what you'd call classical liberal society, art,
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.600]  literature, openness, cultural freedom.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.600]  I know there are real liberals out there,
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  but they have been inducted into a cult that tells them what type of language
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.600]  to use, to be guilty, to, like, live in a cult.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:51.600]  It's classic cult programming.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:55.600]  And it's intensifying, and I just want to ask Bernie Sanders supporters,
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  how could you not vote for Trump?
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.600]  He's way more populist.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.600]  The whole power structure hates him.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:11.600]  You know all that racist stuff is just used as a political weapon?
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.600]  But do you really just want to feel like you're behind a winner?
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.600]  Can you admit you've been lied to?
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:26.600]  I mean, if Trump did one-tenth of what Hillary was doing, I wouldn't support him.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.600]  I mean, Hillary stole at least 10 states.
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:40.600]  He should be the nominee just for the integrity of our elections.
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.600]  But you know, you want to be domesticated.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.600]  You want to be taken care of.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.600]  And the biggest chumps out there are always collectivists.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.600]  So I guess you're just acting like you historically are supposed to.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:54.600]  We're going to go to Michael, and then James, and Dustin, and Robert, and others.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.600]  The toll-free number is 800-25-99-231.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.600]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam, next hour.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:00.600]  I want to call her in just a moment.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.600]  Please don't forget, and by the way, this is a scare tactic.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.600]  I personally am getting more storable food, medical supplies.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  I'm getting my firearms in order.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  I'm getting, you name it, I'm getting prepared because we've gone from the possibility
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.600]  of collapse to a probability to a near certainty.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.600]  It's already happening all over the world.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.600]  The Chinese president ordered people's liberation army to prepare for combat
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.600]  and war with the U.S.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  Putin's warning the West.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.600]  Our government's bringing in massive numbers of jihadis into the nation.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.600]  They're trying to kick off a civil war.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.600]  They're trying to kick off civil unrest.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  The elites are stockpiling food.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.600]  And in going to armoured redoubts, you need to get storable food.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.600]  Patriots need to be prepared.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  You need to plant a garden.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  You need to know how to use a firearm.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:50.600]  And you need high-quality food that's fresh, last 25 years, and is the best deal out there.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:52.600]  That's why it's our sponsor, my Patriot supply.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.600]  And I just said, hey, I just want a private label.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  You're in the entire food line.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.600]  I'll sell your food right next to an info store at the lowest price.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  The only way I could go lower was a private label it.
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.600]  That's how you usually get 10% even below their lowest prices, and then they're the best.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:13.600]  Well, now you get 40% off on a wide spectrum of their food
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:14.600]  and at least 20%.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.600]  You cannot beat these deals.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.600]  They end today.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:18.600]  I've extended it.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:19.600]  It's supposed to be a three-day sale.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.600]  It's been almost two weeks.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  A lot of the stuff that was on sale, we can't do that anymore,
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.600]  because it's either sold out or I can't violate contracts with suppliers.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:34.600]  So infowarstore.com, and it's helping fund the operation of people are responding
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.600]  because you can see the writing on the wall.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.600]  I mean, let's just hope we don't need to use this.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  Let's just hope you can give it to charity or, you know,
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.600]  use it when you're camping or whatever down the road.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.600]  But whether it's a month's supply or six months or a year, they got specialty diets,
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:50.600]  it is upwards of, well, some of it is 40%.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.600]  But 20 to 40% off depending on what you order, infowarstore.com is where you can get
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.600]  DNA force 25% off.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.600]  We hardly ever do that.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.600]  It is such an amazing nutraceutical research DNA force.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.600]  But 10% off on all the nutraceuticals and then that ends tonight.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.600]  The DNA force, we're going to extend through part of next week
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.600]  unless we sell out, which it looks like.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  I mean, I actually do it by Tuesday at current sales rates.
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  It's just so expensive to produce.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.600]  I just never make enough of it and it's hard to source.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.600]  So I never get over that hump where I've got enough to be sure I can make enough
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:28.600]  because then I can't, people that run businesses know how it is.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  And that's how we fund this infowar is a business model.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.600]  But our business is defeating the globalist.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.600]  We're having some success, but we're going to come back in 70 seconds,
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.600]  go directly to your phone, call, stay with us 30 hours.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:59:08.600]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:16.600]  This is the first time we've seen the number of people selling
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:18.600]  and producing electricity from the sun.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.600]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.600]  intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:25.600]  like the rest of the sheep.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:28.600]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.600]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.600]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.600]  in addition to the low price for info wars listeners.
[01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:43.600]  Go to gridwars.com, it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:44.600]  with minimum money.
[01:59:44.600 --> 02:00:10.600]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:42.600]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:45.600]  All right, we're going to go to Michael in Florida, a Bernie supporter.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.600]  James in Texas is a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.600]  Dustin, let's talk about the VIP leak, which is a big deal.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:52.600]  So this is a leak.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.600]  This is a leak.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:57.600]  Trump had a whole plan to roll this out tomorrow.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.600]  And this is RNC's suicide crap.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  The word is, this is out of Fox News.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.600]  That's not from Roger, but I concurred with him on it.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.600]  Or we talked to him, we'll stop there.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.600]  To the hill.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.600]  And this is so they can steal the thunder and not let Trump roll it out.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.600]  But we'll see.
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:21.600]  But I'm digressing.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.600]  We're going to also go to Robert in California and Jonathan and others.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.600]  But right now let's go to Michael in Florida, Bernie supporter.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.600]  So are you going to support Trump or are you going to support Hillary?
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.600]  I'm going to support Hillary.
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  Okay, can you tell us why?
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:47.600]  Oh yeah, because Donald Trump wants to torture terrorists, right?
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.600]  Well, here in Clay County, Florida, what the cops did,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:54.600]  they maced somebody, Daniel Linson Bigler,
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.600]  and they put a bag over his head and strapped him in a chair until he died.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.600]  And nobody was held accountable.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:04.600]  And that's a violation of our Eighth Amendment right.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.600]  There's no cruel or unusual punishment.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:11.600]  And we might as well not even have a jury if they can just take innocent Americans,
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.600]  say they're defiant, mace them, put a bag over their head,
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:18.600]  strap them in a chair until they die.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:19.600]  Let me talk now.
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:20.600]  Let me talk.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.600]  You said that twice now.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.600]  I think this is a very cogent argument against Donald Trump you brought up
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:31.600]  and is one of the only ones that is, I think, a serious concern.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.600]  Now you've welded it in to local police and I actually know about that case.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  Some of these restraint chairs, a bag over the head, people suffocating.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.600]  Yeah, that looks like very sadistic, crazy behavior,
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:46.600]  and sometimes really bad status get off.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  And it's wrong that the issue is statistically, though, it's very rare.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.600]  I'm not defending it.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.600]  And the globalists that are literally the equivalent of, you know,
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  just the black plague, you know, the end of the world type stuff,
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.600]  I don't use the space alien analogy because people think I'm too serious about that,
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.600]  but they're out to get us, okay?
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.600]  That's the big mass number.
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  That's what's going on.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.600]  And they divert us with all this.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.600]  And so Hillary and Bernie pay lip service to this Black Lives Matter thing
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:20.600]  that is a concern about police brutality that a lot of white folks,
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.600]  everybody else have concerns about.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.600]  And then it's projected onto that because Trump wants to act tough,
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:30.600]  knows they're already waterboarding people, kind of refreshing, he's honest about it,
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.600]  and says, you know, let's waterboard ISIS.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  I get the mission creep, and now we waterboard everybody.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  I'm against torture.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.600]  And I think we lose the moral high ground.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.600]  I think Trump is wrong on that point.
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  And if I ever interview him again, I think I'll raise that point.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.600]  Or if I talk to him next week, the point is, is that, and he's backed off of it some.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:51.600]  Don't you see how the whole power structure is against him, though?
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.600]  So, I mean, I mean, doesn't that outweigh, I mean, you know, Hillary,
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:59.600]  talk about torture, she puts, let's humanize the hundreds of thousands of Christians
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:01.600]  murdered by bloodthirsty ISIS.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.600]  You know, I understand some cops killed somebody.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:07.600]  Now let's put the hundreds of thousands of dead Christians, she basically backed.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  Does that touch your heartstrings at all, or just hit them on the radar string?
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.600]  Well, it's not about a bad cop.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:20.600]  It's about a policy that gives them the authority to take innocent American citizens,
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.600]  say they were defiant, which is arbitrary,
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:28.600]  nace them, put a bag over their head, and strap them in a chair until they die.
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:31.600]  And the Eighth Amendment clearly says...
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:32.600]  Okay, okay, you're not listening to me.
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:34.600]  You didn't see, you didn't, you didn't respond.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:40.600]  I intellectually responded to what you said, and actually listened to what you said,
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.600]  and then you just boom, went right back to talk point.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  And I understand it, at that level, you were correct.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:50.600]  We're talking about a very complex world, big issues here.
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:55.600]  Donald Trump isn't going to try to legalize torture of American citizens here in the U.S.
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:58.600]  And by the way, it's already going on, just so you know.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:28.600]  But now the place is overrun with migrants.
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:33.600]  As one resident said, a small number of immigrants is not a problem, but there's simply too many of them.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.600]  They're not poor, hungry refugees. They're big and strong.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.600]  But Clooney's building a fireproof, bombproof, attack-resistant panic room.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:46.600]  The problem is, Clooney's panic room is at one of his other mansions in the U.K.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:49.600]  So he may have to be ready to bug out in his own private jet.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.600]  Such are the problems, so the 1%.
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:55.600]  Get away with the rich and famous.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:24.600]  GrandpaWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.600]  I'm David Knight.
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:04.600]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:08.600]  while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:15.600]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:20.600]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.600]  because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:28.600]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:34.600]  Listeners have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:38.600]  Just go to InfoWars.com, select your favorite product or products.

[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:49.600]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWars.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.600]  10% off on AutoShip. Win, win, win at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.600]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:16.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:20.600]  Well, this is going to be interesting. Make no mistake.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:34.600]  Trump is supposedly going to announce Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, tomorrow at 11 a.m. Eastern.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:36.600]  We've got Roger Stone coming on to talk about it tomorrow.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:42.600]  I talked to Stone, Nico Diddy relayed the message, and I'm not going to relay all of it here.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:46.600]  It's part of his private, but just that this is definitely a leak.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:48.600]  This is not Trump.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:55.600]  And somebody's going to get in trouble for this and that he's not going to talk about it until tomorrow.
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:01.600]  So that's what's going on on that front.
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:10.600]  Probably Fox News where interviews are being set up and things is probably where this got leaked to roll call.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.600]  I got that from another source, but that's obviously not the issue.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  Do you like Mike Pence? Obviously a lot better than Newt Gennrich, but that's just a no-brainer.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.600]  It better not be Newt Gennrich.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:40.600]  We're going to go to James, Dustin, Robert, Jonah, and others here in just a moment.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:48.600]  If you just tuned in, we had a caller just a few minutes ago who was saying,
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:56.600]  look, I don't like Trump because he says he wants to waterboard ISIS. And I said, I'm not for torture either.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.600]  But you know, Hillary is droning everybody.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  She overthrew all these countries.
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.600]  She put ISIS in to kill hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:10.600]  I mean, leftist regimes going to this level are going after free speech.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.600]  In my experience, leftist police departments are some of the most corrupt out there.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:21.600]  And if you cherry pick a few bad examples of the police, we have the statistics.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.600]  And then your whole worldview is, I'm going for Hillary because she's against the police is what he said.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.600]  Get bringing up corrupt police in some area of Florida.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  And people that die on these restraint shares.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:34.600]  Yes, it's horrible.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:41.600]  And I've seen the videos and we need to change the laws and not allow that to go on because they don't call it torture.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  See, it's all definitions, but let me explain something.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.600]  Under Obama, torture has been massively expanded.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  They don't call it that.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:11:03.600]  And they teach torture to the Navy SEALs and to the army forces and the rest of them to special forces.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.600]  Now they teach you it's a vision of torture or how to deal with it.
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  Later, you're told, no, this is how you torture somebody.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:19.600]  So it's time for all the big kids to grow up and understand why Trump is just telling you like it is.
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  Oh, they'll torture if I tell them to and we're going to torture them.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  It's actually sickeningly refreshing because I don't support the torture.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:30.600]  I understand overall it rocks your country.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.600]  But the fact that Trump would come out and say it is not to sell it.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.600]  He's being totally real with you.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  He thinks he could use the ring of Mordor selectively when he gave the authorization to sign torture warrants.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:53.600]  He's ready to sign those warrants to torture leaders of ISIS and Al Qaeda to stop them and not rain down supplies to him.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:55.600]  He's being real with you.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:03.600]  And even though I disagree with it, it's very refreshing, very refreshing to have somebody straight talk you.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.600]  And you can't handle that.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.600]  You can't handle that Hillary is the most bloodthirsty warmonger.
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.600]  You can imagine that the neocons and warmongers hate Trump because he plans to have peace through strength.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:21.600]  A real military, not fighters that cost a billion dollars and aren't as good as F-15s.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.600]  He said actually what he's planning.
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  People won't go read what he said.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  It makes a lot of sense.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:34.600]  We have half the global GDP of the military, half of the military spending is done by the U.S.
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:36.600]  or more.
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.600]  And let me tell you, they're building a bunch of crap.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.600]  It's weapons we built 30, 40 years ago that are winning wars today.
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  And the Russians aren't building junk.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.600]  They're building real weapons.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:52.600]  And they're not giving them to the communist Chinese.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.600]  We're giving what we got to the Chinese, which is insane.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.600]  Mark my words, China is who we're going to be facing in the future.
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:07.600]  But the globalists want to take Russia out because they aren't voluntarily lowering their population and committing suicide.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  Say what you want about Russia.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  They've turned the oxygen back on over there.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:13.600]  They're like, oh, 80 years of communism?
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.600]  I think we're going to trash something a little different now.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.600]  And everybody's like, oh, you're really so communist.
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.600]  You're so, oh, yeah.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  That's why Putin's arrested more than 10 oligarchs.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  And every time their Rothschild or Rockefeller fronts and the Rothschilds sued newspapers in England that said that and lost the lawsuit.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.600]  And the judge said, I am blown away.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.600]  Go read his ruling.
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.600]  He said, I cannot believe this.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  You sued these people and this case proved what they said and more.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  You are the shadow government in Russia.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:41.600]  And Putin's saying, hey, guess what?
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.600]  We're kicking your ass out of here.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  How you like that?
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  I want the big mega banks and the globalist off my back.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.600]  I want free market.
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:54.600]  I want a level playing field.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:57.600]  I want a shot at trying to have a good future.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:00.600]  I don't want to be racially played off against everyone.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:02.600]  Trump says he wants to unify people.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  But when you've got globalists and outsiders trying to tear the country apart, he's got to identify it.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  That's not division.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.600]  Trump is acting like a man.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:19.600]  And that's what they don't like because they say the age of men is over.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:24.600]  It's the age of the machines and the technocrat and the globalists and all this delusional garbage.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.600]  Well, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  I'm going to stop.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:30.600]  I apologize.
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:32.600]  I said I take a lot of calls, but I wanted to respond to that guy.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:33.600]  But I want to give you time on here.
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:34.600]  I got to get better at this.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:35.600]  I'm doing it.
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.600]  I'm skipping this break.
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:40.600]  And I'm going to take one call and just move to the next.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:42.600]  I'm not even going to defend my positions.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.600]  I just want to hear from you.
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  It's been home the longest here.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  Let's talk to Dustin in Florida.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  You're on the year on the VP leak.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:52.600]  Go ahead.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  It's nice to talk to you, Alex.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:03.600]  I just wanted to say that, you know, I look up to you as like a, you know, intelligence officer in a lot of ways socially and, you know, militarily.
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:15.600]  Well, the VP leak, obviously, you know, Mike Pence, the little bit of stuff I had to figure out was that he went to Hanover College School of Law.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.600]  So, you know, ultimately he's a lawyer.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:24.600]  I would like to see a military pick, you know, all his U.S. Army communications intelligence and.
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  I would like to see Flynn.
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:26.600]  I mean, Flynn's got real integrity.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:27.600]  You can just see it looking at him.
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:28.600]  He's a good man.
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  I went and looked at his history.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:32.600]  I didn't just go off how he looks, but I've watched a lot of his speeches.
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:33.600]  I've watched him.
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:34.600]  I've read some of his writings.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  He's very genuine.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.600]  Yes.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  Yes.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  You know, I agree with someone and this guy.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.600]  Mike Pence is just a lawyer, you know.
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.600]  So is Hillary Clinton, you know.
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:51.600]  You know, I why I don't vote for Trump is because why I wouldn't is because I know the system is rigged.
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:52.600]  I know it's absolutely.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:54.600]  We have got so many lawyers.
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  And again, I'm not against lawyers because you got to have a lawyer when you're fighting another lawyer.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:58.600]  But we got more lawyers.
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:00.600]  The whole planet basically combined.
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.600]  I saw that number a few years ago.
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:02.600]  We can check it.
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:04.600]  But we've got we're graduating more lawyers than anybody else in the world.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:05.600]  I know that.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.600]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.600]  It's like more of the whole Western world.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  We have more lawyers and it's just brand and they all just they can just twist things.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:12.600]  Exactly.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.600]  We don't need more lawyers.
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:20.600]  We need more doctors and more engineers and more scientists and yes, more women.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:24.600]  But I don't mean weirdo lawyer women from billionaire families.
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.600]  We need real patriot women and we need we do need quote minorities.
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.600]  But there's great smart libertarian people of every race, color and creed.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:38.600]  We need to break the paradigm of how they give us these false choices of establishment Republican Democrat.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.600]  How could someone not support Trump when he clearly has the establishment crapping their pants?
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  Sorry.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.600]  Exactly.
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:46.600]  Exactly.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:47.600]  I mean, I like Jeff Kaye.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:50.600]  I see him as a Jeff Kaye, but we all know what happened to Jeff Kaye.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:52.600]  I see Hillary Clinton as the whore Babylon.
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:57.600]  You know, she really is the mother of harlots and she rides in on a eight headed octahedded
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.600]  dragon.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.600]  You know, it's the big depiction, you know, in the Bible and she is the worst of the worst.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:03.600]  She is a killer of killers.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  I was a trained killer in the U.S. Army for infantry.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:07.600]  She scares me.
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:08.600]  She really does.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:13.600]  I mean, just how how just blatantly disregarded for life.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:16.600]  She constantly gets on TV and goes, I kill people, kill.
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  And I'm like, foreign governments like, whoa, nobody does that.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.600]  As you know, I mean, that is scary.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:24.600]  You're absolutely right.
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:25.600]  God bless you.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.600]  Great points.
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  I mean, I don't know what to say anymore.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.600]  I am.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:32.600]  I've never been more concerned for myself and my family in this country and people go, I'm
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  just worried about myself.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:34.600]  We're all connected.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.600]  That's why when they, liberals act like they have this monopoly on caring about people or
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.600]  monopoly on not being racist, they're the most race obsessed losers.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:48.600]  Because look, I remember when I was in high school, I had a bunch of jobs and I was somewhat
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.600]  competent, compared to most people that were 17 or 18, but I would get in my parents' business
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:55.600]  and say, I don't think you, I don't like that rug or why are you doing this?
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.600]  Everything upset me.
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:58.600]  You know, and it was like, there's time for you to move out.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:01.600]  This year's time for you to run your own life.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:05.100]  And as I got more and more stuff in my life, I'm less worried about what my neighbor's
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:06.100]  doing.
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.900]  I'm less worried about, hey, you run your own life.
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.400]  I got mine.
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:14.160]  And it's such an immature form of arrested development with these leftists.
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:15.160]  They're little kids.
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:17.600]  They want to run everybody else's life.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.600]  That's not liberal.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.000]  Libertarians don't want to run your life.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.600]  I don't like the right wing folks trying to run people's lives.
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:28.600]  It turns into the whole drug war and all these other frauds.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.100]  It's just, I'm Americana.
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:31.600]  Now, I want what Kurt Russell wants.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.300]  I want 1776.
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:34.700]  I want Americana.
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:36.000]  I want the free market system.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.700]  I want laissez-faire.
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:39.000]  This is not laissez-faire.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.900]  Too big to fail mega banks.
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:43.300]  That's crony capitalism holding its hostage.
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:47.000]  I want my country back right now.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.400]  And I'm not here to be told what language to use or how I'm a racist and I'm a bigot.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:53.500]  It doesn't make me guilty.
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:59.800]  It makes me angry because I know deep down inside what I stand for.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:01.900]  I'm so, I don't even call it prideful.
[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:02.900]  I am.
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:04.400]  I want people to succeed.
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.500]  And it's not like I convinced myself of that.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.200]  I just insulting.
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:15.200]  It is insulting to tell me because the color of my skin, what I feel and what I need to
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.600]  do and what I, all this crap.
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:24.200]  And it's insulting to everybody else who isn't part of this.
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.100]  What the media is creating is not reality.
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:29.300]  I know we all know that, but think about it.
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:33.200]  A bunch of young people and folks that are confused and can't get jobs and there's not
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:38.100]  really a future and it's all weird and the media is just all, just, you know, fight with
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:40.500]  each other and blah, blah, blah.
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:45.100]  You've got to go out in the world and make your bones and you don't go out and do that
[02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:49.400]  by being a good fisherman or a good hunter or a good basket weaver, talking about thousands
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:54.100]  of years ago or being, you know, a good person that comes up with medicines, a shaman or
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:55.100]  whatever.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:56.700]  You don't go out and have those traditional roles.
[02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:57.700]  They're all gone.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:01.700]  There's all this modern society and so you supposedly go out and you, you know, you go
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:05.200]  through the rites of passage through this or through that and we've had a lot of institutions,
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:10.500]  some good, some bad, but the old institutions were at least based on primitive human activity
[02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:11.900]  and the rites of passage.
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:16.100]  They're getting rid of the rites of passage and the new rite of passage is running around
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:21.000]  being racist, screaming and yelling and beating people up and not knowing you're the same
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.400]  thing as a KKK member.
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:30.840]  I don't know what it is about KKK members, but it's like fat, dumb, stupid, mindless idiots.
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.900]  I look at these black lives matter people.
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:38.100]  I mean, if you remove the pigment out of the skin, you got a KKK member.
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:41.400]  I mean, it's so annoying.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:44.500]  We're not getting to the stars, ladies and gentlemen, with this type of behavior.
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:46.400]  And a lot of folks go, well, I ride it all off.
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.400]  I don't care.
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:48.400]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.400]  Then blow your brains out.
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:51.400]  Seriously.
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:54.800]  Do you think the world's over and it's all crap and but you want to be politically involved?
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:59.300]  I love how they're always want to run everything, but then there's no future and blah, blah,
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:00.300]  blah.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:01.300]  No, there's a great future.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:04.000]  You just need to get out of the way or join the team.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.800]  And by the way, joining the team doesn't mean agreeing with me.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:12.600]  It's looking around the universe and understanding that what we're being hit with is synthetic,
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:14.840]  is non-natural and is meant to hurt you.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.160]  You know everything coming out of mainstream media is meant to make you absolutely dumber
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.640]  in the rock and sick and under their control.
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:23.640]  Why then?
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:28.440]  When the entire power structure is against Donald Trump and the entire power structure
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:33.100]  wants Hillary Clinton and the entire power structure is involved in all this.
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:36.100]  I mean, look at this gay black guy yelling another young black man.
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:40.600]  He's got his gay sticker on and he's saying Donald Trump doesn't like gays or black people
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.040]  and wants to ship blacks to Africa if your TV viewers on screen.
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:50.080]  Donald Trump was giving interviews to the advocate and gay publications and calling
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:54.040]  for equal rights for people 30 years ago.
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:57.240]  Donald Trump is trying to stop gays being thrown off cliffs.
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:02.040]  Hillary takes money from the very people that do it and is launching invasions for them.
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:08.280]  But it doesn't matter because this idiot, this arrested development giant fat toddler,
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.400]  nothing is fat people.
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.400]  I've been fat too.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:14.440]  Not all fat people, I'll be if people are smarter than anybody I know, but I'm saying
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:21.480]  this stereotype, it's a fat toddler baby going, I want something, you're not going
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:23.920]  to get anything from the robber barons.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.200]  Anything they give you is poison.
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:29.200]  This guy's a moron.
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:30.680]  God, I'm sick of this.
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:31.680]  Excuse me, Lord.
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:32.680]  Okay.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:33.680]  I'm going to your calls.
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:34.680]  I'm doing better here.
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:35.680]  I'm going to your calls.
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:37.880]  It's been holding the longest now.
[02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:44.520]  Riddle me this, James, and we'll go to others, James in Texas was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:45.520]  Where are you now?
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:46.520]  I'm in Texas, sir.
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:51.120]  No, I'm saying where are you, who are you supporting now?
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:53.840]  Oh, Donald Trump.
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:56.960]  So you really are a Bernie supporter and you really are supporting Trump now?
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:57.960]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.720]  Well, that makes a lot more sense to me.
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:01.040]  I mean, she stole your vote.
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:03.840]  I mean, give me your perspective.
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:11.520]  Well, I started to see what the DNC was doing, and yeah, they did steal all the Bernie Sanders
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:18.480]  votes in my mind, like it was completely rigged.
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.440]  And I was on the train for so long where the media, like I was watching the news at the
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:30.880]  time and the media kept playing bits and sound clips of Donald Trump and saying, oh, he's
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:31.880]  the racist.
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:34.120]  And I was like, oh man, this guy's a maniac.
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.640]  But then after I started noticing that they were stealing the election, I went and started
[02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:46.280]  watching full Donald Trump speeches and I started to realize I was like, he's not a racist
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:47.280]  at all.
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.080]  No, his trade speech was one of the greatest speeches ever given by a presidential candidate.
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.080]  It's just beautiful.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:57.160]  I mean, it was a declaration that we're getting up off our knees.
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:59.080]  The surrender is over.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:02.080]  I'm sick of watching this country surrender.
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.080]  Exactly.
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:09.800]  And then like my biggest problem here lately has been Bernie Sanders surrender to Hillary
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:10.800]  Clinton.
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:11.800]  Oh, I'm sick.
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:17.520]  People don't, I don't think a lot of people understand the utter devastation that that
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.880]  caused to so many young people and young voters.
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:22.880]  That's what she's all about.
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.400]  It's what she's all about.
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.400]  She's the most fascistic corporate wickedness.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:28.720]  She's not even a socialist.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:33.840]  The plan they cooked up with Obama, with Mitt Romney is a screw job for insurance companies
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.840]  to rob everyone.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:41.400]  I mean, Bernie Sanders to me is lower than Hillary Clinton because of what he did to
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:42.400]  young voters.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:49.880]  Like I myself, I'm 30, but to be to disillusion that many people at such a young age, I think
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:56.880]  was one of the most damaging things that any potential or any politician period has ever
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.600]  done to a younger generation of Americans.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:00.600]  Absolutely.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:01.600]  God bless you.
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:02.600]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:06.840]  And look, I get, I don't like Sanders the person because I know he's a fake and a fraud.
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:12.680]  And I know, but, but a lot of what he stood for on the surface, NAFTA and gap being a scam,
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:17.520]  big rich families being partially tax exempt, insider deals.
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:22.880]  Yeah, if you're going to let them have corporate socialism, then give it to the people.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.120]  Listen, if you're going to have QE unlimited, deliver the money to the grassroots.
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:29.560]  Look, if we're going to just print money, it's going to cause a problem down the road,
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:31.280]  but we can actually build some infrastructure.
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:35.160]  I'm not saying do that, but it's much more moral than letting the globalist have it all
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:37.240]  and then saddle us with the debt.
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.280]  Deliver money directly to poor people.
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:40.280]  Boom.
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:42.400]  Some of them are going to go drink themselves to death.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.920]  Others, people are going to actually help build themselves up, but that's not how economics
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:48.920]  works.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:54.200]  And you got to take it from somebody else and you're going to take it from yourself a few
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.880]  years down the road and your kids, because that money is going to be devalued, which
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.480]  is the same thing.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:03.040]  Everything comes back on you.
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:10.600]  And so all I know is everything's teetering on the edge of collapse.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.560]  All the elites are building, you know, bunkers and trauma rooms and helicopter escape pads.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.440]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:21.120]  And by the way, when I get around rich people and stuff, and I mean really rich people,
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.520]  they are like asking me what to do, that they're not, there's no more debating, okay?
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.280]  You notice everything we talk about now is pretty much just almost passe, right?
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:31.960]  That means victory for info wars.
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:41.840]  If we act on it, there is no doubt that Hillary is evil and will want to make you poor.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:44.040]  I don't completely trust Trump, okay?
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:46.880]  I'm not stupid.
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:51.160]  But the things he's saying are irrevocably damaging to the new world order.
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:56.640]  And physiologically, psychically, culturally, that's all money in the bank for Trump.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:59.360]  I mean, I'll just say it.
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:06.640]  I'm emotional once I've made my cold decisions about things, but I get a warm feeling in
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:11.560]  my chest when I think about what Donald Trump's doing, and I've never had that for Ron Paul
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:12.560]  or anybody else.
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:14.680]  I've admired Ron Paul, appreciate him, all the rest of it.
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:19.000]  I don't have an actual emotional feeling, and I'll tell you why it is.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.080]  I know how much danger Donald Trump's in, and I can tell you he's for real.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:25.080]  Here's the problem.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:27.560]  JFK was for real.
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:33.720]  They came to him with a plan, Ella Lemnister, Curtis LeMay, to sneak attack with hydrogen
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:40.400]  bombs Russia, and he fired them and freaked out, and then they had another plan.
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:44.240]  The deep state came in with a socialist plan that was already there going, oh, let's merge
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.280]  with Russia and bring in all this stuff, and then he did stuff like, well, I'm going to
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.280]  boss the Federal Reserve.
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:50.280]  I'm going to cut taxes with everybody.
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:51.280]  He was doing all sorts of stuff.
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:54.400]  He thought it was good, but he was being misguided.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.280]  I mean, just because Trump's a good guy and really smart doesn't mean he isn't going to
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:00.240]  get misguided or have weird stuff going.
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:01.400]  Look, we're not out of the park.
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:04.240]  I mean, we're not out of the woods here.
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.920]  We're not out of Mordor here.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:06.920]  We get Donald Trump elected.
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:09.680]  I just, it's the resistance.
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.680]  It's the struggle.
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:12.160]  It's the trying to do something.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:16.000]  It's the seeing somebody who I know they're afraid of, man, let me tell you, that's not
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.640]  a put on.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:23.920]  They are scared of Donald Trump, and he has been like a sleeper cell for decades against
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:24.920]  them.
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:26.800]  But really, he was always against naffeting yet.
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.880]  He wrote books about how they're screwing America over.
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.560]  He isn't out to get the country.
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:34.560]  That's it.
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:37.760]  Now, he could be bad.
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.960]  I couldn't imagine if I was president, even though I know a lot of things I can't imagine.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:43.640]  Such a crazy world.
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:44.640]  You do one thing.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:45.640]  You think it's going to do something.
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:46.640]  It does something completely different.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:48.960]  It just takes a lot of wisdom.
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:50.680]  I just know this, folks.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:51.680]  We can ask for your support.
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.040]  We can ask you to spread the word, because we're having huge effects.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:59.480]  I mean, this is the place that has the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to spreading
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:01.120]  the word.
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.080]  But bigger than that, I just ask you to pray for the broadcast, pray for us next week in
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:10.160]  Cleveland, and our crew going on to Philadelphia, David, and the rest of the crew after that.
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.040]  That's going to be a circus.
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.360]  And to pray for your own self and your own family, and even if you're not a Christian
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:19.520]  or religious, I think if you just open yourself up to the universe and God, because God's
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:23.240]  free will and just say, God, can you help me with discernment?
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:24.880]  Can you help me?
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:26.720]  God didn't like the devil.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:30.160]  Devil blows the doors off like Darth Vader and comes in.
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:31.280]  You got to ask God in.
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:34.000]  That's how God judges countries, too.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.720]  God just pulls back and lets evil come in.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.160]  Who says God didn't do any of it?
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:40.160]  We did all of it.
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.160]  None of it.
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:42.160]  You see how that works?
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.160]  Kind of a zen thought.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:49.400]  And then we'll be back with your call straight ahead on that little show.
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.680]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:53.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:56.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:30:02.480]  Be aware, but not there.
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:08.880]  The hacktivist group Anonymous is now calling for nationwide day of rage process on Friday,
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:14.320]  July 15th at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time in a city near you.
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:20.760]  The video by Anonymous does specify non-violence and denounces the actions taken against police
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:24.160]  officers who were not involved in these recent deaths.
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:29.720]  But with the tagline day of rage, it's safe to expect emotions to be running very high
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.600]  on both sides of the line.
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:36.680]  No matter how great your empathy might be for those who have unjustly lost their lives,
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:39.440]  these protests are not safe places to be.
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:45.320]  If your home is in or near a major metropolitan area, be aware that your city could be under
[02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:46.320]  siege.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:51.400]  Make plans to stay safe, hunker down with emergency food and purified water, or make
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:54.280]  plans for strategic relocation.
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:57.480]  This is Ashley Beckford with Infowars.com.
[02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:59.760]  Stay tuned for more special reports.
[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:02.160]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:03.560]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:05.280]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:09.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:14.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:15.560]  my system.
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:20.800]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:23.600]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:28.680]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:29.960]  going on everywhere.
[02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:30.960]  These are all parasites.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.680]  Tell us about that all of a sudden, there's so many things that are in it.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:34.920]  You have the neem in there.
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:38.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.280]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:42.280]  All right.
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:44.480]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:47.480]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfowarsLive.com.
[02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:48.480]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:51.320]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:54.600]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLive.com.
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:56.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:00.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:01.400]  Shower filters.
[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:02.840]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:06.920]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:11.800]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:16.400]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your
[02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:18.840]  skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:23.400]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com

[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:33.480]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:38.720]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:41.880]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:47.160]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:49.680]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.680]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:32:51.680 --> 02:33:01.000]  Secure your DNA force today at InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:30.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:35.400]  But largely, Hillary Clinton's comments here today, John, were based around the recent
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:41.800]  violence that we have seen, the police-involved shootings of black men in Minnesota, in Louisiana,
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:46.280]  and then the killing of white police officers by a black gunman in Dallas.
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:50.200]  That was really what she based her comments on around today.
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:54.640]  Remember, Hillary Clinton has some vulnerabilities herself, even as she calls for criminal justice
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:00.680]  reform because of her support in the 1990s for anti-crime legislation that ultimately
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:08.920]  helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration that she now speaks out again.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.640]  We just lost Breonna Keeler, who was in Springfield, Illinois, where Hillary Clinton just
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:14.640]  spoke.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:15.640]  You heard.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:17.280]  By the way, I want to hire Breonna Keeler.
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.760]  I want to hire her.
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:26.040]  She gets up there, look, the Clintons are the ones that got the laws changed and then
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:30.600]  made incredibly racist statements.
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:32.800]  I mean, everybody understands the numbers, right?
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:37.600]  Because, you know, it makes me sick when I go on Info Wars, and I see it everywhere in
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:42.840]  a lot of its bots, with all the racist comments towards black people, and because, you know,
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:46.480]  you have the racist black people, the racist bots, and they're making, you know, white
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:55.160]  devil's statements back, you do know that despite the fact that Africans were forcibly
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:59.080]  brought here and all the things that went on and happened, some cases just as horrible
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.600]  as you see in the movies, sometimes totally different stories, the point is it was much
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.120]  more diverse than that.
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.560]  You do understand that they ended up building a lot of industries and businesses and science
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:14.960]  and culture and art when they were being oppressed, that that's how it works.
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:21.800]  Prosperity makes men, prosperity makes monsters, as the French historian and politician scholar
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:26.760]  Victor Hugo said, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:35.120]  I'm not saying it's good, people are oppressed, I'm just saying that per capita scientific
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:43.840]  development, per capita founding universities and businesses and inventions and just revolutionizing
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:53.400]  machine work and I mean just all over the country, you would go to the black machinist
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:36:00.640]  and the black metal workers and you would go to them.
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.360]  And there was definitely racism and fights and crazy stuff going on and the Klam is like
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:08.880]  a mafia that would just kind of go around extorting everybody.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:11.880]  That was after it was first set up at the end of the Civil War when you had to cover
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.240]  the horses up and everything because there was northern occupation and then it was like
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:24.200]  a rebel force or whatever but then of course everything turns into something very corrupt.
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:30.840]  That's how all this works but it's so frustrating to actually know history and then to see government
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:35.400]  come in in the 50s and 60s with LBJ and I'm not going to quote him here all the racist
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:41.200]  quotes, they're well known, they're in letters, they're recorded, they're on record.
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:44.720]  You think the social engineers are dumb when they say we're going to give you enough money
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:50.000]  to live every month but you can't have a man in the house and by the way you have as many
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  kids as you can so you'd have a nation of children raising children to be beta tested
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  on by the government with everything from diseases to cultural brainwashing and now
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:16.160]  you see the weapon.
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.000]  That's sick.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.200]  That's something that aliens would come up with and I'm not saying they're really aliens,
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:25.400]  I just look at this and it's like we're all fighting with each other and it's real if
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.240]  you're a white person walking down the street in Dallas and three black guys jump out when
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:31.920]  you're 15 years old and try to kill you.
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.960]  I guarantee you there isn't probably one out of a million black people out there that
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:41.920]  has been physically attacked by white people as many times as I've been attacked by racist
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.560]  black people and I'm not some bleeding heart liberal.
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.840]  I am so glad that happened, I'm serious, I mean that because also Dallas is a violent
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:56.360]  place, one of the most violent places in the country, used to have more violence in Chicago
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:01.880]  and I was a free spirited person, I want to go off of these whole stories but if a small
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:08.440]  percentage of black males are racist and killing each other, it's tribalism, humans are tribal
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.840]  because you're wearing blue, you're wearing red, when I was in high school you better
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:15.920]  not wear a red shirt or a blue cap or something, I mean I'd be at a friend's house on the
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.120]  part of town and the police pull over to get up against the car, what are you doing wearing
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:20.600]  this blue baseball cap?
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:23.320]  What's a blue baseball cap man?
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:25.800]  Well that's a gang hat.
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.160]  Do I then hate police forever because of that?
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:34.140]  What I'm getting at here is, I'm going to your calls, there is psychological warfare
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:38.800]  going on, it's a fact and you can buy into it and then it seems real when you're under
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:46.960]  the mind control, it's mind control and there's real elements to the mind control but they're
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.280]  shocking you, shocking you, shocking you Pavlovianly to control you and I'm telling you right now
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:59.720]  the most racist people I've ever been around are liberals, in New York and Chicago at events
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:03.760]  or in college or wherever, they'll just, you'll be sitting there with them and all of a sudden
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.400]  they'll start saying racist stuff and I'm like is this some test or something because
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:09.960]  I'm not into this, they're like oh well no blah blah blah, I mean let me tell you that's
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:16.560]  who they are and they love managing and running everybody, that's why they accuse libertarians
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:20.560]  and stuff that are against all this of being white saviors and all this because see they're
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:26.560]  the ones being a white savior, I don't want to save anybody but your freedom, I just want
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.760]  you left alone, live your own life, free association, be with who you want, do what you want, just
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:37.400]  don't screw me over, see how that works and then if I like your music or I like how you
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.240]  cook or I like the science you have or I like hanging out with you or I like your jokes
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:48.080]  I'll, then you'll be my friend but it isn't this whole force thing that's actually creating
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:55.840]  more division and I know I'm on a rant about this now, it's just that I know the democratic
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:03.040]  party in the south and they're the weirdest bunch of people you've ever seen, they are,
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:10.440]  they are the Ku Klux Klan, they are the Dixie Mafia, they run the show still, a lot of them
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:19.040]  are republicans now, Rick Perry, that guy went to a KKK hunting lodge, I mean he's the real
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:27.640]  deal and nobody cares if you're a Schwarzenegger and we're a Nazi belt buckle and say Hal Hitler
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:33.160]  because the ADL gives you awards, that's what I mean, it's all upside down, the people pushing
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:41.440]  race are the ones that are the race controllers because really racism is a cult, it's a cult
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:48.160]  of control and see people that obsess on it, they aren't the races, they're the race controllers,
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:53.920]  it isn't the dumb people on the bottom become racist, the people on top it's like joining
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:41:00.120]  a devil worship or cult or something, it all then becomes about what group you're in and
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:03.560]  then you get little goodies because you're in that group and Lord I know I've probably
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:07.800]  had privileges in my life because maybe I was good looking or maybe I was well spoken
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:12.320]  or I was white whatever but there were times I had bad things happen to me because of how
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:17.720]  I looked, I mean I don't claim to be a Mr. Beech Boy today but when I was 20, I mean
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:22.280]  I was about as good looking as it got and men and women would be mean to me, they would
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.360]  be angry and it wasn't until I was older, they got a little uglier, I was like folks are
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:32.880]  nicer to me now because I don't look like a Calvin Klein model anymore but so you get
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:36.520]  young people all scared thinking there's racism everywhere and everybody's out to get them
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:39.840]  and oh my gosh and then they see stuff on TV and there's a chip on their shoulder and
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:42.520]  then they act like everybody's out to get them and all this stuff's going on and then
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:50.440]  pretty soon yeah people act weird towards you and the whole country's being turned into
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:57.360]  arrested development children that can be jacked over. You look at cults, the followers
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.760]  are just a bunch of scared weirdos who think they follow the leader and do what they're
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:06.960]  told they're somehow going to reach Nirvana. No, you must develop yourself, you must go
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:13.320]  through the fire, you must be tested, that's what makes you strong. But I went on a whole
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.120]  jag and I'm sorry, I went on one of your calls, I went on a whole jag about Hillary and the
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:25.440]  South and the Dixie Crats and all the rest of it because I know who they are and I'm
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:28.440]  not even saying at the end of the day all of them are evil or whatever they're in their
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:36.960]  own cult but man, I just being a white person in the South, I know how stuff really works
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:48.240]  and I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that Republicans voters are usually Christian
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:59.040]  middle-class people who are scared and not racist. I mean I don't think I've ever heard
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:04.440]  Republicans say racist things. You get in a rim with Democrats, it is the most God-awful
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:08.600]  thing you have ever heard in your life and it's just a sick joke to me, I mean this stuff
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:15.960]  is sick, this is sick, this is sick, this is sick, it is so sick that I have to sit here
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:21.160]  and watch these brainwashed idiots run around like morons, fire ants by George Soros and
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:28.880]  I know I'm 100% right and I can't reach these people. It's like beating your head up against
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:35.800]  a brick wall but I know I'm reaching some people and if the establishment ever starts
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:39.520]  using the Republican Party as its takeover arm, I'll go after them, everybody knows that
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.080]  but I'm telling you right now they're using the left worldwide for a takeover and they're
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:48.560]  not bringing in 5 million Muslims into Europe because they want to help them. They are going
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:54.640]  to use those folks and in the end they're going to scapegoat them when they invade with
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:44:00.720]  the new crusades and wipe out almost all those people and by the way that's getting prepared.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:05.600]  I want to stop the invasion now so it doesn't get to that point. I'm doing myself and them
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:12.640]  a favor, I really look at the moral judgment of things and what is honorable under universal
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:21.440]  law and I morally shouldn't have to pay for people being brought here and I sure shouldn't
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:24.680]  have to pay when they're being made to be a political weapon and I sure shouldn't have
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:30.720]  to pay. This is Islam in 60 seconds and why it's not compatible in the West. There isn't
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.160]  one Islamic country in the world that's tolerant of other people's religions and freedoms.
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:42.600]  The most moderate are intolerant. Almost all of them are radical and orthodox now and will
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:48.560]  kill you. The second or third time you're caught preaching the gospel. They will imprison
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:53.040]  you the first time. They will torture you the first time. They will murder you the first
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:59.680]  moment you're caught in a homosexual act. They treat women like dogs or lower. They
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:05.760]  are incompatible and the social engineers know full well they are basically bringing
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.240]  space aliens into the West and before the New York Times says I believe I'm saying they're
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:17.120]  the equivalent. They are alien, alien and they can be over there. I'm sorry for their
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:23.600]  women. I hope they have a reformation. I love how the left acts like any white male in the
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:28.960]  West hates women getting ahead. That's why they don't want you to ever have kids. Because
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:33.920]  the big secret is once a woman has sons and a man has daughters, if there was any weird
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:39.240]  stuff between the sexes before, there is no difference when it comes down to wanting everybody
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.240]  to get ahead and everybody to be successful and everybody to be fulfilled and be good
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:53.880]  in the eyes of God. That's all I care about. And I love how the state and stuff goes oh
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:58.520]  you ought to put your girls in a camp. I went and looked at some of these camps they're
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:02.920]  pushing. This is like hardcore feminist brainwashing. Put chips on their shoulders. They're going
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:08.440]  to teach your daughters what their identity is. You just hand your kids over to induct
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:18.880]  them to a bunch of freaks who want to sabotage your sons and daughters. The state and its
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:26.080]  systems wants to teach your children their identity. Their identity comes from their
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:32.640]  culture, their parents, their genetics, their experiences and their choices. They will develop
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:37.520]  their identity but you don't want to give them time because you're not a liberal. You're
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:44.240]  a dirtbag psychic vampire piece of crap that can't deal in the society of men and women
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:50.960]  and real intellectual debate. You have to sit there as adults jacking with kids because
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:55.840]  you're perverts. Even if you don't want to put the little kids in a bed, you want to
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:08.480]  psychically rape their brains. Yes, I see you. Let's go back to the phone calls. Robert
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:15.840]  in California are on the air. God bless America, my friend. God bless you, my friend. Go ahead.
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:20.400]  Yeah, anyway, it's a whole world scripted. The whole planet's being consolidated into
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:26.400]  mass concentration camps. They're just trying to put the mass populations in a certain
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.960]  area. With arrogant spoiled brats running around like Triglypuff. Yeah, I've dealt
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:36.560]  with three Presidents of the United States. I've had clearances with the defense. I've
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:44.400]  worked with U.S. Russian intelligence relations and our projects together. As far as Hillary's
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:50.160]  concerned, and that's my dealings with the White House, it was basically the Clintons
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:55.400]  were basically Beverly Hillbillies in Washington, D.C. It was bad. It was trailer trash in the
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:02.800]  White House. These people are completely dysfunctional. She has mental issues. She can't be president.
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:05.600]  The thing is, I know their campaign, what they're going to do. Hillary's going to do
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:09.640]  the stupid bra-less thing, you know, women voting for her. Don't wear your bra. I've
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:13.760]  read the script of what she's going to do, all her stupid crap. I know Trump. I know
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:19.040]  his contacts, what he's involved in. It's very scripted.
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:23.320]  Okay, okay. Listen, listen, listen, listen. I'll skip the break if need be. I mean, I'm
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:26.280]  not saying I believe you or don't believe you. You're such an incredible guy. Are you
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:32.680]  saying Trump's scripted in on it as well? It's a good possibility. If he picks Sarah
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:37.600]  Palin, he's a 100% shill because I know Sarah Palin's excellent mobile contacts and how
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:43.280]  much money she's been given and the funnel to him later on. But it's a possibility. If
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:48.880]  he picks her, the thing is, he needs a Hispanic male or a female VP to get in because Hillary
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:56.600]  has the gay community, lesbian, gay community, has every female in the country, trendies.
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:03.200]  That's a huge bae. And Trump is basically Trump confused people. If you look at Caucasians,
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.480]  males at Caucasians, I mean, they look autistic. They look like they're under some sort of
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:09.520]  brain dead trance. I mean, the real, I spoke to you.
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:12.480]  No, I agree. I agree. But I mean, let's expand on that. Well, they're not getting this fall
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:18.000]  holiday supposedly, you know, just get this magic wand. Most of them are seeing society
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.960]  crumble around them. They're seen as the most uncool thing on earth. Yeah, on average, they
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.480]  are wandering around like zombies. It's a rest of development. It's the sports. It's
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:33.560]  all of it. But look, they're making it the racial and sexual component. That's what
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:37.040]  Hillary's doing. And they're definitely going with that. What do you think will happen if
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:38.640]  Hillary does get into office?
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:44.280]  Well, the thing is, every country is going to laugh at us. You have a woman running the
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.680]  United States of America that is in itself as a joke, considering that no woman has run
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:54.000]  any major military offensive on this planet. As long as we know for millions of years,
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  there's no evidence of this ever taking place. Okay. For one, Russia has submarines right
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.760]  off the coast of California that have been there forever, enough firepower to wipe out
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:07.840]  this country. I'm concerned and I'm in contact with people within United States, Russian
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.280]  people. They're asleep yourselves in Russia. And I've contact, I've always had contact
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:14.840]  with U.S. and like I said, U.S. and Russian relations. They've worked in defense for all
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  the time.
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:17.920]  Well, let me expand on this, sir. There's actually been quite a few times that there have been
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:22.960]  women actually over huge empires and women have launched a lot of successful offensives
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:25.960]  and takeovers. Have you heard of Queen Elizabeth?
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:31.080]  Right. Oh, yeah. I know about this. I'm not talking about modern day warfare, you know,
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:33.760]  and that's, you know, medieval stuff.
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:39.520]  My concern is women tend to actually start more wars historically. Yeah. Oh, yeah. If
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:42.840]  you were to look at who's Queen Elizabeth and what, you know, a lot of other books,
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:46.560]  you know, I mean, look at, look at the bunch of women running the State Department right
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:51.280]  now. They're a bunch of war mongers. I know it's crazy. You're working on emotion. You're
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:54.520]  not working on logic. We're going to break. I'm not going to skip this break. We're going
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.520]  to go ahead and go in here and then we're going to be back with more calls. I appreciate
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:58.520]  your call, Robert.
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:50:59.520]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:06.240]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist, author of 85 books and founder of the National
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:11.200]  Chain Meyer Clinics to tell you about two your health liquid vitamins. I've been taking
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:16.080]  these every day for over a decade now, and I try to encourage every one of my clients
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.920]  to take them every day. And there's a number of reasons. First of all, it's the best vitamins
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:23.560]  you can get. It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients in it. And then the
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:28.320]  most important reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients is because
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:33.200]  it's got brain food in it. It's got the essential amino acid. It's got tryptophan, phylloelamine,
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:38.120]  tyrosine, and choline, vitamin B6, and these chemicals that are all natural from food.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:40.240]  Turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.

[02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:04.880]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:09.560]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:14.320]  we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar
[02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:19.800]  Generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:24.880]  run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:29.680]  summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:33.040]  through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:38.480]  this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:42.920]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition
[02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:47.200]  to the low price for infill-wars listeners. So it's a good time to check it out. Go to
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:53.280]  gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[02:53:53.280 --> 02:54:22.160]  with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:25.520]  By the way, there's a very powerful article that I'm going to spend a few minutes in the
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:32.720]  next hour talking with Anthony Gutiarty about. Paul Watson's done the research. I knew there
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:36.840]  was some problems with Mike Pence, kind of a mainline Republican, and maybe Trump's signaling
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:41.120]  to the establishment, hey, I'm not that dangerous, let me in. But they're still not giving him
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:48.040]  money, so it's pointless. I don't go for less for two evils. But Mike Pence would be a terrible
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:53.400]  choice for BP for Trump. That's the headline. Paul Joseph Watson, Governor of Indiana, supports
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:59.200]  stealth and the STTPP NAFTA. And then it just goes over. I remember Pence saying, calls
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:04.480]  to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. So Pence has
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:10.360]  also shot his mouth off at Trump. Trump said, if you're not going to vet anybody and even
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:15.040]  check their IDs, which they are still not doing and just bring them in, you got to cut
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:20.160]  it off. It may just be a little while until we have a system back in place. Yeah, there's
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.720]  a gas leak. Remember like eight, nine years ago, we had a gas leak in the kitchen. I didn't
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:30.320]  need to go on the Internet to know what to do. I mean, I just knew growing up, I'm not
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:37.760]  a rocket scientist. I went and I turned the gas off at the side of the house. I had a
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:41.240]  tool to do it, dug around the garage and got it. And I was reading the other day that
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:47.920]  most people, you know, call the fire department or call a handyman fine. But I really think
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:52.640]  that's what's happened more than anything. We are separated from the land. We're separated
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:57.520]  from reality. We're just separated from normal human behavior. And so people can be really,
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.200]  really conned. I think that's a big part of it. And that's why they want to get us totally
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.880]  dependent because there's a major global awakening happening, but there's a large portion of
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:11.200]  folks who are still dumbed down and they believe if they can hold those people hostage politically,
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:16.320]  they'll be able to vote to checkmate the minority of us of every race, color and creed who are
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:22.920]  bound by the fact that we are awake, sentient, conscious beings that want to be free, that
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:27.840]  want to be free range humans, that want to be free to do dangerous things like rock climbing
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:33.520]  or ultra light or space travel. You know, the nanny state is about capturing humanity,
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:37.760]  turning us into Chinese princesses. I don't see anybody else that uses those analogies.
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.200]  Well, I need to do a special video on don't let them turn you into a Chinese princess.
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:46.640]  The Africans did it. The Mesoamericans did it. A certain extent, ancient Europeans did
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:52.320]  it. The Japanese did it, but they would bound women's feet where they couldn't walk. That's
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:57.840]  a way to control your wife, you know, the queen. Oh, you're so royal. You don't trim
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:04.400]  your fingernails. They're two feet long. And African tribes, the rings around the women's
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:08.640]  necks where if you took those rings off, they suffocate and die. Everybody's like, Oh, you're
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:14.520]  a movie star, you know, your feeder bound all this. It's all this has been done before.
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:23.120]  It's what the nanny state is. It's got to stop. Oh, but it's so stylish. Liking Matt Damon
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:28.280]  liking all this trendy stuff is just as dumb as deforming your feet. Now, I'll tell you,
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:33.760]  a woman looks good in high heels. Still not good for your feet, but not that destructive.
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.840]  That is quite an invention. I love the Lord's creation. So I'll just tell you right now,
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.280]  I'm red blooded. We're going to go to break, come back and finish up with your calls, Jonathan.
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:49.280]  And then we're going to talk to who else is up here. Harmony, Zeke, Steve and Isaac. I'm
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:51.840]  going to get to every single one of you. I promise Bam, Bam, Bam. We're talking about
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.960]  the VP pick. Is it really who they claim it is? Mike Pence. We're going to review some
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:59.840]  of that. I'm going to print that article. And then we're also going to be talking with
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:04.880]  Anthony Gucciardi as well as he takes over the broadcast. And as I get ready to gear
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:12.760]  up, shoot special reports ahead of going to Cleveland this Saturday or the Sunday. Oh,
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:16.440]  by the way, the special ends today and it will end. It'll be over on the storeable food.
[02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:21.240]  We've extended it over a week. That ends today on the highest quality storeable foods. Everybody
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:25.320]  needs obviously to not be dependent on the system. Now's the time to not play games and
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:28.680]  get it in my view. Plus it supports the broadcast so you can't lose whether it's a month or

[02:59:59.840 --> 03:00:14.840]  They call us walking corpses. Unholy living dead. They like to lock us up.
[03:00:14.840 --> 03:00:21.640]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:32.240]  the info war. Yeah, the global say we're dead. We're spiritually dead. We don't have
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:38.200]  free will. We don't exist. Don't think so. You're the ones that are dead. You wouldn't
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:45.280]  be doing the things you're doing. You're very cold and robotic. Yeah, you call us walking
[03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:59.520]  corpses. Unholy living dead. They'd like to lock us up. Put us in the pretty pink. All
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:02.280]  right, anything you see already is coming up co-hosting with me. I'm punching out in
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:07.240]  20 minutes and I'm taking your phone calls right now. Jonathan, the great state of Tennessee.
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:11.760]  What do you think of the supposed VP pick? Paul Watson thinks it's really horrible.
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:18.680]  Well, you know what? I don't think it does. I don't care. I think I trust Donald Trump
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:25.600]  and it didn't matter who he picks. They're going to the communist news network. They're
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:31.880]  going to dissect them. They're going to say anything they've ever done. We know how that
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:39.360]  works. So I just encourage people that are supporting Trump to realize that that's part
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:43.960]  of their plan. He could pick Jesus. Sure, sure. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I hear
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:48.520]  what you're saying, but Paul Watson, I know he's a good guy. He's smart. He just dug
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:55.720]  into the basics of Pence and Pence is pro-nav-to-pro-gat. Trump is against that. And all I'm saying
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:59.800]  is you're supposed to pick somebody that you agree with and Pence shot his mouth off a
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.160]  lot about Trump. Now, all I'm saying is he's a lot better than Newt Gennrich. Man, I hope
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:08.480]  it's him over Gennrich. But I'm just saying, I mean, do you have any concerns about that?
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:14.960]  Well, you know, sure I do. I have concerns about everything, but I will tell you this.
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:22.480]  I'm more concerned about Hillary Clinton and like the first car being worried about torture.
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:27.560]  Oh, I'm absolutely going to. We know Hillary's is true evil. That's why the establishment's
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:33.080]  behind her. I get it. I'm for Trump because the establishment is totally scared of him.
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:38.360]  But if he brings in a bunch of establishment people, he better watch his back.
[03:02:38.360 --> 03:02:44.840]  And you know what? I pray for his safety because I know what you're saying. And I agree with
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:50.320]  most everything you say. And it's okay for you to disagree with me. I get your point.
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:54.240]  You know, the guy's like, well, Trump wants to torture ISIS. So he supports the cops torturing
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:59.200]  us. No, he doesn't. Right. And that's what I want to say to that young guy. I want to
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:04.120]  say, do you realize that they're going to cut our heads off if we believe something that
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:09.200]  I mean, look, here's the deal. Yeah, look, the globalists are bringing in people that
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:14.520]  are totally incompatible and they're putting them in charge of the Middle East. Boy, that
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:20.120]  shows Obama and Hillary are really bad news. I mean, Obama knew ISIS and al Qaeda that
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:23.160]  they funded to take over Syria was going to kill every Christian they got their hands
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:29.760]  on. I mean, that is cold blooded. I mean, Obama is a conscious murderer of Christians.
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:34.000]  And I knew it for sure. Gotta find this clip. We played it a few months ago. He was laughing.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:38.800]  I think the headline was Obama talks about why we can't take only Christian refugees.
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:42.520]  Well, it wasn't only. He goes, huh, come on, you know, everybody gets to get out, not
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:46.000]  just the Christians. We're going to be fair. He doesn't let Christians get out. It's like
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:53.200]  0.3%. He knows that country was 27% Christian. They're murdering them. They're murdering
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:58.640]  them. They're raping their daughters. And he sits there and he is evil. Man, that guy,
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:02.080]  I used to talk to people that know him and I think, Oh, he's not that bad. He's just
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:06.040]  an ESPN guy. He just likes to have a good time, you know, and they're like, no, he's
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:11.960]  evil. And now I realize that Obama, Obama wants to murder Christians. Obama, I'm gonna
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:18.480]  say that again. Obama wants to murder Christians. I appreciate your call. He does murder Christians.
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:24.440]  He directs the murder of them with that blood drinker, Hillary. I mean, I tell you, boy,
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:28.280]  you sit around TV bragging about killing people. You're you're you're a bloodthirsty
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:31.240]  piece of trash. Anthony, what do you got coming up after the break?
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:35.440]  So the free Syrian rebels, too. Don't forget about that. Going around doing some heinous
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:40.320]  stuff in Syria, chopping heads off and village centers, reveling in it. Well, we're gonna
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:44.680]  talk about a bunch of stuff. University students who are criticizing Black Lives Matter face
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:49.720]  death threats, even though they say, Hey, it might not be a good thing. China hacked US
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:53.880]  banking regulators and the whole system is kind of a big joke. 70% of people say they
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:56.880]  have their incomes becoming stagnant. We're going to talk about it straight ahead. I think
[03:04:56.880 --> 03:05:03.240]  we need to check his mice a little bit alone. Be aware, but not there. The hacktivist group
[03:05:03.240 --> 03:05:10.720]  anonymous is now calling for nationwide day of rage protests on Friday, July 15th at 7
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:16.960]  p.m. Eastern Standard Time in a city near you. The video by anonymous does specify non
[03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:22.720]  violence and denounces the actions taken against police officers who were not involved in these
[03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:28.520]  recent deaths. But with the tagline day of rage, it's safe to expect emotions to be running
[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:34.120]  very high on both sides of the line. No matter how great your empathy might be for those
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:39.360]  who have unjustly lost their lives, these protests are not safe places to be. If your
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:45.880]  home is in or near a major metropolitan area, be aware that your city could be under siege.
[03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:51.160]  Make plans to stay safe, hunker down with emergency food and purified water, or make
[03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:57.880]  plans for strategic relocation. This is Ashley Beckford with infowars.com. Stay tuned for

[03:07:02.400 --> 03:07:07.080]  you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about
[03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:11.960]  how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:17.040]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad
[03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:22.000]  member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen M and put the deadly
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:27.160]  halogen M. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:33.080]  telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information
[03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:38.240]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:43.400]  are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these
[03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:47.560]  studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is
[03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:53.600]  essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:08:08.480]  at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:24.120]  I'm going to get a defense of human liberty, Alex Jones. Well, I'm going to finish. I'm
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:30.840]  going to stay on the ball because fighting tyranny and just having to actually stay on
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:35.480]  the ball just means you got to have the will to never give up, never give in, and we will
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:40.200]  win because they always have to censor our free speech. They always have to shut reporters
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:44.800]  off that expose Hillary and point out laws she supported and pushed for, mandatory sentencing
[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:50.840]  on CNN because the truth will defeat them. And no matter how many fancy technologies
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:54.440]  they roll in, they're going to backfire on them every time, just like the Internet has
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:59.960]  done. Anthony Gutierrez has taken over in T-minus 10 minutes, 11 minutes from now, an incredible
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:08.640]  article by Paul Watson. I had some concerns about Pence and Paul is here hoping that this
[03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:12.360]  is just Trump testing the waters. That's not the word I have from Stone, that this is a
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:17.160]  leak and that it's not even known to be an accurate one. I'm just going to leave it
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:21.200]  with that. We'll find out obviously tomorrow at 11 a.m. Eastern. We'll be here covering
[03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:28.120]  it live, obviously, even before we go on the main show. But this is an excellent article
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:31.760]  and I'm going to your calls right after that. He says, reports that Mike Pence is set to
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:36.040]  be announced as Donald Trump's VP pick tomorrow have set off alarm bells amongst many from
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:41.720]  supporters because of the governor's Indiana's pro-amnesty, pro-TPP advocacy. Making Pence
[03:09:41.720 --> 03:09:47.760]  VP is seen by many as a way of calming establishment conservatives in United Kingdom GOP, although
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:53.800]  why pandering to conservatives would have failed over and over again, John McCain, Mitt
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:58.240]  Romney said, said, is suddenly a good idea remains a mystery. Here are more reasons
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.760]  why picking Pence doesn't make sense. While Trump has promised to build a wall, Pence
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:08.000]  has been savaged by respected conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Phyllis Slapley for
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.840]  advocating stealth ammesty in the form of gas worker program. While Trump has campaigned
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:18.440]  against job killing foreign trade deals, Pence vehemently supports NAFTA, CAFTA and the TPP.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:22.720]  Pence voted for the Iraq war, which Trump was against, and opposed a withdrawal date
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:27.560]  even after it became apparent U.S. involvement in the country was a disastrous policy.
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:34.000]  Pence once advocated conversion therapy for homosexuals, which is just saying that isn't
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.560]  what Trump supports. Pence is not a woman picking a female would have completely neutralized
[03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:44.000]  Hillary Clinton's sole campaign platform, one bolstered by the media, which is the fact
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:49.560]  that Hillary has a, you know what, hopefully the Pence leak is just the Trump campaign
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:53.960]  test in the waters before a final call was made. 60 seconds from Gutiarty, and I'm going
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:58.320]  right to Harmony, Steve, Zach, Isaac, go ahead.
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:02.400]  No, exactly. Why pander to the establishment? The whole point is that people are ready for
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:05.880]  something new. They don't want the same old establishment system. They want something
[03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:09.840]  clearly that Trump was for in the beginning or now currently when he's talking about,
[03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:15.800]  hey, this system has failed. 70% say their incomes are stagnant. 70% also say that they
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:20.000]  hate the direction of the country. 60% of the people, if I recall properly, say they
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:24.200]  don't even like the government in general in the past like 20 years.
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:25.200]  It's much harder there.
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:26.200]  Yeah.
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:29.880]  The latest is 70%. That's another pull, but 9% approval rating for Congress. Absolutely,
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:34.100]  Anthony. Let's go to some of these phone calls. Let's see. We had Alex in Mexico just
[03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:37.400]  called him and he'll probably get to you later. I do want to talk to you though, former Bernie
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.960]  supporter as well. It's always cool to get calls from outside the country. We got Harmony
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:44.520]  in Virginia. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:46.880]  Hey, hey, how's it going?
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:48.600]  Fine. Thanks for calling.
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:54.400]  All right. So I totally agree with the last guy. We should not have a woman president
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:12:01.000]  now. It's just not the right time. One and two, not Hillary. I have been against her
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:04.440]  from day one. Never, never, Hillary.
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:10.520]  But I mean, why not have a woman president now? I mean, if she was informed in a patriot
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:16.480]  and aware and have the knowledge, I mean, women have been good leaders in history.
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:22.120]  But right now, when you've got her in bed with Muslims who, I mean,
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:27.880]  Oh, absolutely. No, she's disqualified being in bed with the nastiest, nastiest shahadis.
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:28.880]  Absolutely.
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:32.560]  But that's what I'm saying is, is Muslims, especially in other countries are going to
[03:12:32.560 --> 03:12:37.120]  see it as, oh, we got America right where we want them. They're going to, I'm not saying
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:38.760]  I feel that way about women.
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:41.720]  No, no, I get it. I understand you're saying from the perspective of the world.
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:47.120]  Now, let me tell you, my son is a four-time vet. He's an amputee, wounded warrior. He's
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:54.040]  still active duty and he's deployable. He was in the Invictus games recently. You know,
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:58.880]  here's here's the method to the madness with Pence, if it isn't that tense. That's what
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:04.920]  I'm saying is, and I think more, more of us believe this than you know. We need strength.
[03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:10.880]  We need men, real men, like my son. We need them in charge. We need them now more than
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:17.080]  ever. It's the tiny has a lot to do with it. And again, Hillary just not been the right
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:18.080]  person for any job.
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:22.920]  Now, I have worked for men and I've worked for women. I will work for a man any day.
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:26.080]  Women in power, you know, there's no guarantee they're looking out for you.
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:29.240]  On average, they are more vindictive. There's a lot of other issues. I mean, there's a reason
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.840]  in history, things kind of shake out the way they do. All I know is, is that if there's
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:38.480]  a woman qualified who's a patriot, and that's who I'd go for because women could do a really
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.120]  great job. I mean, it's kind of like, it's all statistical. And the difference is I can't
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:46.640]  have a baby. So there is differences with the sex. Sex is, it is a fact. I appreciate
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:51.600]  your call, Harmony. Let's go ahead and talk to you as we hold the longest now. That'd
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:55.760]  be Isaac in Texas. And then I'm going to go to the Bernie supporters. Go ahead.
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:14:02.160]  Hey, Alex, just want to make a comment here regarding Donald Trump.
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:09.680]  Yes. When he first came out and said that he was running for president, to be honest
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:16.000]  with you, I've been off for it with his past reputation of building his business. He's
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:20.160]  a successful businessman. He's obviously smart, intelligent.
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:26.120]  Yeah, I want businessmen. I want businesswomen. I want engineers. I want doctors. I want scientists.
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:30.160]  I want farmers. We've got 90% lawyers. That's enough.
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:36.880]  Exactly. And then with Trump, he would make the perfect, he seems like the perfect role
[03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:43.040]  model for anyone that aspires in business and wants to create their own.
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:46.160]  Sure. So what do you think of the VP pick? What do you think of the VP pick? I mean,
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:51.880]  do you think it's real? Anyone but Newt would, you know, anyone but
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:15:00.560]  Newt. I'm concerned now about Pence with the concerns that you raised earlier regarding
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:07.200]  his connections. And that concerns me. I'll be, that's my point, actually.
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:13.680]  When Trump first came out, it seems like a perfect fit. He's a great negotiator. He's
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:20.680]  intelligent. However, I've seen things along the way, little hints, drops of hints that
[03:15:20.680 --> 03:15:25.560]  just, they're concerns. And I'm sure they've come up as red flags for you too.
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:31.040]  Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, the establishment's hate of him is real, but is it because he's
[03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:35.680]  an outsider who hasn't been in their club and they're just afraid he's going to steal
[03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:43.120]  their, steal their quarry, steal their kill? I mean, that could be the problem.
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:48.640]  It could be. There's just a lot of concerns that are coming out that obviously...
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:54.320]  Well, voice some of those. The forgiveness statement. I remember that one, that one threw
[03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:58.560]  up a red flag. I mean, honestly, where he says, you know, I don't believe, you know,
[03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:03.360]  I need to be forgiven for anything. He didn't admit, okay, that's cool. It's, you know,
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:09.320]  I let, you know, that that was the first. The second was the waterboarding, the torture
[03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:15.520]  statement. And, you know, the, you know, the wall he, I don't really take that as racist.
[03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:21.040]  I'm going to be honest with you. That is not a racist statement. I never took it that
[03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:22.040]  way.
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:24.280]  Well, sure. You can have a wall. The thing is, it won't work if you've actually have
[03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:28.240]  to go after cut off the welfare. I appreciate your call. Interesting points. We'll continue
[03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:32.240]  to watch this and we'll know about tomorrow. Riveting information, obviously, history happening
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:36.080]  right now. Steve in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide. You were
[03:16:36.080 --> 03:16:38.760]  a Bernie supporter. What are you going to do now?
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:43.800]  Thank you, Alex. I'm on a long-time listener, first-time caller, and my kids love the Pro
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.120]  Pier. I'll get that off my back here. Thank you for your support, sir, and the stuff you
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:50.680]  purchased at Info War Store. It makes it all possible. Thank you.
[03:16:50.680 --> 03:16:56.840]  Okay. Well, I, I agreed with a lot of what Bernie had to say. And I, one of the big things
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:04.920]  I think is if, you know, he wanted to, he would, wanted to de-schedule marijuana, the
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:11.920]  cannabis. And I think if Trump were to come out and state that he would do that, they
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:16.360]  should decriminalize it. They've still got hemp banned. You could smoke an 18-wheeler
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:20.600]  of it and not get a buzz. I mean, why is that banned? Because it competes with polyester.
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:26.840]  Yeah, I just think, you know, you guys talk about the war on drugs and how unconstitutional
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:31.080]  that is. And I think that if Trump were to come out and just state that he would end
[03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:34.440]  the prohibition on cannabis, that would be a lie.
[03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:37.640]  Sure, sure. But I mean, I mean, will you hold, will you hold your nose and vote for Trump?
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.120]  Or will you jump off a cliff and vote for Hillary? I mean, she is the corporate candidate.
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:47.280]  She is the warmonger. She stole the votes from the Bernie people. I mean, I mean, uh, Trump
[03:17:47.280 --> 03:17:48.280]  all the way.
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:54.600]  So you are, you are Trump all the way. Yes. Good. Well, please reach out to the Bernie
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:59.720]  supporters. Do you talk to other Bernie supporters? And if so, I mean, what's the sentiment? What's
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:00.720]  the sentiment?
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:08.480]  Yep. Well, you know, I'm up in Northeastern Minnesota here and things are quite progressive
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:15.960]  up here, you could say, or maybe not. Sure. But, uh, yeah, I think, uh, just, there's
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:22.280]  not a whole lot of good things that people have to say about, about, uh, Trump up here.
[03:18:22.280 --> 03:18:25.000]  But, uh, yeah, I mean, it's,
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:29.280]  We'll start talking to him, brother, because I mean, he's not perfect, but he's one of
[03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:33.640]  our only shots at trying to really give the globalists a black eye here. And we've got
[03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:38.040]  the situation with the Brexit. I mean, this is a protest vote. Enough Clintons, enough
[03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:45.120]  bushes. Oh, I don't know who I'd hate more, a Hillary or a Jeb. I just, Hillary's like,
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:49.520]  was the Clintons were leaving a dropping of the bushes. I mean, it's just, there's no
[03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:53.840]  way it's like, it's like her piece. You just cannot get rid of these people. Give me a
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:57.000]  headache thinking about who I just liked more. I think it's probably Hillary. She's just
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:02.040]  such a witch, that Joker thing. At least Jeb acts like he's humble, but you know, it's
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:05.960]  kind of a serial killer. He's trying to, he's nice, but you know, Hillary, it's just full
[03:19:05.960 --> 03:19:11.240]  on like with a vampire, you know, transforms and fright night. Oh, you think that's scary?
[03:19:11.240 --> 03:19:17.840]  Hillary. Oh, by the way, people say she doesn't project strength for the Middle East. Everybody's
[03:19:17.840 --> 03:19:21.680]  scared of her. And that's dangerous when people got nukes. The Russians are scared
[03:19:21.680 --> 03:19:29.400]  of her. And for a good reason, she's dangerous. She's a lunatic. Let's talk to Zeke in California.
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:30.400]  Go ahead. You're on the air.
[03:19:30.400 --> 03:19:37.320]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That would be me. Welcome. Go ahead. I appreciate it. I just want to
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:40.960]  preface, you know, my statements by saying, I've been listening to you for so many years.
[03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:45.640]  I can't even keep track of how far back it goes. But, um, I did want to take a second
[03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:51.080]  to address the, uh, Trump, you know, Trump situation and asking people that were Bernie's
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:54.920]  supporters, whether or not they were going to jump to Trump. And I'm not one of those
[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:58.720]  people. I'm not going to jump to Trump. Just real quick. I don't even know where it began.
[03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:03.120]  I really, I think if Trump was really sincere about his make America great again thing and
[03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:07.320]  if he was really about a power in, in power in America, he would have been done and set
[03:20:07.320 --> 03:20:13.040]  up some type of enterprise, industrial enterprise here in the States. And he's been outsourcing
[03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.480]  labor and having stuff built all over the country.
[03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:21.600]  His argument is it's so unfair and everything's so expensive. I can't do it. It won't work.
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:25.760]  And I've experienced it where I do made in America and then people hardly buy it because
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:31.120]  it costs 30, 40% more. And so I'm kind of in that position where I, I mean, we wouldn't
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:34.440]  exist if we weren't buying it from Mexico or whatever, but I hear you, he could do a
[03:20:34.440 --> 03:20:39.360]  national push, have an industrial zone or something, get investors. That, that'd be
[03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:43.600]  a great idea. So you, you don't think there's any, uh, action behind his talk?
[03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:48.920]  No, not at all. I think he's playing people like waving a raw steak in the, in the faces
[03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:53.160]  of a blindfolded, hungry individual. And then I'm not all of your pockets. I don't know
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:20:58.040]  how much you have in the bank, but him as a billionaire, you could easily set up some
[03:20:58.040 --> 03:21:02.960]  type of industrial enterprise, have a construction team or something like that. And in, in, in
[03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:07.840]  the bigger picture, argue that he builds golf courses and hotels and apartment buildings
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:11.600]  and businesses here in America. He does mainly invest in the United States.
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:15.840]  I mean, come on now, the people on golf courses, I'm talking about the bread and butter of
[03:21:15.840 --> 03:21:16.840]  America.
[03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:21.400]  I know brother, but you understand service economy like that is what actually creates
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:27.120]  the mid-level tier jobs. I mean, that, that's, I mean, Trump has produced a lot in the country.
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:32.000]  Well, but again, a golf course versus like construction teams, the people that support
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:36.160]  them, I think he's playing them the same way. Uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger played everybody
[03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:37.160]  here.
[03:21:37.160 --> 03:21:40.120]  Oh, I hear you. Well, I knew Schwarzenegger was bad. Oh my God, that guy was behind the
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:45.040]  in Ron everything. I tell you, and I hated great Davis, but it was just like total setup.
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:48.600]  No, no, no, I hear you. So, so will you be supporting Hillary or Trump?
[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:53.720]  Yeah, I mean, I would have to hold my nose and check a box for Hillary, even though like
[03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:57.160]  you just said, the bushes and the Clintons, we check all of them.
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:21:59.160]  I mean, I'm not a socialist.
[03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:04.000]  I love you and I appreciate you. Listen, I appreciate the call, but hands down, Hillary
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:11.960]  is probably other than maybe LBJ, one of the most dangerous, racist, demonic people you
[03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:15.080]  could ever imagine.
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:19.080]  Donald Trump is all about Donald Trump, but he wants me to turn around guy that makes
[03:22:19.080 --> 03:22:24.600]  America great again. He's, he's an ego maniac for real. And I just, there's a reason they're
[03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:29.720]  scared of him. He did not to get us. Okay. And he's super honest. Yeah, I make my ties
[03:22:29.720 --> 03:22:34.160]  in Mexico. I'm not against Mexico. I can make them for a 10th the prize. You can't do stuff
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:40.200]  in America. I want to change that. Mexico's screwing us over. I make stuff in Mexico.
[03:22:40.200 --> 03:22:48.000]  I explain it to people here by the made America shirt. It's $25 cause it cost me 12, 13, 14
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:53.520]  bucks, paying a shirt, or I can buy one of Mexico for $4 and then I could sell them to
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:23:00.520]  you for $9 or $5. I just, in the people you vote, you control me, you vote with your dollars.
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:06.520]  I try to be the most moral person I could be, but I find it very refreshing that Trump
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:09.680]  is honest about that. And I'm not defending any of this. I'm really concerned about this
[03:23:09.680 --> 03:23:14.680]  Pence thing and the, and the, and the amnesty and the open border and the NAFTA and the
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:20.160]  GATT and the TPP TPP. I mean, I, he better come out and say, he's from behind Trump
[03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:24.720]  and everything if this is actually who Anthony, I've got to go. I want you to take these calls
[03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:28.800]  from Alex and Mexico and Greg and PA and others. I've got a meeting I got to go to.
[03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:32.680]  I wish I could listen to the show. We obviously have a special that ends today and it will
[03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:37.160]  end today. We'll end today on the storeable foods, all the other specials at the end,
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:41.040]  25% off, extended though, when it comes to vegetables, 25% off on DNA force. These are
[03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:44.680]  all products you need and voting with your dollars makes it all possible. I appreciate
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:49.500]  all of your support, my friends. Info wars is such an important voice, getting the word
[03:23:49.500 --> 03:23:55.480]  out to people everywhere info wars, lives.com for the 25% off DNA force, info or store.com
[03:23:55.480 --> 03:23:59.880]  is the umbrella site where you can find everything info or store.com and Anthony, I'm going to
[03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:03.720]  segue to you now, uh, with, uh, I don't know your view yet. This just broke when I was
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:07.120]  on air and you were getting ready. Uh, you heard me read Watson's article, Mike Pence
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:11.400]  would be a terrible choice for, uh, Trump's VP. I agree. Unless you're talking about
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:15.600]  Gennrich. I mean, Gennrich, if he comes out and endorses Gennrich, I'm going to have a
[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:23.960]  mini heart attack, uh, but politicians have turned so bad. I almost expected. I just,
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:27.280]  you know, that's the case. At least I could start unloading on Trump before he gets in
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:29.920]  and I won't feel guilty, but I don't think that's going to happen. I think Trump's for
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:32.680]  real overall. What do you think, Anthony? Well, you know, I think it's sad. Do you think
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:36.440]  about that caller that called in and what do we talk about? We talk about how people
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:40.480]  say, Oh, I want Hillary just cause she's a woman. Then that caller, not, not attacking
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:44.880]  her, you know, but she says, I don't think we're ready for a woman to lead. And I, I
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:49.840]  hear so many people just say these statements about just the most elementary level stuff.
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:53.080]  And they don't talk about any of the details or anything. And we're talking about, you
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:57.440]  know, the VP pick, you're reading an article Watson wrote a really good one about what
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:02.080]  this guy supports. But instead on the news, when I was in there getting ready, I hear
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:06.560]  the news people say things like, well, I don't know if he's strong enough. I don't know.
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:11.360]  I don't know if he's a strong enough person. Like, what does that even mean? They never
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:15.480]  bring up real issues. It's just nothing. Is that why we're in so much trouble? It's like,
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:19.920]  his hair looks good though. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know if he's, if he's fit
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:25.920]  enough to lead, right? They don't talk about his actual opinions or his policies. Leading
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:30.960]  means you take us in a good direction that's moral constitutional and you can get the people
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:35.120]  behind it. That's leadership. I mean, I would totally vote for a woman. I'm sure you would
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:39.600]  too. If she was actually a good candidate and had our best interests in mind and wasn't
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:42.640]  an establishment puppet, I would vote for her in one second. I would, I think it would
[03:25:42.640 --> 03:25:47.440]  be amazing because then we could get behind a woman and it would be, oh, a woman or whatever.
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:51.720]  It's a joke when you bring it down to gender. It doesn't matter which gender it is. I get
[03:25:51.720 --> 03:25:56.280]  her point though. If it was from that perspective, you'd be totally right. I mean, I'm not saying
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:59.520]  you're wrong, but I get the perspective. For the perspective of we don't need a woman
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:04.680]  because they're not smart. I get you. But what she's saying is with the Muslim countries
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:08.160]  and stuff, they'll see that as weak. I get what she's saying, but I wasn't even specifically
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:12.200]  talking about her. I'm saying the overarching thing of these people debating based on ridiculous
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:16.360]  factors. No, I hear you. I'm handing the baton to you. In Forrest Downey News tonight, seven
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:21.080]  o'clock central, please continue. All right. Thanks, Alex. You know, it's, I got a stack
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:24.520]  of news and it's one of those times where there's so much going on. There's so much
[03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:28.520]  craziness going on. Everyone's talking about Donald Trump's VP and everything like that,
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:32.120]  which we're going to talk about a little bit too. But there's other news coming out and
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:35.800]  it's just as important because sometimes when all the craziness is going on, we miss some
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:40.600]  of the good stuff, right? We miss some of the gems. So here we have Kerry, you guys may
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:47.040]  have already heard about this. U.S. will welcome a target of 10,000 Syrian refugees. Of course,
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:50.880]  everyone's already talked about the vetting process being a failure, but that's fine.
[03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:56.200]  The target is 10,000. And instead of debating it, instead of debating the whole refugee
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:27:02.440]  situation, I wanted to remind you of something. And that is that Saudi Arabia, we've talked
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:10.120]  about this many, many times, has 100,000 air-conditioned tents sitting empty. Still, they won't take
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:16.640]  in Syrian refugees a minute. They're tents sitting there. No one is in them. Not a single
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:21.760]  soul. They're perfectly preserved. They're clean. They're air-conditioned from the Washington
[03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:26.160]  Times. It says, a Saudi Arabia faces mounting criticism for refusing to take in any of
[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:30.240]  the millions of Syrians fleeing conflict in their homeland. It was revealed this weekend
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:38.680]  that the country has over 100,000 empty air-conditioned tents that could house up to 3 million refugees.
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:45.280]  So I wanted to bring that up again because I see celebrities and others speaking out
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:48.720]  and saying, we need to bring in the refugees. It's a very sad situation. We know it is
[03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:54.600]  a sad situation. It's a very, very sad situation. But why are we not publicly calling on other
[03:27:54.600 --> 03:28:00.120]  countries like Saudi Arabia with 100,000 air-conditioned tents that are empty that can fit 3 million
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:05.440]  refugees with ease? And it's way closer. It's not going to result in coming over the
[03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:14.040]  United States. And Saudi Arabia is a much more congruent nation as opposed to the refugees,
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:20.800]  which many of them have reported to been extremists that wanted to kill people in the United States.
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:26.520]  But no, rather guilt people and say that we're bad for not taking in Syrian refugees, right?
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:31.200]  So also wanted to hit on this, China likely hacked U.S. Banking Regulator report fines.
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:35.920]  And it's interesting because, this is from Reuters, it didn't just happen. They're just
[03:28:35.920 --> 03:28:40.400]  finding out the Chinese government likely hacked computers at the Federal Deposit Insurance
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:48.840]  Corporation in 2010, 2011, and 2013, according to a congressional report on Wednesday that
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:52.240]  cited an internal investigation by Banking Regulator.
[03:28:52.240 --> 03:29:00.040]  Now, this is an issue because we don't understand the true depths of our infrastructure that
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:06.640]  has been completely compromised and hacked into at every level. And it sounds spooky
[03:29:06.640 --> 03:29:11.440]  sometimes like a hacker, like there's someone in a suit like hacking with all these cool
[03:29:11.440 --> 03:29:16.280]  screens and stuff. It's actually much, much more simple than that, oftentimes. It's oftentimes
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:22.120]  that someone very important has a terrible password and someone can grab it from them
[03:29:22.120 --> 03:29:24.960]  using a key logger or something and access everyone's information.
[03:29:24.960 --> 03:29:29.880]  This happens to corporations all the time. Our information is not as secure as we think.
[03:29:29.880 --> 03:29:33.840]  When the nuclear launch codes are zero, zero, zero, zero, also, you know, it raises some
[03:29:33.840 --> 03:29:34.840]  red flags.
[03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:38.000]  But I will be back. This is the fourth hour. I'm Anthony Gutiarty. It's the Alex Jones
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:41.280]  show. A lot more coming up and we're going to play a special report that Alex did yesterday
[03:29:41.280 --> 03:29:43.440]  that is very, very powerful.
[03:29:43.440 --> 03:29:44.440]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:56.360]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:56.360 --> 03:30:02.720]  Is George Clooney ready for his panic room?
[03:30:02.720 --> 03:30:08.600]  Clooney's been a proponent of open borders and unlimited immigration, but now the chickens
[03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:10.520]  have come to his home to roost.
[03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:15.360]  Clooney's $11 million Italian mansion is in a favorite vacation spot of the rich and
[03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:20.720]  famous. Barbara Streisand, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Brad and Angelina, Madonna and
[03:30:20.720 --> 03:30:26.160]  other A-list liberals have all enjoyed champagne wishes and caviar dreams here. But now the
[03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:28.120]  place is overrun with migrants.
[03:30:28.120 --> 03:30:33.080]  As one resident said, a small number of immigrants is not a problem, but there's simply too many
[03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:38.120]  of them. They're not poor, hungry refugees. They're big and strong. But Clooney's building
[03:30:38.120 --> 03:30:43.080]  a fireproof, bomb-proof, attack-resistant panic room. The problem is Clooney's panic
[03:30:43.080 --> 03:30:48.440]  room is one of his other mansions in the UK. So he may have to be ready to bug out in his
[03:30:48.440 --> 03:30:52.800]  own private jet. Such are the problems of the one percent.
[03:30:52.800 --> 03:30:56.120]  Run away with the rich and famous.

[03:31:59.080 --> 03:32:00.680]  Hey everyone.
[03:32:00.680 --> 03:32:04.560]  Farms has been Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:09.120]  to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite
[03:32:09.120 --> 03:32:13.720]  spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[03:32:13.720 --> 03:32:19.200]  this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:19.200 --> 03:32:22.480]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[03:32:22.480 --> 03:32:27.040]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge
[03:32:27.040 --> 03:32:30.120]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking

[03:33:03.640 --> 03:33:11.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.440 --> 03:33:19.080]  Let's ride to see Alex Jones' show. I'm Anthony Gucciardi, and yesterday I shot a video with
[03:33:19.080 --> 03:33:24.280]  Alex, rather Alex shot a video, and I joined in. And it was a great analysis on Black Lives
[03:33:24.280 --> 03:33:29.960]  Matter. It was probably the best one that I've seen and been a part of. And specifically,
[03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:34.960]  it's not just attacking so-called Black Lives Matter and the ideology, it breaks down the
[03:33:34.960 --> 03:33:41.040]  ridiculousness of what's going on, and how it's really just a symptom of the raw deal
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:46.240]  that we've been served as a country. And it's a symptom of the political correctness attack
[03:33:46.240 --> 03:33:50.280]  on ideology and just a whole slew of stuff. So we're going to go ahead and play this video,
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:34:04.160]  and then I'm going to come back and take some more calls and talk about some more news.
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:09.640]  President Obama had a special visitor today. They had a photo op, but then almost all the
[03:34:09.640 --> 03:34:14.400]  three-hour meeting was behind closed doors. No, he wasn't meeting with the head of state.
[03:34:14.400 --> 03:34:18.360]  He never meets with them for three hours. Hell, not even the pope for three hours. No,
[03:34:18.360 --> 03:34:22.960]  ladies and gentlemen, it was the head of Black Lives Matter. And of course, the head of Black
[03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:28.200]  Lives Matter and other community organizers like Obama lives in a home paid for by George
[03:34:28.200 --> 03:34:37.800]  Soros, by George Soros Open Society Foundation Menus. So he's bought and paid for in a house
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:43.520]  with people that are high-level minions of the Open Society Foundation that has the American
[03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:47.920]  people's liberties and freedoms on the menu. Black Lives Matter leaders spent three hours
[03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:53.840]  with President Obama today to demand action in regard to recent officer-involved shootings.
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:34:59.600]  How about demand action with all the cops getting shot on a daily basis? Now, D. Ray
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:05.120]  McKesson, one of the group's most prominent figures, joined several other Black Lives
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:10.400]  Matter leaders at the White House to bring up concrete action the president can take
[03:35:10.400 --> 03:35:17.640]  in order to appease its members. And it goes on from there. Ladies and gentlemen, this
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:21.920]  isn't about police brutality. It isn't about some of the wrongful shootings that happened
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:27.120]  that were totally against. But I'm the guy that wrote books on the police state. I'm
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:31.120]  the guy that made films about it. And I wanted to stop the police from being globalized and
[03:35:31.120 --> 03:35:38.240]  federalized and being tools of tyranny. But now it's about federalizing them. It's about
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:42.640]  the U.N. running them. It's about breaking them to bring in global control locally under
[03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:47.440]  the Strong Cities Initiative. This whole thing is synthetic from the big mega corporations
[03:35:47.440 --> 03:35:53.480]  on down to control society and to create a civil war in this nation. I was the first
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:58.640]  to use that term. Now it's all over the news. And you better believe that while President
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:02.560]  Obama is meeting with this guy and other leaders of Black Lives Matter, government
[03:36:02.560 --> 03:36:08.760]  sorrows funded, just to pull the strings, it's about creating civil unrest to make everything
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:14.760]  in America about race, not about real economic or cultural issues that matter. Because now
[03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:19.800]  America on average is more than, quote, half minority, and they've got the white liberals
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:23.400]  that will vote. However, as long as you say it's racial, this is about ending thinking
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:28.880]  in politics and going all racial, which they claim they were always against. This is the
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:33.760]  political correctness takeover. This is their full push. This is happening in public schools
[03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:39.800]  everywhere. This is their horribly racist plan. They're planning civil unrest coming
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:45.680]  up at the RNC and DNC and right of the election. This is an attempt to destabilize this country.
[03:36:45.680 --> 03:36:52.520]  It's very dangerous. The very same globalist, proto-globalists did this in 1917 in Russia.
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:59.600]  In 1949 in China, they mean business. And it is scary that those cops weren't even cold
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:06.720]  Friday morning in Dallas. And many others were fighting for their lives. And Obama said,
[03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:10.200]  we need to reform the police. That's what happened. And Hillary said, white folks need
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:15.080]  to listen up, as if some white person working a job has something to do with some cop that
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:20.760]  shoots somebody in the back. This is about selling race war in America. And this is directed
[03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:25.120]  by the so-called federal government that's above the law. You better believe this country
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:30.560]  and this world's in trouble. Now let's get up and go on over here. Let's talk to Joe
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:35.560]  Biggs, infowords.com reporter, the Anthony Gucciardi, and get their takes on what we're
[03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:38.240]  facing and what we're dealing with. Joe Biggs.
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:42.720]  Well, just think about this. Four days ago, Duret McKesson was arrested in Baton Rouge
[03:37:42.720 --> 03:37:49.000]  protesting. Then a couple days later was the funeral for the Dallas police officers who
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:54.280]  died in that horrendous attack. And then 24 hours later, you have Duret McKesson, the
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:59.440]  head of Black Lives Matter, in the White House meeting privately with President Obama, a
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:03.760]  man who lives in a home, like he said, by two philanthropists, James and Robin Wood out
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:10.200]  of Baltimore. And they are on the board of the George Zoros Foundation Open Society Institute.
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:13.920]  And he gave $35 million of Black Lives Matter alone just for Ferguson. Understand, this
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:18.080]  is all by design. This is a green line with Facebook and Google. Everybody's saying Black
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:22.120]  Lives Matter. And don't say all lives matter. Remember, and scratching that off the board.
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:27.600]  This is the signal for the weirdo communist rebellion that will then be administered by
[03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:32.040]  billionaires offshore who were tax exempt. Of course, the billionaires offshore want to
[03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:35.800]  raise taxes under a Hillary thing to take our money and give it to them in a bank or
[03:38:35.800 --> 03:38:40.200]  bailout. With a bunch of useful idiots burning their own neighborhoods down. Sorry, go ahead,
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:42.240]  Biggs. I mean, Netanyahu can't even go get a meeting
[03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:47.840]  with Obama, but you have a guy right now who's making $165,000 from the Baltimore
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:53.520]  School District. That's a lot of money. This guy's making $165,000 being given a home to
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:58.960]  live into by George Zoros and his board members to go out and start civil unrest. They're
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:02.720]  going to be at the RNC and they're going to be at the DNC. We've seen emails. We've seen
[03:39:02.720 --> 03:39:08.000]  different reports where these guys are protesting. They're planning huge amounts of people to
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:11.920]  come out, show up and disrupt the RNC. And I'm going to say this right now. The globalists
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:17.560]  have miscalculated. You think you're going to intimidate free speech and intimidate Americans
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:21.120]  by coming out and threatening people and threatening folks. I'm coming there. I'm going to be
[03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:25.600]  on the street every day. And just because you're backed up by George Zoros, the Nazi
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:29.600]  collaborator who just overthrew Ukraine, just because you think you're God, this isn't
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:35.240]  Egypt. This isn't Libya. This isn't Syria. No, this is America. And you're going to
[03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:39.720]  find out, you little bastards and you're filthy handlers, exactly what America stands for
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:45.520]  because we're not violent until you start it. But your time is coming to an end, filth.
[03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:49.280]  And the elite think that they're in control, they're elite maggots that think they would
[03:39:49.280 --> 03:39:54.760]  pull this crap in our country. Obama pushing total racial division and race war and killing
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:59.480]  random police. God help us. This is a criminal force we're dealing with. And I'm calling
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:05.200]  for everyone throughout government, corporations, private life, everywhere to resist this enemy.
[03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:11.720]  With every legal means necessary, but take the gloves off. In the Info War, we're going
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:16.720]  to have a green light here. Fire at will in the Info War, folks. It's going to be intense.
[03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:20.640]  There's going to be thousands upon thousands of people packed into this area. There's tons
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:25.520]  of police. Police from Austin are being shipped up to pull security in Cleveland and other
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:30.040]  departments around the country. I mean, they've even closed down the airspace. Think about
[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:34.480]  the vulcanization where cops are going up there to protect people's free speech by groups
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:38.800]  won by the White House that want to kill cops. I mean, this is so, this is the takedown of
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:43.240]  America by a bunch of goddamn Benedict Arnold's. But what's been going on? What's been leading
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:47.080]  up to this? Al Sharpe and Obama all calling for the federalization of police. We're going
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:52.440]  to have two huge events where we have paid protesters coming in to spark civil unrest.
[03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:55.760]  They're going to say local police can't do this and they want to bring in federalized
[03:40:55.760 --> 03:40:59.760]  police and there's going to be martial law all over the place. Civil emergency. It's
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:04.400]  all a big demonstration. And when that happens, Obama can go for a third term. And I'm telling
[03:41:04.400 --> 03:41:08.240]  you, I used to hear this years ago, I thought I'll never try it. God, who knows? They got
[03:41:08.240 --> 03:41:12.840]  a bunch of social justice warriors. They want to see anybody that's a libertarian or patriot
[03:41:12.840 --> 03:41:18.640]  fricking hung. I mean, they hate free speech. They hate everything. A bunch who live in
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:22.960]  this free open country who had ever worked a day in their lives. They don't even care
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:27.000]  that Bernie Sanders voters had all their votes stolen. They just don't care. They are more
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:33.440]  immoral trash. But think about this. Ohio is an open carry state. Without a permit,
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:37.240]  you can go in an open carry. And now the new Black Panther Party, which is known as the
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:42.200]  terrorist organization, is coming out there with machine guns, with sawed off shotguns,
[03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:45.040]  with all this. They've openly come out and said they're going to be coming out there.
[03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:48.760]  Are they going to be attacked for having guns? No. Is this going to be an opportunity to
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:53.080]  use as a false flag to blame it on the right wingers, so to say? It's going to be interesting.
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:57.360]  I mean, I'm telling you, this week coming up is going to be the most intense time in
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:01.720]  years. Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you right now, I'm not scared. I am excited to
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:05.400]  be able to join the ranks of our forebears that stood up against tyrants and bullies
[03:42:05.400 --> 03:42:10.600]  and trash, and against the British Empire, and against the Mexican dictator, Santa Ana,
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:16.520]  and I mean, I am so honored to stand against the hordes of Mordor, and just the trash.
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:20.080]  And I ask all Americans, whether they race, color, or creed, to stand for free speech
[03:42:20.080 --> 03:42:24.120]  of the First Amendment to understand this is your chance to be involved in an epic battle
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:27.200]  for the Republic. Because let me tell you, they're not just beta testing communist overthrow
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:34.760]  now. This is globalist mega bank run, communist doctrine. They are thinking about going operational
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:39.000]  with a full overthrow of the country. I mean, Obama turned the lights off, folks. I mean,
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:45.160]  coming after the guns, huge inner city populations starving to death, and just demanding martial
[03:42:45.160 --> 03:42:49.320]  law, creating total race war. I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:53.480]  Think about all the Bernier bus people, the people that donated thousands or hundreds
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:57.360]  of thousands of dollars to Bernie Sanders' campaign to defeat Hillary Clinton, and he
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:02.120]  is now bowed down, sold out to the establishment, who he said he was anti-establishment. That
[03:43:02.120 --> 03:43:05.920]  money goes to her. Look at all those people. They're going to come out to show up to RNC
[03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:09.200]  and to the DNC. They're going to be angry. They're going to now start voting for Trump.
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:12.160]  I guarantee you're going to see a huge turn. And that's why they need to make some type
[03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:16.600]  of racial issue early on in the Trump deal and some type of riot. And the word is, from
[03:43:16.600 --> 03:43:19.160]  Rogers, Sheldon and others, and we also have this in the police. I'm going to stop right
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:23.160]  there. This is the breaking news. We already knew this was happening. It's happening now.
[03:43:23.160 --> 03:43:26.760]  When Hillary wanted to demonize Bernie, she would have people attack Trump in Bernie outfits.
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:32.600]  They're going to have people in Bernie outfits attack Trump supporters and free speech supporters,
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:37.720]  anybody who's white to make it racial. Because it's okay if you're another color, you're
[03:43:37.720 --> 03:43:41.800]  taking a white. That's all right. To make it where Bernie supporters see the fight and
[03:43:41.800 --> 03:43:45.720]  the clash and just think, there's a clash between Bernie. Bernie's already throwing
[03:43:45.720 --> 03:43:50.720]  the talent. There's a clash between Bernie and the Trump. I'm going to get Trump. Be
[03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:55.760]  nice to my Bernie because let me tell you I'm Bernie. Listen to you. Listen to Bernie
[03:43:55.760 --> 03:44:01.200]  to tell the truth now. What happened here is I was sold out to Hillary many years ago.
[03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:05.280]  Never worked till I was 40. I promise you all these free goodies because we want you
[03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:11.760]  dependent. All right. I told you not qualified war monger Goldman Sachs biggest corporate
[03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:17.200]  candidate. The truth is I sold you out. Now I think you're dumb. We're going to have
[03:44:17.200 --> 03:44:21.480]  a lot of people dressed up like they support me and then they're going to sit there and
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:26.800]  attack everybody. And when the Trump people fight back, it'll all be about how the Bernie
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:33.360]  people hate Trump. That's to manipulate you dumbasses. All right. Think about all the
[03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:38.840]  money though that Hillary would have not gotten going out and campaigning. The amount
[03:44:38.840 --> 03:44:43.920]  of money that they use Bernie, they use Bernie as a pawn, I think, to get money from these
[03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:47.480]  groups of people who would have never given money to Hillary, knowing the end game would
[03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:52.240]  be that he would pass a war chest for Trump, give out and then use that more money to go
[03:44:52.240 --> 03:44:55.360]  against Trump because that's all we've seen in the mainstream media is how everyone is
[03:44:55.360 --> 03:45:01.760]  attacking him using this racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic narrative, nonstop
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:05.080]  shoving it down people's throats. And every time I go out in the street and ask people,
[03:45:05.080 --> 03:45:08.400]  why don't you like Trump? It's the same thing. Sex is racist. I'm like, they want to feel
[03:45:08.400 --> 03:45:11.920]  good though. They're taught you're good as long as you declare this. Now you're being
[03:45:11.920 --> 03:45:15.840]  taught this so anybody that wants freedom can have this projected on it. And then you
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:19.520]  just piss your pants and say you can't support it. Anthony, it's your turn. No, exactly.
[03:45:19.520 --> 03:45:24.040]  It's sad. Once again, the media is hijacking everything. They hijack the narrative. They
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:27.480]  tell you that you're supposed to care about things. They bring up the whole race issue.
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:30.440]  They bring up all of this. The truth is, I don't think people are buying it. I'm not
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:34.400]  buying it. And what's funny is, I do think Black Lives Matter, and I think everyone in
[03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:39.400]  this room knows that Black Lives Matter. But the issue is that when you say all lives matter,
[03:45:39.400 --> 03:45:43.760]  then you're racist. That is absolutely absurd. It's completely mentally ill. If I was a doctor
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:48.480]  looking at this society, this country as the media shows it, I would declare it completely
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:52.720]  mentally ill. To say it's racist to say all lives matter like Martin Luther King is taking
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:57.200]  not being racist and saying it's racist. Exactly. What genius. So it's mental illness at the
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:01.080]  highest degree. If you ever talked to a crazy person before, they'll just say the opposite.
[03:46:01.080 --> 03:46:04.720]  You know, you come up to it, how are you doing? Stop being mean to me. Right? Just totally
[03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:08.520]  mentally ill. I'd like to work this out with you. Shut up. Yeah. This society is mentally
[03:46:08.520 --> 03:46:12.200]  ill. It is deeply, deeply mentally ill. But the good thing is, I don't think people are
[03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:16.320]  buying into it. Just look at the political correctness. Yes. The redskins, right? They
[03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:20.880]  Oh, the redskins. So many Native Americans being offended by this team. Okay. Maybe even
[03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:26.360]  as offensive. But guess what? 96% said they weren't offended by the natives. Yeah. Exactly.
[03:46:26.360 --> 03:46:29.880]  So let me ask you a question, Anthony. What are they thinking then? Because it isn't working
[03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:33.760]  in the real world in their own weird cult programming, though they keep doubling down.
[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:39.800]  What are they doing? 70% of Americans say they are pissed off and angry about this country
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:45.080]  being where it's heading. Over 60% say that it's never going to get better. Like the stats
[03:46:45.080 --> 03:46:49.560]  are insane. There's 19 stats. You can look up like 50% of Americans just hate everything.
[03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:52.920]  People are depressed. People are angry. People are frustrated. They hate the system. So what
[03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:56.880]  the media does is they have a unique opportunity. They have the opportunity to funnel all that
[03:46:56.880 --> 03:47:00.280]  hatred and anger, which is actually against the establishment where everyone bought into
[03:47:00.280 --> 03:47:04.960]  it and lost. They got the raw deal. They ordered a steak. They got a bloody chunk of meat. They
[03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:09.240]  got the raw deal. So the media then takes that unfiltered rage and hatred and puts a
[03:47:09.240 --> 03:47:13.360]  magnifying glass on these little micro issues. It's all a distraction. They focus all the
[03:47:13.360 --> 03:47:17.120]  rebellion against the foreign occupation, the globalist, all their scams, and have to
[03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:22.320]  get everything onto random local police who most of them are quitting and freaking out
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:26.640]  so crime rates are exploding and the cops are like, I'm out of here. Screw this. I mean,
[03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:29.160]  you can see the plan to bring the country down. They're going to get it. I just got
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:32.520]  chills. We get drawn into it, though. We get drawn into it. We have to cover it instead
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:35.160]  of all the other stuff. We get drawn into it, which is fine because we have to talk about
[03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:40.000]  it. But now, oh, it's Black Lives Matter versus police versus white people. And the average
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:44.560]  childlike person, the average liberal is the rest of development thinks they're an intellectual.
[03:47:44.560 --> 03:47:47.920]  I mean, the leaders like make believe like they're a wonder woman or Superman. They're
[03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:53.880]  not. They just think it's being covered. They're getting attention. They're winning when instead
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:58.120]  total vulcanization is being created and it's legitimizing a police state they're going
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:01.440]  to bring in. It's going to make you want the one you just lost.
[03:48:01.440 --> 03:48:06.560]  You know, it is very, very sad. The truth is, I think Black Lives Matter, as I said in
[03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:11.080]  that video, and as we all agree, I also think all lives matter. And if I'm a racist for
[03:48:11.080 --> 03:48:18.440]  saying that, that is a very, very absurd, disgusting state of affairs. And the point
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:22.760]  that I'm trying to make and the point that Alex, I believe, is making that video is that
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:30.360]  this is a very, very sad funneling of the distrust of government, distrust of the system.
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:34.600]  We've been told that if we go to school and get good grades and go through college and
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:39.120]  be a good worker drone and sitting in your cubicle, you'll have a white picket fence
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:43.960]  and you'll be happy someday. But that's not how it worked out at all. And there's real
[03:48:43.960 --> 03:48:50.680]  discrimination. I've been mistreated by police many times in my life. I went to Utah, went
[03:48:50.680 --> 03:48:55.440]  up to the NSA, if you guys remember years ago, and they basically said their dog was
[03:48:55.440 --> 03:49:02.600]  going to rip my testicles off and eat them. And I'm lucky the dog didn't get me because
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:04.240]  he was hungry.
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:07.880]  So I've had cops mistreat me and there's real discrimination. There really, really is. There's
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:14.760]  real racism. But it's not about white people versus black people, cops versus whatever.
[03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:21.200]  That is an insane division and we're falling for it if we let the media and the so-called
[03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:27.360]  establishment hijack the narrative to where it's all about race-baiting. It's all about
[03:49:27.360 --> 03:49:31.800]  just how we're bad, okay? And now in kindergarten, they say, this is a black person. This is
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:35.760]  a white person. And the kids are like, what? I didn't even notice the difference. This
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:41.840]  is a black person. It's absurd. That's real racism. I'm against real racism. I think all
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:47.120]  lives do matter. I hate the division and I'm tired of it and it's stupid. We need to go
[03:49:47.120 --> 03:49:54.320]  back to preschool and relearn some ethics and understanding of what racism really is.
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:57.880]  And we'll talk a little bit more about trigger warning in the next segment too. I have some
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:02.440]  things to say on that. But first, we're going to blitz through one more call. Alex in Mexico
[03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:08.040]  says he's an ex Bernie Sanders supporter. What is on your mind? You've got about 30
[03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:09.040]  seconds.
[03:50:09.040 --> 03:50:15.600]  Hello. Well, I used to... Well, first, let me say that hilarically, he's a very dangerous
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:22.440]  person for the whole world. And I think she would just eat her young. And I used to support
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:33.560]  Bernie because he was against TPP with completely erases sovereignty of nations. And the last
[03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:41.320]  days I've been hearing Trump speak and he's against... I think he's against TPP. And
[03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:50.160]  what I like about Trump is that he wants to cancel NAFTA with... That actually is seen
[03:50:50.160 --> 03:50:51.160]  as a good...
[03:50:51.160 --> 03:50:54.240]  Right on. We'll talk about it as soon as we get back and have some thoughts about Bernie
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:51:20.920]  as well. And here are your points. 100%. We'll be right back. This is the Outro Challenge.
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:25.880]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better. Due to the
[03:51:25.880 --> 03:51:30.960]  unexplainable improvements in their patients' health, more doctors are calling to order

[03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:04.360]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[03:53:04.360 --> 03:53:09.040]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends,
[03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:13.780]  we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen.
[03:53:13.780 --> 03:53:18.920]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[03:53:18.920 --> 03:53:23.440]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[03:53:23.440 --> 03:53:28.120]  sun. Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're
[03:53:28.120 --> 03:53:31.560]  not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And here's the best
[03:53:31.560 --> 03:53:36.440]  news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast
[03:53:36.440 --> 03:53:41.040]  charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off
[03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:45.640]  the grid gear in addition to the low price for M4Wars listeners. So it's a good time
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:51.000]  to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:54:09.680]  generate maximum electricity with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[03:54:09.680 --> 03:54:13.160]  We are back. I apologize to the caller. We don't have much time at all, and I wanted
[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:17.600]  to hit on a few points. But just to address your point, you were talking about being a
[03:54:17.600 --> 03:54:22.080]  Bernie, ex Bernie Sanders supporter. And you said, you know, it seemed like you support
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:27.840]  a lot of things he did or stood for, but obviously there were some issues. I think that a lot
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:32.720]  of what Bernie stood for was good, okay? Not in the economic sense, but he was against
[03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:38.940]  NSA spying. He was against a lot of the so-called intrusive federal government acts that were
[03:54:38.940 --> 03:54:43.200]  going on, which is kind of funny, right? Because everyone talks about how he's for big government
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:49.120]  like that. But I can see the appeal of the Bernie wave. I can see the appeal at the anti-establishment
[03:54:49.120 --> 03:54:52.920]  in many regards. It's just the little things that people don't notice because everyone
[03:54:52.920 --> 03:54:57.520]  loses themselves to the details, as always, as we've talked about. But I just want to
[03:54:57.520 --> 03:55:05.200]  remind you, infowarslife.com, DNA force is 25% off, which is a very large percentage.
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:10.480]  It's been a very, very long time since we did a deal like that for DNA force. DNA force
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:17.480]  has BioPQQ, which is backed by over 180 clinical studies. It's the real deal. It is, if you
[03:55:17.480 --> 03:55:23.000]  go and look at infowarslife.com, click on the supplement facts panel, look at the ingredients,
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.560]  and actually research each one or scroll down for the description and learn what is in DNA
[03:55:27.560 --> 03:55:32.840]  force. And that's pretty much all you need to know. I mean, this is the most expensive
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:38.080]  product that is made on infowarslife. Just one batch of the really, really good patent
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:42.840]  and stuff costs $30,000. It's not a joke. It's very expensive. The margins are not very
[03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:49.320]  good, but it is a very, very powerful product with CoQ10, mega, mega antioxidant that lasts
[03:55:49.320 --> 03:55:55.560]  a very long time. But the BioPQQ, the science behind it is absolutely 100% absurd.
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:56:01.080]  What I wanted to talk about now, though, is, you know, the Atlantic had a pretty good piece
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:07.200]  called the coddling of the American mind, and it talks about things like trigger warnings.
[03:56:07.200 --> 03:56:11.800]  It talks about the political correctness. You know, college campuses, people are so
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:19.120]  offended. You see, they have higher quality problems now. If we were to look back in history,
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:25.760]  the problems have shifted. You see, it used to be that you were working in a coal mine,
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:31.000]  and your number one concern was getting black lung or not having enough money for food,
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  and that your family could die. You could lose your life because you weren't working
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:40.400]  enough, and you weren't making enough money, and you could get black lung in the coal mines,
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:45.120]  or the breaker boys sorting through the coal and hailing all in their lungs. Well, now
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:51.400]  our problems are that our feelings were hurt from someone's microaggression in school,
[03:56:51.400 --> 03:56:58.240]  or that you saw something online that offended you. That is our quality of problem now. And
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:03.000]  I wanted to show some images just to remind us, guess what? You don't have problems if
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:07.080]  you're offended by microaggressions, and you feel like you were triggered by something
[03:57:07.080 --> 03:57:14.600]  someone said. You don't have problems. Real problems are sitting in a trench afraid that
[03:57:14.600 --> 03:57:19.520]  you're going to die. Getting trench foot where your foot is rotting off, you have to rip
[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:25.600]  your boot off, and it looks like a disgusting mass on your foot is growing, and the most
[03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:31.560]  painful thing you can imagine. Real problems are living in a situation where you're fearful
[03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:38.120]  for your life, where you're starving, where you are being abused deeply. Talk about the
[03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:43.360]  article I saw the day where they found 38 slaves who were being abused and chained and tied
[03:57:43.360 --> 03:57:49.520]  up in some country in Europe. I mean, we're not experiencing real problems when we talk
[03:57:49.520 --> 03:57:54.200]  about and cry about the microaggressions. And I talk to people in my daily life, and
[03:57:54.200 --> 03:57:59.160]  they say, I need a safe space. This is offending me. This is not just jokes. People say this
[03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:03.500]  kind of stuff. And I just want to remind them, the images you're seeing on screen, World
[03:58:03.500 --> 03:58:09.560]  War II, World War I, the coal miners of the 19th century, those people face real problems.
[03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:14.760]  There's still many real problems in the world today, but these are not real problems. These
[03:58:14.760 --> 03:58:21.240]  are nitpicking, high quality problems, the most absurd level of sloth that we have reached,
[03:58:21.240 --> 03:58:25.560]  where we can lounge around and cry about microaggressions. Because guess what? There
[03:58:25.560 --> 03:58:30.120]  aren't other problems to complain about when you don't look at the real issues. I'm Anthony
[03:58:30.120 --> 03:58:34.040]  Gucciardi. This is The Alex Jones Show, and thank you so much for watching. Alex, be
[03:58:34.040 --> 03:58:38.160]  back tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. Please don't get triggered between now and
[03:58:38.160 --> 03:58:40.480]  then, and remember you don't have real problems if that is your issue.
