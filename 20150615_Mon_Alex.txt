[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.880 --> 00:27.600]  jones well there is massive just absolutely massive amounts of key news
[00:27.600 --> 00:31.720]  and information we'll be covering today we're gonna phase out bill berg coverage
[00:31.720 --> 00:35.720]  but finally here's a boil down of the best moments as the globalist were
[00:35.720 --> 00:40.560]  confronted in europe there in austria
[00:40.560 --> 00:58.840]  black limousines with darkened windows converged a hotel where private
[00:58.840 --> 01:04.040]  security guards imposed iron-clad control the limos carried royalty
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.040]  political power brokers and industrial titans to a secret meeting that will
[01:09.040 --> 01:14.760]  last all weekend is known as the builder berg group could their objective be
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.440]  world domination the builder berg group consists of the heads of all of the
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.200]  managing roundtable groups that steer individual countries picture the elite
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.080]  power structure of the world as a giant pyramid with only the elite of the elite
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.360]  at the tip top of the capstone the group has been so secretive that until the mid
[01:36.360 --> 01:44.480]  1980s the controlled corporate media denied its existence into the late
[01:44.480 --> 01:52.120]  1990s coverage only consisted of rare one-line mentions with the rise of the
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.920]  alternative media their stranglehold on information has begun to slip in
[01:56.920 --> 02:00.800]  builder berg's long history many reporters attempting to cover the group
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.520]  have been harassed detained and even jailed the thing that first impressed me most was
[02:06.520 --> 02:12.000]  caused in 1957 by the late great westbrook peggler widely syndicated
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.360]  columnist he wrote two leafy columns about how approximately a hundred leaders
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.720]  of international finance heads of state public officials were meeting behind
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.240]  armed guards closed doors on chuckle island sealed off what are these
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.000]  powerful internationalists doing and why is it so secret why does have armed
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.480]  guards outside why is it sealed off the newspapers totally nori not a word total
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.440]  blackout in the United States 120 of the world's most powerful men heads of
[02:48.440 --> 02:52.920]  state from Europe high officials United States government treasury White House
[02:52.920 --> 02:59.200]  state defense they're setting the world agenda now the reason they want secrecy
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.240]  is calls they're doing evil evil is done under the cover of darkness good works
[03:04.240 --> 03:08.720]  are done in sunshine that they're planning the corporate agenda they're not
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.920]  planning the democratic human journey agenda in my opinion Mussolini had a
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.120]  definition is when the interest of the corporation take completely over from
[03:19.120 --> 03:22.200]  all other interests and that's fascism he said it should probably call
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.920]  corporatism well call it corporatism call it fascism call it neo-lib neo-con there's
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.560]  a whole variety of political words depending on which side of the stripe
[03:30.560 --> 03:34.520]  you come from to start with which describes the thing but what they are
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.880]  describing is the complete end of democracy the end of what matters to
[03:38.880 --> 03:42.160]  people the end of what happens to the human journey and for that reason I

[04:20.800 --> 04:25.800]  give us the power and the foresight and the understanding and the will to stand
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.600]  against your entire agenda including your final plan of world population

[08:58.400 --> 09:06.120]  that we have a full plate today is a very very serious understatement

[09:43.480 --> 09:49.720]  on this compendium of information let me just go over some of the top stories in
[09:49.720 --> 09:55.120]  the stacks here jeb Bush expected to officially announce his running for
[09:55.120 --> 10:01.960]  president today and he made an announcement along with that that he
[10:01.960 --> 10:08.480]  cries and then he's a real person that's an actual quote he cries and
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.680]  hillary's announcing how she's a real person and a commoner as well and she
[10:14.680 --> 10:21.640]  cares about women but jeb cries so everything is okay
[10:22.360 --> 10:29.040]  us archbishop quits after archdiocese charged with cover-up of pedophilia and
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.440]  another bishop in the u.s. has resigned as well and the Vatican is to hold first
[10:34.440 --> 10:42.240]  trial of senior cleric for pedophilia so they're actually going in to begin
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.920]  trying to ferret out the pedophile network that has basically taken over
[10:47.920 --> 10:50.760]  much of the Catholic Church and it's not just the Catholic Church it's
[10:50.760 --> 10:55.160]  Congress it's government agencies all over the world that's what this disease
[10:55.160 --> 11:04.760]  does over and over again throughout history from the Bible and Sodom and
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.480]  Gomorrah coming to the door and saying give us your family give us your kids
[11:09.480 --> 11:17.840]  to today it's the same story we're gonna be looking at that report
[11:17.840 --> 11:24.800]  GOP leadership's latest obama trade ploy revealed a small business tax hike that
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.200]  violates the GOP's anti-tax pledge well the goal is shut down small businesses
[11:30.200 --> 11:34.760]  after all you didn't build it that's what globalism is so we know what the
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.800]  agenda is open borders global corporations tax exempt small businesses
[11:39.800 --> 11:45.520]  tax hikes that's what Boehner and Ryan and all these people are going to bring
[11:45.520 --> 11:53.880]  it isn't that just special in fact I just actually found the articles out of the
[11:53.880 --> 12:05.360]  telegraph jeb bush I cry I cry I'm introverted but I want to be president
[12:08.440 --> 12:14.880]  Russia says it will retaliate if US weapons stationed on its borders are
[12:14.880 --> 12:20.920]  deployed again Russia says it will retaliate if US weapons are stationed
[12:20.920 --> 12:28.160]  on its borders we're going to be going over that as well here's another
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.080]  headline just give me an idea of what's in the stack here Michigan police sees
[12:32.080 --> 12:39.760]  kids from family for camping just last week it was an 11-year-old his parents
[12:39.760 --> 12:46.160]  were an hour late home they got home at six the child got home at 430 the 11
[12:46.160 --> 12:52.280]  year-old played basketball in his backyard and was taken from the family
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.760]  they were charged with neglect and the news media reported it with a straight
[12:58.760 --> 13:07.560]  face like they were a horrible family everyone I know has had to wait for
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.200]  their parents to get home by the age of 9 10 11 12 but that's not even the
[13:12.200 --> 13:19.040]  issue did the youth not know where the hidden key was it doesn't matter this is
[13:19.040 --> 13:23.560]  the prison state that we live in it's the laws that need to be changed ladies
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.000]  and gentlemen
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.080]  continuing Greece's debt drama the possible scenarios that could bring down
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.160]  the euro but three or four separate times they forced massive tax increases in
[13:38.160 --> 13:42.200]  Greece massive sell-offs of their infrastructure and notice it never pays
[13:42.200 --> 13:50.360]  off the debt it never fixes the problems because it's not designed to the
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.840]  debts have been rigged by signing countries on to derivatives that are
[13:54.840 --> 14:00.200]  impossible to pay back if you gave the private banks all the debt in the world
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.880]  but it's the private mega banks that created the derivatives
[14:05.880 --> 14:14.120]  continuing some good news France banned sale of Monsanto herbicide roundup in
[14:14.120 --> 14:21.560]  nurseries in plant stores in public challenge to Obama family of drone
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.720]  victim ask what is the value of an innocent life
[14:26.720 --> 14:36.400]  continuing shock video rioting migrants attempt to hijack truck heading for the
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.400]  UK we're going to break that down in a moment gang's intent on getting access
[14:40.400 --> 14:47.320]  to countries generous welfare system and meanwhile the UN the Vatican and every
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.680]  other globalist organization this is an ABC news are saying open the borders up
[14:52.680 --> 14:58.360]  it's your job to basically take on unlimited third world populations as the
[14:58.360 --> 15:05.120]  Middle East Africa Asia and Latin America collapse you've got to take all
[15:05.120 --> 15:12.280]  these people on and then give them free everything and give them voting cards and
[15:12.280 --> 15:19.240]  let them vote this is how the West is being conquered and it doesn't help the
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.960]  third world populations at the same time before I get into all that and
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.960]  there's a lot more in science news and economic news I'm going to drill into
[15:27.960 --> 15:37.440]  all this news today there's the huge report on the Supreme Court races the
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.960]  clock on gay marriage Obamacare and more and they're already sending out
[15:41.960 --> 15:47.680]  announcements trial balloons that oh get ready for Obamacare to be reaffirmed by
[15:47.680 --> 15:54.360]  the US Supreme Court a second time and I've had so many constitutional lawyers
[15:54.360 --> 15:58.920]  on from across the spectrum the rulings we're seeing out of the Supreme
[15:58.920 --> 16:06.080]  Court are now anti-gun they were pro-gun just six years ago they are now
[16:06.080 --> 16:12.600]  completely anti-border they are completely anti-sovereignty they are
[16:12.600 --> 16:19.640]  totally pro-abortion so we saw the court turn back towards the Constitution and
[16:19.640 --> 16:28.320]  then suddenly veer veer and an example of that Supreme Court won't revive North
[16:28.320 --> 16:37.800]  Carolina abortion law saying you've got to show somebody an ultrasound now when
[16:37.800 --> 16:44.000]  you go in at the second trimester and they know you want to keep the baby they
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.800]  show you an ultrasound basically hoping they can find something wrong so they
[16:49.800 --> 16:52.720]  can convince you to have an abortion this is how the system is basically
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.600]  geared doesn't mean the doctors and nurses themselves are bad and the
[16:58.600 --> 17:03.120]  Supreme Court says no it violates the doctors free speech to show you the
[17:03.120 --> 17:08.240]  human so does it violate their free speech if they don't show you holes in
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.040]  your heart with an ultrasound or if you have a broken leg maybe their free
[17:12.040 --> 17:14.960]  speech says they don't want to tell you that you have a broken leg so they just
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.240]  tell you to go home on it maybe a compound fracture of the wrist a bone
[17:19.240 --> 17:22.920]  sticking out you know what I don't feel like telling you that's broken so I'm
[17:22.920 --> 17:29.080]  not going to tell you that's right it's the free speech of the doctor to not
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.440]  tell you there are other options that sounds completely reasonable if you're
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.840]  about to kill a child in fact the feds have been pushing and and Planned
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.240]  Parenthood have been pushing the eugenics league you know they changed their name
[17:43.240 --> 17:49.720]  they've been pushing and have gotten it successfully passed in many states to
[17:49.720 --> 17:57.600]  ban these mall kiosk that show you a 3d shot of your baby they have kiosk in
[17:57.600 --> 18:02.640]  malls and then they send you to their facility to actually do the scan they
[18:02.640 --> 18:07.840]  claimed it was medically dangerous maybe or in other states they claim well
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.720]  you're not a medical company so you're cutting in on the medical mafia so we're
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.720]  going to get laws passed a whole bunch of states have done this so you can't see
[18:16.720 --> 18:23.320]  the baby it's okay to kill them but we're not going to show you the baby in fact
[18:23.320 --> 18:28.000]  most medical centers will not even show you a 3d shot even though they're for
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.040]  decades the ultrasounds all basically have it
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.440]  there's the headline FDA warns against keepsake ultrasounds oh it's safe when
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.480]  the hospitals do it over and over again when the doctor does it over and over
[18:43.480 --> 18:51.600]  again but when you go to get it done in you know Southern California well we've
[18:51.600 --> 18:56.960]  got to ban it now the truth is it was cutting in on the abortion mill because
[18:56.960 --> 19:01.160]  you could humanize it it wasn't just a blob of tissue so this signals where the
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.360]  Supreme Court goes there's another article out today saying they get ready
[19:05.360 --> 19:13.040]  for justice Kennedy a relic of the great society to support Obamacare because
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.600]  it helps poor people yeah by cutting the quality of the care death panels
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.520]  turning doctors into nothing but minions of government computers following
[19:21.520 --> 19:29.760]  orders it's a VA model the voice of opposition past justice Kennedy may save

[23:59.440 --> 24:27.720]  you're on personal Jesus someone to hear your prayers let me someone who give
[24:27.720 --> 24:34.760]  me an example of a microcosm of how much trouble this society's in personal and
[24:34.760 --> 24:38.680]  how the yuppies the trendies the proto
[24:40.720 --> 24:51.000]  future humans how upside down this world has gotten I talk a lot about Michelle
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.200]  Obama and the bizarreness the ridiculousness of having the first lady
[24:58.200 --> 25:06.720]  be the figurehead of the federal lunch program lecturing adults and children
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.160]  on what we're supposed to eat and then you go look at what she recommends it
[25:12.160 --> 25:19.280]  isn't stay away from GMOs it isn't stay away from trans fats it isn't stay away
[25:19.280 --> 25:26.400]  from toxic additives it's keep your calories low don't have any fat
[25:26.520 --> 25:40.520]  MSG is fine as pertains fine and you read what they're pushing what they're
[25:40.520 --> 25:50.000]  recommending it is a reduced calorie diet it's social engineering and what
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.720]  business does the federal government have telling us individually what to
[25:54.720 --> 26:03.040]  eat and so maybe every four or five months I will get Mexican food from a
[26:03.040 --> 26:09.560]  place called Guero's in Austin Texas that's pretty close to our office and I
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.840]  guess that translates to the gringo or something and the Mexican foods okay it's
[26:15.840 --> 26:22.160]  a little bit simple but it's decent and so I said hey I think I want to eat out
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.480]  today I didn't bring any lunch today will somebody go pick me up some Guero's
[26:27.480 --> 26:35.400]  I'd like to see their menu and they said okay it says on their website it's
[26:35.400 --> 26:44.080]  Meatless Monday and I went wait a minute is it that Michelle Obama's directive and
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.920]  sure enough they say on their website that they're basically following Michelle
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.880]  Obama's directive Meatless Monday at Guero's we're proud to be part of the
[26:57.880 --> 27:04.960]  national initiative to help promote healthy eating there's a reason mom
[27:04.960 --> 27:10.760]  always told you to eat your vegetables but now your mom is big sister Michelle
[27:10.760 --> 27:22.800]  Obama this is the cult so that's it I'm not going to eat at Guero's again I'm
[27:22.800 --> 27:37.840]  done forever schools out forever it is to quote the great Alice Cooper I don't
[27:37.840 --> 27:42.240]  live in Nazi Germany where I eat what the Fuhrer says by the way the Nazi
[27:42.240 --> 27:47.800]  Party told people what to eat I don't live in some freakish Soviet system under
[27:47.800 --> 27:54.840]  Joe Stalin either and it's all about big corporate combines being able to
[27:54.840 --> 28:02.760]  shovel crap food on people and then have us accept this new austerity you go
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.600]  into whole paycheck I mean whole foods and they've got magazines everywhere
[28:07.600 --> 28:14.240]  about the new austerity how it's cool to be poor and these trendies these trust
[28:14.240 --> 28:21.800]  fund kids will go live out of vans and things and not take bath just to show
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.720]  how cool they are when all they're getting ready to do is accept the new
[28:27.720 --> 28:35.920]  poverty that's coming to this country and so I'm digressing here it's just such
[28:35.920 --> 28:43.040]  mind control such cultural sickness if you want to be a vegetarian more power
[28:43.040 --> 28:47.600]  to you if you get the right protein there are some real health benefits to
[28:47.600 --> 28:54.080]  it there is no doubt about it meat overall has some health benefits if it's
[28:54.080 --> 29:03.440]  clean if it's good but this is not about being reasonable and having food
[29:03.440 --> 29:09.840]  protein that is produced humanely this is about taking over society in fact
[29:09.840 --> 29:15.720]  maybe you guys can search engine it it's the megapolis cartoons PSAs they
[29:15.720 --> 29:22.200]  showed a British school children in the UK where it shows the world in 20 years
[29:22.200 --> 29:28.840]  and you only get meat on your birthday and the government computer tells you
[29:28.840 --> 29:33.960]  where you work and what you do the Watson IBM computers already say which
[29:33.960 --> 29:38.640]  vets to treat which one's not to now they're going over Obamacare now they're
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.680]  going over pet care I saw an IBM commercial this morning but the globalist
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.680]  program the computers you understand it's tyranny it's the opposite of local
[29:48.680 --> 29:52.920]  it's evil we're on the March the Empire's on the run if you want to have
[29:52.920 --> 29:57.640]  veggie day that's Alex Jones don't do it when Michelle says work man I can't

[30:16.680 --> 30:22.480]  opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a

[33:23.360 --> 33:31.040]  it's Alex Jones that's right you know what's funny I was
[33:31.040 --> 33:36.000]  actually thinking about getting vegetarian enchiladas but I wanted to
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.320]  see if they had a special on that because they have daily specials and then my
[33:42.320 --> 33:45.320]  cousin Buckley read in here and he said you didn't know Guero's is Bill
[33:45.320 --> 33:51.320]  Clinton's favorite restaurant in Texas and I was like no I didn't know that but
[33:51.320 --> 33:53.640]  see I only go there every once in a while I've been going there since it
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.240]  opened 20 something years ago down on South Congress and I just really
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.200]  realized you've got to investigate every business you do business with and if
[34:03.200 --> 34:08.240]  they're globalist and if they're socialist italitarians or fascist you
[34:08.240 --> 34:13.880]  cannot support them period one of the only powers we've got left other than
[34:13.880 --> 34:21.080]  the cartridge box go into the guns is voting with our dollars and we've had
[34:21.080 --> 34:28.160]  devastating success on GMOs on roundup and again Michelle Obama's not worried
[34:28.160 --> 34:34.400]  about any of that and these big corporations that get the contracts for
[34:34.400 --> 34:39.360]  the horrible cruddy school lunch food that's worse than supermax prison food
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.040]  literally and then all these trendy restaurants say sorry you can only eat
[34:45.040 --> 34:54.200]  vegetables today mommy says your mommy Michelle Obama isn't my mommy so I just
[34:54.200 --> 34:56.800]  ordered beef enchiladas from another place it's even better they just take
[34:56.800 --> 35:08.640]  longer and that's it we got to stop going convenience I'm gonna throw up look
[35:08.640 --> 35:12.080]  at this it wouldn't be the first place in town named after a president's order
[35:12.080 --> 35:17.000]  during 1995 meal at Guero's president Bill Clinton ordered rest of chicken
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.880]  taco one beef taco one tamale and guacamole that order was immoralized on
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.960]  the Mexican joints menu as the L president say along with the tagline he
[35:28.960 --> 35:36.760]  ate all of his oh isn't it cute but wait there was meat on that Bill Clinton
[35:36.760 --> 35:43.840]  I'm done talking about it it's just a window into these control freaks is it a
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.480]  free country when the first lady tells you what to eat
[35:49.480 --> 35:56.960]  that's not liberal that's not more freedom that's not your business and
[35:56.960 --> 36:03.240]  it's the GMO and the additives and the trans fats and all the weird crud in the
[36:03.240 --> 36:07.920]  food that's making people's pancreas is fail it's them I've looked it up we had
[36:07.920 --> 36:18.080]  higher caloric intake in the 50s than we do now people ate like pigs breakfast
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.640]  lunch and dinner and they didn't look like this we're bloated because of
[36:24.640 --> 36:31.880]  toxicity it's a fact we have record cancer record thyroid problems record
[36:31.880 --> 36:37.280]  issues across the board because of all sorts of dietary deficiencies because the
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.160]  soils are played out you add a bunch of chemicals to that your body holds water
[36:42.160 --> 36:50.800]  adds fat to try to basically buffer all the garbage that's known I've got so
[36:50.800 --> 36:54.560]  much news to get to in a short time to get there I've got to get into this TPP
[36:54.560 --> 36:57.880]  news they're trying to bring it back Wednesday or Thursday they're talking
[36:57.880 --> 37:01.480]  about tagging it on to some other bills that's in the news senator sessions is
[37:01.480 --> 37:09.080]  warned in the Senate senator sessions is warned in the house not related ones
[37:09.080 --> 37:16.040]  from Texas and the house ones from Alabama and sure enough Boehner and
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.320]  Obama and others are running around on the news saying it's a good thing we've
[37:21.320 --> 37:29.360]  got to try to get it passed this week Paul Ryan is truly sickening but to tell
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.640]  you how unpopular all of this is even Hillary Clinton is saying well she
[37:33.640 --> 37:36.840]  doesn't know about it it needs to be tweaked how about it needs to be
[37:36.840 --> 37:46.400]  released let me ask you a question can you tweak a dead animal in the ditch no
[37:46.400 --> 37:52.080]  you throw it in a hole or you let buzzards eat it you can't tweak something
[37:52.080 --> 37:57.480]  that's a giant con job we've got three sections of it each section alone ends
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.040]  this country sovereignty as we know it I mean it's just a giant nail in the
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.000]  coffin it is incredible and because each section says and the commission can
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.720]  change this to do anything they want in any time and you've got to abide by it's
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.280]  like article 30 of the UN charter where it says you've got all these rights
[38:13.280 --> 38:19.200]  unless we say no it's not if you say it's then suspended and you can change it
[38:19.200 --> 38:24.040]  whenever you want I want to get into Hillary that made her disgusting
[38:24.040 --> 38:29.880]  announcement yesterday and tie that into jeb bush in a minute it shows the
[38:29.880 --> 38:37.440]  disconnect the arrogance the false aplomb or maybe it's not maybe they're
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.240]  gonna win you've got these crime families that we know work together at
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.640]  Mina work together in narcotics trafficking work together in money
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.960]  laundering work together in the Central Intelligence Agency on record Bush
[38:48.960 --> 38:52.960]  senior when he was head of the CIA directly ran Hillary and Bill when they
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.280]  were in Europe and that's all been partially declassified totally staged
[38:58.280 --> 39:10.520]  the Clintons are the bushes that's why Bush 43 calls Clinton Bubba brother and
[39:10.520 --> 39:23.000]  the the the matriarch Barbara Bush calls him son I'm going to throw up and so
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.040]  we've got these two boxers in a Don King heavyweight championship and everybody's
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.440]  still gonna go basically pay for pay-per-view was gonna buy into it and
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.240]  watch the Don King boxing match even though it's as funny as a three dollar
[39:37.240 --> 39:46.880]  bell well it's the same thing here these people are a joke their agenda is
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.840]  exactly the same just different rhetoric and it's not even that different they
[39:50.840 --> 39:56.440]  all support open borders they all support DPP they all support abortion
[39:56.440 --> 40:02.320]  Jeb Bush is a gun grabber and as soon as he starts running against Hillary I
[40:02.320 --> 40:05.360]  will have affiliates most of our affiliates are really smart and good
[40:05.360 --> 40:10.760]  people but this has happened before call me and say stop bashing Jeb he's not
[40:10.760 --> 40:15.080]  perfect but he's running against Hillary that's how the scam works I mean Jeb
[40:15.080 --> 40:21.520]  Bush looks like a demon he acts like a demon because he is a demon we need to
[40:21.520 --> 40:28.760]  see sanity rain here like we saw tea party Republicans libertarian
[40:28.760 --> 40:35.240]  Republicans with real liberal Democrats who are not insane demand that
[40:35.240 --> 40:42.920]  their elected representatives their servants vote down the TPP it's secret
[40:42.920 --> 40:48.920]  the three sections we got are a giant rape job this is the United States not
[40:48.920 --> 40:54.560]  North Korea where we have hegemonic families where hereditary
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.920]  dynasties are formed one senator said the presidency is not a crown to be
[41:00.920 --> 41:10.360]  passed between two families but they're not even two families just like IBM was
[41:10.360 --> 41:14.440]  worried about trust busting so they created Microsoft as their front
[41:14.440 --> 41:24.560]  company the bushes created the Clintons and they run them and they run the
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.400]  Obama administration right now that's why the Republican leadership when it
[41:29.400 --> 41:34.440]  comes down to it is defending Obama and carrying his water on getting your guns
[41:34.440 --> 41:41.880]  on opening the borders on Obamacare on every other scam because it's one sick
[41:41.880 --> 41:47.360]  group with a bunch of pedophiles working for them who they can burn any time
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.760]  they want that's why they go and they recruit the dentist
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.640]  hazards out of nowhere to put them in charge everywhere because they can call
[41:55.640 --> 41:58.400]  them up and don't have to pay them don't even have to give them payoffs they go
[41:58.400 --> 42:07.040]  listen you want the FBI to raid you next week you vote like we say or we're
[42:07.040 --> 42:12.640]  gonna come arrest you perv boom they slam the phone down that's how this
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.960]  country's run with blackmail as the aircraft landed Mina to this day C-130s
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.640]  full of cocaine so heavy they come in hard the trucks are unloaded it's
[42:23.640 --> 42:30.000]  shipped into your communities and you love it I'm gonna be Terry Reed it was
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.560]  CIA at the airfield saw all of them out there just it was a party that's why
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.640]  they keep drugs illegal so they could put you in your family in prison if
[42:40.640 --> 42:46.640]  you're dumb enough to use it or they planted on you yeah this is hardcore
[42:46.640 --> 42:53.000]  radio I've already gone so far why not just go all the way somebody's got to
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.280]  tell the truth we're gonna get into Bill Clinton his latest you can't have
[42:56.280 --> 43:04.000]  people walking around with guns close quote can we find the Diane Feinstein
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.720]  Mrs. and Mr. America turn them all in I want to find that clip as well oh but
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.360]  nobody wants our guns they've just banned them in every city and country they
[43:15.360 --> 43:20.360]  get a hold of globalist oh but nobody wants your guns that's a conspiracy
[43:20.360 --> 43:24.320]  theory too just like the death panels or Obamacare doubling and tripling cost
[43:24.320 --> 43:30.240]  yeah and there is no Bilderberg group right remember that lie mm-hmm and there's
[43:30.240 --> 43:33.640]  no cancer viruses in the vaccines and they don't give you diabetes type one
[43:33.640 --> 43:39.800]  even though it says it on the insert of the MMR shot and they just think you're
[43:39.800 --> 43:43.840]  dumb and they just think you won't go look it up
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.160]  by the way Terry Reed wrote compromise Clinton Bush in the CIA he's been on the
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.320]  show probably 15 times over the years we can't get a hold of him if anybody
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.240]  knows how to get a hold of him I want him back on the show please send us his
[43:58.240 --> 44:01.960]  phone number or contact info or get a hold up and tell him to call us I want
[44:01.960 --> 44:07.280]  him on the show I know he didn't work with world that daily like 10 years ago
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.680]  maybe you can call Joseph Farah guys I want him I don't care how we do it I
[44:11.680 --> 44:14.760]  want him on
[44:14.760 --> 44:22.160]  and I want to get Larry Nichols on too we used to have his number but that
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.720]  doesn't work and I know he's still he used to work for Bill Clinton basically
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.600]  his unofficial chief of staff for decades he could tell you everything I
[44:29.600 --> 44:35.520]  can't believe we're having to warm back up the research you know take it out of
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.720]  deep freeze on the Clintons I'm having flashbacks I'm getting nauseated looking
[44:40.720 --> 44:47.520]  at Hillary a narcissistic murdering witch and these throngs of idiot women who
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.080]  have such weak identities that that they go oh you just don't like Hillary
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.160]  because she's a woman not a likers he's a crime boss just like I don't like Jeff
[44:55.160 --> 45:01.800]  Bush he's a piece of crap that's why I don't like him I'm sick of it get out of
[45:01.800 --> 45:07.400]  your identity politics have some basic smarts have some basic dignity have some
[45:07.400 --> 45:13.800]  basic common sense you morons and you make me want to throw up I'm gonna stop

[48:29.200 --> 48:34.120]  unrest in Maryland the civil unrest other areas is because of guns Maryland is
[48:34.120 --> 48:37.920]  some of the strictest gun laws out there and they've not been having shooting
[48:37.920 --> 48:43.080]  problems against the police there or vice versa it's been cops shooting people
[48:43.080 --> 48:49.000]  that's questionable so well you can't have the cops with guns this is them
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.160]  inserting the demonization of the second amendment wherever they can
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.680]  towards federalization as the solution as Al Sharpton admitted a month ago so
[48:57.680 --> 49:03.800]  here's Bill Clinton the coke head criminal back in our face running a
[49:03.800 --> 49:09.680]  fake election against Jeb Bush and who knows what deal they've got behind the
[49:09.680 --> 49:15.080]  scenes who they plan on installing Jeb or Hillary but boy give me a barf bag
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.560]  let's go to that clip what's killing all these communities is that everybody
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.160]  thinks every tomorrow is gonna be like yesterday your toast you can deal with
[49:24.160 --> 49:27.720]  poverty adversity anything long as they think you could be different the
[49:27.720 --> 49:31.960]  Baltimore thing came on the heels of what happened in Ferguson and what
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.240]  happened in New York City and all these other places and there's a big
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.200]  national movement about whether the lives of young African-American men count
[49:40.200 --> 49:44.320]  you know like life's matter yeah yeah you can't have a bunch of people walking
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.560]  around with guns I used to tell people whenever when we did Bosnia
[49:48.560 --> 49:55.280]  Kosovo anything like that you get enough people with weapons around and there
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.800]  will be unintended consequences simply incredible we're gonna come back with a
[50:00.800 --> 50:07.600]  Feinstein and our inner clip earlier ladies and gentlemen the West on record
[50:07.600 --> 50:16.520]  funded KLA al-Qaeda out of Albania to invade and attack the Serbs when their
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.720]  military repulsed the al-Qaeda attack they were called terrorist and their
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.800]  whole country was bombed their water plants everything and I'm not saying the
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.400]  Serbs were perfect but the UN's own report said the Muslims and Croats
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.240]  killed double what the Serbs did and started it and then that war criminal
[50:33.240 --> 50:39.160]  engaged in that but this is the UN model of victim disarmament we'll be back

[54:00.880 --> 54:06.840]  the Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[54:06.840 --> 54:25.640]  because there's a war on for your mind
[54:25.640 --> 54:33.120]  by the way Shaquille O'Neal someone controlling I guess his Facebook put out
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.640]  some questions about the official story of 9-11 I mean it's admitted now that
[54:36.640 --> 54:40.920]  Saudi Arabia was at least behind the supposed hijackers and that our
[54:40.920 --> 54:45.440]  government stood down so all of us there 9-11 truthers all deserve a major
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.920]  apology from the left and the right we've been proven correct yet again I
[54:50.920 --> 54:54.480]  mean of course government stage events of course governments allow attacks to
[54:54.480 --> 55:01.000]  take place of course government provocateur but Shaquille O'Neal said
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  oh I'm going to fire whoever did that and that was basically the end of it so a
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  little bird told me we're gonna try to get in touch with him today on air I'll
[55:14.000 --> 55:24.040]  leave it that we'll see what happens but truly disgusting there's nothing worse
[55:24.040 --> 55:30.800]  than bloated cowards in the system who sit there and act like it's
[55:30.800 --> 55:36.200]  weird to point out that 9-11's been used to take our freedoms and set up a
[55:36.200 --> 55:43.600]  police state and terror is what's being used to end our republic as we know it
[55:43.600 --> 55:48.560]  and now the anti-terror initiatives are pointed at veterans conservatives
[55:48.560 --> 55:52.840]  libertarians gun owners and local governments this is a foreign globalist
[55:52.840 --> 56:01.920]  takeover the tools of war will be used on the people and it's not for security
[56:01.920 --> 56:08.560]  now the CIA came out last week and blamed Bill Clinton saying he dismantled
[56:08.560 --> 56:13.040]  the anti-terror system that's actually true Bill Clinton could have killed been
[56:13.040 --> 56:17.160]  lot and repeatedly in ordered standouts and did dismantle a bunch of the
[56:17.160 --> 56:22.240]  networks watching al-qaeda but it's beyond that but notice now the CIA is
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.080]  trying to distance itself from what happened because they know it's all
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.680]  coming out and how are people gonna feel when all of what happened on 9-11 came
[56:31.680 --> 56:34.920]  out do you really think you're gonna get away with something that big you're
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.120]  not oh there might not be trials there might not even be a rest but in the
[56:39.120 --> 56:45.960]  court of public opinion and the documents it's all coming out but you just
[56:45.960 --> 56:49.320]  heard Bill Clinton go you can't have people with guns and they talked about
[56:49.320 --> 56:56.160]  a government with guns you see opposing the UN's guns the UN and NATO
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.800]  bombing Belgrade bombing Kosovo and to this day every week it's in the foreign
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.920]  news that radical Muslims move into new towns and cities and murder the
[57:06.920 --> 57:13.160]  Christians when it becomes a majority Muslim area the killing start and they
[57:13.160 --> 57:18.920]  go oh it's liberal allow more in do more it's good it's loving I've got some
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.560]  sickening Hillary Clinton clips and Bill Clinton clips that are coming up the
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.080]  next hour but speaking of that UN humans right chief urges Europe and I'm gonna
[57:29.080 --> 57:34.680]  show this video a shock video rioting migrants attempt to hijack trucks heading
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.960]  for the UK we'll show some of this video now as I talk over it UN humans right
[57:39.960 --> 57:45.960]  chief urges Europe to accept more migrants not illegal aliens not people
[57:45.960 --> 57:49.520]  coming in out of Eastern Europe or coming out of Africa or coming out of
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.560]  Asia or coming out of no no no this came out under Tony Blair at the channel at
[57:54.560 --> 57:59.880]  the French side they load the illegals up from all over the world basically they
[57:59.880 --> 58:04.200]  get on trucks they get on top of them and the British police don't stop them
[58:04.200 --> 58:07.680]  when they drive up out of the tunnel there's famous footage of them cheering
[58:07.680 --> 58:16.440]  as they jump off trucks and trains giant hordes as the third world collapses the
[58:16.440 --> 58:20.640]  answer is bring them into collapsing Europe bring them into collapsing us
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.680]  give them voting cards and within just a few years they're police officers who
[58:25.680 --> 58:30.080]  can't even speak English ruling over us the governor Joe Biggs is going up
[58:30.080 --> 58:33.520]  their next week to report on it the governor of Hawaii can't even speak
[58:33.520 --> 58:39.120]  English that's how you conquer the West and the globalists have done a great
[58:39.120 --> 58:43.080]  job while they sit offshore on their yachts listening to Switzerland and a
[58:43.080 --> 58:49.360]  few countries that don't let people in everywhere else is brought down
[58:49.360 --> 58:53.520]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as

[58:57.200 --> 59:02.320]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[59:02.320 --> 59:07.280]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.000]  40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:48.600]  was 1998 it was a British newspaper article but they had the video embedded
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.320]  and it was shocking as trucks came out of one lane and trains on another like
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.480]  the South American train of death or Central American train of death people
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:06.640]  are on the sides on the top and on trucks and they would cheer and run past the
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.880]  police as they got off and it turned out Tony Blair you can look this up this does
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:19.280]  come up had done a secret deal with the EU well now the EU just says you will set
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.480]  quotas of the millions of illegals you're gonna bring in and again I have
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.520]  nothing against the desperate people out of Africa the desperate people out of
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.560]  the Middle East the desperate people out of Eastern Europe the desperate people
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.560]  that are pouring in but man folks have you been to India have you been to
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.360]  Africa I haven't but I've seen long-form documentaries and stuff I've talked to
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.600]  folks that have been there I mean you want to talk about scary and then you
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:55.560]  add welfare to it game over sure a lot of these immigrants if you get them there
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.880]  and there's not welfare they are hard-working but there are criminal
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.280]  gangs that feed off of them and organize them and now government mainly
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.880]  liberals are doing this all over the world this is their clowered and piven
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.760]  checkmate this is how they bring the folks in to socialize and then bring
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:20.560]  down the country we're gonna play that video with audio as a shocked Kiwi
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:29.920]  videotapes it who was visiting France about to go under the tunnel and it is
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:39.200]  just shocking shocking what's going on Joe Biggs is going out to Hawaii one of
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.840]  our hardest-working reporters he wanted to take us vacation slash working
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.800]  vacation and I said absolutely please go but he's gonna be documenting the
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.560]  giant immigrant shanty towns that are there now lining major highways and
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  how they just let the illegals come in off boats and ships now to the point of
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.760]  it locals and I mean the actual Hawaiians are freaking out about what's
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.720]  going on and it's one thing of the invaders bring you know running water
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.920]  and television you could still say that's bad if it's not your culture but
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.000]  what when people just bring disease and poverty and again people say well why
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.560]  don't you support the globalist and their sterilization program I want to
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.720]  industrialize the third world I want to build these people up once you
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:31.680]  industrialize you have on average 1.4 children within one generation the
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.040]  globalist on record on the Royal Commission put out in 49 out of England
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.960]  had a plan to not develop the third world create a third world bloom in
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.520]  population and then use those populations to keep the third world
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:51.680]  destabilized so they could extract their resources easily and then use those
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.800]  third world populations as a weapon to bring down the west this is a military
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.600]  operation and the globalist put a human face on these migrants on these
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.160]  immigrants you bet they're humans just like if I was getting off the Titanic
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.760]  and I was in the boat with my wife and my kids and the water was already coming
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.520]  up to the very edge of the boat and splashing over and we're bailing and
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.440]  there's 50 people right off our our our bow begging to be let on in the freezing
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:32.120]  water if you let them climb over the ship is going to go under it's going and
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.000]  that's the plan it's cloud heaven in fact it doesn't matter we're already done
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.160]  it did you all see you'll all see just enjoy because the whole third world's
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.400]  collapsing they're going to collapse it into the west and it's going to go
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.280]  bottom-up then they're going to seal the borders entirely and bring in a police
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.920]  state I mean it it's amazing but not before enough are brought in to divide
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.640]  and conquer this is how we're being taken over the film the magnificent seven
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.400]  is about to be remade story of a village oppressed by both bandidos and
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.080]  federales the villagers realized that until they were able to defend
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.760]  themselves they would always be slaves and victims so they hired professionals
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.720]  not to be their protectors but to teach them how to defend themselves it's a
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.280]  timeless tale of the power of the community of posse comatose our
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.240]  founders knew that permanent standing armies would mean a permanent state of
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:33.000]  war abroad and tyranny at home and as we've maintained the largest standing
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.800]  army in the world we have had a permanent state of war if our increasingly
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.160]  militarized domestic law enforcement were an army it would be the fourth largest
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.480]  in the world the concepts of a militia and a posse kept power in the hands of
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.440]  the people to be led as needed by a few professionals until we reclaim that
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.440]  constitutional heritage we will remain helpless peons for ever wars calm I'm

[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.680]  apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.920]  help the government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.320]  is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.760]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.200]  communities if you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.600]  that happen mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two

[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:12.520]  department I am inside I have two words for you the dramatic scene played out
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.480]  in front of our cameras parents grabbing their children and running after
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.920]  spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.720]  to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle they let them in the
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.400]  area they told them they could come in and now they're coming in like their
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  trespassers punching and shoving people
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to commentate us
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:44.200]  we are on the march the empire is on the run live from the info wars dot com
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:11:00.960]  studios it's alex jones
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:12.680]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.960]  well bill clinton says all our problems are because of guns you just can't quote
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  have people walking around with guns unless it's the globalist unless it's
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:27.440]  the UN I'm gonna play that clip again and then tie it in with some very
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.760]  important clips from Hillary Clinton and her announcement yesterday but here's
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.760]  Diane Feinstein saying if she had the votes she'd ban all your guns mr. and
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.520]  mrs. America turn them all in in case there's any doubt we have us from the
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.760]  NRA G.O.A. and others they're warming up for another assault on our guns they're
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.400]  coming let's go to that clip if I could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:01.040]  United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr. and
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.800]  mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it I could not do that the
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.160]  votes or all right so as soon as they get the votes that is the plan now let's
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.000]  go back to Bill Clinton you can't have people walking around with guns talking
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.080]  about Baltimore as if that's what caused this it was cop shooting people in a
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.080]  questionable fashion or or breaking somebody's neck it's police brutality
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.680]  that at least is what the White House is stirring up to cause the clash so the
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.720]  feds can come in and take over it's that simple Al Sharpton admits that
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  should I play the clip again and him saying we need to federalize all the
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:49.640]  police but he then makes it about gun owners and ties that to when we did
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:58.440]  Serbia I guess you did do Serbia like the mafia does somebody in you're
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.320]  talking about a government that you attacked so now even governments can't
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.120]  have guns the West came in and armed the Croats armed the Muslims had them
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.400]  attacked the Serbs this is on record the Serbs fought back one and so NATO came
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.000]  in and took them over just like you've got the West funding Al Qaeda and ISIS to
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  attack Syria right now and they're calling Syria the bad guys until the
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.360]  public didn't buy it they went oh you're right the bad guys are Al Qaeda and
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.800]  ISIS we've got to go in and take over and get rid of Assad so that we control
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.440]  the country and not him as if he's behind it it's sick here's Bill Clinton
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.880]  what's killing all these communities is everybody thinks every tomorrow is gonna
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:48.000]  be like yesterday your toast back it up please deal with poverty I can't believe
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.120]  after 20 years on air I still have to deal with the Clintons I mean I started
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:59.880]  talking my talk radio show in 1996 started on TV in 95 when these guys had
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.920]  just carried out Oklahoma City and I could do a whole show on that I've been
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.040]  in films on it made a film on it done countless shows had the police officers
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.080]  on that were there and witnessed it I mean that was a government operation a
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.440]  criminal element of the government we know the names everything and just have
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:31.440]  to I'll care about you so much you just can't have these lives being lost I
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.280]  care so much about lives and the headline on CNN yesterday was Bill
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.600]  Clinton brushes off Foundation questions their foundation getting money from
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.880]  Third World dictators to be taken off the State Department list so weapons can
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.880]  be shipped there I mean you pay Hillary money you pay Bill money and then she's
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:57.720]  at the State Department and let's weapons go to your country let's go back
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.800]  to that quote it's just hard to listen to pumpkin head here it is what's killing
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.960]  all these communities is that everybody thinks every tomorrow is gonna be like
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.400]  yesterday your toast you can deal with poverty adversity anything long as they
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.440]  think it could be different the Baltimore thing came on the heels of what
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.480]  happened in Ferguson and what happened in New York City and all these other
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.840]  places and there's a big national movement about whether the lives of
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.880]  young African-American men count you know that black lives matter yeah yeah you
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.720]  can't have a bunch of people walking around with guns I used to tell people
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:39.160]  whenever when we did Bosnia Kosovo anything like that you get enough people
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:44.320]  with weapons around and there will be unintended consequences people who make
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.760]  mistakes people do wrong things happen the to hold the community together you've
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:56.440]  got to have a high level of community trust somebody that's in your family
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:02.800]  gets shot you want an answer from somebody you know and you want to be able
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.040]  to ask questions and get them answered this is truly sick of it they had
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.920]  police officers citizens teenagers murdered who knew about the drug dealing
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.360]  at Mina and he sits up there talking about how much he loves everybody when
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:23.360]  he turned al-Qaeda loose in the Balkans and then blew up the infrastructure
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.920]  killing tens of thousands and dropping depleted uranium cluster bombs on
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:39.880]  Belgrade unprecedented a war criminal a liar and he's up there explaining to us
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:45.800]  why there's problems with guns in America you know something he said is
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.720]  true in a twisted way you can't have armies quartered amongst you you know
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.960]  that's in the Bill of Rights you can't have a heavily armed huge paramilitary
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.400]  force in your country you will end up having problems in every third world
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.760]  nation the military or the paramilitary police end up taking over stability and
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:12.280]  confidence is destroyed the country collapses forever Latin America look at
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:21.480]  it no success stories all because of their standing armies that's why our
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:32.400]  founders in 1776 and forward said no standing army we can have a Navy we can
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.760]  have an army that's put on ships we can have Marines that's how the Marines get
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.280]  around Posse Comitatus even though it's an 1878 law the Marines operating
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.280]  predates that you can control your borders you can have a Navy and in modern
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.840]  parlance you can have an army but you do not station it or use it domestically
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.560]  ever and by the way the founding fathers didn't invent that the Dutch had
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:02.080]  that on the books the Swiss had that on the books because successful they've
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:10.040]  been and where did they get it well you guys search when I know it was 40
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:20.840]  something years BC 40 something years before the birth of Christ will you
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.320]  please give me the year Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon just type in the
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.360]  crossing on the Rubicon the date that happened you see the Romans for 200 plus
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:41.720]  years it was an execution offense for a general to lead his armies south into
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.760]  northern Italy across the Rubicon basically close to the border with what's
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.800]  Austria today and if a soldier unless it was a parade wore their uniform they
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.440]  could get in big trouble because you don't suit up the troops inside the
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.360]  country duh nowadays this Jones guys crazy he doesn't like troops marching up
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.320]  and down the streets everywhere and running checkpoints and working with
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.040]  police and admitting the preparing to take on the tea party in army times
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.200]  Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon 49 BC the crossing of a small stream in
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.560]  northern Italy became one of the ancient history's most pivotal events they
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:23.640]  went from Republic to dictatorship Caesar became synonymous with King
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.000]  continuing with the quote from it sprang the Roman Empire and the genesis of
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:39.640]  modern European culture so there you go Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon the
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.920]  genesis of European culture it began to collapse Western culture into a dark age
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:52.080]  that lasted over a thousand plus years it took 400 plus years for Rome to
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:20:01.400]  degenerate to its final sacking in 410 by the Visigoths so the phone rings and I

[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.480]  there's a company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.480]  electronic pickpocketing I didn't realize there was such a thing as
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:17.800]  electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.280]  and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.600]  transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.160]  guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.800]  collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.200]  it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should

[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:26.920]  I've got Shaquille O'Neal's personal cell phone number and we're gonna call him
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:33.000]  live on the air coming up in the next segment we tested it a few days ago I'm
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.160]  kind of forgotten about it because it's not that big a deal big deal basketball
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:44.840]  player and I'm going to call him up on air and ask him about it if he has any
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:48.720]  concern about crimes being committed inside this country probably just hang
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:56.040]  up on us but we'll see what happens of course he came out last week whenever
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.920]  someone on his Facebook working for him question 9-11 and said he was gonna fire
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:08.080]  whoever did it I'm gonna ask him he knows about the 27 pages or 28 pages that
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.640]  have been made secret of the 9-11 Commission showing Saudi Arabia basically
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:17.160]  quarterback the operation just like a quarterbacking the attack on Syria right
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:22.920]  now and just you might want to rethink firing whoever did that but I'll
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.360]  guarantee you they gave directives to act edgy and act like he's involved with
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.720]  the community and he doesn't like where it went those companies you hired to do
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:37.440]  that I've researched them try to follow a profile you give them and if we can
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.240]  hijack popular culture we'll do it all day long try to get folks out of the
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.800]  matrix coming up I'm gonna play these sickening Hillary quotes about how she's
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.480]  for the little guy and wants to fight the oligarchs and the robber barons
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.600]  basically I mean this is really getting rich because the big money's behind her
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:02.000]  Bilderberg had her campaign head at the meeting she's been to Bilderberg nobody
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.080]  else was there from the Republican camp or the Democratic camp that means
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.120]  that's who they're looking to push she was at Bilderberg in 2008 I was there
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.120]  covering it we saw the armored cars go in we saw the Secret Service they were
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.280]  all over the news saying where's Hillary where's Obama we knew where they were we
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.120]  later confirmed they were inside
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.800]  well again it's an inside job folks rigging it by controlling the field and
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.680]  the media is now telling us it's Jeb Bush and Hillary they're the choices you
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:41.080]  have meanwhile UN human rights chief urges Europe to accept more migrants I
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.520]  mentioned this I'm gonna play the audio and video for TV viewers I'll narrate
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.000]  for radio listeners the video is up on info wars dot com it's also on drugs
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.480]  report dot com shock video rioting migrants attempt a hijacked truck headed
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:03.960]  for the UK the footage filmed in the French port town of callous shows desperate
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.200]  migrants attempting to break into delivery trucks well what's wrong with
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.840]  breaking into things that's that's that's okay they released 36,000 violent
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.160]  illegals just this year in the US but they got a manhunt for two guys that
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.880]  broke out of a state prison that's okay heading to the United Kingdom in another
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.800]  illustration of how the country's generous welfare system acts as a beacon
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.400]  for illegal aliens the clip shows huge gangs of migrants roaming around the
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.120]  highway just blocking the road attempting to attack vehicles breaking into
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:44.080]  buses holding doors shut ripping open 18 wheelers I guess with crowbars breaking
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.920]  into the back I mean this is what's going on because the police don't stop
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.240]  them they could have a 500 police stationed right there and stop it and
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.680]  let the illegals know and the French could tell them that hey we got folks
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.360]  coming in on the trains and cars they don't because they want this and it came
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.080]  out in 2008 the Tony Blair had a secret deal with the French government and the
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.400]  EU to let them in but Michael Savage can't come into England because he
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.360]  criticizes radical Muslims it is a conspiracy to bring down Europe let's
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.240]  go ahead and go to this clip
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:30.840]  it was like a hundred angles basically what the hold up here is
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:43.240]  is that there's actually some mines some sorry some
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.760]  Europe's gonna fall harder than America
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:29:02.960]  try to hold you in the US you get shot doing that this is why they disarm
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.120]  people shivers man we saw this how the illegals have climbed on the bus they're
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.560]  holding the door shut they're trying to sabotage the truck so it can't drive
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:17.200]  away God Almighty see the government wants disarmed slaves but now the
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.240]  country doesn't have an immune system no one can fight and so when the people
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.720]  pour in out of Morocco and out of Africa and out of other areas just no one
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.200]  knows how to stand up to it it's like goonie birds when the sailors they
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.080]  didn't run from the sailors they all got eaten and so just hordes of people
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.960]  roaming around I mean look weapon or not you're trying to climb in the cabin
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.120]  my truck I'm gonna beat your brains out but see the French have been trained to
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.320]  lay down in England you're indicted if you defend yourself from attackers in

[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.320]  secret of Bilderberg meetings yet in typical mainstream fashion they
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.520]  downplayed the significance of the global elite meeting in secret to set

[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.920]  news blackout was the headline last week from the Washington Times whose
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.280]  coverage made it seem like the infamous Bilderberg meeting was nothing more than
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.960]  a gathering at a country club of course this contradicts what David Rockefeller
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:44.840]  said in a speech at a Bilderberg meeting in 1991 where he said quote we are

[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.760]  all in I would have done it but I also believe a lot of gun owners would
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.400]  agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.240]  there's this have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:34.000]  catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to do this every
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.800]  in a vastly different way enough enough enough
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.600]  Mayor Boomer, how you doing Jason? I grew Brooklyn. In the spirit of gun control will you
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.600]  disarm your entire security team? You'll get right back to me.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.160]  They may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture there's there's a
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.080]  there's an aspect of this a kind of Wild West cowboy dirty harry aspect there's
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.400]  also an aspect. So they're macho men and they gotta have a gun.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:20.360]  Make my day. Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead. A trio of would-be
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:25.240]  burglars picked the wrong Albuquerque house to break into police say when the
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:29.920]  three teens pride opened the door a brave little girl was waiting for them
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.280]  locked and loaded. It's harder to use a assault weapon to hit something that is a
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:35:02.280]  shotgun okay? You don't need an AR-15. It's harder to aim. It's harder to use. In fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Why shotgun? Why shotgun?
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:07.760]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:13.160]  talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.040]  fingerprint identification the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.320]  might wear. Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless people that want
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:28.160]  to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.280]  gun-free zones we're gonna beat you. We're gonna vote you out of office or
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.600]  sucking my machine. That's why you're going to fail and the establishment
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.040]  knows no matter how much propaganda the Republic will rise again when you attempt
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:46.600]  to take our guns. Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons. I believe that as Americans we have a right
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.920]  arm ourselves against criminals but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:58.480]  against the army or the police. The United States military is not out to get us. The Department of
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:03.120]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying screen. It comes out to
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.520]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. The second amendment is there so and it
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:13.720]  was put in there not for hunting and fishing like they like to say because
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.720]  back when they did it if you didn't hunt or fish you didn't eat it was put in
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.360]  there so the citizens would have the ability if their government became
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.720]  oppressive they could defend themselves against oppressive government.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.320]  Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.240]  But El Castro took the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns. And I'm here to tell you
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:38.720]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.720]  I'm the hootness, hootness, hootness. Bob T. Wildcat in the wind.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:50.720]  I don't want that man to have a gun. I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with him in his home
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.720]  where he had access to his 50 weapons. Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.720]  Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.720]  I'd love to see that in uniform.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:13.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.720]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.720]  if you want to come and take home.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:33.720]  Now if you're a TV viewer, you've seen it. If you're a radio listener, you haven't.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:40.720]  It looks like over a hundred illegals, predominantly out of North Africa,
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:49.720]  running around at the channel border station on a major highway,
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.720]  breaking into buses, holding the door shut. The bus, the people are on videotaping,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.720]  breaking into 18-wheelers, climbing up into cabs. It's incredible.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.720]  I don't care if you're black, white, what color you are from North Africa or from the moon.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  I'm in a car, you try to break in, I'm going to attack you.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.720]  You're in the United States, I'm going to shoot you.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.720]  But there, I guarantee you, I'm going to attack you. I'll use the car on you.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.720]  But man, I'm not trying to run down the French, they're great people,
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.720]  but they just sit there and take it because they're so politically correct.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:31.720]  You've got basically over a hundred people, just you can see in the camera shot,
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.720]  and up in front of the car is about 50 or so milling around, they're all around the bus.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.720]  And this is only from one vantage point of the camera.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.720]  We'll show some of that footage for TV viewers.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.720]  Shock video, rioting migrants attempt to hijack trucks headed for the UK,
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.720]  and it's gangs, and they're laughing at the people.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.720]  I mean, you try going to North Africa and doing this.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.720]  A military truck would pull up and shoot you.
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.720]  And that's because if they didn't, the whole society would collapse.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  This is what the so-called left is doing to Europe now coming out in ABC News
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.720]  and saying that the UN wants them to just open the borders basically entirely.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.720]  And then that will accelerate the gold rush, the rush.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.720]  They're already announcing record illegals from Central and South America
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.720]  coming up through Mexico to get to the US because of all the freebies.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:28.720]  It's insane unless you want to bring the country down.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.720]  And I'll guarantee you on this type of lawlessness, breaking into vehicles, the rest of it,
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.720]  that goods are being stolen.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.720]  A few people get shot, they'll stop doing it.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.720]  But the system wants lawlessness.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.720]  While they are at armored hotels behind thousands of police and helicopter gunships
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:51.720]  meeting in secret, running the EU while the public is domesticated fighting for their lives.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.720]  It's incredible.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.720]  And again, is radical Islam defeated after 14 years of post-911?
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.720]  No, it's bigger than ever.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.720]  And it's running around attacking innocent, moderate Muslims
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.720]  that were the majority around the world and overthrowing their countries,
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.720]  overthrowing our allies, overthrowing neutral countries, and putting radicalism in.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  Why would our elite be doing that?
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.720]  Because they're destabilizing the planet.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.720]  And as the Middle East collapses, and as Africa collapses,
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:28.720]  and now that Libya, that was stabilizing all of Africa, Libya was doing it.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.720]  I'm not for socialism or dictators, but Muammar Gaddafi was spending about 98% of the money
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:35.720]  on the people from the oil revenue.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.720]  He lived in very modest government facilities compared to others.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:47.720]  And he was stabilizing Africa. Now that it's fallen, North Africa is descending into hell.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:51.720]  It's descending into hell, and hordes are coming into Europe.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:55.720]  Boats every few days are sinking full of so many illegals.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.720]  And that's the same allegory of once they get to Europe.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.720]  They've already sunk Africa, now they're going to sink Europe.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.720]  But they're not the enemy.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.720]  The enemy is the globalist that set up a system like this.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.720]  Africa could be a jewel. The West has done everything it can to keep it destabilized,
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.720]  so they get those raw materials super cheap.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:24.720]  And so they have dictatorships and oligarchies in that they can buy off very cheaply.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.720]  Middle classes are the enemy of the globalist.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.720]  Progress is the enemy of the globalist.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.720]  Let me tell you, there was some African country with a higher GDP and cooler people,
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.720]  and it was free, I'd go there.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.720]  But there isn't.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.720]  There was one country in South America that was one of the richest in the world,
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:50.720]  and it's a hellhole now after the globalist took it over.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.720]  It's richest in Argentina.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:42:01.720]  I talk a lot about that because the globalist want us poor, they want to wreck us, and they will.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:07.720]  This is a formulae, they're following 110%.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:14.720]  Big boats, little boats, you name it, coming across the African waters of the Mediterranean into Europe,
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.720]  and the EU says, invite them in, pay for them, and then the numbers just flood.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.720]  Then they let them in, and then more flood, and now they want to go to Europe, from Europe to the UK,
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.720]  that's got even more welfare, and the police stand down while they pour across.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.720]  This is the false flag attack.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.720]  This is the takeover.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.720]  I want to get to these chilling Hillary Clinton quotes, they're so deceptive.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.720]  In the words of Richard, in the control room, this lady's the devil,
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.720]  with how she inverts and turns reality into upside down.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.720]  But here are the headlines, Daily Mail and FullWars.com.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:43:15.720]  Well, whatever, fine, if you don't agree with that, that's fine, he has that right to do that.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.720]  But you don't have a right to demonize people that question major events,
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:28.720]  because so many of them, from the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam, to Operation Ajax, to Fast and Furious,
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.720]  have been false flags to take our freedoms.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:38.720]  And some attacks are real, but they still use them to take our freedoms when that doesn't protect us.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.720]  We're always being told that it's a balance between freedom and security.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.720]  You know, the more freedom you have, the more secure you are.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.720]  Governments being armed historically is dangerous at a central level.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.720]  I'm not against locals being armed, heavily armed.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.720]  As long as it's decentralized and compartmentalized, it's why we have jurisdictions.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.720]  So if one town goes corrupt, one county goes corrupt, the others aren't.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.720]  Our founders were smart cookies.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.720]  There's a reason we've been the greatest country in the world.
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:13.720]  But for Bill Clinton to demonize the individual being armed, that's the ultimate equalizer,
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.720]  because they're more good people than bad.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.720]  Bad people don't like being around armed people.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.720]  They moved to Chicago or New York or D.C., where they've got disarmed prey.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.720]  Just like in France, they can rob and kill whoever they want and burn down whole cities.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.720]  Everybody says, well, it's politically correct, let the radicals do it.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.720]  I mean, Shaq, did you know there's a global secret treaty we barely beat last week
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:39.720]  that they're bringing back this week, the TPP, to hand over our sovereignty to foreign corporations?
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.720]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:48.720]  And so I do admire folks in Hollywood and sports who do care about politics and who have a libertarian bent.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.720]  Folks like Vince Vaughn, because he can get a lot of heat for coming out for the Second Amendment.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.720]  So that means he's a real man who cares more about principles than just being famous.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:04.720]  And I would like to admire you.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:11.720]  I just have never seen anything out of you, but dumb arrogance.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.720]  Whatever you do, Shaq, don't drink fluoride water, don't give your kids inoculations,
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.720]  care about your family, at least don't trust the system.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.720]  You know, I bet you're not as stupid as you act.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.720]  You probably already know all this.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with the Hillary Clinton clips and more.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:32.720]  I'm Alex Jones. Whatever Hillary has to say about the TPP, stay with us.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:05.720]  We get our 10 Reasons Book free. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.720]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.720]  Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:14.720]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.720]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.720]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.720]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.720]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.720]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:03.720]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.720]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:14.720]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than 2 cents per gallon.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.720]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:06.720]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:15.720]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:43.720]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:54.720]  Well, the Supreme Court has come out and struck down a state law saying that you've got to talk to folks about how big the baby is,
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.720]  basically give them an ultrasound. That's a North Carolina law.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.720]  The voice of opposition past Justice Kennedy may save Obamacare.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  It's back up again before the Supreme Court because so many parts of it are obviously illegal.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.720]  But they'll certify anything now.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.720]  We have a criminal takeover.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:19.720]  We don't have an elite that wants prosperity and wants to just skim off the top of that.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.720]  They want it all. They want control. They've got a score to settle with the bitter clingers.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.720]  They want to break and conquer the American people.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:37.720]  Before I go any further, we are listed supported by the very, very highest quality products you're going to find anywhere,
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.720]  Norway radios, Patriot apparel, books, films, nutraceuticals.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.720]  We had run out of survival shield X2. The laboratory had a small amount left.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:52.720]  That came in last Thursday.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.720]  It will sell out very, very soon.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:58.720]  Our thyroids and other glands are full of bad halogens.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.720]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine, it's all there.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.720]  This gets into your thyroid and keeps those from continuing to build up.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.720]  And quite frankly, a lot of evidence shows pushes them out.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.720]  That can feel pretty bad the first month. Consult a physician.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.720]  This is hard core. It changes the chemistry basically your whole body.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:25.720]  I lost tons of weight, so much more energy when I religiously take it.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.720]  And we're running out of the deep earth crystals. Nobody else gets them from mind sources.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.720]  We do. That's why it's the cleanest, purest out there.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:41.720]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.720]  And we've got 20% off on the Pro Pure as well.
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  Let's go ahead and go to Hillary Clinton's disgusting announcement,
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:51.720]  telling us what we all already knew that she's running for president.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.720]  And if you're not for that, you're against grandma.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.720]  Here is Hillary Clinton.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:04.720]  You brought our country back. Now it's time, your time, to secure the gains and move ahead.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.720]  And you know what?
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:15.720]  She talks to them in this slow cadence like you talk to a dog or you talk to a two-year-old.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:23.720]  You brought the country back, electing the Lord and Savior, Barack Obama.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:27.720]  You. And these people just want to sit there and feel like they're important.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:34.720]  An important person is telling me I'm important. She's feeding on you idiots.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.720]  It's incredible. Let's just go back to the club.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:41.720]  America can't succeed unless you succeed.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  Let's pause again.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.720]  You ever heard cult leaders talk all over the world, they have this saying,
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:52:00.720]  you know why you're here, come into the cult, release yourself.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.720]  I mean, this is Jim Jones stuff.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:09.720]  I just, I can't even look at her. God, she's got to be president.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.720]  Or I got to look at Jeb Bush.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.720]  I may have to leave. I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:21.720]  Please, okay, I can't look at it. Just go ahead and play her.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.720]  I'm not going to look at her though. Go ahead and play her.
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:33.720]  That is why I am running for president of the United States.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:36.720]  This is lecturing. This is like a robot talking.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:42.720]  I'm running to make our economy work for you and for every American.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:49.720]  Now there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.720]  Head pause.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.720]  We've got to do a whole new report on this.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:58.720]  This is Delphi Technique slash NLP.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:02.720]  I mean, she definitely is trying to trans people like a robot.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.720]  And that's not even her voice.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.720]  And you notice when she goes to Kentucky though, she goes,
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.720]  How you doing there? Good to have you with me.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.720]  Because the anthropology shows how to put them into a trance.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  That's a grandma talk.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:19.720]  I'm here to take care of you. How'd you like to pass me out of there?
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.720]  I mean, this talk's a Latino. She's like,
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:37.720]  How would you like taco?
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:53.720]  I'm here to take care of you.
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:54:18.720]  I'm here to take care of you.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.720]  Or call 1-888-253-3139. That's infowarslife.com.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:55:04.720]  We should do a video saying, looking for Hillary's real voice.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.720]  Because we've got her talking to Hispanic crowds, very patronizing,
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.720]  talking to them in a fake, whatever Hispanic voice is.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:18.720]  And then we've got her talking to people in Kentucky going,
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:22.720]  How you doing there? I mean, I'm not even exaggerating.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:27.720]  I'm going to have the apotheosis.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.720]  And then now when she talks to a bunch of women,
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.720]  because all the photos are like women behind her and women like,
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.720]  We're coming. Oh, it's so creepy.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.720]  A bunch of dumb fluoride head, socialist women who already wrecked the country,
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:45.720]  the kids into little spineless wrecks, now they're going to bring us down.
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.720]  When the whole society collapses and everybody's starving in the streets,
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:51.720]  these people are going to blame us, not themselves.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.720]  That's how scummy they are.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:55.720]  But anyways, getting back to what I was saying,
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:58.720]  her real voice is,
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.720]  What difference does it make? What the?
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.720]  Yeah, that's how she really talks.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:10.720]  So we need to do a compilation, you know, discovering the real voice of Hillary.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  Because I just hate women. It's not that I don't want to turn my guns in.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.720]  It's not that I don't love Obamacare that totally cheats me.
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:19.720]  It's not that I'm upset about her being a criminal in all the deaths
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.720]  and Vince Foster and Cattlegate and Benghazi and Fast and Furious
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:27.720]  and her foundation being one of the most corrupt ever mainline foundation groups,
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.720]  say it is, you know, money from dictators for weapons,
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.720]  you know, lying about all these wars, blowing up Serbia,
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:38.720]  lying about being shot at in, you know, on a C-130.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.720]  It's not that it's that I hate women. It's true.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.720]  I've just got to own up to it.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:46.720]  Let's go back to her in this weird mind control.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.720]  Like if aliens landed, we have come here to assimilate you.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.720]  We come in peace.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.720]  Let's go back to her literally talking to her brain dead audience.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.720]  She knows her audience are unconscious, entranced, fluoride heads.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.720]  This is how they talk to their victims.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.720]  Same old song.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.720]  Same old song.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:14.720]  A song called Yesterday.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:18.720]  A song called Yesterday.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.720]  Creepy, literally smiling at her victims.
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.720]  I showed up to adversaries like this.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:23.720]  I can't look at this.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:25.720]  Reinforced allies like Israel.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.720]  And I was in the situation room on the day we got bin Laden.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.720]  Oh, more bulls, more fairy tales.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  The day we got bin Laden.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.720]  It's the past time to end the outrage of so many women
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.720]  still earning less than men on the job.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:45.720]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:48.720]  Oh, my gosh. Look at those idiots in the audience.
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.720]  So stupid.
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.720]  And we have color often making even less.
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.720]  Oh, like the black unemployment doubling under Obama?
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.720]  You do your part.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.720]  You reap the rewards.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:57:59.720]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.720]  Where we don't leave any gun out.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:05.720]  The earlier, though, that slow droning, that's mind control.
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.720]  Let's go out to break with part of her promising to battle the rich fat cats
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.720]  that she's totally funded by more than anybody.
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:12.720]  Let's go to that club.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:15.720]  You have to wonder when does my hard work pay off?
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.720]  When does my family get ahead?
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.720]  When.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.720]  I say now.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:26.720]  I say now.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.720]  I say now.
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.720]  I'm bossy.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:38.720]  You know, prosperity can't just be for CEOs and hedge fund managers.
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.280]  Democracy can't just be for billionaires and corporations.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.120]  With her manager meeting with Bloomberg.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.320]  Democracy are part of your basic bargain too.
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.120]  So you can vote to be screwed over worse.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.800]  Country back.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.680]  Now it's time.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:53.680]  It's your time.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:54.680]  Good pause.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:55.680]  To secure the game.
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.680]  You want your country back.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.760]  You ran it for eight years with your husband.
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:02.760]  Now you've run it for seven years with Obama and now you're back acting like you're not
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:03.760]  the establishment.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.680]  I mean, and yeah, they've got just endless armies of victims and they're going to say
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:08.680]  what do you do?
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:09.680]  Vote for Jeb Bush?
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.760]  No, I'm not voting for any of them.
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:13.000]  It's all a back room deal.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.360]  It's all a big joke.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:19.480]  I mean, man, I'm not kidding.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:20.480]  I look at Hillary.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.480]  I feel claustrophobic.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.600]  I mean, I don't want to cover her for eight years.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.600]  I don't want to look at her.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:28.840]  Is she just go crawl back in the hole she came out of?
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:29.840]  I mean, that's it.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:34.680]  I mean, having the Clintons corner back from under their rock is really sick.
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:39.040]  You've probably heard that synthetic ingredients in your food could be harmful to your health,
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.360]  but what about the clothes on your back?
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:46.200]  In the article, the hidden toxins in your closet, Dr. Groot breaks it down.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:50.880]  Popular clothing stores like H&M, Levi's and Gap are beginning to turn their attention
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.560]  toward producing healthier and more environmentally friendly clothing.
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:00.600]  Increased consumer awareness around the dangers of synthetic dyes as well as other things
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:04.240]  are fueling a drastic revolution in the fashion industry.
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:09.000]  Keeping in line with current trends, clothing retailers are finally attempting to appeal
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.600]  to health conscious buyers as well as appease international health organizations.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:19.200]  And as with any movement, the best way to have your voice heard is to vote with your
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.720]  dollars.
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:26.280]  Get companies who make clothing out of bamboo, organic cotton, or flax, and always choose
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:29.000]  clothes produced using natural dyes.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  Good, brother.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  I just recently started using your products.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.800]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I'm going to have the
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.800]  highest quality.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:55.120]  The super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:01.880]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.920]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've been a ton of money
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.920]  there.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:12.520]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:14.000]  maximum potency.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.960]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.600]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.600]  going goes right to the source.
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.560]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:32.400]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  from InfoWars Life.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.400]  I love our candy.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.400]  I want to review this.
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:38.400]  Why, why, why?
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:42.520]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.480]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.200]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:55.600]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.120]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.640]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]  drugs.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.560]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.600]  that children would actually like and take.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.160]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.760]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.240]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:27.280]  nutrients that taste great.
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:30.560]  Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:47.920]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:56.480]  This is a big news hour, the third hour, we're honored to be joined by George Norrie, we're
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.360]  going to in a moment.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:04.240]  You can say he's the number two, number three, maybe number one talk show host in the world.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:10.480]  Talk radio is the only outfit that still has five, ten million listeners a day on some
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:17.880]  of these giant shows, 16 to 18 million listeners total just in North America.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:22.920]  Think about it, top shows on TV have like five million viewers, maybe ten million.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.400]  The Super Bowl, 70 million, that's why it's the biggest thing around.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.800]  Ten million George Norrie with seven, eight million listeners a night, 16 to 20 million
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:35.720]  a week not counting the internet.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:36.720]  That's exciting.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:41.640]  I've got three million listeners a day and it just absolutely is a huge responsibility
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:45.880]  and tens of millions every week or so just on YouTube alone.
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  That's what's exciting.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.000]  We still though, kind of like even when I was a man and bigger than my dad when I was
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.960]  a teenager I still looked at him and he looked bigger to me and I remember suddenly when
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:04.800]  my mother who always looked big to me suddenly looked little, it's like a flip in your mind
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:14.000]  and somehow we look at mainstream media, corporate broadcast TV cable and we think of it as powerful
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.480]  and big because they have fancy sets.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.880]  Well, we just built a fancy set too.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:24.680]  Now the same guys that built Fox News studios, we can do that.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:30.280]  So we've got the audience to match Fox and we've got the studio to do it.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.560]  So it's all optics, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:38.880]  Now to be clear, Fox has as many viewers and listeners as I do, basically 18 hours of the
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.040]  day.
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:46.160]  So Fox is obviously much bigger than Info Wars, but that's in the aggregate, not my show
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:47.160]  itself.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:53.200]  But I'm not up here bragging at the start of this hour about how big my audience is.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.120]  I'm simply pointing out that 500 major newspapers went out of business in 2014.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:05.560]  The others are in freefall, broadcast TV, cable is in deep trouble and it's not just
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.520]  because of more choices and competition.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:14.360]  It's because mainstream media has been caught lying and carrying the water for special interests
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:17.240]  and others for so long, people see through it.
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:21.960]  What is the establishment thinking putting up a Hillary Clinton, who's basically been
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:26.440]  running the Obama administration for seven years, was in office for eight years and then
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:34.080]  running the Bushes when they've had three administrations as well?
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.080]  This is crazy.
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:41.960]  Two administrations of Obama, two of the Clintons, that's four administrations and the Bushes
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:45.280]  have had three.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:53.960]  Bush Senior, Bush 41, had one and then Jr. had had two, regardless of what you think.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:59.180]  As the senator said, I forget who said it, the presidency is not a crown to pass back
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.280]  and forth.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:05.520]  People are sick of it and everybody heard MSNBC say Obamacare was free, then they said
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.400]  it was cutting your prices, then they said you could keep your doctor, then they said
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:13.760]  there were no death panels and now all of it's come out.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:17.440]  Now we know for over a year, veterans are on secret, don't treat list.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:21.960]  Speaking of veterans, George Norris is also a veteran of the Navy, three-time Emmy award
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:28.840]  winner for TV news production and of course came up from the bottom in talk radio to have
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:35.520]  the number one show in his city and then of course be picked up and syndicated nationwide.
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:41.000]  And he's the guy that had the courage to put me on coast to coast first to talk to their
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.520]  16 to 20 million listeners and that certainly helped get the info war out to another level
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.520]  as well.
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:52.800]  And again, I really admire people like Vince Vaughn that had the will to come out against
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:57.080]  the globalist and for the Second Amendment and again, I mean, this is how we're going
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:03.360]  to take things back and in the beginning of Patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared and
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:07.760]  scorned, but when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:10.160]  to be a patriot and that is George Norris.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.920]  And again, folks, I don't get most guests on and lot them for five minutes before they
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:15.920]  come on.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:19.600]  I don't do this a lot with George either, just we have to really sit back and think
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:24.560]  about the risk everybody's taken to tell the truth.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:30.880]  I mean, I loved our bell, great guy, riveting voice, super smart, but George Norris took
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:38.960]  the show and changed the degree of it about 100 degrees, not 180, not 160, but about 100
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:43.680]  degrees towards hardcore, Patriot, anti-New World Order, exposing vaccines.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.400]  He would just read the vaccine insert on air.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:51.560]  He was the first on mainline talk radio to really start to fight so much tyranny.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.800]  And I could just count how many victories we've had that George Norris was the detonator
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:00.560]  of with his audience and his audience deserves the credit as well, but I think we should
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:04.000]  celebrate leaders who support freedom.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.360]  It's not about left or right.
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:13.720]  It's about being sane, fighting the TPP 10 years ago, George Norris was.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:18.880]  You see, we have to understand that and appreciate it and not take this show or his show or other
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:20.800]  shows for granted.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:21.800]  Does that mean I'm perfect?
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.560]  Does it mean George is perfect?
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:24.560]  No.
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:27.000]  But we want to live in a free country.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.280]  We are four common sense.
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.160]  I think we can say we're populist, constitutional populist.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:35.760]  Now, I've been ranting, George, I know you were coming on about world events and all the
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:40.800]  bizarre earth changes, the Ring of Fire, what's happening with the economy, much of Africa
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.200]  collapsing into Europe, ISIS making all these gains.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:49.360]  I mean, there's so many things going on, TPP getting shot down so far last Friday, huge
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  victory.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.560]  George, there's so many angles to go.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.560]  Where would you like to go first in this palette I've thrown out or do you want to
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.160]  throw a curveball at us?
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:01.120]  No, no curveball to you, Alex.
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.680]  I'll do that a little bit later.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.320]  But one, thanks for having me on.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:11.640]  Two, the best move I ever made was putting you on our show because I got three million
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:13.280]  more listeners that way.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.040]  Pretty smart, huh?
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.040]  It certainly is, my friend, but you know you took risk doing that.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.040]  I did.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.040]  I did.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.040]  I put my head in the news.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:26.520]  You know, I have a conservative network and but they let me run with this show and
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.080]  I said, I want this guy.
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:30.080]  He's different.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.680]  He's patriotic and let's do it.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.640]  You know, yesterday was flag day.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:35.640]  I was on the air.
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:42.400]  I do the first or second Sunday of every month and I played James Cagney.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:48.280]  It's a grand old flag to end the show and I've got to tell you, it brought chills up and
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.680]  down my spine because that's what America's all about.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:10:00.600]  Just about doing something for people and not manipulative groups and building corporations
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.960]  and for helping people.
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:05.600]  It's so many of our politicians have forgotten that.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:11.720]  I was just listening to these clips you were playing of Hillary Clinton and it's unbelievable
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:17.560]  how these people will just position themselves for power.
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.560]  It's disgusting.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:20.240]  We're not going to do that.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:22.960]  We're going to be the watchdogs of everything.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:28.960]  We went after TPP last week and I think we helped contribute to its defeat.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.640]  Let's hope it stays defeated.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.960]  It's supposed to come up for another vote this week.
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:39.760]  Our next move is to insulate the power grid so that we're not up a creek if somebody launches
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:44.160]  a nuke in the atmosphere or the sun hits us with some kind of solar fire.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.880]  And I'm not going to stop, Alex, and you're not going to stop either.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:51.000]  That's right, you've launched with a bunch of former military generals and others, a
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  national initiative.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.800]  It's only a few billion dollars, two to five, depending on which number to harden things.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:01.400]  We get hit by one of these EMPs or a sun, I guess a Carrington event.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.720]  You're the expert, but I've had scientists gone.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.640]  It will blow the electrical grid and put us back in the Stone Age and they know that
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:11.120]  and they know we've been hit before.
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.360]  We were an industrialized society and metal lining buildings, you name it, basically caught
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.520]  on fire, describes that threat for people that aren't aware of it.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:23.520]  Oh, it is unbelievable.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:30.480]  They're predicting 90% of the Americans will die within the first year if the power grid
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:33.240]  goes out in total.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:34.640]  This is not scary thought.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:35.640]  This is real.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  This is a possibility that a rogue nation or any nation that has a nuke has the capability
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:48.960]  of detonating it in our atmosphere, it creates gamma waves and it literally fries the electrical
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:51.200]  grid and we have no power.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:57.320]  The sun can do the same thing if it's got a big enough X flare that it emits and we're
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:58.880]  not protected.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:04.520]  Now some states are starting to protect their own grid, so they may be self-contained.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:11.160]  Texas is thinking about it, but in terms of the country and whole, we haven't done anything
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.160]  yet.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:16.080]  There's a lot of great people out there, but Peter Pry for example, has been trying to
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:20.840]  get legislators convinced, let's just do it.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:26.600]  There's a representative out of Michigan, Fred Upton, who has been stymying the shield
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  bill.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:33.200]  He's been holding back maybe the lobby of the electrical companies, you know, it have
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:41.960]  gotten to him, so I turned my audience loose and they just flooded his phone line in Washington
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.840]  D.C. and then Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:51.240]  We got to get these legislators to simply say, we care about America, we care about people,
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  this is ludicrous.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:53.240]  Fix this thing.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.120]  Well, let me back up what you're saying there.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:59.000]  I mean, I've had so many mainline scientists on, but as you know, the audience may not
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  have just tuned in.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.040]  They've had congressional hearings the last few years where the Pentagon admits, and that's
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:09.080]  where that 90% number comes from, that if we have a Carrington event, like we have in
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:14.240]  the 1850s, we'll put that back on screen for TV viewers, that it will heat up the power
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:20.960]  lines and other systems and blow them as happened to telegraph wires across the U.S. in 1859
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.200]  and other parts of the world.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:28.000]  So a partial Carrington event, X Flare, would blow out incredible amounts of stuff and cause
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.400]  amazing devastation, but a full one, we're talking stone age level behavior.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.920]  Now I understand folks like to say North Korea or ISIS could do it or something, and I get
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.560]  that if you detonated a bomb or hydrogen bomb in the atmosphere right, that it can blow
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:46.480]  out electricals and that happened during nuclear testing.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:49.160]  But I don't see that, George, as the big threat.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:54.200]  I see it as the sun because according to the physicists and astrophysicists we've had on,
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:58.320]  they believe we're overdue for another one of these Carrington events.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:00.400]  Oh, we are overdue.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:06.440]  We looked out a few years ago when a huge X Flare went out at the side of the sun.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.880]  It wasn't facing us directly.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.320]  Had it hit us directly, we wouldn't have had some severe problems.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.480]  We lucked out there.
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:19.840]  This could happen at any day, any time the sun emits a huge solar flare, it could hit
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.840]  us.
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:21.840]  Carrington, they were lucky.
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:23.840]  They just had the telegraph system.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:27.680]  If that same flare hit us today, Alex, you wouldn't be on the air.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.080]  I wouldn't be on the air.
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.560]  You couldn't get to your ATMs.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.760]  Gasoline stations wouldn't be able to pump.
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:36.400]  Water stations couldn't pump water to your house.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.400]  It's over.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  That's right.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.160]  I remember a few times in the 80s and then in the 90s when I was younger, this was in
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:43.160]  the 70s and 80s.
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:48.080]  I remember my dad talking about it and like, AM radio wouldn't come in, FM barely wouldn't.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.560]  They said satellites failed, gas pumps, they couldn't take credit cards inside.
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.920]  I remember those events.
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:59.880]  Imagine now if we get hit.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  I know it.
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:03.960]  It could be just devastating and we're going to prepare ourselves.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:10.080]  We're going to keep going and keep pushing and devoting incredibly valuable airtime to
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.600]  get this done.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:18.320]  To me personally, it's the biggest issue I have ever faced beyond anything else that's
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.440]  been going on under the table.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:22.400]  You've got to get this thing.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  Something just clicked.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.280]  The globalists that have hijacked our country use America to dominate the planet to a great
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.920]  extent, have us pay for it at our expense.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.920]  If they really wanted to dominate the world, they would harden the UK, the US, and a few
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.840]  other countries they control and then when one of these things inevitably hits, we'd
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.560]  be the only country standing.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:48.440]  Why on earth would they not spend the couple billion dollars to harden the power centers
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:49.440]  themselves?
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.720]  Explain what would be done to harden it.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.120]  Well, technically, we've got the engineering to do it.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.000]  The estimate is about $2 billion to fix the power grid.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:07.880]  We're sure that things are fairly caged, that transmitters are taken care of, that everything
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:12.880]  we've got is fixed, insulated, and that's all doable.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.760]  Our engineering is excellent.
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:22.440]  $2 billion is no money compared with what they spent just during the bailouts in 2008.
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.640]  I mean, let's do it.
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.320]  I would, as a taxpayer.
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:29.760]  Could it basically just, from the engineers I've had on, a surge protector at the power
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.080]  plants and at the power relay centers in between the lines and the final equipment so if it
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.160]  hits, you don't blow up all the equipment and so it doesn't cause a chain reaction?
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.160]  That's most of it.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:42.160]  That's most of it.
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:47.480]  But you'd still have to do it in individual states, but it's easy to do.
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:54.200]  The technology's there, the manpower's there, and my God, one day it's going to happen and
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  the nation that has not protected itself is literally toast.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:04.160]  It will look like the Pentagon predicts, and I agree with them, like the road, Viggo Mortensen's
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:09.160]  a listener he's been on, but have you ever seen the road come out about eight years ago?
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:16.560]  Yes, I did, but this is going to be worse than Mad Max.
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:22.320]  Well they believe in a collapse of society, even a total economic collapse, within 15
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:25.080]  days most people become cannibals.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:29.240]  And most people don't even know how to wipe their noses now, they're not self-sufficient,
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:34.200]  it's a very entitled society, living off a bunch of hard-working people, can you imagine
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.280]  all these entitled spoiled brats during a collapse, George?
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:42.200]  Unbelievable, there was an old twilight zone show called The Shelter, Alex, where this
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:48.600]  guy had a fallout shelter, and that was very prevalent in the 1960s, where his neighbors
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:50.920]  all knew he had a shelter.
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:55.720]  They knew that he had water put away and food put away, and he was ready in case the Soviet
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:02.760]  Union at the time launched, well guess what, a alarm went off that a nuke had been detonated,
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:08.600]  and everybody was trying to break down his fallout shelter while he and his family were
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:14.560]  in it to get to him, they all wanted in, and that's what's going to happen here.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.840]  People are going to go ballistic, the haves and the have nots are going to go at it with
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:19.840]  each other.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:26.320]  It's going to be unbelievable, a nightmare beyond biblical proportions.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:31.640]  You're absolutely right, government itself is digging in, elites are running to New Zealand,
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:38.640]  all the billionaires have left Israel, we saw this coming way back, things are unsustainable,
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.560]  and you add to all of that, they're blocking new technologies and things, now more than
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:47.440]  ever people need to get prepared because I can feel it in my bones, oh this is the question
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:50.160]  I wanted to ask you, I wanted to get you on a few weeks ago.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:53.560]  Everybody, and when I say everybody, I mean everybody I talk to, but separate people at
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:58.520]  restaurants and at hotels, I'll hear them talking and going, yeah everybody, it feels
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:04.240]  like something bad's coming, I can feel it, and intellectually we can then see the reasons
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:11.080]  for that, but is it war with Russia, is it economic collapse, is it that people are awakening
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:16.280]  and we feel kind of that group consciousness of concern, or do you disagree, you don't
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.200]  think something big is coming, what's your take?
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.680]  Oh, I've been saying for a couple years now Alex that something big is happening and that
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:28.680]  people have been acting strange, weird, you've seen it, you just talked about it, and they
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:33.880]  sense something, there's something out there in the cosmos, this wireless internet that
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:40.840]  we're all connected to that is telling us something big is about to happen.
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:46.080]  I had a story about a rabbi on last night who in Israel, he was in Haifa, Israel, he
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.880]  went into the cave, which apparently was the cave of the prophet Elijah, and he claims
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:20:00.760]  that he came out and was told by the prophet that Israel will sustain soon a huge war and
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:02.480]  that many would die.
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:08.120]  I mean, these are frightening prophecies, we're not making this stuff up, these are
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:14.640]  people who are legitimate in what they do, everybody's talking about something that's
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:19.080]  going to happen, I mean the United States moving military equipment to Europe, I mean
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:23.640]  this is shades of the Cuban Missile Crisis all over again, do you think Putin's going
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:24.640]  to allow that?
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:32.120]  Well George, George, you know, the older you get, the more you learn to follow your gut,
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:37.680]  and my gut's never wrong, and I've never, never had my gut this concerned, I mean my
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:44.240]  spider sense is redlining every day now, it's just getting so intense, and everybody else
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.300]  I talk to, he says the same thing, what do you think it is, I mean I'm getting chills
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:49.800]  right now.
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:58.880]  Honestly, yes, I think we're on the brink of a third world war, a war that nukes may
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:04.760]  be used that will change the face of this planet for the rest of our lives, if we do
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:10.800]  have the rest of our lives, I mean I've got six grandchildren, Alex, I adore them, I want
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:17.080]  them to have a future, I still think there's a piece of me that because of all of us and
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:23.560]  the way we think we can get through this, but some of these leaders just don't seem
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:29.440]  to get it, I mean they just don't seem to get it, if you ever go to Vegas, you see people
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:36.800]  of all walks of life, you see people from Africa, China, the rest of Asia, you see Russians,
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:42.840]  you see Americans, you see people from Mexico, people are out there having fun, you sit down
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:48.840]  and you play a little blackjack next to somebody from two different countries, they don't want
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:55.480]  you dead, yet there's something else afoot here that I just don't get, you know ISIS
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:02.560]  for example, these people are driving with new trucks, new humbees, waving their black
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:09.440]  flags, why isn't anybody taking them out, they're right out there, it doesn't make
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:16.800]  any sense, generals during World War II would have had that thing destroyed by now, today
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:20.240]  there's a different thing, there's something else going on here, I can't put my finger
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:21.240]  on it yet.
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:26.840]  Well it's a global destabilization and criminal elements in western governments have been
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:34.640]  funding radical jihadis to destabilize and then you tie in now, Africa collapsing after
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:41.520]  Hillary's invasion of Libya, which she bragged, she came, she saw, he died and now thousands
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.080]  a day are streaming across into Europe, they're now getting to the channel and the British
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.960]  government is allowing them to basically hijack trucks and drive through into England, I mean
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:57.520]  this is getting insane, it's like an evil force wants to collapse the world George.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:02.840]  Oh there's no doubt about it, look Saddam Hussein, not a Boy Scout, kept things in
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:10.800]  check, Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, not a Boy Scout, kept things in check, Mubarak in Egypt,
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:16.200]  not a Boy Scout, kept things in check, the Middle East is a different animal, it cannot
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:24.440]  run the way we run our democracy, it just doesn't happen that way, we should have realized
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:30.000]  that a long time ago, instead we wanted to topple these regimes and we've got a disaster
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:36.200]  on our hands, I mean we cannot fix that problem, I don't care how many troops we might have
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:41.080]  to start sending back in, we can't fix it.
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:45.600]  All we can do is contain it, but George if you pull back criminal elements that want
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:49.400]  to destabilize, want to war on the police, you name it, it's the same pitcher everywhere,
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:53.760]  the same M.O., they want this crisis, then they're going to use the threat of al-Qaeda
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:59.480]  and ISIS to take our freedoms domestically and we're back at the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:02.840]  That's exactly right, I mean who do you trust?
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:07.800]  Even if we lived in the world of total peace, there'd be some groups that I would not trust
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:13.240]  who would want to disrupt our way of living and they would create false flags just to
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:18.520]  keep things going, the elitists do not want stability.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:24.000]  They do not, George Norrie, Coast to Coast AM dot com, stay with us.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:34.800]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:41.080]  The US media blackout on Bilderberg has been broken, well sort of, the Washington Times
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:46.480]  are the first mainstream US news outlet to cover the secret of Bilderberg meetings, yet
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:52.680]  in typical mainstream fashion they downplayed the significance of the global elite meeting
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:55.680]  in secret to set world policy.
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:01.520]  Bilderberg meets amid conspiracy theories, heavy security and news blackout was the headline
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:06.920]  last week from the Washington Times, whose coverage made it seem like the infamous Bilderberg
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:10.920]  meeting was nothing more than a gathering at a country club.
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:16.200]  Of course this contradicts what David Rockefeller said in a speech at a Bilderberg meeting in
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:22.880]  1991 where he said, quote, we are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.920]  Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:32.240]  and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years and you can learn more

[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.480]  powerful and most challenging to acquire.

[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:48.000]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.480]  as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over

[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.480]  boyfriend up on screen can you guys i wasn't planning to do this today but i'm gonna come
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:40.560]  out of the closet today uh maybe it'll be as big as bruce Jenner having a sex change
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:46.880]  i actually am dating slimer and uh you can actually see a scene of it in the new upcoming
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:51.720]  ghostbusters movie okay i'm being sarcastic you guys google slimer again can we show him
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:57.080]  coming down the hall please uh this is my attempt to humor which i will engage to impromptu
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:03.280]  at the event but uh your guest though is a really serious researcher he was pretty high
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:12.200]  level in the ministry of defense tell us about that guy tell us yeah nick the nick polk ministry
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:18.360]  of dial a little lag there but nick polk uh was in the british ministry of defense he
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:26.600]  looked at ufo files he investigated them and he he's just a riveting guest he's a no nonsense
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.640]  guy and he's going to tell the audience well i'm not going to tell him everything that
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:38.040]  he's going to tell them but he has seen things that nobody has seen in those files and we
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:42.360]  we're he's going to talk about that but he's a great guest he's been a guest on coast at
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:48.880]  coast for years now alex and um he's just a superb ufo investigator and again he was
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:57.120]  there he was in the ministry of defense in britain and he saw things and they're real
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:05.160]  well george speaking of ufo's it's such a giant galaxy and we know there's billions of galaxies
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:10.840]  that hobbles photographed we understand all that clearly we're probably not alone but
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:16.720]  you don't see a movie like interstellar which is long but excellent where it's actually
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.320]  humans from the future trying to save the earth and that kind of creates that time warp
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:28.640]  loop uh continuum that's so fascinating but i'm really concerned about project blue beam
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.040]  that's been partially declassified and iron mountain and other plans to unify the planet
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:39.200]  under world government with a fake ufo landing and with the cg and with the technology we
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.680]  know that they've suppressed they could easily do that with animatronics we see the pope
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:49.840]  getting everybody ready saying you know god has other flocks aliens are probably real
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:54.960]  uh we see the vatican getting folks ready i mean i really see this preparation in movies
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:36:02.840]  and culture pushing this what's your take on that oh you are so right on i you know
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:09.080]  they they want to fake eventually it's like the day the earth stood still they're going
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:14.320]  to want us to flock to government begging for help oh my god the extraterrestrials
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:18.480]  are here they're going to eat us they're going to take us they're going to capture us please
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:25.120]  governments please do what you can and under this guise this is incredible of using the
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:31.200]  holograms and everything else they're going to they think they think we're going to flock
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:39.400]  to them for help uh like sheeple going underneath a tree during a storm and i don't think it's
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:44.640]  going to work i think people are so tuned into this already to shows like yours and
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:49.960]  mine that they're going to look at this and go ha they faked it and but but they're going
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:55.320]  to make it as realistic as possible sure they might they might even have some fake alien
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:01.120]  you know standing next to president obama saying you know we are taking over your planet
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:08.280]  now and it's going to be unbelievable it'll be like the simpsons it's a two-headed monster
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:11.740]  but as long as you've ever one of the heads everything's okay there's the headline vatican
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:17.200]  astronomer says alien life will be discovered but will not prove or disprove god speaking
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:22.240]  of the big questions i knew reyman teague who died last year uh who was on the front
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:27.880]  line of the nasa Apollo missions you can watch the film footage he's right up there in mission
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:33.680]  control controlling the cameras on the spacecraft on the lander and so much more he basically
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:39.520]  ran skylab it was also classified that he came over my house a lot he said i'm going
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:43.200]  to tell you i'm going to tell you and then he would just he couldn't say it but he said
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.120]  listen we went to the moon but we have some advanced stuff i didn't want the russians
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:52.320]  to know we had you saw most of the mission but basically it was linking up with other
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:55.840]  stuff and then he just said i'll get killed if i tell you and i mean he really was on
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.200]  the front line of nasa and he would get really upset when he even talked about it with me
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:08.160]  i met with him at a hotel actually the former sack base at the hilton for a hamburger whenever
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.680]  he was picking up some family that was in town he said you meet me there and he was
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:13.760]  going to tell me stuff right before he died because he'd had another heart attack he was
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:19.040]  going in for surgery his heart blew up like two weeks later and and and he's just you
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:21.680]  know what i'm not going to tell you it's too dangerous he said i care about you alex
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:25.680]  they'll kill you so to the government he never told me what it was he just said look we
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:31.640]  went to the moon well separately we they say this the sr 71 blackbird is the fastest plane
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:38.000]  in the world it was in service in 55 who believes that we know they're suppressing technologies
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:43.200]  we know that they've gotten really arrogant about these technologies but how advanced
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:48.920]  is the secret space program and from all your research who do you think's really running
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:53.480]  things in this global government and are they so arrogant now with the russians and others
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:59.440]  because they've got such super weapons or or is it just old-fashioned arrogance well
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:06.640]  i think it's i think it's arrogance and it's power an absolute power corrupts absolutely
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:11.200]  i think we've been to the moon there's no question we've been to the moon i i've interviewed
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:17.520]  too many astronauts these people aren't lying to me alex but the question is is have we've
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:24.280]  been back to the moon since and were we there back a long time ago i think that's possible
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:32.520]  on both fronts i think high technology existed on earth millions of years ago atlantis atlantis
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:39.400]  you name it i think we went to the moon millions of years ago and that we have structures on
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.840]  the moon well you know playdough wrote about atlantis like it was real and flying machines
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:50.560]  and everything that's absolutely you know in india they had the vamanas which were flying
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:56.440]  machines i mean they clearly wrote about it pictures and obados in egypt you will see
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:03.800]  what looks like a helicopter and they submarine and they flying apparatus i mean it happened
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:12.160]  we had whether it was extraterrestrial technology or ours we had the ability to do these things
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:18.560]  something happened on the planet where everybody got obliterated and we started all over again
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:24.440]  and that's a lesson for all of us because good old planet earth regenerates itself and you
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:30.800]  know we could all get wiped out every building you see today would crumble the dust and in
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:37.240]  a hundred million years it could start all over again well i agree with you and i don't
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:41.400]  like to get into speculation because in the media runs off of that demonizes me i can
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.280]  get folks to admit fema camps when they're called emergency centers establishment act
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:51.120]  civilian and made labor camp program geoengineerings admitted but they go oh that doesn't exist
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:55.880]  so i can't get folks who admit what exist and in the area of research you know there
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:02.000]  are some cooks out there some charlton's but also a lot of real folks i was in l.a.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.280]  even after he been on the show and i talked to buzz aldrin at length and then after this
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:10.520]  happened he didn't say i couldn't talk about it but after i talked about it he i guess
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:14.720]  he got in some trouble and won't come back on but buzz aldrin came on this show and never
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:19.520]  told anybody else this it's online and said oh yeah you know the same aliens that built
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:24.400]  egypt they're the ones that have got an obelisk that that's what we based the movie on 2001
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:30.000]  it's out on the moon the small moon of of mars mars has one little moon and yeah and
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.720]  by the way and then next i talked to him a few months later i'm out now and he goes
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.800]  this over the phone on speakerphone he goes alex at about six months they're gonna crash
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:43.120]  a probe and looking for water on the moon the truth is we already found it we're just
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:47.400]  gonna let them think they found it but we're sending them there with the probe we got a
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.760]  secret deal with the indians and we want them to have this fine but there's a whole ocean
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:57.200]  of water basically all under the moon and that's all i can tell you i mean i'm talking
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:02.280]  to buzz aldrin any and then six months later it happens and they find the water and it's
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.720]  a whole ocean which shows we were just told something they knew we now know they've released
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.080]  the text out of portugal that they knew what the americas were the vikings had been here
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:19.120]  of the chinese were doing trade with the aztecs and people i mean the truth is the elite the
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:25.040]  illuminati already know all this history they've kept it from us i mean buzz aldrin told me
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:32.360]  publicly that aliens built the pyramids on this show have you ever heard that club and
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:38.040]  they did absolutely it was incredible and there's there's there's nothing that we have
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:43.520]  on this planet that could have built the pyramids in those days we didn't have a hundred thousand
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:49.760]  egyptians pulling ropes it just didn't happen that way there was some other kind of incredible
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:58.000]  technology and i believe it was the extraterrestrial i had interviewed zahi awas who was the antiquities
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:03.600]  director not anymore he got tossed out after barbaric fell apart but you know you you bring
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:07.720]  up the thought of e t's to him he's live it he'll chase you up and down with a baseball
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:13.640]  bat um i mean he believes so much that egyptians did this and there's no way there's just no
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:19.800]  way they could have done that so many mysteries on this planet alex that just boggle the mind
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:25.040]  including of course the conspiracies that you and i deal with on a nightly basis as
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:28.960]  well sure well they claim the step pyramids were practiced then they built the big ones
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:34.080]  but now scientists as you know have tested them know the the little ones are humans
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:42.280]  trying to make them trying to copy the real ones yes it is just so bizarre and again folks
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:46.600]  i don't even get into all this because people can't even deal with with basic reality like
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:51.600]  bill berger existing hey george what do you make of us you know 13 years ago or whatever
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:57.720]  talking about bill berger nobody knowing about it and then now it's admitted it exists you
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:04.960]  have pinpointed exactly what's going on on this planet we are years and have been years
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:10.760]  ahead of ourselves that people are now beginning to get caught up in i'm amazed at daniel estalon
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:17.640]  and who was very complimentary about you by the way on my show last week and we were talking
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.880]  about the bill bergs conference in austria and how that they're so public now on one
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:29.160]  hand they've got their website up they put down who some of the members are yet some
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:34.640]  of the other people it's clouded in secrecy they try to jam reporters that don't want
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:40.280]  people in you can't really report on what they're talking about because they wanted
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:45.120]  to be a free airing conference within but we were years ahead of ourselves and you of
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:49.440]  course you were the pioneer about this well i mean you get a lot of credit but but but
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:54.760]  separate from credit we were right is what matters we're not making this stuff up is
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:45:02.280]  the point and it it comes down to that that we're being lied to we don't claim to have
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:07.760]  all the answers we're simply looking for the truth and try to be honest and that's the
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:11.720]  difference george norrie coast to coast a m dot com i'll be speaking with him coming
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:16.760]  up in a few months in canada look forward to seeing you all up there i'm gonna leave
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:20.960]  this totally wild card i've got a bunch of topics i want to raise but when we come back
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:25.160]  i'm gonna just let george bring up what else he thinks is important it'll be a surprise
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:29.880]  for all of us straight ahead the final segment of the transmission with george norrie i'm

[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:10.240]  and our country it is so important to our children and to the future of this nation
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:16.400]  we have got to do it it is by far one of the simplest things to fix of what could be one
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:21.840]  of the most tragic events ever and i just don't get it i don't understand why this government
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:27.840]  why some political candidate isn't using this as a platform with gingrich wanted to do it
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:34.160]  back when he was pouring with running but of course you know he fell on deaf ears we've
[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:41.160]  got to get people convinced to do this two billion dollars is nothing alex for the preservation
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:46.960]  of the united states you're right and you would think the elite spend so much time trying
[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:51.520]  to dominate the public to secure their power we want to do something to shield them from
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:57.800]  a mass coronal ejection a super x flare hitting the earth and blowing out the telecommunications
[02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:03.080]  on the ground it just it just sounds like a total no brainer that that they would do
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:08.080]  that is there some reason that they know something we don't know that they don't care or any
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:15.160]  other governments hardening their their power grid what if the rumors of reducing the world's
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:21.720]  population from seven billion to five hundred million are true and that the globalists and
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:28.200]  the elitists have already built their bunkers that are fully contained with generators and
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:34.160]  power systems and food and water and that they're okay and that these places are located
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:41.720]  strategically all around this world for them and so they go in one that when this happens
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:48.360]  and lock themselves in they stay for six months or a year they come out to a devastated planet
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:57.000]  and then they start rebuilding all over again does it sound far-fetched ludicrous i don't
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:02.040]  know maybe not i think it's happening and they're building emergency secret seed banks

[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:10.160]  try to pass secret legislation and hands over our sovereignty the foreign institutions and
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:15.160]  it really illustrates how the republican and democratic leadership just like jeb and hillary
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:21.440]  are really working together like a don king match or a mafia run horse race and even
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:25.680]  the london telegraph has come out today with an article perhaps the world conspiracy theorists
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:33.800]  have been right all along we're going to cover that article here in a moment but first magna
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:41.440]  karta 800 years ago today it was signed after the battle of ronnie mead the tyrannical king
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:45.280]  had been out slaughtering and murdering and had been defeated and they said you either
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:49.880]  signed the magna karta that you're not above the law or we're going to chop your head off
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:55.680]  he signed it then still tried to go back on it and the rest is history he was defeated
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:05.600]  magna karta its proper name is magna karta libertarian libertarian latin for the great
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:10.520]  charter of the liberties is a charter agreed to by king john of england at ronnie mead
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:16.480]  near winsor on the 15th of june 2015 first grabbed by the arch bishop of canterbury
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:20.920]  to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons that promised the
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:28.560]  protection of church rights protection from the barons from legal imprisonment access
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.520]  to swift justice and limitations on feudal payments of the crown to be implemented through
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:42.440]  a council of 25 barons now some will say that oh so an oligarchy of barons yes you have
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:49.240]  to look at the history of when it was were we perfect with 1776 declaration of independence
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:54.880]  then the constitution bellarites no but the ideas in there were revolutionary and then
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:57:03.080]  were expanded on and became more and more realized this is revolutionary magna karta
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:07.960]  first time in world history other than a short time in greece that people say the government
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:15.000]  isn't god the king isn't infallible he can't do it and that the lords had to be responsive
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.360]  to their vassals as well so there had to be juries and grand juries had to be warrants
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:28.440]  to come in your house a man's home is his castle all of this flows out of 800 years
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:35.440]  ago magna karta the heart of western common law the heart of jurist prudence and i'll
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:39.920]  never forget tony bleger when he got elected back in 1960 said i'm declaring war on magna
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:44.320]  karta we're getting rid of it we don't need that anymore and now cameron said three weeks
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:50.880]  ago oh we're not going to say you have free speech anymore you see they know they attack
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:54.800]  it and act sneaky it's like they're doing something wrong but if they attack it boldly yeah magna
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:58:03.920]  karta is horrible i'm getting rid of it it's like wow it it's all a confidence game neither
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:10.840]  side stood behind their commitments and the charter was annulled by the pope innocent the
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:15.760]  third leading to the first baron's war and again as i said it wasn't even enforced right
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:21.240]  up front but then it took hundreds of years with the parliament act and other things to
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:29.840]  divest the crown of its power and to transfer it first to barons then to lords then to parliament
[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:35.920]  then to the councils then to the people and it's always this struggle but it was an evolution
[02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:42.480]  that led in great part to other developments of freedom in the continent of europe that
[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:48.760]  led to the renaissance with the acceleration the nitrous oxide and a race car of adding
[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:57.560]  the printing press the guttenberg and so it's a big deal here today to see the president
[02:58:57.560 --> 02:59:02.360]  saying he's above the law saying he can open the borders if he wants he can change laws
[02:59:02.360 --> 02:59:07.520]  he can sign executive orders to restrict power plants or sign executive orders to go after
[02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:16.400]  guns this is tyranny this is a president playing god this is what the un and bill derberg
[02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:21.440]  and all this is about is the new royalty saying they have diplomatic immunity they are above
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:29.880]  the law no you are not above the law and magna karta and all these other great signpost
[02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:33.200]  continue on as we promote them and breathe life into them
