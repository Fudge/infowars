[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  We've got it, got it.
[00:01.400 --> 00:03.400]  Thank you for your space coming to you.
[00:04.700 --> 00:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.400]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:11.400 --> 00:17.600]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:19.700 --> 00:24.400]  When you come face to face with the fact that we're dealing with organized evil
[00:25.100 --> 00:26.600]  with these mega corporations
[00:26.600 --> 00:30.600]  and that everything they preach about all day, being loving, being good,
[00:30.600 --> 00:33.600]  caring about humanity is a cover for who they really are.
[00:33.600 --> 00:37.600]  Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft.
[00:38.600 --> 00:42.600]  Truly wicked, wicked organizations. It's all coming up.
[00:45.600 --> 00:48.600]  Top of Drudge Report, as it said best,
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.600]  Amazon warehouse of hell, robots replace exhausted humans.
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.600]  They make you package one package per nine seconds or you're fired.
[00:57.600 --> 01:01.600]  Total enslavement like a Chinese slave factory.
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.600]  But it's okay because it's liberal.
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.600]  When Apple has suicide nets at its factory and forced drugging, it's liberal.
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.600]  But first let's go to John Bowne's report on the New World Order.
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.600]  Even though Nancy Pelosi is defending fallen representative John Conyers
[01:17.600 --> 01:21.600]  after his sexual misconduct came roaring out of the closet.
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.600]  And even though embarrassed Senator Al Franken refuses to resign
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.600]  and even though the sexual misconduct in Congress is so massive
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.600]  it is under sealed confidentiality agreements that have cost taxpayers $17 million.
[01:36.600 --> 01:41.600]  All of the Sunday morning talk shows went after the Commander-in-Chief
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.600]  using the allegations surrounding congressional candidate Roy Moore
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.600]  to lump Trump into the fray while simultaneously protecting
[01:49.600 --> 01:51.600]  their corporatic comrades.
[01:55.600 --> 01:59.600]  Representative Jackie Spear has said she knows of two other members of Congress
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.600]  who have engaged in sexual harassment.
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.600]  Still unnamed and as of now facing no consequences.
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.600]  And then there's Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.600]  accused of sexual misconduct against minors.
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.600]  President Donald Trump defending him this week saying that Moore denies it
[02:18.600 --> 02:21.600]  and implying that his denial is enough.
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.600]  But according to a report just out overnight in the New York Times
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.600]  that defense of Moore infuriating Trump's Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill
[02:31.600 --> 02:35.600]  who had been trying to distance the party from those misconduct allegations.
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.600]  Today on Face the Nation there is maybe a split, maybe there's not a split
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.600]  but there appears to be a split between the President who doesn't believe
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.600]  Roy Moore's accusers and Senate Republicans including McConnell
[02:49.600 --> 02:52.600]  and Mike Lee, other senators who've looked at the evidence
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.600]  looked at the responses from Roy Moore and said we believe the accusers.
[02:56.600 --> 02:58.600]  Do you think that split matters?
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.600]  Once you just back away a little bit having Moore win
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.600]  and then come to the Senate presents just a whole host of political problems
[03:07.600 --> 03:09.600]  that will not be easy to deal with.
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.600]  Sexual harassment, a national turning point or is it?
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.600]  After refusing to back Alabama's Roy Moore.
[03:15.600 --> 03:20.600]  The President said if the allegations are true then that Roy Moore should step aside.
[03:20.600 --> 03:23.600]  President Trump decides to stand by his man.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.600]  I can tell you one thing for sure.
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.600]  We don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.600]  Good Sunday morning. I hope everyone is having a safe and healthy Thanksgiving weekend.
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.600]  There are moments in the past half century when as Americans
[03:38.600 --> 03:42.600]  we've been forced to re-examine our attitudes and ourselves.
[03:42.600 --> 03:44.600]  Vietnam, civil rights, gay rights.
[03:44.600 --> 03:47.600]  In politics we're now facing the crucible of sexual harassment.
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.600]  Our revulsion at what we've learned and our uncertainty of what to do about it going forward.
[03:52.600 --> 03:56.600]  Is it time to demand the resignation of all politicians accused of harassment?
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.600]  Is it better to support an accused child molester of your own party
[04:00.600 --> 04:03.600]  than to have the other party win an election?
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.600]  The revolt against sexual harassment and assault
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.600]  may in part be a backlash after Donald Trump's 2016 victory
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.600]  when millions of voters overlooked more than a dozen allegations of sexual misconduct.
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.600]  And what Mr. Trump in the White House
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.600]  a result that triggered thousands of women nationwide
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.600]  to begin an anti-Trump movement that has flexed its muscles since the inauguration.
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.600]  With two weeks until the special U.S. Senate election in Alabama
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.600]  President Trump is again aligning himself with embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore.
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.600]  Today on Twitter the president called Moore's Democratic amendment.
[04:42.600 --> 04:46.600]  Are we not all under unyielding harassment by the corporate media?
[04:46.600 --> 04:50.600]  When do the American people get what their tax dollars paid for?
[04:50.600 --> 04:56.600]  The names behind the $17 million payout to the victims of perverse hubris
[04:56.600 --> 04:58.600]  lingering in the nation's capital.
[04:58.600 --> 05:04.600]  I'm driving home here about to take off few days for Thanksgiving
[05:04.600 --> 05:08.600]  and I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers
[05:08.600 --> 05:11.600]  of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[05:11.600 --> 05:17.600]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action
[05:17.600 --> 05:19.600]  and if you weren't there spreading the word
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.600]  globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[05:23.600 --> 05:31.600]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer
[05:31.600 --> 05:38.600]  that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.600]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.600]  with the enemies tracking back so just please we should all be so thankful to God
[05:46.600 --> 05:49.600]  and thankful to each other for taking action.
[05:49.600 --> 05:53.600]  And also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead
[05:53.600 --> 05:57.600]  because history is happening so for myself and my family, God bless you all.
[05:57.600 --> 06:20.600]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[06:27.600 --> 06:47.600]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[06:47.600 --> 06:48.600]  You think? Just let me think.
[06:48.600 --> 06:51.600]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones
[06:51.600 --> 06:54.600]  and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.600]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[06:55.600 --> 06:56.600]  Damn it!
[06:56.600 --> 07:00.600]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation
[07:00.600 --> 07:03.600]  words will always retain their power.
[07:03.600 --> 07:07.600]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen
[07:07.600 --> 07:09.600]  the enunciation of truth.
[07:09.600 --> 07:14.600]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[07:14.600 --> 07:16.600]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof.
[07:16.600 --> 07:18.600]  You told me every television in longer!
[07:18.600 --> 07:21.600]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.600]  And where once you have the freedom to object
[07:23.600 --> 07:26.600]  and don't think and speak as you saw fit
[07:26.600 --> 07:28.600]  you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[07:28.600 --> 07:32.600]  perversing your conformity and surveying your submachine.
[07:32.600 --> 07:34.600]  How did this happen?
[07:34.600 --> 07:36.600]  Who's to blame?
[07:36.600 --> 07:39.600]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.600]  They will be held accountable.
[07:41.600 --> 07:44.600]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty
[07:44.600 --> 07:47.600]  you need only look into a mirror.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.600]  I know why you did it.
[07:49.600 --> 07:51.600]  I know you were afraid.
[07:51.600 --> 07:54.600]  You wouldn't be. War, terror, disease.
[07:54.600 --> 07:57.600]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired
[07:57.600 --> 08:01.600]  to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[08:01.600 --> 08:04.600]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic
[08:04.600 --> 08:07.600]  you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Suttler.
[08:07.600 --> 08:10.600]  He promised you order, he promised you peace
[08:10.600 --> 08:14.600]  and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[08:14.600 --> 08:17.600]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[08:17.600 --> 08:20.600]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[08:20.600 --> 08:23.600]  The time to choose sides has come.
[08:23.600 --> 08:27.600]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.600]  And it is Cyber Monday, the 27th day of November 2017.
[08:37.600 --> 08:39.600]  I'm Alex Shepard.
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.600]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.600]  I do intend to open the phones up and take your calls today.
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.600]  The news is getting so insane, so crazy
[08:52.600 --> 08:55.600]  that I don't even know where to start anymore.
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.600]  I mean, just look at these headlines.
[08:58.600 --> 09:00.600]  Amazon warehouse of hell.
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.600]  Robots replace exhausted humans.
[09:04.600 --> 09:10.600]  And then, if you go deeper,
[09:10.600 --> 09:13.600]  you learn that all of Amazon,
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.600]  every bed of it is taxpayer subsidized nationwide
[09:17.600 --> 09:24.600]  and it is exempt from all of the major laws
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.600]  that it lobbies for against us to shut down Main Street,
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.600]  to even shut down Walmart.
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.600]  It has slave factories in China,
[09:39.600 --> 09:41.600]  the equivalent of slavery here,
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.600]  absolutely cold-blooded, absolutely technocratic.
[09:49.600 --> 09:52.600]  It gets $1.48 every package at Shepard's,
[09:52.600 --> 09:54.600]  with taxpayer money.
[09:54.600 --> 09:57.600]  Other big companies don't get that.
[09:57.600 --> 10:00.600]  He's building buildings all over the major cities
[10:00.600 --> 10:03.600]  where he's based, where they basically push the employees
[10:03.600 --> 10:06.600]  to then live in a small apartment,
[10:06.600 --> 10:14.600]  pay more per square foot than you normally would.
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.600]  He's buying up the grocery stores.
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.600]  He's buying up the infrastructure
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.600]  and he's doing it all through monopoly systems.
[10:24.600 --> 10:27.600]  And he says he's going to replace humans,
[10:27.600 --> 10:29.600]  that that's his ultimate goal,
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.600]  but it's okay he's abusive and oppressive and repressive
[10:33.600 --> 10:36.600]  because he likes Obama and that makes it trendy,
[10:36.600 --> 10:39.600]  kind of like Apple with the suicide nets and the stairwells
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.600]  and around the buildings at their Foxcom factories.
[10:45.600 --> 10:48.600]  Remember that?
[10:48.600 --> 10:51.600]  The people jumping off the roofs and the forced drugging,
[10:51.600 --> 10:55.600]  but the media didn't care because it's Apple
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.600]  and they're trendy and they support Black Lives Matter.
[11:00.600 --> 11:03.600]  So it's okay if Obama funded the Arab Spring
[11:03.600 --> 11:05.600]  and the Muslim Brotherhood to put hundreds of thousands
[11:05.600 --> 11:08.600]  of women into slavery as young as six years of age
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.600]  and rape them to death and throw gays off buildings
[11:11.600 --> 11:16.600]  because they pose and say they're liberal,
[11:16.600 --> 11:20.600]  so it must be okay.
[11:20.600 --> 11:23.600]  Meanwhile, while all of this is going on,
[11:23.600 --> 11:26.600]  while Google admits that even if you turn off
[11:26.600 --> 11:28.600]  all the spy functions, they're still watching you,
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.600]  they're still listening to you,
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.600]  they're still tracking where you go, what you do,
[11:36.600 --> 11:38.600]  you've got cancer rates skyrocketing,
[11:38.600 --> 11:41.600]  you've got vaccines killing people all over the place
[11:41.600 --> 11:43.600]  and causing neurological disorders
[11:43.600 --> 11:45.600]  and causing all sorts of problems,
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.600]  but despite all of that,
[11:47.600 --> 11:58.600]  we're told that sex scandals dealing with men
[11:58.600 --> 12:04.600]  asking women out is paramount to Harvey Weinstein
[12:04.600 --> 12:07.600]  raping women, according to eyewitnesses
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.600]  and Kevin Spacey basically sexually assaulting men.
[12:11.600 --> 12:16.600]  All of that is paramount in the media's conflation
[12:16.600 --> 12:19.600]  with a man asking a woman out
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.600]  or a man trying to kiss a woman
[12:21.600 --> 12:23.600]  and then she rebuffs him.
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.600]  That is paramount now with rape and pedophilia,
[12:27.600 --> 12:33.600]  but the American people see right through all of this.
[12:33.600 --> 12:36.600]  We've seen wall-to-wall coverage in the control
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.600]  corporate press that Trump supports a child molester,
[12:40.600 --> 12:42.600]  Roy Moore, as if he is a child molester,
[12:42.600 --> 12:45.600]  as if he's been proven or convicted,
[12:45.600 --> 12:48.600]  when they have far more proof of Bill Clinton
[12:48.600 --> 12:51.600]  on a sex traffickers airplane going to an island
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.600]  where sex trafficked children were taken
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.600]  and we have senior secret service agents
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.600]  like Mr. Bongino saying that while they were there,
[12:59.600 --> 13:01.600]  they witnessed things you couldn't believe
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.600]  and they threatened to release the information,
[13:04.600 --> 13:06.600]  but that's not even in the news.
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.600]  We wrote about it last Friday,
[13:08.600 --> 13:11.600]  didn't even get any coverage, who cares?
[13:11.600 --> 13:13.600]  Ex-secret service agent threatened to drop
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.600]  details about Bill Clinton and Lolita Express,
[13:16.600 --> 13:18.600]  newswars.com.
[13:18.600 --> 13:20.600]  But meanwhile, Trump comes out and says,
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.600]  we haven't seen any proof and until I see proof on Roy Moore,
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.600]  I'm not going to support the Democrat,
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.600]  Pelosi comes out and calls Conyers an icon,
[13:30.600 --> 13:32.600]  but that's okay.
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.600]  Now the media spends it, oh look,
[13:34.600 --> 13:38.600]  Trump supports a child molester,
[13:38.600 --> 13:40.600]  but he hadn't been convicted of it,
[13:40.600 --> 13:41.600]  hadn't been proven.
[13:41.600 --> 13:43.600]  Talk about defamation, but see,
[13:43.600 --> 13:48.600]  he's a public figure, so they hide behind that.
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.600]  Meanwhile, Trump has come out and said
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.600]  that he will not campaign for Moore
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.600]  and he said he wouldn't campaign for him before
[13:54.600 --> 13:56.600]  and didn't originally support him,
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.600]  but again, it turns into this giant diversion
[13:59.600 --> 14:02.600]  as if all the crimes on Earth against women
[14:02.600 --> 14:05.600]  were done by Judge Roy Moore.
[14:05.600 --> 14:07.600]  Meanwhile, CNN had a big report out yesterday
[14:07.600 --> 14:10.600]  saying sexual harassment globally by the numbers
[14:10.600 --> 14:13.600]  and said, oh, the Middle East doesn't have any problems,
[14:13.600 --> 14:16.600]  America, that's where we're bad to women.
[14:16.600 --> 14:18.600]  I'm not kidding.
[14:18.600 --> 14:19.600]  So that's how they operate.
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.600]  Meanwhile, last week, major corporations broke ties
[14:24.600 --> 14:27.600]  with Google and YouTube for now
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.600]  over the fact that they have been promoting
[14:30.600 --> 14:34.600]  sexualization of children and soft core child porn,
[14:34.600 --> 14:35.600]  if you could call it that,
[14:35.600 --> 14:38.600]  and weird snuff film videos,
[14:38.600 --> 14:40.600]  simulated snuff films of children being killed,
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.600]  cut into videos that are supposed to look
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.600]  like they're family friendly.
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.600]  Last night, I started getting more intel about this
[14:47.600 --> 14:51.600]  and then saw it in the news today.
[14:51.600 --> 14:53.600]  This is on infowars.com,
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.600]  YouTube auto complete tool shows users
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.600]  profoundly disturbing child sex results
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.600]  when they search for how-to videos
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.600]  and that's coming up as well.
[15:06.600 --> 15:09.600]  So you just type in how to change a tire,
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.600]  how to sail a boat, how to tire shoelaces,
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.600]  how to plant tulips, how to sell your bike.
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.600]  No, that's not what you get.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.600]  How to have sex with your kids
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.600]  and then a bunch of other vulgar searches
[15:26.600 --> 15:29.600]  are the first thing you get.
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.600]  How to have sex with your kids.
[15:32.600 --> 15:34.600]  Think that's all by accident?
[15:34.600 --> 15:37.600]  That is the religion of the people running things,
[15:37.600 --> 15:39.600]  is hurting innocents.
[15:39.600 --> 15:42.600]  And if they can't screw their brains up with television,
[15:42.600 --> 15:44.600]  that's the low level stuff,
[15:44.600 --> 15:45.600]  at least they can screw your kid up,
[15:45.600 --> 15:46.600]  get him on drugs,
[15:46.600 --> 15:49.600]  that's the main overall satanic transmission.
[15:49.600 --> 15:51.600]  Then if they can get their hands on them
[15:51.600 --> 15:52.600]  and rape them even better,
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.600]  the real good thing is torturing them to death
[15:54.600 --> 15:56.600]  before you gouge their eyeballs out
[15:56.600 --> 15:58.600]  while they beg for mommy.
[15:58.600 --> 16:00.600]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.600]  I'm talking thick meaty,
[16:01.600 --> 16:04.600]  center cut presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:04.600 --> 16:07.600]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[16:07.600 --> 16:08.600]  Awesome.

[16:11.600 --> 16:13.600]  NASA pack technology.
[16:13.600 --> 16:15.600]  Bacon, fully cooked, fully hydrated,

[16:17.600 --> 16:19.600]  or warm and served.

[16:31.600 --> 16:33.600]  freedom from insurance.
[16:33.600 --> 16:35.600]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.600]  that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[16:41.600 --> 16:43.600]  and $347 for families.

[18:56.600 --> 18:59.600]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.600]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact
[19:01.600 --> 19:05.600]  that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually,
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.600]  militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb.
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.600]  With populations and globalism
[19:12.600 --> 19:15.600]  and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds,
[19:15.600 --> 19:17.600]  things are getting crazy.
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.600]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[19:20.600 --> 19:23.600]  We've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared.
[19:23.600 --> 19:25.600]  And the number one thing after getting right with God
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.600]  is to have high-quality, storeable food.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.600]  Well, the entire line of my Patriots supply foods,
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.600]  private-labeled as InfoWars Select,
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.600]  is now 50% off.
[19:34.600 --> 19:37.600]  I've only done that one time before previously.
[19:37.600 --> 19:39.600]  50% off, you cannot beat that.
[19:39.600 --> 19:42.600]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.600]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving
[19:44.600 --> 19:46.600]  and runs through next Monday.
[19:46.600 --> 19:49.600]  InfoWarsStore.com, you can go right there.
[19:49.600 --> 19:51.600]  It's the full spectrum of my Patriot,
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.600]  it's private-labeled by us, totally fresh,
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.600]  last 25 years, 50% off.
[19:55.600 --> 20:21.600]  50% off, take action today.
[20:26.600 --> 20:29.600]  All right, coming up, ladies and gentlemen,
[20:29.600 --> 20:33.600]  inside Amazon's slave factories
[20:33.600 --> 20:37.600]  and inside their slave shipping centers,
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.600]  and how Jeff Bezos is truly organized evil.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.600]  Everything he does is meant to be dehumanizing,
[20:45.600 --> 20:48.600]  anti-human, and quite frankly,
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.600]  I walked in this morning,
[20:50.600 --> 20:52.600]  there was my wife again on Amazon,
[20:52.600 --> 20:56.600]  and I said, honey, we gotta dehabitualize this.
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.600]  All these little packages coming to people's houses
[20:58.600 --> 21:00.600]  are undercutting all the markets.
[21:00.600 --> 21:02.600]  He's made special deals with the government.
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.600]  He gets $1.48 every package from us.
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.600]  He took over the publishing industry,
[21:07.600 --> 21:10.600]  he devastated that, he's moving on to everything,
[21:10.600 --> 21:13.600]  he's anti-free speech, he owns the Washington Post,
[21:13.600 --> 21:15.600]  churning out lies against America,
[21:15.600 --> 21:17.600]  trying to have InfoWars shut down
[21:17.600 --> 21:20.600]  and putting out disinfo that I'm a Russian agent
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.600]  that needs to be arrested.
[21:24.600 --> 21:27.600]  And he does this to any industry, any media, anything.
[21:27.600 --> 21:30.600]  He wants total control,
[21:30.600 --> 21:32.600]  and he psychologically studies
[21:32.600 --> 21:35.600]  how to get you tied into his systems.
[21:35.600 --> 21:37.600]  He wants to own the grocery stores you go to,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.600]  the self-driving cars, the packages you get,
[21:41.600 --> 21:44.600]  where you live, he's pushing the coffin apartments
[21:44.600 --> 21:46.600]  so you own nothing, you have nothing.
[21:46.600 --> 21:49.600]  He's trying to replace you with robots.
[21:49.600 --> 21:52.600]  He's a super uncool guy, okay?
[21:56.600 --> 21:59.600]  And of course he's all tied into DARPA and his daddy
[21:59.600 --> 22:03.600]  and a whiz kid who just magically did all this on his own.
[22:03.600 --> 22:07.600]  Bull, it's like Bill Gates, it's like Apple,
[22:07.600 --> 22:11.600]  all of it are in-q-tell government DARPA fronts,
[22:11.600 --> 22:15.600]  and they even admit it when you read deeper literature.
[22:15.600 --> 22:19.600]  And Trump is trying to stop this anti-human system.
[22:19.600 --> 22:26.600]  That's his big crime, is that he's against this total control grid
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.600]  that the globalists are building, so that's coming up.
[22:30.600 --> 22:34.600]  YouTube, when you type in how to fix the number one search is
[22:34.600 --> 22:37.600]  how to have sex with your kids.
[22:37.600 --> 22:40.600]  Massive pedophile arrests going on all over the place
[22:40.600 --> 22:46.600]  of people sex trafficking three, four, and six-month-old babies
[22:46.600 --> 22:48.600]  for gang raping, that's all coming up.
[22:48.600 --> 22:52.600]  As liberal media says, there is no pedophilia, it doesn't exist.
[22:52.600 --> 22:54.600]  No one wants to sexualize your children,
[22:54.600 --> 22:59.600]  and you turn on the television and it's sexualization of children,
[22:59.600 --> 23:03.600]  and then we've got a report break in the next few days
[23:03.600 --> 23:09.600]  of what Disney's up to, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[23:09.600 --> 23:13.600]  But you talk about caught red-handed.
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.600]  This is the coming out of the pedophiles, folks.
[23:17.600 --> 23:19.600]  I'm going to stop right there.
[23:19.600 --> 23:23.600]  But this stuff's gotten so hardcore that I already knew it was true
[23:23.600 --> 23:25.600]  and that their religion is pedophilia,
[23:25.600 --> 23:36.600]  but when you actually see them on store shelves selling sexualization of babies,
[23:36.600 --> 23:43.600]  I don't even know what to say at this point.
[23:43.600 --> 23:49.600]  I almost just need to take a vacation because I'm not complaining.
[23:49.600 --> 23:52.600]  I've just reached the maximum point here.
[23:52.600 --> 23:58.600]  I mean, I don't know what to say anymore.
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.600]  I mean, these people are evil.
[24:00.600 --> 24:02.600]  They are scientifically evil.
[24:02.600 --> 24:04.600]  They have a will to dominate you.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.600]  They hate you.
[24:05.600 --> 24:09.600]  It's a feeling of just pure, complete, absolute.
[24:09.600 --> 24:10.600]  They're going to run your life.
[24:10.600 --> 24:11.600]  They know how you work.
[24:11.600 --> 24:12.600]  They're going to program you.
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.600]  They're going to set you up.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.600]  They're going to get you.
[24:15.600 --> 24:16.600]  They're going to make you sick.
[24:16.600 --> 24:18.600]  They're going to dominate your life.
[24:18.600 --> 24:19.600]  They're just vicious.
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.600]  They only feel good when they're running over you and doing something bad.
[24:24.600 --> 24:27.600]  And if people would just wake up to how bad these folks are
[24:27.600 --> 24:34.600]  and start making better life choices, it all would be over.
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.600]  I have harangued everybody around me to not use Amazon for years.
[24:39.600 --> 24:41.600]  We were off of Amazon for years.
[24:41.600 --> 24:44.600]  Without me even knowing, they put our stuff back on Amazon.
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.600]  And the argument is in our marketing and shipping, sir, we had to do it
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.600]  because then they sell counterfeits or our products at lower prices
[24:52.600 --> 24:54.600]  and undercut us so we have to have a presence there
[24:54.600 --> 24:57.600]  so we can shut down everybody else selling our stuff.
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.600]  So we had to just have a limited deal there
[25:01.600 --> 25:03.600]  just so we can't be associated with Amazon.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  It's such a monopoly.
[25:04.600 --> 25:07.600]  We've got to have one of their tentacles around our neck
[25:07.600 --> 25:13.600]  or we can't even communicate with the monster.
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.600]  And they've got the exhausted humans hanging around inside the factories
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.600]  as the robots are right next to them, replacing them.
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.600]  That's up on newswars.com and everywhere else.
[25:24.600 --> 25:34.600]  And meanwhile, I have Bezos breathing down my neck.
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.600]  And he's about to get not just $1.48 every package
[25:38.600 --> 25:40.600]  and tax exemptions in all these cities
[25:40.600 --> 25:43.600]  and where the cities actually pay to build their factories.
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.600]  And you thought paying to build a sports stadium was bad.
[25:49.600 --> 25:51.600]  This is next level.
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.600]  They now have a bill that's set to pass the Senate anytime
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.600]  with bipartisan support as Bezos has greased all the skids
[25:59.600 --> 26:06.600]  where every federal purchase, whether it be automobiles or printer ink
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.600]  or government uniforms will go through Amazon
[26:10.600 --> 26:13.600]  and Amazon's going to give them a computer program interface
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.600]  where you can only shop on government computers with Amazon.
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.600]  And of course Trump's trying to stop that
[26:21.600 --> 26:23.600]  and that's why they want to kill it.
[26:23.600 --> 26:26.600]  Because you're going to buy from Jeff Bezos
[26:26.600 --> 26:32.600]  who's anti-gun, anti-Christian, anti-family, anti-human, pro-robot takeover
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.600]  because he's such a jerk that if he thinks he can wreck humanity
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.600]  with Apple and Google and all the rest of these psycho jerks
[26:40.600 --> 26:44.600]  that he's a big man because he screwed over everybody.
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.600]  And he made you pay for it and you were so stupid
[26:48.600 --> 26:53.600]  you kept buying everything from him and the little Pavlovian boxes
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.600]  and the free shipping because it's been paid for by taxpayers
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.600]  and there you are, slitting your own throat, shutting your own city down.
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.600]  It's not innovation, it's cancer.
[27:03.600 --> 27:09.600]  It's organized scientific bug-eyed evil
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.600]  by a collection of psychopaths who love slave camps,
[27:13.600 --> 27:16.600]  who love slave labor, who love forced abortion,
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.600]  who love forced drugging, who love suicide nets.
[27:20.600 --> 27:23.600]  You're never going to hear Black Lives Matter or Kaepernick or anybody
[27:23.600 --> 27:26.600]  bitch and complain about millions of Chinese slaves
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.600]  or millions of Buddhists in prisons with their organs being harvested
[27:30.600 --> 27:32.600]  because that's not the script.
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.600]  You follow Apple and Amazon script and Google script
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.600]  to act like you're old liberal and loving
[27:38.600 --> 27:41.600]  while your own white papers say you're going to replace humans
[27:41.600 --> 27:48.600]  or dog meat and garbage and filth.
[27:48.600 --> 27:52.600]  Now coming up, should have said at the start of the broadcast,
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.600]  you want movement from Trump?

[28:06.600 --> 28:10.600]  and Billy Boyd, Petafile Clinton in the grease.
[28:10.600 --> 28:16.600]  He's got the grease turned up at a nice 300 degrees or so.
[28:16.600 --> 28:18.600]  He's turning it up to 350.
[28:18.600 --> 28:23.600]  They're in the hopper and the button's going into the grease.
[28:23.600 --> 28:25.600]  So that's coming up.
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.600]  Roger Stone joins us with the exclusive intel on that.
[28:29.600 --> 28:35.600]  Also is General Michael T. Flynn really turning on Trump?
[28:35.600 --> 28:38.600]  Somebody talk to folks in that camp
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.600]  and we'll have the answer for you on that
[28:40.600 --> 28:42.600]  and more on the other side.

[31:04.600 --> 31:07.600]  just encouraging listeners to understand that
[31:07.600 --> 31:10.600]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[31:10.600 --> 31:12.600]  or books or videos
[31:12.600 --> 31:16.600]  or other material from infowarrestore.com,
[31:16.600 --> 31:18.600]  you are funding the revolution.
[31:18.600 --> 31:20.600]  I cannot say it any clearer.
[31:20.600 --> 31:23.600]  It is essential that you purchase the products
[31:23.600 --> 31:25.600]  at infowarrestore.com.

[31:34.600 --> 31:37.600]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[31:37.600 --> 31:40.600]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[31:46.600 --> 31:48.600]  stands with us, stands with America,
[31:48.600 --> 31:50.600]  stands with Trump, stands against the globalists
[31:50.600 --> 31:52.600]  and their satanic pedophile armies.
[31:52.600 --> 31:54.600]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are.
[31:54.600 --> 31:59.600]  And they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.600]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers
[32:02.600 --> 32:05.600]  that without you funding our operation by purchasing products
[32:05.600 --> 32:09.600]  at infowarrestore.com, we would not be here.
[32:09.600 --> 32:11.600]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[32:11.600 --> 32:13.600]  We don't have globalist funding.
[32:13.600 --> 32:15.600]  We're funded by patriots like you.
[32:15.600 --> 32:17.600]  And we also, of course, provide high-quality products
[32:17.600 --> 32:19.600]  to make it easy to support yourself
[32:19.600 --> 32:21.600]  and to support us,
[32:21.600 --> 32:24.600]  especially as we try to retake this country and the planet
[32:24.600 --> 32:28.600]  and heal the population that's been under globalist engineering.
[32:28.600 --> 32:31.600]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever,
[32:31.600 --> 32:34.600]  every single year, during Black Friday.

[32:50.600 --> 32:53.600]  storeable foods. That's unprecedented.
[32:53.600 --> 32:56.600]  We've got super male volatility, 50% off, and so much more.
[32:56.600 --> 32:58.600]  So check it out today.
[33:00.600 --> 33:03.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:03.600 --> 33:05.600]  The Alex Jones Show.
[33:34.600 --> 33:36.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[33:36.600 --> 33:38.600]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign,
[33:38.600 --> 33:40.600]  has talked to folks.
[33:40.600 --> 33:42.600]  We'll just leave it at that.
[33:42.600 --> 33:44.600]  And he's got the inside scoop on the FBI,
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.600]  new director, getting ready to move against Mueller,
[33:47.600 --> 33:50.600]  Comey, the Clintons, you name it. This is very exciting news.
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.600]  But you suddenly see all these emails being put out now
[33:53.600 --> 33:56.600]  showing the cover-up of Mueller and others
[33:56.600 --> 33:59.600]  back six, seven years ago of Uranium One.
[33:59.600 --> 34:01.600]  They're saying, we've got to handle this specially.
[34:01.600 --> 34:03.600]  I'm the only one that looks at it.
[34:03.600 --> 34:05.600]  Then he killed it to shut down the informant,
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.600]  to shut down all that information.
[34:07.600 --> 34:09.600]  So that's all coming unraveled.
[34:09.600 --> 34:11.600]  And the media for a week has been saying
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.600]  that General Flynn is turning against Trump
[34:13.600 --> 34:17.600]  because he's not talking to the White House lawyers anymore.
[34:17.600 --> 34:19.600]  We're going to explain why.
[34:19.600 --> 34:21.600]  And I'd already figured this out,
[34:21.600 --> 34:23.600]  but as soon as we were able to talk to the parties,
[34:23.600 --> 34:25.600]  it was what we thought.
[34:25.600 --> 34:28.600]  So that is coming up.
[34:28.600 --> 34:30.600]  The White House is full of operatives, folks.
[34:30.600 --> 34:32.600]  The White House is full of globalists.
[34:32.600 --> 34:34.600]  You want to leak stuff?
[34:34.600 --> 34:37.600]  That's like communicating to Mueller.
[34:37.600 --> 34:40.600]  And Flynn understands that former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.600]  That's how hijacked the White House is.
[34:42.600 --> 34:45.600]  It's still doing a lot of good, but Trump is surrounded.
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.600]  Just like Trump fired the head of an agency.
[34:47.600 --> 34:49.600]  It's totally under law. You can do it.
[34:49.600 --> 34:51.600]  They're now suing him over it
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.600]  because the person that quit appointed someone
[34:53.600 --> 34:55.600]  and is claiming they have the right
[34:55.600 --> 34:57.600]  to appoint someone, not the president.
[34:57.600 --> 35:00.600]  And the media plays on the public's ignorance
[35:00.600 --> 35:02.600]  and goes, oh, look,
[35:02.600 --> 35:04.600]  Trump fired the head of an agency.
[35:04.600 --> 35:07.600]  He can't do that when the law is 100% clear
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.600]  for 240 years.
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.600]  Now, before we go any further,
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.600]  I am excited to announce to everybody
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.600]  the launch of something absolutely new,
[35:22.600 --> 35:24.600]  dynamic, and exciting.
[35:24.600 --> 35:27.600]  And I am so excited
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.600]  to be able to break this down here on air
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.600]  and to be able to
[35:35.600 --> 35:38.600]  offer something like this to the public
[35:38.600 --> 35:45.600]  because something like this
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.600]  will be so popular and so successful
[35:49.600 --> 35:56.600]  that it will help fund our operations and our expansion.
[35:56.600 --> 35:58.600]  Now, first off, ladies and gentlemen,
[35:58.600 --> 36:00.600]  we're in the middle of a 34-hour live broadcast,
[36:00.600 --> 36:03.600]  and we're live 10 hours a day right now
[36:03.600 --> 36:06.600]  from 8 a.m. past 3 p.m. in the afternoon central.
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.600]  But now we are going to be more and more often
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.600]  doing 34-hour broadcasts
[36:14.600 --> 36:16.600]  where they kick off at 8 a.m. with David Knight
[36:16.600 --> 36:19.600]  and Bill Nunes, run through M4's Live with Julie Alex Jones,
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.600]  right through Owen Schreuer,
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.600]  and the War Room that comes on at 3 o'clock every day.
[36:25.600 --> 36:27.600]  So it starts one day, runs through 24 hours,
[36:27.600 --> 36:30.600]  and then back through another 10 hours.
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.600]  That's 34 hours live,
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.600]  and we're calling this 34-hour live transmission,
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.600]  Know Your Enemy.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.600]  We're going to get into the globalist
[36:38.600 --> 36:40.600]  and how they run monopolies and how they're anti-human
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.600]  and how they have a church of AI
[36:42.600 --> 36:45.600]  and worship world government and worship AI computers.
[36:45.600 --> 36:47.600]  And believe that they're going to become gods.
[36:47.600 --> 36:50.600]  I reported that 10 years ago in my film Endgame.
[36:50.600 --> 36:52.600]  Now you notice that's all over the news.
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.600]  Google executives met to launch their new church
[36:55.600 --> 36:58.600]  of worshiping AI.
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.600]  Also be part of the revolution,
[37:00.600 --> 37:01.600]  spreading the word,
[37:01.600 --> 37:03.600]  infowars.com forward slash show,
[37:03.600 --> 37:06.600]  reaching out to new people during the special 34-hour broadcast.
[37:06.600 --> 37:08.600]  Please, whether you're watching on Facebook,
[37:08.600 --> 37:09.600]  Google, Twitter, YouTube,
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.600]  or listening on local radio station,
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.600]  or watching us on local TV station,
[37:13.600 --> 37:15.600]  tell everybody about the transmission
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.600]  and spread the links.
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.600]  That's how we get around the sensors and the globalists
[37:19.600 --> 37:21.600]  that are openly having congressional hearings,
[37:21.600 --> 37:23.600]  talking about how they're trying to shut down
[37:23.600 --> 37:26.600]  our free speech.
[37:26.600 --> 37:29.600]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:29.600 --> 37:32.600]  introducing
[37:32.600 --> 37:35.600]  the cleanest,
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.600]  purest, most researched,
[37:38.600 --> 37:41.600]  heart and body,
[37:41.600 --> 37:43.600]  energy,
[37:43.600 --> 37:46.600]  utropic out there.
[37:46.600 --> 37:47.600]  I'm so excited.
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.600]  It's a two-month supply.
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.600]  And it goes directly
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.600]  to supercharging the body.
[38:00.600 --> 38:03.600]  Introducing, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.600]  the real red pill.
[38:05.600 --> 38:08.600]  Now, this doesn't compete with Brain Force Plus.
[38:08.600 --> 38:10.600]  It's so incredibly popular
[38:10.600 --> 38:13.600]  and is a very, very inexpensive,
[38:13.600 --> 38:16.600]  high-quality, neutropic that blows away the competition
[38:16.600 --> 38:18.600]  and is our number one best-selling product.
[38:18.600 --> 38:20.600]  It goes together with it.
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.600]  The red pill has the very best amino acids,
[38:23.600 --> 38:27.600]  wide-spectrum, organic-sourced vitamins and minerals,
[38:27.600 --> 38:30.600]  every vitamin, every mineral you need,
[38:30.600 --> 38:33.600]  with key amino acids that allow the uptake of it
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.600]  with one final, highest-quality sourced ingredient.
[38:38.600 --> 38:40.600]  That I learned about six, seven years ago
[38:40.600 --> 38:43.600]  from medical doctors that are prescribing this
[38:43.600 --> 38:45.600]  to their patients even though it's not prescription.
[38:45.600 --> 38:47.600]  And that's preglonone.
[38:47.600 --> 38:50.600]  They've been giving us this the 20s for arthritis.
[38:50.600 --> 38:53.600]  And as you get older, by the age 20,
[38:53.600 --> 38:56.600]  it starts dropping massively.
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.600]  Now, it is classified as a neuro-steroid.
[39:01.600 --> 39:03.600]  I don't want that word scare you.
[39:03.600 --> 39:05.600]  It's the precursor,
[39:05.600 --> 39:08.600]  hormone precursor for men and women, for all of their hormones.
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.600]  Without this, your body cannot reduce hormones.
[39:13.600 --> 39:16.600]  That's why it's legal for athletes to take it.
[39:16.600 --> 39:18.600]  That's what they take in the Olympics, you name it,
[39:18.600 --> 39:19.600]  because it's not a steroid.
[39:19.600 --> 39:22.600]  It's the building block the body needs
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.600]  for all the hormones and all the things in the body.
[39:25.600 --> 39:34.600]  So this is a stimulant-free brain, heart, body pill
[39:34.600 --> 39:38.600]  that is a multi-vitamin, multi-mineral,
[39:38.600 --> 39:44.600]  with the preglonone and the key amino acids,
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.600]  all in one pill, a two-month supply for half price.
[39:48.600 --> 39:51.600]  That's why you can sell this retail for $80.
[39:51.600 --> 39:53.600]  We're not doing that, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:53.600 --> 39:55.600]  Out of the gates, it's $39.95,
[39:55.600 --> 39:57.600]  even though that cuts massively into our funding,
[39:57.600 --> 40:00.600]  because it takes a lot to put this much into these pills.
[40:00.600 --> 40:02.600]  There's no fillers, there's no garbage.
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.600]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[40:04.600 --> 40:06.600]  you could take all the stimulants you wanted,
[40:06.600 --> 40:09.600]  you could sit there and take all the steroids you wanted.
[40:09.600 --> 40:13.600]  If you don't have the precursor, preglonone,
[40:13.600 --> 40:15.600]  and the other amino acids that are in this,
[40:15.600 --> 40:17.600]  it's not going to do anything.
[40:17.600 --> 40:20.600]  Well, see, your body already naturally has the ability
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.600]  to make these things.
[40:21.600 --> 40:26.600]  This simply gives it the precursor to do it.
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.600]  This is the real red pill.
[40:28.600 --> 40:30.600]  You want to get awake?
[40:30.600 --> 40:33.600]  Look, brain force has some green tea in it,
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.600]  but then a bunch of other known compounds
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.600]  that wake you up naturally.
[40:37.600 --> 40:39.600]  But it does have some stimulant, and it's great.
[40:39.600 --> 40:41.600]  It's a good, clean stimulant.
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.600]  Brain force plus.
[40:43.600 --> 40:45.600]  Now, 20% more in each bottle.
[40:45.600 --> 40:47.600]  That's still 50% off, because people love the discount.
[40:47.600 --> 40:49.600]  This is 50% off out of the gate,
[40:49.600 --> 40:52.600]  because I know when you try it,
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.600]  most of you have been deficient
[40:56.600 --> 40:58.600]  in one of these minerals, one of these amino acids,
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.600]  one of these cofactors, one of these vitamins.
[41:02.600 --> 41:07.600]  And I know, depending on which statistics you look on,
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.600]  the average person at the age of 20
[41:11.600 --> 41:17.600]  sees as much as a 60% decline in preglonone in the body.
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.600]  Your body produces it.
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.600]  And again, you're not going to find it out there
[41:23.600 --> 41:24.600]  in the environment.
[41:24.600 --> 41:26.600]  It's got to be made, and that's what's happened.
[41:26.600 --> 41:31.600]  And preglonone is the big secret weapon, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:31.600 --> 41:33.600]  But again, if you don't have all these amino acids
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.600]  and vitamins and minerals, your body can't absorb it
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.600]  and can't use it and can't make the hormones
[41:38.600 --> 41:40.600]  that it makes out of it.
[41:40.600 --> 41:43.600]  So this is as close as you're going to get
[41:43.600 --> 41:45.600]  to a fountain of youth, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.600]  That's why you're allowed to make the claims healthy, aging.
[41:50.600 --> 41:53.600]  So this is the Rolls-Royce, the Bentley,
[41:53.600 --> 42:02.600]  the Ferrari of quality for the cost of a forward focus,
[42:02.600 --> 42:04.600]  comparatively.
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.600]  $39.95, ladies and gentlemen, a nice two-month supply,
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.600]  the red pill, because you've got to have
[42:11.600 --> 42:13.600]  all these building blocks together
[42:13.600 --> 42:17.600]  to then have your glands and the rest of it be able to operate.
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.600]  That's a fact about not just the preglonone,
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.600]  but the key amino acids we have in here,
[42:24.600 --> 42:26.600]  with the vitamins, with the minerals,
[42:26.600 --> 42:30.600]  all the everything together, the real red pill.
[42:30.600 --> 42:33.600]  Then you take Rainforest.
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.600]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com,
[42:37.600 --> 42:40.600]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[42:40.600 --> 42:42.600]  And we still have store-wide free shipping,
[42:42.600 --> 42:44.600]  but it's got to end tomorrow.
[42:44.600 --> 42:47.600]  It's ending because today is Cyber Monday.
[42:47.600 --> 42:49.600]  Free shipping store-wide, Infowarsstore.com,
[42:49.600 --> 42:52.600]  and you help fund the revolution by shopping with the good guys.
[42:52.600 --> 42:54.600]  If you don't shop with us,
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.600]  we already have better deals at Amazon.
[42:56.600 --> 42:58.600]  You're insane.
[42:58.600 --> 43:01.600]  I'm driving home here,
[43:01.600 --> 43:04.600]  about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving,
[43:04.600 --> 43:07.600]  and I just want to impart my message to the listeners
[43:07.600 --> 43:09.600]  and viewers of how much I appreciate you
[43:09.600 --> 43:11.600]  and how thankful I am.
[43:11.600 --> 43:14.600]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point
[43:14.600 --> 43:16.600]  that if you weren't there taking action,
[43:16.600 --> 43:19.600]  and if you weren't there spreading the word,
[43:19.600 --> 43:21.600]  globalism would have completely taken over
[43:21.600 --> 43:23.600]  not just this country, but other nations.
[43:23.600 --> 43:26.600]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual,
[43:26.600 --> 43:30.600]  anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.600]  that is just pure power cult will to dominate
[43:35.600 --> 43:37.600]  and control society.
[43:37.600 --> 43:40.600]  And that we have come so far with God's help
[43:40.600 --> 43:43.600]  and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.600]  And just please, we should all be so thankful to God
[43:46.600 --> 43:49.600]  and thankful to each other for taking action.
[43:49.600 --> 43:52.600]  And also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead
[43:52.600 --> 43:54.600]  because history is happening.
[43:54.600 --> 43:56.600]  So for myself and my family,
[43:56.600 --> 44:25.600]  I wish you all have a great Thanksgiving.
[44:26.600 --> 44:29.600]  Pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.600]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[44:31.600 --> 44:34.600]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.600]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[44:36.600 --> 44:38.600]  They are the anti-liberals.
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.600]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends,
[44:41.600 --> 44:43.600]  and promote freedom worldwide.
[44:43.600 --> 44:45.600]  We've got more than 60 original designs
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.600]  of high-quality t-shirts for men and women,
[44:48.600 --> 44:52.600]  as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.600]  Be part of the Second American Revolution
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.600]  at infowarstore.com.
[44:58.600 --> 45:00.600]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact
[45:00.600 --> 45:05.600]  that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily,
[45:05.600 --> 45:08.600]  the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb
[45:08.600 --> 45:11.600]  with populations and globalism
[45:11.600 --> 45:14.600]  and the neural orders manipulation of people's minds.
[45:14.600 --> 45:16.600]  Things are getting crazy.
[45:16.600 --> 45:19.600]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[45:19.600 --> 45:22.600]  We've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared.
[45:22.600 --> 45:24.600]  The number one thing after getting right with God
[45:24.600 --> 45:26.600]  is to have high-quality, storeable food.
[45:26.600 --> 45:29.600]  Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods,
[45:29.600 --> 45:31.600]  private-labeled as infowarselect,
[45:31.600 --> 45:33.600]  is now 50% off.
[45:33.600 --> 45:36.600]  I've only done that one time before previously.
[45:36.600 --> 45:38.600]  50% off. You cannot beat that.
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.600]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[45:41.600 --> 45:43.600]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving
[45:43.600 --> 45:45.600]  and runs through next Monday.
[45:45.600 --> 45:47.600]  infowarstore.com.
[45:47.600 --> 45:48.600]  You can go right there.
[45:48.600 --> 45:50.600]  It's the full spectrum of my Patriot.
[45:50.600 --> 45:52.600]  It's private-labeled by us. Totally fresh.
[45:52.600 --> 45:55.600]  Last 25 years, 50% off.
[45:55.600 --> 46:24.600]  Take action today.
[46:26.600 --> 46:29.600]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto,
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.600]  lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3,
[46:33.600 --> 46:35.600]  selenium, and copper.
[46:35.600 --> 46:37.600]  Prostagard is something that the men
[46:37.600 --> 46:39.600]  on the InfoWars crew take every day.
[46:39.600 --> 46:41.600]  And from our research, it's something that men
[46:41.600 --> 46:43.600]  should really be adding to their daily regimen
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.600]  in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[46:46.600 --> 46:49.600]  Now's the time to start naturally supporting your body.
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.600]  Get Prostagard on your side today,
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.600]  exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.600]  That's infowarslife.com.
[46:59.600 --> 47:28.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:29.600 --> 47:38.600]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[47:38.600 --> 47:41.600]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:41.600 --> 47:51.600]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[47:51.600 --> 47:55.600]  George H.W. Bush just turned 93.
[47:55.600 --> 47:59.600]  He's now the oldest living president in U.S. history.
[47:59.600 --> 48:04.600]  Number two is Jimmy Carter at 91 years of age.
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.600]  Isn't that interesting?
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.600]  Joining me is Roger Stone,
[48:08.600 --> 48:10.600]  former head of the Trump campaign,
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.600]  to give us the intel on the new FBI director
[48:14.600 --> 48:17.600]  releasing all these emails from the Clinton era
[48:17.600 --> 48:20.600]  and the Obama era with Mueller ordering
[48:20.600 --> 48:22.600]  the investigation shut down.
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.600]  We also have the ongoing Justice Department
[48:24.600 --> 48:26.600]  trying to block and have gag orders
[48:26.600 --> 48:29.600]  against the informants from speaking to Congress
[48:29.600 --> 48:33.600]  about what they know with real Russian collusion
[48:33.600 --> 48:35.600]  and the uranium-1 deal.
[48:35.600 --> 48:38.600]  But these new emails being released by the FBI director
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.600]  signals a big change and looks like
[48:41.600 --> 48:43.600]  justice is about to be done.
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.600]  Another little bird told me about what was going on
[48:47.600 --> 48:49.600]  with General Flynn.
[48:49.600 --> 48:52.600]  Is he really talking to Mueller?
[48:52.600 --> 48:54.600]  Is that really true?
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.600]  Because he stopped talking to the Trump administration.
[48:57.600 --> 48:59.600]  Another little bird told me that's because
[48:59.600 --> 49:01.600]  there's a bunch of leakers in there.
[49:01.600 --> 49:03.600]  He might as well be talking to Mueller.
[49:03.600 --> 49:05.600]  It's not that we don't trust Trump, it's that he's surrounded.
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.600]  So joining us via Skype is Roger Stone.
[49:08.600 --> 49:10.600]  Roger, thank you for joining us.
[49:10.600 --> 49:12.600]  Alex, great to be here.
[49:12.600 --> 49:15.600]  Well, let's get right into the FBI director, the new director.
[49:15.600 --> 49:18.600]  This is big. Tell us what your sources tell you.
[49:18.600 --> 49:22.600]  I spoke to a member of Congress yesterday
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.600]  who tells me that all Washington is buzzing about the fact
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.600]  that 75 pages of emails were posted
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.600]  on the FBI's website, The Vault,
[49:34.600 --> 49:38.600]  but not pursuant to any request from Congress.
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.600]  This is most curious and indeed these emails
[49:42.600 --> 49:44.600]  represent a bombshell.
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.600]  Among other things, they showed the special treatment
[49:48.600 --> 49:53.600]  that was afforded to Hillary Clinton by FBI director James Comey.
[49:53.600 --> 49:57.600]  And essentially, they pierced the cover-up
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.600]  in the email scandal,
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.600]  which dogged her through the presidential campaign.
[50:02.600 --> 50:07.600]  They also document further the violations of the Hatch Act
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.600]  by the deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe.
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.600]  Now, you'll remember, Alex, that McCabe's wife
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.600]  was running for the Virginia State Senate,
[50:18.600 --> 50:25.600]  and the Clintons funneled $457,000 to her campaign
[50:25.600 --> 50:31.600]  through a PAC controlled by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe,
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.600]  a longtime Clinton-running dog and ally.
[50:36.600 --> 50:41.600]  So McCabe has deep legal problems.
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.600]  Comey's problems are now compounded.
[50:44.600 --> 50:46.600]  What does all this mean?
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.600]  A source very close to the new FBI director told me
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.600]  that this is the signal that Director Ray has decided
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.600]  to clean house, that the Obama-era figures
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.600]  still at the FBI are not long for this world.
[51:05.600 --> 51:12.600]  Wow, so this is a real glimmer of hope here
[51:12.600 --> 51:14.600]  that he might actually do his job,
[51:14.600 --> 51:17.600]  because the level of Russian and Communist Chinese
[51:17.600 --> 51:20.600]  and other foreign collusion of the Democrats
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.600]  is just staggering, and then Mueller killing the investigation
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.600]  of the Clintons in the middle of all this,
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.600]  buying off the shipping companies, buying off the mines,
[51:29.600 --> 51:31.600]  buying off the Canadian government.
[51:31.600 --> 51:33.600]  I mean, this was a real Russian operation
[51:33.600 --> 51:36.600]  that was successful getting 20% to 30%
[51:36.600 --> 51:39.600]  of our strategic weapons-grade uranium stockpile.
[51:39.600 --> 51:41.600]  I mean, you talk about classic spy stuff
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.600]  with Mueller delivering weapons-grade samples on tarmacs.
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.600]  There is nothing more Alex
[51:48.600 --> 51:53.600]  than the Comey-Mueller-McCabe gang fears more
[51:53.600 --> 51:57.600]  than a special prosecutor on the matter of uranium-1.
[51:57.600 --> 52:00.600]  That's because such an investigation
[52:00.600 --> 52:05.600]  would necessarily entail both Mueller and Comey,
[52:05.600 --> 52:09.600]  who both had the FBI during that investigation,
[52:09.600 --> 52:12.600]  McCabe, who was also there,
[52:12.600 --> 52:17.600]  but additionally then U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein.
[52:17.600 --> 52:21.600]  How ironic that the four men
[52:21.600 --> 52:25.600]  who are twisting Donald Trump's tail at this very moment
[52:25.600 --> 52:28.600]  would find themselves under federal investigation.
[52:28.600 --> 52:32.600]  Now, the current legal problem lies in the fact
[52:32.600 --> 52:35.600]  that Attorney General Jeff Sessions
[52:35.600 --> 52:38.600]  has recused himself in the uranium-1 matter.
[52:38.600 --> 52:42.600]  That means technically that the person in charge
[52:42.600 --> 52:46.600]  of appointing a special prosecutor on uranium-1
[52:46.600 --> 52:52.600]  is none other than Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
[52:52.600 --> 52:55.600]  Will Rosenstein appoint a special prosecutor
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.600]  to look into Rosenstein?
[52:58.600 --> 53:00.600]  Highly unlikely.
[53:00.600 --> 53:05.600]  That's why the decision must go to the U.S. Solicitor General,
[53:05.600 --> 53:07.600]  a solid Republican,
[53:07.600 --> 53:11.600]  and a man who takes his responsibilities seriously.
[53:11.600 --> 53:14.600]  The House of Cards is about to come down.
[53:14.600 --> 53:15.600]  In the meantime-
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.600]  I was about to say, in the meantime,
[53:17.600 --> 53:19.600]  I want to get into Flynn and other subjects,
[53:19.600 --> 53:20.600]  but let me just interject.
[53:20.600 --> 53:23.600]  Now we see the colossal error that Trump made
[53:23.600 --> 53:26.600]  getting rid of Flynn, which we know he admits,
[53:26.600 --> 53:29.600]  and how they buffaloed the entire administration
[53:29.600 --> 53:32.600]  basically with this rogue move
[53:32.600 --> 53:34.600]  to appoint a special prosecutor
[53:34.600 --> 53:37.600]  when it was Rosenstein clearly covering his butt
[53:37.600 --> 53:39.600]  for uranium-1 the entire time,
[53:39.600 --> 53:43.600]  getting Sessions to recuse himself with no connections to it.
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.600]  He should recuse himself now
[53:45.600 --> 53:47.600]  when he's up to his eyeballs.
[53:47.600 --> 53:49.600]  Mr. Rosenstein, this is outrageous.
[53:49.600 --> 53:51.600]  It is indeed.
[53:51.600 --> 53:54.600]  Now this same member of Congress tells me
[53:54.600 --> 53:59.600]  that 95% of the members of Congress
[53:59.600 --> 54:03.600]  for whom the U.S. taxpayers paid out
[54:03.600 --> 54:08.600]  to cover up sexual assault settlements are Democrats.
[54:08.600 --> 54:11.600]  That's why Nancy Pelosi is struggling mightily
[54:11.600 --> 54:14.600]  to keep this list from the American people.
[54:14.600 --> 54:16.600]  I think it is inexorable, Alex,
[54:16.600 --> 54:19.600]  that those names are going to come out,
[54:19.600 --> 54:22.600]  and we're going to see more of what we saw
[54:22.600 --> 54:24.600]  in the instance of John Conyers,
[54:24.600 --> 54:27.600]  the senior Michigan Democrat
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.600]  who Nancy Pelosi incredibly called an icon over the weekend.
[54:32.600 --> 54:35.600]  It was Conyers who led the charge
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.600]  for the impeachment of my mentor, Richard Nixon.
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.600]  Somewhere, Nixon is smiling.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.600]  Can you hear me?
[54:45.600 --> 54:48.600]  It's just amazing, amazing arrogance,
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.600]  but as you said, the House of Cards is coming down.
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.600]  Let us go now to the question of General Flynn,
[54:59.600 --> 55:02.600]  because I think this is very important.
[55:02.600 --> 55:05.600]  The headline that we showed just a few moments ago
[55:05.600 --> 55:07.600]  that indicated that Flynn,
[55:07.600 --> 55:10.600]  because he has ceased communications
[55:10.600 --> 55:13.600]  between his lawyers and the president's lawyers,
[55:13.600 --> 55:16.600]  has turned on the president,
[55:16.600 --> 55:20.600]  has been told at the very, very highest levels
[55:20.600 --> 55:23.600]  of the Flynn camp that this is untrue,
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.600]  that Flynn's loyalty to the president remains intact,
[55:27.600 --> 55:31.600]  despite the fact that he was sacked
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.600]  only 30 days into his tenure as NSA director,
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.600]  and that indeed that the reason that they have ceased
[55:41.600 --> 55:44.600]  the cooperation and the communications
[55:44.600 --> 55:49.600]  is solely because of the leaks inside the Trump White House.
[55:49.600 --> 55:52.600]  Flynn's lawyers fear that anything they tell
[55:52.600 --> 55:55.600]  the president's lawyers will end up on the desk
[55:55.600 --> 55:58.600]  of Robert Mueller.
[55:58.600 --> 56:01.600]  Roger Stone is our guest here.
[56:01.600 --> 56:04.600]  Again, if we pull back from this,
[56:04.600 --> 56:07.600]  you can see the colossal bluff they've been engaged in,
[56:07.600 --> 56:10.600]  completely in the Russian's, the Chinese,
[56:10.600 --> 56:12.600]  anybody else that would buy them off,
[56:12.600 --> 56:15.600]  red-handed all of them personally making millions of dollars
[56:15.600 --> 56:18.600]  off of it in front of God and country,
[56:18.600 --> 56:21.600]  and now desperately trying to spy on Trump
[56:21.600 --> 56:23.600]  to find something thinking, well,
[56:23.600 --> 56:26.600]  if we sold out to the Russians, maybe he'll sell out too,
[56:26.600 --> 56:29.600]  then we can control him, not finding anything,
[56:29.600 --> 56:31.600]  the panic has only intensified,
[56:31.600 --> 56:34.600]  now they've illegally leaked, they've illegally spied,
[56:34.600 --> 56:36.600]  they've been caught lying about it all,
[56:36.600 --> 56:38.600]  this just gets crazier and crazier.
[56:38.600 --> 56:41.600]  Well, and the real sign, Alex, that the jig is up
[56:41.600 --> 56:44.600]  is the way the mainstream media has turned viciously
[56:44.600 --> 56:47.600]  on the Clintons in the last 10 days,
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.600]  where suddenly, among their biggest defenders
[56:50.600 --> 56:52.600]  in the media are those saying, well,
[56:52.600 --> 56:54.600]  perhaps we should have impeached Bill Clinton
[56:54.600 --> 56:57.600]  over Monica Lewinsky, perhaps it was time
[56:57.600 --> 57:00.600]  to take a closer look at Bill's activities.
[57:00.600 --> 57:02.600]  The problem remains the same, though.
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.600]  Half the mainstream media continues to harp
[57:05.600 --> 57:09.600]  on Bill's consensual but distasteful sexual relationships
[57:09.600 --> 57:13.600]  rather than his track record of vicious assault
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.600]  on women such as Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Willey,
[57:18.600 --> 57:21.600]  and others, the worm has turned,
[57:21.600 --> 57:24.600]  the Clinton's time in the barrel is upon us.
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.600]  We're gonna come back in 70 seconds
[57:26.600 --> 57:30.600]  and get into what does the collapse look like,
[57:30.600 --> 57:32.600]  what's the next shoe to drop,
[57:32.600 --> 57:34.600]  what does the Clinton's time in the barrel look like,
[57:34.600 --> 57:37.600]  and can the civil war inside the Democratic Party
[57:37.600 --> 57:39.600]  be won by either side,
[57:39.600 --> 57:42.600]  or will it deliciously discontinue on and on?
[57:42.600 --> 57:44.600]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[57:44.600 --> 58:11.600]  According to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,
[58:11.600 --> 58:15.600]  it was revealed last week the taxpayers
[58:15.600 --> 58:18.600]  footed the bill for a $27,000 settlement
[58:18.600 --> 58:20.600]  for a staffer of Conyers that claimed
[58:20.600 --> 58:24.600]  the 88-year-old congressman made sexual advances on her
[58:24.600 --> 58:27.600]  and then fired her after she wouldn't succumb to them.
[58:27.600 --> 58:29.600]  And a lawyer who worked for Conyers
[58:29.600 --> 58:32.600]  said she'd often encounter the congressman in his office
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.600]  walking around in his underwear.
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.600]  Conyers, who's the longest serving congressman,
[58:36.600 --> 58:39.600]  has denied all sexual harassment allegations against him.
[58:39.600 --> 58:41.600]  Nancy Pelosi says we need to give him a pass
[58:41.600 --> 58:43.600]  because Conyers is an icon.
[58:43.600 --> 59:10.600]  Lee and McAdooInfoWars.com.
[59:14.600 --> 59:16.600]  The real punk rock is being a patriot
[59:16.600 --> 59:19.600]  who's pro-America, pro-capitalism,
[59:19.600 --> 59:22.600]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[59:22.600 --> 59:24.600]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[59:24.600 --> 59:27.600]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.600]  They are the anti-liberalists
[59:29.600 --> 59:32.600]  who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends,
[59:32.600 --> 59:34.600]  and promote freedom worldwide.
[59:34.600 --> 59:36.600]  We've got more than 60 original designs
[59:36.600 --> 59:39.600]  of high-quality t-shirts for men and women,
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.600]  as well as more Patriot apparel

[59:43.600 --> 59:45.600]  Be part of the Second American Revolution
[59:45.600 --> 59:47.600]  at infowarsstore.com.
[59:50.600 --> 59:54.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.600 --> 59:56.600]  Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.600]  Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  Alex Jones Show.
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:26.600]  I really wondered whether they would ever
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:28.600]  be fully brought to justice,
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:32.600]  but what we have seen is an extraordinary sea change
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:34.600]  where the left has decided
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:38.600]  that the baggage of the Clintons has become a steamer trunk,
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:43.600]  that they can no longer be the face of the opposition,
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  that the American people are fed up with Bill,
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.600]  Hillary, and their greedy little daughter, Chelsea.
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:54.600]  So, in recent weeks, you have seen Ross Douthat
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.600]  of the New York Times,
[1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:59.600]  Chris Hayes of MSNBC,
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:02.600]  the elitist punk David Rothkopf,
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:03.600]  whoever he is,
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  and Michelle Goldberg,
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.600]  writing in the New York Times,
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.600]  all turning viciously on the Clintons.
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:12.600]  What this means, of course,
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  is growing optimism among House Republicans
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:21.600]  that they will get a special prosecutor
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.600]  to look into the Clinton Foundation,
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:26.600]  Uranium One,
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:33.600]  and indeed into Bill's long, tortured list of sexual assaults.
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:35.600]  Now, I want to stress
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:38.600]  that some in the media still trying to pass
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:42.600]  Bill Clinton's activities off as consensual,
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:45.600]  saying that these were infidelities
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.600]  or indiscretions.
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:51.600]  Well, ask Juanita Broderick about that.
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:54.600]  An extraordinary piece last week
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:58.600]  by Aaron Klein of Breitbart,
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:01.600]  an incredible piece by Ed Klein,
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:04.600]  the award-winning author,
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:08.600]  detailing five new women who came forward
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:10.600]  in just the last 10 days,
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:15.600]  all of whom were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton.
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:18.600]  This is creating a firestorm,
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:22.600]  a critical mass, if you will.
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:24.600]  The Clinton's days,
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:27.600]  as the head of the Democratic Party,
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:29.600]  at least the titular head,
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:33.600]  the face of the party of Kennedy, Truman,
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:35.600]  and Roosevelt is over.
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:37.600]  And who is leading this charge
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:40.600]  to de-Clintonize the Democratic Party?
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:42.600]  Well, my sources tell me
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:46.600]  it's none other than Barack and Michelle Obama.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:49.600]  Remember that the Obamas continue to control
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:53.600]  the machinery of the Democratic Party.
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:55.600]  That's the nominating process
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.600]  for their candidate in 2020.
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:00.600]  Now, the blood was never good
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:03.600]  between the Obamas and the Clintons.
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:05.600]  They needed each other.
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:09.600]  They had a tendency to cover for each other.
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:13.600]  But who can forget Ed Klein's incredible reporting
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:16.600]  in which Hillary Clinton barked at the president
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:18.600]  over the email scandal,
[1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:21.600]  call off your dogs, Obama?
[1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:24.600]  Well, now it seems that the dogs
[1:04:24.600 --> 1:04:26.600]  have been sicked on the Clintons.
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:30.600]  This performance in Arkansas last week,
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  in which they had the 25th anniversary
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.600]  of Bill's election,
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  both looked like octogenarians ready
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.600]  to go to the great beyond,
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:41.600]  was kind of their final act.
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:43.600]  I was about to say, not making fun of old folks,
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:45.600]  the Clintons particularly look like evil cryptkeepers
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  about to be shoveled into their graves.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:49.600]  Hopefully all their evil works
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:51.600]  will be shoveled in there as well
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:53.600]  with old George Soros and his demonic son Alex.

[1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:54.600]  line of organic products.
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:23.600]  That's infowarstore.com.
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:35.600]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:38.600]  you cannot make this up.
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.600]  Two weeks ago,
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:42.600]  they had congressional hearings
[1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:45.600]  where Paul Watson had an article
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:47.600]  about the Islamic truck attack,
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.600]  the ISIS attack in New York.
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:53.600]  And they said during lunch,
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:56.600]  this was YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter executives,
[1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.600]  we found that info was at the top story about the attack
[1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:01.600]  and it was fake news.
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:04.600]  And the fake news was that a major E-mom had warned
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:07.600]  DeBlasio publicly on WABC
[1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.600]  but also on Fox News
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:11.600]  that there were imminent ISIS attacks coming
[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:14.600]  and which mosque were teaching it.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:16.600]  Now, that was all true.
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:18.600]  And the congressman says,
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:19.600]  I want it taken down.
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:22.600]  They said, yes, sir, we already took it down at lunch
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:24.600]  so that people couldn't see it.
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:26.600]  We're the target, not because we're fake news,
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:28.600]  but because we have the best guest on.
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:29.600]  We do the research.
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:31.600]  They just misrepresent what we say in the news sometimes
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:33.600]  to then say we've put out fake news,
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.600]  like Martian slave bases.
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:37.600]  I never said that.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:38.600]  They just say I said it.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:39.600]  But where's the video?
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:40.600]  Where's the article? Where's the text?
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:42.600]  It's fake news.
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:44.600]  Time magazine, all of it's going bankrupt, folks.
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:46.600]  It's all falling apart.
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.600]  So, there's a new article
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:51.600]  that just went up on infowarstore.com
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:54.600]  and we're going to our guests, but all ties together.
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.600]  YouTube says infowars.com is harmful
[1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:00.600]  while ignoring its own pedophile problem.
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:04.600]  If you type in how to have,
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:09.600]  it comes up with how to have sex with your kids.
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:12.600]  In fact, the top searches are that.
[1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:15.600]  But then if you're on YouTube and try to click
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:17.600]  and go to infowars.com,
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:22.600]  it says be careful, may contain malware,
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.600]  phishing attempts, or disturbing content.
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:27.600]  Yeah, disturbing content.
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:30.600]  So, now when people try to go off links
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:31.600]  that we put under our videos,
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:33.600]  and we're partnered with YouTube,
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  they're saying be careful.
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:37.600]  This is total defamation.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:40.600]  And it's just getting worse by the minute.
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  Speaking of worse by the minute,
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:46.600]  Communist China is absolutely allied with the left
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:48.600]  and many globalists in this country.
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  And they are now militarily expanding all over the world.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:54.600]  They've got 97% of rare earth minerals
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:56.600]  that we've just strategically let them have,
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:57.600]  the Panama Canal.
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:08:58.600]  This has all been the globalists
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:00.600]  sold out of the country.
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:03.600]  And joining us, published by Regnery,
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:06.600]  is Stephen W. Mosier,
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:08.600]  Bully of Asia, the new book.
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:09.600]  And of course, he's one of the top journals
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:13.600]  and experts on China, highly recognized out there.
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:18.600]  I'm not gonna go over his whole bio,
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:20.600]  but he's a best-selling author
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:22.600]  and actually recognized authority on China
[1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:23.600]  and population issues,
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  as well as he acclaimed author and speaker.
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.600]  He has tirelessly worked since 1979
[1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  to fight coercive population control program.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.600]  We should get him back on the top, just about that.
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:34.600]  And has helped hundreds of thousands of women
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:35.600]  and families worldwide over the years.
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:38.600]  In 79, Stephen was the first American social scientist
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:40.600]  to visit mainland China.
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:42.600]  He was invited there by the Chinese government
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:44.600]  where he had access to government documents
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  and actually witnessed women being forced
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.600]  to have abortions under the new one-child policy.
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:51.600]  Mr. Mosier was the pro-Church atheist at the time.
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  He's been on before,
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.600]  but witnessing the traumatic abortions led him
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:57.600]  to reconsider his convictions
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  and eventually become a practicing pro-life Roman Catholic.
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:04.600]  And he joins us now, pop.org,
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:07.600]  to get into just China, their stance,
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.600]  what they're doing, what the mindset is
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.600]  of the Communist authoritarian regime
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  that controls a billion, 300 million people.
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:16.600]  So thanks for joining us.
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:17.600]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:18.600]  Where should we start?
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  There's so much to get into.
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:22.600]  I mean, I'm now more and more under Chinese-style
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:23.600]  net censorship.
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:25.600]  They're starting to block us everywhere,
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:27.600]  and it's crazy.
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  Well, it is, Alex,
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:31.600]  and they're blocking you because you're telling the truth,
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:32.600]  and there are a lot of people out there
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  who don't like truth tellers.
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.600]  The global elitists want us to go quietly
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:38.600]  into that good night.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  They want to use Chinese serfs, Chinese slave labor
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:43.600]  to produce cheap goods,
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:46.600]  which they import into this country.
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:48.600]  And of course, millions of American workers
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:50.600]  have been unemployed as a result.
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  But one of the point I want to make,
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  and in fact, the point I make in Bolivia,
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:58.600]  is this is all part of an effort concerted with,
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:02.600]  and in fact, in many ways, led by the People's Republic of China.
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.600]  People need to understand in the United States
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:09.600]  that China declared war on us back in 1991.
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:11.600]  Now, you didn't hear about this,
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  but you're hearing about it now.
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  And what I mean by that is when the Soviet Union collapsed,
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:20.600]  Deng Xiaoping said to his comrades,
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:23.600]  the old Cold War is over, America won,
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:25.600]  but the new Cold War is now beginning
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  between China and America,
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:29.600]  and China, the Middle Kingdom,
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  is going to win this one
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:33.600]  and become the dominant power on the planet.
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:35.600]  And they admitted it's economic, I mean, you're the expert,
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  but they even said to them,
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:38.600]  we're going to flood them with bad drugs,
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  legal drugs, prescription drugs, opiates,
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.600]  stuff 10 times stronger than oxycontin.
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  They brag about what they're doing,
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:47.600]  and they found lots of accomplices in our government.
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  Well, they did.
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.600]  I mean, China's been at war with us ever since.
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  They've been stealing our intellectual properties,
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.600]  stealing our factories and jobs,
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  opposing us internationally,
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  warring against us in cyberspace,
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:01.600]  making these amazing territorial claims
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:03.600]  to the South China Sea.
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  In a saner time, you know, claiming the entire South China Sea
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:08.600]  would be an act of war,
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:10.600]  and we just sort of, we went to the Hague Tribunal
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  and said, tell China to stop.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:14.600]  And the Hague Tribunal said, stop.
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:17.600]  And Xi Jinping, the new red emperor of China,
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  Xi Jinping, the president of China,
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.600]  the head of the military,
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:23.600]  the head of the Chinese Communist Party,
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:26.600]  says the Hague Tribunal's ruling on the South China Sea
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  is nothing more than waste paper, toilet paper.
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  And that's how China regards all international law.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  They are not going to be bound by the current international system.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  They're going to violate it in every way they can
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  to profit themselves.
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.600]  That's what's been happening for the last 20 years.
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:46.600]  And finally, finally at long last,
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:49.600]  I think we have a president who understands this
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:51.600]  and is willing to seriously take on China.
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:53.600]  I think that's good for America,
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:56.600]  and it'll be good for our future
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:59.600]  if we can simply carry out his policies.
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:01.600]  I knew back in the mid-90s,
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:04.600]  FBI reports for 10,000 Chinese front companies
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:06.600]  in the U.S. infiltrating everything.
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  Now reportedly, it's far worse than that.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  They're making a lot of our defense components.
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  Again, they've penetrated and bought off
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  massive numbers of state, local, federal officials.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:17.600]  I mean, from your deep research,
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  how bad is the penetration?
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:24.600]  Well, you know, when I met with Chris Cox back in 1998,
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:27.600]  he was head of the Cox Commission looking into
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  Chinese efforts to destabilize the United States
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:33.600]  back in 1996 with the election
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  by pouring money into the Clinton campaign.
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  So this Russian collusion, I have to smile at,
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:41.600]  because there was real Chinese collusion
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:44.600]  beginning in the 90s and continuing to the present day.
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:48.600]  It was 8,000 front companies in the United States
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  that Congressman Cox put in his report.
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:53.600]  It's tens of thousands more now.
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:55.600]  We have Confucian institutes,
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:59.600]  so-called going into American universities,
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:02.600]  Confucian institutes, which are run by
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  the Ministry of State Security in China,
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:09.600]  where you cannot talk about the three T's.
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  You cannot talk about Taiwan, you can't talk about Tibet,
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:16.600]  you can't talk about Tiananmen massacre back in 1989.
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:20.600]  All you can talk about is, you know, how wonderful
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:23.600]  the People's Republic of China is
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:25.600]  and how everybody should learn Mandarin Chinese
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:27.600]  so they can read the news reports
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  from the new China news agency,
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  which is the propaganda arm
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:33.600]  of the Chinese Communist Party.
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:35.600]  So the penetration is very deep.
[1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:39.600]  It's continuing, and we've got to wise up to it.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:42.600]  We are five or 10 years away from a tipping point
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  after which China will become so strong and powerful
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:49.600]  that there will be no recovering, no recovering.
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:52.600]  And notice we hear from the head of Goldman Sachs,
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  Lloyd Mike, fine, and other globalists,
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  ha-ha, Trump, you'll never get the infrastructure back.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  We're moving everything to China, America's done.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  Our global elites based in the U.S.
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:03.600]  have openly sided with China for decades.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  This is part of their larger plan.
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:06.600]  I know you're an expert on that,
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:08.600]  but I want to talk about when we come back
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  because they're literally cackling like the wicked witch
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:15.600]  of the East saying, too late, my pretty, it's already done.
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:17.600]  Well, we'll see if that's the case.
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:20.600]  Trump at least is trying to get us awake to this
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  to a certain extent.
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:24.600]  That's why it makes me so mad the whole Russia canard,
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:28.600]  not that I'm a rusephobe or a rusephile either way.
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:30.600]  Don't hate Russia, don't love Russia.
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.600]  I just have studied the facts,
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  and it looks like Russia on a Richter scale, what?
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  I mean, maybe one-tenth, well, one-one-hundredth?
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:40.600]  I mean, it seems so small
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:43.600]  compared to the sophisticated Chinese total penetration,
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  plus the elites here that have been open-armed to it.
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  Let's talk about this with the author of the Bully of Asia,
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  Stephen Moser, straight ahead.

[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:26.600]  The Bullie of Asia is the book.
[1:20:26.600 --> 1:20:28.600]  Stephen M. Moser,
[1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:33.600]  expert on China, is our guest right now.
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:39.600]  Stephen, getting into this,
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.600]  when we see Mao Zedong being put in power by leftists
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:45.600]  in the CIA in 49, that's now been declassified.
[1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:48.600]  The John Birch Society wrote about it back in the 50s
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:50.600]  and got made fun of.
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:53.600]  And then now we see Lloyd Blankfaun,
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:55.600]  as I mentioned earlier, tweeting at Trump going,
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:57.600]  I've been to China, their infrastructure's way better.
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  Good luck turning America back on.
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:01.600]  It's one thing to see China wanting to be dominant.
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  It's another thing to then see elites in our own country
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:08.600]  allied with it, selling it out, making sweetheart deals,
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:11.600]  getting rich off of it, moving to China,
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.600]  and then celebrating it.
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:16.600]  It's so painful to see why they hate America so much.
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:19.600]  A, is what I just said, accurate from your research,
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:22.600]  and then B, why do they have that attitude?
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:27.600]  You know, Alex, there's a lot of money to be made in China
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.600]  because China is a country run by a corrupt elite.
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:35.600]  The Chinese Communist Party is the largest party in the world,
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:37.600]  had 90 million members.
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  But when we're talking about the elite,
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:42.600]  we're just talking about the top 10,000 or so.
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.600]  The people who run the provinces,
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:46.600]  the people who run the major factories,
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:51.600]  who get into power and literally make billions of dollars
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:54.600]  in corrupt, under-the-table bribes
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:58.600]  by running this province or by running that state-owned factory.
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:02.600]  It's an amazing fact, but the former Premier of China, Wen Jabao,
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.600]  who came into office with a fairly modest fortune,
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:12.600]  left office with $3 billion in ill-gotten gains.
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:15.600]  So if you go to China, and if you link up with people
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:18.600]  like Xi Jinping and people like Wen Jabao,
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.600]  the leaders of provinces, the leaders at the state level,
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:24.600]  the national level, yeah, you can make a lot of money
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:26.600]  by selling out the United States
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:30.600]  and by helping the Chinese elite oppress their own workers.
[1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:34.600]  There are probably 100,000 demonstrations by workers
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:38.600]  in China each year against factory owners
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.600]  who are in cahoots with the Chinese Communist Party
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.600]  who don't pay them just wages,
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:46.600]  who won't allow them to organize and strike for higher wages.
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:49.600]  When they do start striking, when they do start organizing,
[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:53.600]  the People's Armed Police, so-called, the People's Armed Police,
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:55.600]  which are not on the side of the people,
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:57.600]  but on the side of the party,
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.600]  come in with their AK-47s and break up the demonstration.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:05.600]  So this is a tiny elite in China
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:10.600]  cooperating with our own elite to suppress wages in China,
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:13.600]  to produce cheap goods which are then flooded into the United States
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  and other foreign countries.
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  The goal, of course, of the Chinese Communist Party
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:24.600]  is to industrialize China to move the factories of the world to China
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:27.600]  away from the United States, away from Europe,
[1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.600]  and to use the rest of the world as a source of raw materials
[1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.600]  and a source of consumers.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:35.600]  And I'm afraid to say that that project,
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:38.600]  which began in the 1990s,
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:43.600]  and picked up speed with China's entry into the World Trade Organization
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:47.600]  17 years ago, is very, very far along.
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:50.600]  China produces more than half of the world's steel today.
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:52.600]  They're flooding the market with cheap steel.
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:55.600]  What does that do for American steel workers
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:59.600]  when that subsidized cheap steel comes into the United States?
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:01.600]  Well, it puts them out of work.
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:06.600]  Fortunately, we have a president now who sees the problem
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:11.600]  and who is standing up for ordinary Americans, blue-collar workers.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:12.600]  Sure, well, exactly.
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  Let's talk about the end game here.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:15.600]  If the U.S. is totally sold out,
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:17.600]  they won't even have any bargaining chips.
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:19.600]  Our own elites just want to make money today
[1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.600]  and not even have power long-term that they could leverage out.
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:25.600]  So they really are short-sighted even from a Machiavellian perspective.
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:26.600]  Let me ask you this question.
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  The suicide nets around the Apple factories,
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:32.600]  the forced abortions, the Falongong, Buddhist arrested,
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  the youth, too, of the American left would criticize this.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:36.600]  So would the right.
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:39.600]  Now you see almost no news about this anymore,
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  showing our own establishment would like to implement something like this here.
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.600]  Well, people don't know,
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  but they're going to learn now from your show, Alex,
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  that a new cultural revolution is underway in China.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:57.600]  You remember the old cultural revolution launched by Mao Zedong back in the 60s,
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  which followed on the heels of political purges in the 50s,
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  which cost tens of millions of lives.
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.600]  I mean, Chairman Mao Zedong was the greatest mass murder in history,
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:10.600]  responsible for at least 65 million deaths.
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:14.600]  Well, over the last 30 years, beginning when I was in China,
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:17.600]  first in China back in 79 and 80,
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:20.600]  the Chinese Communist Party has eliminated,
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:24.600]  has killed 400 million of its own unborn citizens.
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:27.600]  That's the result of the one-child policy.
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  And any country, any leadership that's willing to kill
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:35.600]  400 million of its own unborn citizens is obviously
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:38.600]  will stop at nothing to achieve its goals.
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  And its goal really is the China Dream.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  When you hear President Xi Jinping,
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  who's also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping,
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  who's also the Chairman of the Military Commission, General Xi Jinping,
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:55.600]  say that he dreams a China dream.
[1:25:55.600 --> 1:25:58.600]  That China dream, as I write in the Bowie of Asia,
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:01.600]  is the world's nightmare.
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:04.600]  China dreams of overturning the current world order
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:07.600]  and replacing it with one dominated by China.
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:11.600]  I was about to say, what does their in-game look like
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.600]  when you talk about us being five to ten years of this being irreversible,
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:18.600]  because whether it's genetic engineering or chemical dumping
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:22.600]  or dirty coal, I mean, they just do not care.
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  It is just absolute balls to the walls,
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.600]  pell-mell this dream, no rules, no nothing, no regulations,
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  while we have regulations heaped on us by our very own elites
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:35.600]  that are investing in China.
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  Well, here we have to go back to the very founding of China,
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:43.600]  back in, way back in, in 220 BC,
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:48.600]  when the brutal Qin Zhihong, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty,
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.600]  killing millions of people in the process,
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:54.600]  unified China under a single emperor.
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:57.600]  And China, of course, was known as the middle kingdom,
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:26:59.600]  the kingdom in the middle.
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.600]  And it had, it felt a natural right, a manifest destiny
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.600]  to control all of its smaller neighbors.
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.600]  Well, that manifest destiny that China feels,
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:11.600]  that's embodied in the China dream,
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.600]  is now something that China wants to extend to the entire world.
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:18.600]  China dreams of being the world's dominant power,
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.600]  replacing the United States.
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  And of course, a world dominated by China would be less free,
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:25.600]  less democratic, it would be less safe,
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:28.600]  not only for Americans, but for the Chinese people themselves.
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:31.600]  I mean, look, Christians in China are being told
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:33.600]  they cannot bring their children to church.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:36.600]  This is new, this just came out a couple of weeks ago,
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.600]  because children under the age of 16,
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.600]  it's illegal to bring your own children to Catholic mass
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  or to Christian religious services.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:47.600]  Home church leaders are being arrested.
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:50.600]  The crosses are being ripped off the top of churches.
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:56.600]  Catholics have been told to stop any contact with...
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:59.600]  And is that because now our media won't criticize China?
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:02.600]  They feel like there's a green light to be even more repressive?
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.600]  Well, I think part of it is the fact that our own media
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:08.600]  wants advertisements placed by Chinese companies,
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:11.600]  and of course, they're making money off the China trade.
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:16.600]  The other thing is that they think that the United States,
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.600]  that China, in many respects, our own elite, which I believe
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:24.600]  that leftists in general have a kind of self-loathing
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:27.600]  that they project onto society as a whole.
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:29.600]  They don't respect the United States.
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:33.600]  They think that China is, in some ways, a more just society
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:36.600]  because they believe Chinese propaganda
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:39.600]  that we provide housing and food for.
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  Absolutely, and they get off on Buddhist being taken
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:44.600]  and having their organs stolen.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:46.600]  I want to talk about, briefly, the only other side
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:48.600]  that will let you go, how to stop them, though,
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:50.600]  what you think the weak points are
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:52.600]  in the Communist Chinese system.
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:29:21.600]  Let's go ahead, bully of Asia's The Book.
[1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:25.600]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.

[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:39.600]  and this part is most important.

[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:02.600]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:15.600]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:17.600]  and I'm telling you what,
[1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:19.600]  you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.600]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:42.600]  Well, we've got a bunch of multinational corporations
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:44.600]  that have a vision of world government
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:46.600]  that's now out in the open.
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:48.600]  They've been programming the average American
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:50.600]  to hate our heritage, to hate Christianity,
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:52.600]  to hate free market,
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:54.600]  and then to lionize communist countries.
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:57.600]  People tell me, oh, we want to be like Cuba.
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  They have free healthcare.
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:01.600]  Yeah, but no MRI machines.
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  I mean, Venezuela doesn't even have medicine
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:06.600]  for malaria right now.
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  They long since ate their dogs and cats.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  There's this total bizarre,
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:14.600]  romantic, romanticism
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:16.600]  associated with communism
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  that breeds on the universities.
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.600]  And I understand rich elites
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:22.600]  want to sabotage the next generation
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  so there's no competition from that generation.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:26.600]  That's clearly what this action is.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:28.600]  Kind of like a grizzly bear.
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  I'll find a female grizzly bear that just had a bear cub
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  and will kill it.
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:35.600]  It's just pure, aggressive, dominant behavior.
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:37.600]  Extremely authoritarian.
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:39.600]  It creates nightmare societies.
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:41.600]  It creates survival of the fittest.
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.600]  It creates survival of the most demonic
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:45.600]  and evil and controlling.
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  And so joining us is Stephen M. Moser,
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.600]  one of the top experts on China,
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:52.600]  new best-selling book out,
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:54.600]  Bully of Asia.
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.600]  They say they're taking over.
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:58.600]  They've done a pretty good job of it.
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:01.600]  Russia and other countries try to pull out of globalism.
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:03.600]  China's dictator,
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:05.600]  calling president,
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  put in charge by the Central Committee
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:09.600]  in the Politburo.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:11.600]  He came out when Trump that elected
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.600]  about 11, 12 months ago and he said,
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  I'm going to prop up the new world order.
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  I'm going to keep the euro in place.
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:19.600]  I'll help you defeat Trump.
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  If people remember.
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:23.600]  They were like, yay, our new leader is the
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  communist Chinese president.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  Because he'll play along with all this.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.600]  So we've gone from criticizing Tiananmen Square
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.600]  a few decades ago to,
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:33.600]  our media will not even discuss it today.
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  And it just goes
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:37.600]  on and on and on.
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.600]  That we're becoming like China.
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:41.600]  They're not becoming like us.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  Trump just wants to put the brakes on it a little.
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  And the howling and screaming,
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:47.600]  even though the economy comes back,
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:49.600]  only gets more deafening.
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:51.600]  So what is their end game?
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  How do we stop it and other key points?
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  Well,
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:57.600]  their end game is obviously world domination.
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.600]  That's what the people may have heard
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:01.600]  about the New Silk Road.
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:03.600]  China spending trillions of dollars
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:05.600]  to create a series of railroads
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:07.600]  and ports
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:09.600]  opening sea routes and land routes
[1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:11.600]  to Europe.
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:13.600]  The New Silk Road is all about restructuring
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.600]  the world economic order
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  around China.
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:19.600]  Drawing Europe, drawing India, drawing
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  the Middle East away from connections
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  with the United States
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:25.600]  and forging connections with China.
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  So that's obviously an effort to dominate
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.600]  what Harold
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:31.600]  McKinder called the world island.
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  You know, back 100 years ago,
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:35.600]  this great strategist said
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:37.600]  he who dominates the world island
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:39.600]  will dominate the world.
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  Well, we don't have ambitions in the United States
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:43.600]  to dominate the world.
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:45.600]  We've been a benevolent world leader.
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  We have not claimed territory
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:49.600]  when we've gone in to try to promote democracy.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.600]  China wants territory.
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  It wants power. It wants clout.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:55.600]  It wants domination.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  And its New Silk Road is an effort
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.600]  to dominate your Asia.
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  If China winds up dominating
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:03.600]  everything from
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  Manchuria in the East, Siberia in the East
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  all the way to
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.600]  Europe and Russia in the West,
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  it's game over. Basically, they will control
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  so much of the world's population,
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  4 billion people,
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  and so much of the world's land mass
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  that the United States will necessarily be
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:21.600]  a second ranked power.
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  Exactly, and they admit all this. How did they
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:25.600]  get
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:27.600]  97% control of rare earth minerals?
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:29.600]  How did they strategically let that happen?
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:31.600]  Plus, that's not normal.
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:33.600]  Other companies or countries should have
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.600]  a bigger percent than 3% total.
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  I mean, wow, how did that disaster
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.600]  happen? Again, for those who don't know,
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  you need rare earth minerals for all the electronics
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  that run civilization.
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:45.600]  How did they get such a corner
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  on the global market of that key
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  area?
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:51.600]  Well, Alex, you know, rare earths are not
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:53.600]  all that rare. They're found in the United States.
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:55.600]  We had
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  rare earth mines
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.600]  years ago where they were shut down
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  by an overactive environmental protection
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  agency.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.600]  China, of course, doesn't mind
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:07.600]  violating environmental rules.
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  In fact, the main job
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:11.600]  of the Chinese Environmental Protection
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:13.600]  Agency agents is to go out to mines and factories
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  to take a bribe and then go
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:17.600]  home and write a nice report
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.600]  saying there's no problem with pollution.
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:21.600]  Anyone who's been in China knows that
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  pollution is terrible.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:25.600]  These lung cancer, throat cancer rates are the
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  world's highest.
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  And there's no effort really to rein in this kind
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:31.600]  of pollution.
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  But who cares?
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.600]  Chinese elites certainly don't care if Chinese
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  workers' lives are sacrificed
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  as long as their power, as long as their
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:41.600]  wealth continues to go up.
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.600]  You know, we hear a lot about
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  North Korea.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  What people need to understand is that North Korea
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  is China.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.600]  North Korea is a tributary state
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  of China.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.600]  It is armed and defended by Beijing
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  under a mutual security treaty.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  So here you have the irony of China
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:01.600]  saying, oh, we don't like Kim Jong-un.
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:03.600]  We want to do something about his nuclear program.
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.600]  We believe in denuclearization
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:07.600]  at the same time that they're providing
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.600]  components for his missiles
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:11.600]  that they're providing technology
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:13.600]  for his nuclear research program.
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  And at the same time, they are
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  protecting North Korea
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:19.600]  by a mutual security treaty.
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:21.600]  I mean, anyone who
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:23.600]  fell for that, as of course
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  the Clintons did back in the 90s,
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  and everyone, in fact, up to President
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  Trump fell for that little charade,
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  doesn't understand
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  the point of China's
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:35.600]  relationship with North Korea.
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:37.600]  Chinese party supreme,
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:39.600]  Xi Jinping, doesn't want to help solve
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  the North Korean problem.
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:43.600]  He helped to create the problem, he sustains
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  the problem, and he's using it for his own
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  purposes, which is to say
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:49.600]  the United States and the world
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  from the real threat, which is
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.600]  China itself.
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:55.600]  And again,
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  the worst human rights abuses, the
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600]  suicide nets, the forced abortions,
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.600]  the killing of the Buddhists and Christians,
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:03.600]  and leftist media trying to cover that up
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:05.600]  for decades, it's all now admitted,
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.600]  I think it's beyond just
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  a romanticism for communism.
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.600]  I just think the average leftist
[1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:13.600]  really likes authoritarianism
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:15.600]  and really wants to appease China
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:17.600]  on the payroll.
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  Well, I
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.600]  have to agree with you, because
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:23.600]  if the leftists in the United States
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  have no respect for
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  the freest, most
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  democratic country
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  that has ever existed in the world,
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.600]  which is the United States of America,
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.600]  then they have to embrace something.
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  You know, they can't
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:39.600]  let their minds remain completely empty,
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  and so they embrace this distant mirage
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:43.600]  of socialism, the
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  idea that you can create heaven on earth,
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.600]  and not knowing very much about
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.600]  China, and not wanting to disturb their
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  unillusions, they romanticize
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  the country. They romanticize
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:55.600]  strong leaders who are going
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  to solve, because supposedly, problems
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.600]  overnight. And they fantasize
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  because they love that socialist
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:03.600]  authoritarianism that they'll be part of
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.600]  the ruling elite, just briefly as we're going to
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  break, and I appreciate your time, bully of
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:09.600]  Asia, Stephen Moser, always a great
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  guess, that on before, one
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:13.600]  of the top experts out there, talk about just
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  briefly your awakening as an atheist.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  You know, it's kind of, I guess, a liberal, whatever.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.600]  You're over there. You actually see it for yourself
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  that transformation.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  Well, years ago
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  I was at the University of
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  California, Berkeley, one of
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.600]  the high temples of secular humanism,
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:31.600]  teaching Chinese anthropology.
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:33.600]  I was finishing up a Ph.D.
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:35.600]  at Stanford University. I was selected to go
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:37.600]  to China and study
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.600]  the People's Republic of China.
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:41.600]  I found myself in the midst of those
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:43.600]  horrific population control
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  program the world has ever seen,
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:47.600]  the one-child policy, which
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:49.600]  involved the forced abortion of women
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  seven, eight, and nine months pregnant.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:53.600]  There were four sterilization
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  following, so they wouldn't disturb the population
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.600]  control program in years to come.
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  And I really did have
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  in the operating room, witnessing
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:03.600]  the forced abortion of women
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:05.600]  who were very close to giving birth.
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  I came to understand, first of all, the
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  national sanctity of human life. These were little
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  tiny human beings, little
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  sons of Adam, daughters of Eve, who were
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:15.600]  being sacrificed to the population
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.600]  control program. And I came
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:19.600]  to believe that
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  if hell could exist,
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:23.600]  and as it were,
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  the pit of hell opened up before me as I
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:27.600]  was witnessing forced abortions, and there
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  must be a compensating good, there must be
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:31.600]  a compensating heaven, there must be a god.
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  In a kind of strange way,
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  I found God in China because
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:37.600]  of the absolute absence
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:39.600]  of God and godliness
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  beautifully said, because when you're
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:43.600]  surrounded by good and justice, you don't appreciate it
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  once you're put into hell for one moment, you
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  awaken. Bully of Asia,
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  thank you so much, sir, for your time. God bless you.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:51.600]  We'll be back.
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:57.600]  According to House Minority
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  leader Nancy Pelosi, due process
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  is only necessary when you're a Democrat.
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:03.600]  When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:05.600]  whether or not embattled rep
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  John Conyers should be
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:09.600]  in or out of Congress as he faces
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:11.600]  down sexual harassment allegations,
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.600]  Nancy Pelosi replied,
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  we are strengthened by due process
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  just because someone is accused,
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:19.600]  and wait, was it one accusation? Is it
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  two? Well, Nancy,
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  to answer that question, it was revealed last week
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:25.600]  the taxpayers voted the bill for a $27,000
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.600]  settlement
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  for a staffer of Conyers that claimed
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:31.600]  the 88-year-old congressman
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:33.600]  made sexual advances on her
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  and then fired her after she wouldn't
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:37.600]  succumb to them. And a lawyer who worked
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  for Conyers said she'd often encounter
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:41.600]  the congressman in his office walking
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  around in his underwear. Conyers,
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  who's the longest serving congressman, has
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  denied all sexual harassment allegations
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:49.600]  against him. Nancy Pelosi says
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.600]  we need to give him a pass because Conyers
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:53.600]  is an icon. Leigh-Anne McAdoo
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  infowars.com
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  I'm driving home here
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:01.600]  about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:03.600]  and I just
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  want to impart my message to the listeners
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:07.600]  and viewers of how much I appreciate you
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:09.600]  and how thankful I am.
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  And I also just want to
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:13.600]  re-emphasize the point that if you weren't
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:15.600]  there taking action, and if you weren't
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  there spreading the word,
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:19.600]  globalism would have completely taken over
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  not just this country but other nations.
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual,
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:25.600]  anti-God, anti-family,
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  anti-Christian
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  cancer that is just
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:31.600]  pure
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:33.600]  power cult will to dominate
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:35.600]  and control society.
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.600]  And that we have come so far
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  with God's help and have turned the tide
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:41.600]  with the enemies tracking back. So just
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:43.600]  please, we should all be so thankful to God
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:45.600]  and thankful to each other for taking
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:47.600]  action, but also
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:49.600]  girt ourselves and get ready for the next big
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:51.600]  fight ahead because history is
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:53.600]  happening. So for myself and my family
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:57.600]  God bless you all. Have a great Thanksgiving.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  I point out a lot to our listeners
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  and viewers that without you
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:03.600]  funding our operation by purchasing
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  products in FullWarsTour.com
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  we would not be here.
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.600]  We don't have corporate sponsors. We don't have
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:11.600]  globalist funding. We're funded by
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:13.600]  patriots like you and we also
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  of course provide high quality products to
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  make it easy to support yourself
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  and to support us. Symbiotically
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:21.600]  as we try to retake this country
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:23.600]  and the planet and heal
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  the population that's put under globalist
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:27.600]  engineering. That said
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:29.600]  we're running biggest specials
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:31.600]  every single year
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:33.600]  during Black Friday and this year is even
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:35.600]  better than last year. We've got

[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:29.600]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:31.600]  Modern liberalism
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:33.600]  is a counterfeit of Thomas
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:35.600]  Geverson's classical liberalism.
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:37.600]  They are the anti-liberal
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:39.600]  to defend free speech, meet like-minded
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.600]  friends and promote freedom world-wide.

[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  at infowarstore.com
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:59.600]  You're listening to the
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  You know, I'm not really good at
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:33.600]  whining.
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  I'm not really good at
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.600]  saying no for me
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:39.600]  because I've asked for everything that's happening.
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:41.600]  But I do need
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  the listeners and viewers to understand
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  something. We're in a fight
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:47.600]  and
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:49.600]  the attacks taking place
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:51.600]  against info wars
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  and against news wars.
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:55.600]  Some of which I can talk about
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:57.600]  publicly, some of which I can't talk about yet
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:47:59.600]  soon, aren't
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  recognized by you as an attack
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  on all of our freedoms.
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  We will lose.
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  Now, we've come from behind.
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:09.600]  People now know there's a private corporate world government.
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  They now know our elite sold us out to
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.600]  Communist China and sold out their people to
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:15.600]  total slavery to be the engine
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:17.600]  to build world government.
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:21.600]  We now know about
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  the globalist pedophile networks
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  and how they control populations.
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:27.600]  They're eugenics based one world government
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  plan.
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  We know about their plan to make us all
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  renters living in 200 square foot coffin
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  apartments where families have basically been
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  made illegal.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:39.600]  We know the enemy's plan.
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:41.600]  We know it's diabolical. We know it's anti
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:43.600]  human. We know it's authoritarian.
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:45.600]  We know it's nasty. We should be able to stop
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.600]  it.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:49.600]  But that said,
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:51.600]  Google
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:53.600]  and its sub companies, Facebook, Twitter,
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  they're all
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.600]  ratcheting us down
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:48:59.600]  and banning Milo and Roger Stone
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.600]  and new people every day.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:03.600]  They're banning popular leftist
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:05.600]  that have their own platforms
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:07.600]  because they don't want anybody but the controlled
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.600]  central systems.
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:11.600]  All the major newspapers are going bankrupt.
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:13.600]  They're all getting propped up.
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.600]  Time magazine's bankrupt. It just got bought
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:17.600]  out.
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  It's all collapsing
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:21.600]  and its response is to go ahead and launch
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  it.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  So if we just sit here and confidently take it
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:27.600]  like, well, that's no big deal.
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:29.600]  Being banned on Google AdSense.
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  Being banned on
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  AdRole.
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  Being constantly curtailed. Being blocked
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:37.600]  from putting our films on iTunes.
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:39.600]  All of it.
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:41.600]  We put up with that discrimination.
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  We're going to go from being in these digital
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:45.600]  ghettos as Matt Drudge has warned
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  to physical ghettos.
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:49.600]  It should make us total cost
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  being shut down in full wars.
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  The heads of YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:55.600]  go, yes sir, we shut them down at lunch.
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  I mean, we have the video.
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.600]  It's on screen right now.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:01.600]  And now this article
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:03.600]  by Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:05.600]  I don't want to make the news about us.
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  I got stacks of incredibly important stuff here.
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:11.600]  But if you go to YouTube
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  and you type in how to have
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  how to have a great trip,
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:19.600]  how to have a great vacation.
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:21.600]  No, you get how to have sex,
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:23.600]  get auto loads,
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:25.600]  how to have sex with your kids.
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:27.600]  And YouTube and Google, its parent company
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:29.600]  just lost millions in advertising last week
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  as companies found their advertising was being
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:33.600]  placed on pedophile videos
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  promoting child sex
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  with adults.
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.600]  This is just their coming out to
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:41.600]  condition is where we don't care anymore.
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:43.600]  Got the deputy pope
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:45.600]  arrested for it. You got all these major
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  arrests happening daily.
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:49.600]  And you've got all these publications coming out
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:51.600]  saying Trump isn't going after pedophiles.
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:53.600]  There's no pedophiles.
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:55.600]  Alex Jones made it up. It doesn't exist.
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:50:59.600]  Pizza gates, fake news.
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  Pizza is codeword.
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:03.600]  She's pizza for child porn online, the FBI reports.
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:05.600]  The media focused on a pizza place
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:07.600]  to then try to make it look like
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:09.600]  no pedophilia exists in the world
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:11.600]  by putting out that fake story that everybody
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:13.600]  then ended up reporting on
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:15.600]  nor the spirit cooking and the devil worship
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:17.600]  and the pedophilia arrests and all the rest
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:19.600]  of it. They distracted off with
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:21.600]  that decoy.
[1:51:21.600 --> 1:51:23.600]  But here it is.
[1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:25.600]  And we're going to break tomorrow.
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:27.600]  Disney
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:29.600]  involved in sexualization of children
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:31.600]  shocking.
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:33.600]  Disney
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:35.600]  though hires people that are convicted child
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:37.600]  rapists to run movies with children
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:39.600]  on the set. I mean, this is who they are.
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:41.600]  They're about selfishness
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:43.600]  and there's nothing more selfish.
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:45.600]  I feel guilty when I eat veal
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:47.600]  because it's baby cow.
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:49.600]  Imagine, again, these people
[1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:51.600]  are all about having no guilt.
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:53.600]  So the story is on infowars.com, newswars.com
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:55.600]  our final outpost.
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:57.600]  YouTube says infowars.com is harmful
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:51:59.600]  while ignoring
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:01.600]  its own pedophile problem.
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:03.600]  So you know this is the next step for us being banned
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:05.600]  on made up pretenses.
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:07.600]  So we have our own platform here
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:09.600]  for now, infowars.com
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:11.600]  we have our own app.
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:13.600]  There's no need to go there.
[1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:15.600]  Any time you go, people stop on the street
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:17.600]  they go, I don't see you streaming on
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:19.600]  Facebook anymore.
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:21.600]  That's because they block us from sharing
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:23.600]  the link. You have to go right to
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:25.600]  Alex Jones on Facebook to see the feed.
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:27.600]  You got to go to infowars.com
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:29.600]  to the Alex Jones channel.
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:31.600]  They're not letting you share it.
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:33.600]  You have to click notifications.
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:35.600]  You have to come to your inbox
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:37.600]  or they'll block it.
[1:52:37.600 --> 1:52:44.440]  they can see it. But when they can, they just go, oh, where's Alex Jones? Get the sign up
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:49.400]  for our free newsletter, infowars.com forward slash newsletter. So you get the videos and
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.820]  the articles they don't want you to see delivered to your inbox. I've been saying we've got
[1:52:53.820 --> 1:52:57.480]  to go back to email. We've got to get big and email. Everybody's got to follow us on
[1:52:57.480 --> 1:53:03.280]  email. You got to sign up to get our alerts because it's happening. Having ignored its
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:08.440]  own pedophile problem where wannabe child molesters abuse the platform to stalk children
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:14.080]  for months, potential years. YouTube is now declaring links to infowars.com, harmful and
[1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:19.880]  disturbing. Oh, the irony. A user who attempted to link through to info wars from a YouTube
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:24.920]  video on their phone sent us the following screenshot. I've seen it too. Be careful.
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:29.840]  The site may be harmful states the warning. The site you're trying to visit infowars.com
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:36.480]  may have malware, phishing attempts or disturbing content. I think it's pretty disturbing when
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:42.240]  you type in how to, how to fix your car, how to, whatever you get, how to, how to rape
[1:53:42.240 --> 1:53:48.960]  children. No, YouTube's harmful. Amazon's harmful. Apple's harmful. They're the globals. They're
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:52.600]  the ones in bed with China. They're the ones that openly want to run our lives and say
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:58.840]  we're obsolete and you took over all the major platforms. This website that offers a back
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:04.720]  to safety option. Oh, back to safety. Don't leave. Stay here with us on YouTube. This
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:11.040]  is so our William option to prevent the user from accessing info wars. And it goes on with
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:18.320]  a daily mail reporting on it. I can't even deal with this anymore. I mean, do you understand
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:24.280]  they are trying to stuff us out? And if they could stuff us out, they can stuff you out.
[1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:27.880]  We are the champion. I didn't ask to be the champion. I'm not complaining about it. I'm
[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:32.360]  quite honored. I don't feel up to it, quite frankly. Now, before I go to break and come
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:36.480]  back the next hour and I will take your phone calls the entire hour and cover other big,
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:47.960]  important breaking news, quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:53.640]  to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:55:00.560]  the formula. And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers.
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:06.200]  And I said, what are even better mineral, vitamin, amino acid mixtures with beetroot
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:10.880]  concentrate for the heart? It's the red pill. There's no artificial additives here with
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:17.480]  preglonone, which is the Olympic team lets you take it. It doesn't consider it a steroid,
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:22.320]  but it is the precursor to all hormones in the body. Your body has to have it to be able
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:28.760]  to make hormones. Your body produces it on its own, but with all the chemicals and things
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:34.160]  in the environment and all the estrogen mimickers, it ends up getting basically blocked and then
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:40.840]  levels of it go down more than 60% on average. By the time you reach 20 years of age, starts
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:46.160]  dropping precipitously up to 60 plus percent by the time you're 70. You can read all the

[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:13.040]  personally and others. So it is a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, multi with the preglonone
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:26.200]  and with the beetroot. And you add all that together. It is amazing. m4warsstore.com, m4warslife.com

[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:55.560]  culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:02.080]  giant time bomb with populations and globalism and the neural orders manipulation of people's
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:07.760]  minds. Things are getting crazy. We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've
[1:58:07.760 --> 1:58:12.160]  also got to have rear guard actions to be prepared. The number one thing after getting
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:16.520]  right with God is to have high quality, storeable food. Well, the entire line of my patriots

[1:58:40.160 --> 1:58:48.600]  fresh last 25 years, 50% off 50% off. Take action today with few remaining days left
[1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:53.800]  on the legislative calendar. Congress sure has a lot on the agenda, including reauthorization
[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:59.400]  of mass surveillance. The current authorization for the controversial section 702 expires
[1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:04.960]  December 31. And it's the first time Congress has faced reauthorization since Edward Snowden
[1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:10.480]  revealed the NSA's mass surveillance apparatus. Civil Libertarians have urged Congress to
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:16.000]  take this reauthorization as an opportunity to implement meaningful reforms to shield
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:20.040]  innocent Americans from mass surveillance. But with the clock running out, Congress appears
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:24.920]  poised to just jam through reauthorization. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has just took
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:30.240]  up a blockbuster case. The privacy of emails, photos stored in the cloud, even heart rate
[1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:35.660]  history from a smartwatch could be at stake. The case, Carpenter vs. US, will determine
[1:59:35.660 --> 1:59:40.880]  whether the history of cell phone locations stored by a phone service provider is searchable
[1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:45.520]  without a warrant. It's a legal theory known as the third party doctrine. Leon McAdoo,
[1:59:45.520 --> 1:59:56.600]  infowars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:34.380 --> 2:00:27.880]  called Pregnan alone. And I learned about it five years ago, getting a check
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:33.280]  up at the doctor and I noticed they were selling it. And then I learned though that
[2:00:33.280 --> 2:00:37.520]  if you take it with multivitamins and the right amino acids and the right minerals
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:45.000]  in a compound together and soup it up with beetroot concentrate, that the leading science
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:52.320]  showed that all of that together gave your body the complete building blocks to produce
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:57.780]  not just key hormones, but other compounds that come out of your glands. And it's so
[2:00:57.780 --> 2:01:03.600]  game changing. I've been taking the red pill the last few months and the amount of energy
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:08.600]  it gives me, the amount of stamina, the amount of focus you can even make claims about what
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:13.200]  it does for your cardiovascular system, what it does for your brain. But there's no classic
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:20.760]  stimulants in the real red pill. It's just all the building blocks your body needs so
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:26.440]  that you can naturally produce the hormones and other enzymes and things that make our
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:35.960]  lives possible. So the real red pill, vitamin, minerals and Pregnan alone, as well as beetroot
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:41.520]  is so powerful, supports optimal brain function, supports hormonal balance, supports healthy
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:49.000]  aging. By age 20, our body stops producing as much Pregnan alone, which again is a neuro
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:53.520]  steroid precursor. That's why the Olympic team lets you take it. So all the sporting
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:58.560]  teams and other organizations let you take it because it's in a steroid class, but it's
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:04.200]  naturally occurring and it is a precursor. So it's reportedly you can do your own research
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:10.440]  totally and completely safe. It's the building block that your body has to have to then make
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:14.120]  all the other hormones. But then they've got to have the vitamins, they've got to have
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:20.120]  the minerals, they've got to have the amino acids, and then it's all right there together
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:25.760]  in the real red pill. You know, this had another name six months ago, we were having the first
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:31.280]  samples come in that I began to take. And I noticed that the pills, let me open a bottle
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:40.520]  of this to show you that the pills were, depending on the batch, pink or red, this particular batch
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:44.440]  of the beetroot, it's not that dark, which is barely pink. And I thought a pink pill,
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:55.320]  I go, ooh, matrix red pill, call it the real red pill. And it's amazing. Now again, we
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:59.920]  have a product that is our best seller that this doesn't compete with brain force that
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:05.520]  has the green tea extract, a little bit of it and has some of the uramate in it and gives
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:11.280]  you good, clean, strong, pick me up. But that's not even the main reason. It's got the alfionine,
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:20.240]  it's got a whole bunch of other alpha GPC and other things in it, black pepper, fruit extract
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:25.140]  and a bunch of other things that are known to give you good clean energy. But this does
[2:03:25.140 --> 2:03:31.640]  have some healthy stimulants in it. The real red pill doesn't. It just has all the building
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:35.720]  blocks for you to have the hormones and the other things that your body needs. That's
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:41.800]  why I'm so excited about brain force plus, which is still 50% off. That special is about
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:47.440]  to end because the supplies are about to sell out. And the red pill, the real red pill out
[2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:57.560]  of the gates, ladies and gentlemen is 50% off. It's a powerful multivitamin. It is a
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:04.480]  powerful mineral spectrum vitamin. But what it's really powerful for is that it has the
[2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:10.560]  pregnant alone in it and the beetroot and more and all of it together, dramatic responses
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:14.600]  what I personally experienced. And that's why out of the gates, I'm offering 50% off
[2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:19.520]  on this. The reason we're doing that is I want you to try it and see how amazing it
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:24.600]  is and give us your reviews before it goes back to the regular price. And it's got a
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:30.200]  lot of ingredients in it. It costs a lot to produce this. Again, it's got a two month
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:35.680]  supply in it, ladies and gentlemen, 120 capsules and a nice glass bottle, super high quality
[2:04:35.680 --> 2:04:40.480]  in your purchase helps from the operation. But I'm really impressed with the real red
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:44.080]  pill. So I hope you'll get your bottle today and tell us what you think there as well.
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.240]  Okay, when we come back, more Democrats are calling for Republicans to be arrested in
[2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:51.960]  mass. I'm not kidding. And then we're going to take your phone calls as well. I'm Alex
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:05:03.000]  Jones, please stay with us. I'm driving home here about to take off few days with Thanksgiving.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:06.640]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers how much I appreciate
[2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:12.880]  you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to reemphasize the point that if you
[2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:17.760]  weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.840]  have completely taken over not just this country, but other nations. And globalism is a completely
[2:05:22.840 --> 2:05:32.120]  anti individual, anti God, anti family, anti Christian cancer that is just pure power cult
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:38.640]  will to dominate and control society. And then we have come so far with God's help and
[2:05:38.640 --> 2:05:43.080]  have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back. So just please we should all be so thankful
[2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:48.520]  to God and thankful to each other for taking action. Also, Gert ourselves and get ready
[2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:53.720]  for the next big fight ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family,
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:06:08.960]  I bless you all have a great Thanksgiving. You want answers? Well, so does the live from
[2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:19.080]  the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. 877789 Alex first time callers today 877789
[2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:26.720]  Alex 877789 2539. And we'll be taking your call starting the next segment. And by the
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:30.600]  way, we're going to have open phones throughout the war room with Owen shroyer coming up.
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:35.640]  And then right through the evening with a bunch of Millie Weaver and Rob do and Michael
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:41.720]  Zimmerman and Paul Watson. And just so many other people are going to host right through
[2:06:41.720 --> 2:06:46.360]  nighttime right through the middle of the night, right through into tomorrow and through
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:51.240]  the broadcast, a 34 hour live broadcast. We did one about a month ago and the mainstream
[2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:55.400]  media got really, really upset about it about three weeks ago. And I saw that I thought,
[2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:59.120]  well, let's just do some more of these because we've gone from, you know, just having my
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:03.120]  show four hours a day live to 10 hours a day live and we're going to relaunch the nightly
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:06.920]  news and other things in the near future. We're just hiring crew and trying to expand
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:09.920]  because you either expand or you contract and the globalists are trying to shut us
[2:07:09.920 --> 2:07:14.920]  down. So we're just going to try to expand and get even more hardcore and break more
[2:07:14.920 --> 2:07:19.680]  big news and just tell the truth about freedom in the face of all the things they're doing.
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:31.120]  But that said, I've got several clips here that I want to play. The first clip is MSNBC
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:40.760]  and the MSNBC show has a guest on. There's a Democratic Party pollster actually lost my
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:45.120]  video list. I'm sure I'll find it again here in a minute. It's like an explosion of papers.
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:48.200]  People ask me why I have all these papers printed. It's because especially in the old
[2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:55.200]  days of the internet, stories would disappear or it was hard to load things. You sit there
[2:07:55.200 --> 2:07:58.960]  on talk radio with a computer up with five or six stories and you try to go back to the
[2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:04.880]  story and it'd take five minutes to load. So always print everything. But then sometimes
[2:08:04.880 --> 2:08:12.720]  there's so much printed and so much breaking and so much going on that it's hard to keep
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:17.840]  track of. So it definitely has its downside. But there it is. It's a story on info wars.com
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:25.440]  from Alex Thomas. MSNBC guest Republicans or domestic terrorist also accuses GOP of
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:33.680]  being pro-Putin and pro-pedophile. Well, remember the Democratic Party is the sexual
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:39.480]  deviance, is the pro-sexualization of children, I mean is the pervert party. During a segment
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:46.240]  on Saturday's broadcast of MSNBC's AM Joy, the liberal network, a lot of Democratic pollster
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:51.160]  to call for his political enemies to be arrested and put in prison for failing to adhere to
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:58.640]  a variety of left-wing viewpoints. Hoster is Fernand Amadi, as they pronounce it, made
[2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:02.680]  the comments during a discussion. And the reason that's important is we've got more
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:07.040]  of them saying that. So you've got them saying arrest our opposition, get rid of the free
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:13.680]  speech, ban Alex Jones off the internet, ban Matt Grudge. But then simultaneously we're
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:17.080]  going to have an uprising November 4th, we're going to kill everybody and kill Trump. And
[2:09:17.080 --> 2:09:21.160]  then they go, oh, you're crazy, we're not calling for that. We have full-page ads calling
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:27.560]  for driving people from office and overthrowing Trump and you've got communists marching everywhere
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:31.400]  saying we're going to kill everybody and you've got Black Lives Matter groups being funded
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.960]  by big telecoms and big internet companies calling for cops to be killed. It's going
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:42.280]  on all around us. And then they play this game where Jones claims Democrats want to overthrow
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:48.600]  Trump. Jones claims Democrats are calling for violence and they just do this over and
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:53.920]  over and over again because, again, they want to energize their people, get them mobilized
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:57.400]  while telling you nothing's happening, go back to sleep, you go back to sleep. But it's
[2:09:57.400 --> 2:10:03.480]  a classic military tactic. And these people mean business, but the most positive news
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:14.040]  I've seen yet is that you've seen the FBI release all these emails from back during
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:20.600]  the Obama years when Mueller killed the FBI investigation into Hillary and uranium one.
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:25.400]  And the word is, Washington is a buzz, according to the congressman and other sources that
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:34.160]  Jones talked to that the new FBI director is preparing to go after Mueller, Comey, Hillary,
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.960]  all of them. None of them are invincible. The Democrats are beginning to turn against
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:42.440]  them, you know, as hedging their bets because, man, Mueller and the Clintons are on the Russian
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:48.720]  payroll. And the Chinese payroll, you name it, and they are just no wonder they're trying
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:53.360]  to say everybody else is a Russian. I mean, imagine me and me and watching congressional
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:58.920]  hearings, there's been five of them I've seen, where they say Alex Jones is a Russian agent
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:06.160]  and we censored him at lunch and we're going to block him. And I mean, never got a dollar
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:15.280]  of Russian money. It's just crazy. Most of the Russian media is leftist. RT America has
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:20.520]  run by a bunch of leftists. I mean, no proof, no nothing, no court of law, just they just
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:28.800]  say it. Meanwhile, they are literally in bed with them. So they mean business and YouTube
[2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:34.520]  is pushing people to pedophile sites on how to pick up kids and how to have sex with kids,
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:38.360]  building a community of pedophiles. And then meanwhile, they're blocking people on their
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:51.800]  smartphones, throwing the info wars.com. So it's getting worse and worse. They're also
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:55.800]  releasing the deputy director McCabe, who's a Clinton operative and all his communications
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:01.320]  with his wife running for state Senate campaign, all of that. I mean, it just gets worse and
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:06.280]  worse with these people. But since I mentioned it, let's go ahead and go to that clip of
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:11.600]  the MSNBC Democratic Party operative saying, let's get them out of office and then let's
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:13.880]  put them in jail. Here it is.
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:21.680]  Republican Party in the last 10 years done to help the American people. What have they
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:26.480]  done? This is not a political party. This is a domestic terror group. And what I think
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:30.400]  the American people should consider when they ask themselves that question where they party
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:35.640]  that has done nothing to help the American people is to vote them out and consider possibly
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:39.840]  afterwards locking them up, Joy.
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:45.080]  Which is what their plan is. It's always been that. And they want to declare the election
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:50.200]  of fraud, to claim an old Russian, kick out all these Congress people that got elected,
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:55.720]  federalize the elections, which they've already done, one of Obama's last actions, and then
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:13:00.800]  have a one party permanent state. They're attempting an authoritarian takeover. And it's
[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:04.520]  the dumbest rhetoric. They've done nothing to help people like they're supposed to drop
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:12.480]  cheeseburgers from helicopters, get the regulations out of the way, cut the taxes, have fair trade,
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:16.840]  have a boom time. It's happening. And in the midst of the biggest boom time, we've seen
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:23.960]  in 30, 40 years that they are freaking out, saying the world is ending. Everything's over
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:30.800]  because they want depressed, dumbed down, pathetic people, Facebook executives admitted.
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:40.080]  From Sean Parker to their own documents, to Hillary emails, how she hates her loser constituents.
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:44.480]  And then they go out there to the whole lottery ticket crowd and go, they didn't give us anything.
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:48.520]  What have they done? Lock them up. So the stupidest people watch that go, yeah, what
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.840]  did they give me? Give me a free car or something. Yeah, go to North Korea. They can't even
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:14:05.360]  make cars. Let's play this so-called billionaire, Tom Sayer, can't wait to impeach Trump. And
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:12.120]  he runs these ads. This little globalist, you know, environmental land grabber insider
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:17.720]  auto move to communist China guy, just just just dripping with narcissistic self important
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:23.880]  surrogates. You have become perhaps the loudest voice calling for impeachment. The Constitution
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:29.520]  this guy sets the grounds for impeachment as treason. Right. They all do this self confidence
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:40.160]  thing when they go reliable sources. It's like, you know, like you just like stole some
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:49.200]  out of the cookie charts. I can't even do a fake confidence look like it'd be like a
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:55.640]  joke like, Hey ladies, how you doing? Let's go back to it or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:15:04.360]  Which is the president violated? Good morning, Dana. I would say it's clear that he has
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:09.680]  violated the Constitution in the sense that he has violated his trust with the American
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:15.800]  people through obstructing justice by firing the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, for what he
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:22.280]  said explicitly was over the Russian investigation. He has been taking in contradiction of the
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:26.320]  emoluments clause. He has been taking payments from foreign governments almost since the
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:31.560]  very first day that he took office. The president is exempt from all that of their preexisting
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:37.200]  businesses. This guy knows that the audience are idiots watching this. So he sits up there
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:40.880]  and just con artists everybody that says he can't wait for Trump to be impeached. We'll
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:44.840]  be back with your phone calls on the other side. There's so much other news I haven't

[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:09.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:09.800 --> 2:20:20.800]  Coming at you live. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:20.800 --> 2:20:38.920]  There's a phenomenon that if somebody's going to screw you over or cheat you, unless they're
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:46.560]  a total psychopath or sociopath, they normally make up a reason that you've been dehumanized
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:52.080]  so they can do it to you. They say you deserve it. And that's why Democrats and globalists
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:58.280]  and people that have sold the country out hate it so much because you're not going to kill
[2:20:58.280 --> 2:21:02.200]  your dog if you love it. But if you decide you're going to kill it for whatever reason,
[2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:07.600]  might as well decide they deserve it. And that's really what these parasites have done.
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:11.320]  I mean, you look into that billionaire guy that runs all these ads against Trump. He's
[2:21:11.320 --> 2:21:18.240]  a total establishment slime bag on the inside track. And all these guys are. And they have
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:22.920]  been selling this country out. So Trump just halfway got a few of the bear traps off our
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:30.680]  legs in the last year. And the economy roared back. And the media is like, well, look, there's
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:34.840]  still homeless people. Absolutely. The country still got problems. Most of the homeless are
[2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:39.160]  either drug addicts or mentally ill, but there's still big economic problems in this
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:45.240]  country. We're far from out of the woods. But to cheer lead against it really shows
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:57.240]  you who all these folks are. And that's why it frustrates me so much to be a hypocrite
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:00.240]  because you're just brought up in the midst of this. And even though you know it's destroying
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:05.800]  you, you still do it because PCs are made in the slave factory. So why not have Apple
[2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:12.280]  even though Apple is the worst and the worst politically and my enemy and trying to shut
[2:22:12.280 --> 2:22:16.960]  me down publicly and discriminating against me. I still have iPhones for everybody in
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:21.400]  the office because they're proprietary. They work together. We can get our work done, but
[2:22:21.400 --> 2:22:27.360]  it's like living with the devil. Same thing with Amazon. Same thing with YouTube or Google.
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:31.840]  I mean, I know who they are. I've read their corporate writings. Their own executives have
[2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:36.440]  gone public and said, we made the decision to take over, replace you with robots and
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:43.000]  we're going to kill you. And I'm just sitting here listening to what they say in policy
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:50.800]  reports versus all their grandstanding about how liberal they are and to watch them bend
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:56.720]  over backwards to be nasty, bend over backwards to hurt poor people and then grandstand when
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:02.000]  that, you know, these guys are on average worth like $80 billion a piece and how they
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:07.680]  escape taxes, but then they try to get bigger taxes on the middle class. I mean, it's, they're
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:19.280]  so evil. And none of this is my opinion. It's a fact that Google doesn't take taxes, income
[2:23:19.280 --> 2:23:26.320]  taxes, corporate taxes, general electric, Al Gore, the Clintons, any of these dirtbags,
[2:23:26.320 --> 2:23:35.400]  they all got tax-free foundations and they're all just selfish, worldly, nasty people and
[2:23:35.400 --> 2:23:40.120]  they know liberalism makes you dependent, makes you dumb, makes you stupid, makes you
[2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:45.640]  envious, makes you screwed up, makes you a loser. So they use it as a weapon system on
[2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:52.520]  you and they know it's a weapon system. I'm going to go to CA and Nicholas and Colt, Brian
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:57.120]  and Peter and John and others right now, but I'm going to say this one more time. There's
[2:23:57.120 --> 2:24:03.480]  a global architecture. There's a global ruling class. They're super sociopathic. They have
[2:24:03.480 --> 2:24:08.520]  an agenda. It's public. They're exploiting your weaknesses. They admit they're doing
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:14.120]  it. This is not my opinion. And the way they trick you into not caring, they then say you
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:22.120]  deserve to die and they want me shut down because I know their philosophy. I can show
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:29.120]  you a stack of articles where from pillar to post, Amazon is creating a monopoly with
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:35.080]  Chinese slave labor and tax exemptions and government funding of their buildings and
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:44.760]  taxpayer money per package, $1.48, where you can't compete with them. And then he's a socialist
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:50.960]  bleeding heart on top of it. It's all cold, blooded, psycho talk. That guy is as liberal
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:25:05.080]  as the Easter Bunny. It the clown has more morals. But again, every one of the billionaire
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:13.560]  leaders is a liberal because it's a scientific weapon system to screw you over. The universities
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:20.000]  are designed to create mentally ill, gibbering basket cases, unemployable. Everything is a
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.800]  takedown of the country. And Trump's just some desperate attempt to not totally destroy
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:30.080]  the country. And they're all just howling with anger because man, they had this country
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:40.600]  on its knees and it was over. We were out cold, TKO, but we got back up. And it would
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:45.520]  be so hard to live under them if they get their way, but we'll be so dumb down it won't
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:52.640]  even matter. I'm sorry, I'm ranting. God, these people are just so bad. I was watching
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.200]  this morning, the House of Horrors, warehouse horrors in the big giant warehouse where we
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:03.920]  replaced people with robots and everybody's got a package, one package every nine seconds
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:11.280]  like racks. Who should I go to? CA, Nicholas Kult, Brian. We're going to go to Brian, but
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:13.600]  I'm going to do it after the break because we're going to break in two and a half minutes
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:16.440]  and I don't want to cut him short and I'm going to write your calls right when we come
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:21.520]  out of break. But I just read here about how Seattle's going to pay for everything. So
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:26.120]  they put their new corporate headquarters there when it's already there, Amazon, or
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:32.720]  how they just now sex robot craze. And it's a guy sitting there next to a sex robot proud
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:36.200]  of the fact that he doesn't want a real woman and he's going to teach women. He doesn't
[2:26:36.200 --> 2:26:40.800]  need them because he has a robot and he thinks it's so cool not to procreate and give up.
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:47.880]  I mean, it's just the death of our culture, the death of everything by design. Briefly,
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:52.440]  they're doing everything they can to shut us down. That's why to these 34 hour really
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:57.240]  fundraiser broadcast that bring in the extra funds we need to hire more reporters and more
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:27:00.720]  crew because they're not going to let me just sit here at this size. They're trying to destroy
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:05.760]  me. They have newscast talking about how they're trying to destroy me. I aired one Friday where
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:09.920]  they talked about how we've attacked his sponsors and attacked his products and we're trying
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:14.760]  to shut him down, but it's hard. They're working and if they can get us the lead elephant, they
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:21.160]  can get you. That's why we make it easy with the best probiotics now available at infowarstore.com,

[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:07.400]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb. With populations
[2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:14.440]  and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.

[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:21.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. We're approaching one year that comes from an office
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:27.840]  in the United States. Alex Jones. You know a man by his enemies? Boy, they are upset
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:34.680]  at Trump. I'll say this though, he's letting us down. His new head of the CDC is a pro-vax
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:44.480]  guy, and you see him with a whole fake drug war thing. It's a total joke, but he's bringing
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:50.560]  the country back, bringing the jobs back, crushing political correctness. Soros-funded
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:56.800]  group claims repealing net neutrality is racist, and again they play these games. Obama's net
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:03.360]  neutrality move before he left office gives control of the Internet over to the UN for
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:10.840]  censorship and brings all these controls in, and then has taxpayers pay for all this broadband,
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:16.280]  and then claims that the government has jurisdiction over all other forms of media. It isn't net
[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:22.600]  neutrality. And so what Trump's FCC is doing is going back the way it was, real net neutrality.
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:28.920]  But again, it's all the way they label things. It's all how media lies to people. Here's
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:34.120]  an example. Day before Thanksgiving, we get the raw video of Congressman Joe Burton to
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:41.320]  a girlfriend naked. I said I thought it was probably revenge porn, and then it was wrong
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:45.800]  for whoever put it out unless that he was actually going after somebody that didn't
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:51.040]  want to be sent that. That's his personal stuff. I showed that we had the video. I
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:56.840]  didn't show the video. Made it clear I thought it was wrong. The neocon media picked it
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:03.080]  up and said that I did revenge porn, and that somehow we had the footage, and we got it
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:10.080]  from the Congressman. Knowing that we didn't show the video, they can then just lie and
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:19.200]  say that we had. It's just next level deception. That's what we're dealing with here, ladies
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:26.800]  and gentlemen. And it just goes on and on and on and on, where I think it's bad judgments
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:30.800]  sitting there doing that into some webcam to some woman you barely know. The point is,
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:34.400]  the biggest issue is who released it. It was already on the internet, the still images.
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:39.040]  We're pointing out it was a video, and it was revenge porn, unless she could prove that
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:44.400]  it was unwanted advances. But how is what he did equated with Bill Clinton on the Lolita
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:49.360]  Express with known pedophiles transporting children with Secret Service saying Bill Clinton
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:55.520]  was involved? Imagine my shock. Okay, let's go to your calls right now. I said I was going
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:36:02.920]  to Brian next, so he hung up. Okay, CA and Morocco, Nicholas in Texas, Colton, Kansas,
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:10.880]  Peter in New York, John and Callie. Let's go ahead and go to CA and Morocco out there
[2:36:10.880 --> 2:36:12.800]  in the Mediterranean. Go ahead.
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:17.400]  Alex, it's actually Zach reporting from Morocco right now.
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:20.560]  Okay, you didn't tell him it was Zach. It just says CA.
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:23.520]  Yeah, I did say Zach. Maybe the phone broke up there. I'm overseas.
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:27.960]  Let's start over. Intergalactic. I'm going to put you on hold. We're going to start
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:32.640]  over. We're going to put Zach up there from Morocco and I'm going to start over just because
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:37.720]  I didn't used to be OCD, but I'm getting really OCD about little things. And then if I can
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:42.280]  just have them that way, everything's going to be okay. So let's start over. Let's go
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:47.520]  to your phone calls. Zach in Morocco, you're on the air. We haven't heard from you in a
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:53.400]  while, Zach. You got hauled in last time you called in.
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:58.640]  That's correct. And well, I'm actually reporting from Morocco now for several reasons. One
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:03.360]  of which happens to be some of the major updates that I'm going to sort of release right now
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:11.400]  right here. So we warned of Yemeni terror attacks, obviously, that was foiled and stopped, thankfully.
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:16.080]  But what I can't verify and your team could pull up, it's public news now. As of yesterday,
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:22.640]  we have 10 high-profile Yemeni al-Qaeda ISIS targets neutralized by a drone strike authorized
[2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:28.320]  by the White House. That could be pulled up and that occurred yesterday. We also have
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:34.840]  the Islamic military counterterrorism, the Islamic military counterterrorism coalition,
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:45.360]  the IMCT meeting at the behest of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia with a complete message
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:50.200]  and a complete unified message of a complete global war and terror. We need to salute Donald
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:53.960]  Trump and salute the Info War. I don't know how you guys did it. I don't know how we did
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:57.160]  it. We got this out here and this is happening. This is breaking yesterday.
[2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:02.320]  Okay, for folks that don't know, I know folks that know who you are. You've told us who
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:05.480]  you are. We've checked it. You are who you say you are. Used to be in the military and
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:09.000]  intelligence operations. Now you're out with a security clearance. You're not giving us
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:12.600]  anything secret. You're talking about stuff that's human intelligence that's public. It's
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:16.840]  public domain right now, but you did get hauled in a few weeks ago when you called in the
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:20.600]  last time. How did that go? And now how are you able to call back in?
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:28.080]  It's essentially an intimidation tactic, basically making me aware of legally the ramifications
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:33.280]  of my actions, which is always the intimidation tactic. However, I'm not going to be intimidated
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:38.120]  and quite frankly, I did go overseas for certain safety reasons, but I feel quite safe overseas
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:43.080]  in the meantime, where I do have family and certain connections and sources, obviously,
[2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:46.920]  while the FBI gets their house in order, which is currently a current, but again, the two
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:52.840]  men. Okay. So let's be clear. You're calling in from Morocco and you've left the United
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:56.560]  States. So you can call into this show. I did see the drone strike news. I know that
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:00.360]  Trump's getting the Saudis to stop playing their double game. And you're saying from
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:04.920]  your personal experience as a U S citizen, you think this is actually working?
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:09.520]  It's definitely working. And you know, people are people have been calling for years. Where's
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:14.640]  the reparation of Islam? Where are the Islamic countries from the other right here? You have
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:18.600]  the meeting. You have the meeting on Sunday. You have the meeting of the Islamic military
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:23.000]  counterterrorism coalition, or essentially the era of NATO. They are turning on these
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.960]  forces, double crossing all these, you know, these deep state actors. And you know, it's
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:30.720]  not like the Arab countries don't want to see the reformation. It's not like they're
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:34.760]  not sick and tired of this crap. And it wasn't for Donald Trump and the administration that's
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:35.760]  in there.
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:39.600]  I don't want to say who you are, but you're, I mean, you're actually pretty famous. And
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:45.280]  of course, you know, you are a Muslim, at least one of your parents says has been Muslim.
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:48.760]  And so I mean, you're a well known, respected person, but you don't want who you are to
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:53.840]  be known at this point. That's why they picked you up. You're saying as a citizen who's had
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:58.920]  to leave the country so that you're able to even call into the show, you're just pointing
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:04.280]  out that, that, that we are actually rolling up the deep state backing of Al Qaeda and ISIS
[2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:07.920]  and Wahhabist and the rest of it physically every day.
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:12.480]  I mean, the drugs track that went on over the weekend were critical. I mean, very critical
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:18.360]  in the civil war that's unfolding overseas. You know, I can't, you know, emphasize the
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:24.840]  importance of the meeting of these 49 Islamic countries that do not include Syria, Iraq
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:30.560]  and Libya currently, which for obvious reasons, because who's running it now. And what we
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:37.360]  do also see is a humanitarian okey-doke, a flanking from, I don't know, the left, the
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:41.920]  deep state in America coming up with this sort of humanitarian crisis saying, look what's
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:47.000]  going on with the Yemeni civilians. Hey, that's not our problem. That's a result of the leftist
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:52.360]  Obama Bush, Cheney, Clinton machine. Now it's being rolled back. We have to the legitimate
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:53.360]  energy.
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:56.440]  Well, let's be clear. None of this is a secret started about seven years ago. And then going
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:00.720]  through Benghazi, they funded Arab Springs to put radical elements into destabilized
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:06.000]  moderate regimes and to overthrow secular regimes and, and bring into destabilization.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.400]  And Trump is cutting that off, making straight deals with everybody. We'll do trade. We'll
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:14.000]  do investment. We'll work with you. But all the double games are over because it's been
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:18.920]  directed by us is what is basically happening. And so that whole program that's been going
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:24.160]  on since the end of World War II, you're saying Trump's successfully pulling up those roots.
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:29.160]  Without question. And I mean, it's time stamp 27 November, Saudi led Arab NATO, declare total
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:34.680]  war on terrorism, Iran, Iraq and Syria, not invited. This is due to the fact that Donald
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:37.760]  Trump is in power and they have the backing and they're not worried about being double
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:41.480]  crossed and ran over by what's been going on this country generationally for quite some
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  time.
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.520]  Well, without getting into stuff that's already gotten you picked up twice, which you can give
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:50.120]  anything out secret. You're talking about all news. I just don't want your perspective.
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:53.320]  This is really upsetting with deep state, isn't it? Because once we stabilize the Middle
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:58.520]  East, then we can deal with China, who again, deep states double crosses to 100% one thing
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:01.760]  at a time. And you know, some of these countries overseas have definitely went for it. I know
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:06.080]  specifically with complete validation that talking government's been waiting for it.
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:08.840]  And deep state actors there, when Hillary's pay to play have been rolled up this week
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:11.200]  as well, which we're going to start to see that come out in the news, you know, the
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.080]  phosphate companies getting the money for the foundation, getting millions of dollars.
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:17.240]  Now it's just, you know, that was just a step.
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.680]  How does Iran play into this? Are they figuring out? They better watch it.
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:28.360]  Well, you know, a little too late, a little too late. It's going on right now. I don't
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:34.640]  think people realize the significance of what occurred on the 27th of November with this
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:38.160]  Arab coalition coming together and physically, I mean, physically being in the same room
[2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:43.040]  and declaring war on these actors that are deep state facts. This is the reformation.
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:46.640]  This is one of the most important moments in recent history. As far as the war on terror
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:50.520]  goes in our, in our state, as a country, as a world, this is incredible.
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:54.680]  Well, you had to go to Morocco to call in. We'll come back with Zach from Morocco.
[2:42:54.680 --> 2:43:00.480]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:06.360]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:13.320]  and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:17.720]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rearguard actions
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:22.080]  to be prepared. The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:26.600]  historical food. Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods, private labeled as

[2:44:02.200 --> 2:44:10.120]  new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:15.240]  able to break down meat and other proteins better. And then the other two is a powerful
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:23.520]  50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:29.080]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance. But all of
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:37.440]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:44.560]  affordable price. That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price

[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:55.120]  globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  With few remaining days left on the legislative calendar, Congress sure has a lot on the agenda,
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  including reauthorization of mass surveillance. The current authorization for the controversial
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:11.560]  section 702 expires December 31st. And it's the first time Congress has faced reauthorization
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:17.200]  since Edward Snowden revealed the NSA's mass surveillance apparatus. Civil libertarians
[2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:22.240]  have urged Congress to take this reauthorization as an opportunity to implement meaningful
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:26.760]  reforms to shield innocent Americans from mass surveillance. But with the clock running
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:32.160]  out, Congress appears poised to just jam through reauthorization. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:37.440]  has just took up a blockbuster case. The privacy of emails, photos stored in the cloud, even
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:42.960]  heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake. The case, Carpenter v. US, will
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:48.040]  determine whether the history of cell phone locations stored by a phone service provider
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:52.560]  is searchable without a warrant. It's a legal theory known as the third party doctrine.

[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:26.280]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro America, pro capitalism and pro freedom
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:32.760]  who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:38.720]  liberalism. They are the anti-liberal. To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends
[2:46:38.720 --> 2:46:44.120]  and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts

[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:22.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:43.000]  Here's an example. Soros was in the WikiLeaks and other documents that came out last year
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:48.520]  saying I want the UN to run things, have Obama give the internet over to the UN, then we'll
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:54.400]  only direct the news to us and we'll put up systems where you have to go through a site
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:59.920]  saying this is dangerous if you try to go to InfoWars. That's in the news today. They
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:04.880]  finally did it. Even though Trump got elected, they're just going ahead with it. Here it
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:10.480]  is, up on infowars.com, a Jerome Corsi article. It's linked up on drugsreport.com right now.
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:13.920]  Let's put that on screen and show folks where to find it, right there in the middle column.
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:19.920]  Soros, second story down, funded groups claim repealing net neutrality is racist, but again,
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:26.640]  it's not net neutrality. They got rid of net neutrality last year, 14 months ago, calling
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:31.800]  the new takeover of the internet net neutrality. All Trump's doing is going back to what was
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:37.400]  there before. And again, let me break down Trump. His dab was really old fashioned, an
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:42.440]  anti-communist, a John Birch funder. Okay, that's a fact. You can actually look that
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:47.440]  up. It's not even a secret. Trump sat there, played possum as a businessman, kept waiting
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:53.280]  for the country to get fixed, didn't want to run for president. And he's a pragmatist
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:59.120]  and he wants deals that are straightforward, not Machiavelli where you fund both sides.
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:02.840]  And that's very refreshing to a lot of folks actually in the Middle East who know they've
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:07.320]  been manipulated into a deindustrialization campaign. Trump just says, invest your money
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:11.000]  with us and we're going to stop overthrowing you and killing you because they understand
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:15.560]  where the plan was actually going. You think it's bad for us to have all the poorest, most
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:19.400]  uneducated Muslims coming here? Imagine being over there and having radical Muslims put
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:20.400]  in charge of your country.
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:24.360]  Now I'm going to go to the other callers, Nicholas and Colt and Amanda and Peter and
[2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:27.840]  John and others, but take Jack Basovic, who's hosting the fourth hour and I'll host some
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:31.480]  of the hour with him to take calls. He was an able intelligence, never made a big deal
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:35.680]  about it. Was a Trump booster. Trump would tweet him and liked him. They found out in
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:38.840]  the news he was an able intelligence. They had him stripped of his national security
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:43.480]  clearance because the president liked him. So in America, it's traitorous to back the
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:49.840]  president and follow the law. Same thing with our guests who I know who he is. They don't
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:53.960]  like him either, but he's not telling you anything that's secret. As a citizen, he's
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:57.960]  giving you his perspective on what Trump's doing.
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:03.480]  But what I get from you though, as you say, this realignment, this reformation, this giving
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:08.920]  Islamic countries a chance to not be manipulated by the globalist deep state in this whole
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:13.560]  class of civilizations, you're saying Trump and our military is successfully derailing
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:14.560]  that?
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:19.640]  That's without question. I mean, you made its first trip there. That was the first foreign
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:25.280]  visit into Riyadh and on the 26th of November, you have all the countries uniting, the Arab
[2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:30.760]  countries uniting in a complete unity fashion in a complete unified fashion to fight terror
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:35.480]  and what we think terror is today. And as the shakeups come through the deep state, we're
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:39.240]  really realizing what it is and kind of the world that's been pulled over everybody's
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:47.640]  eyes as a public since 2001. And that's enough. It's enough. Everyone's sick of it. And for
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:52.080]  all the criticisms and all the distractions that are going on state side, it's a disgrace.
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:53.720]  What Trump's doing around the world is...
[2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:56.760]  Yeah, he's trying to get our dollar back, trying to take care of our military, trying
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:51:00.960]  to take care of our workers, trying to boost our security. And he's just straightforward
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:05.680]  as a pragmatist trying to run America like a successful business and treating people
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:07.320]  like they're not crap.
[2:51:07.320 --> 2:51:12.920]  You have Barack Obama during his presidency, destabilizing Libya where there's now open
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:18.760]  slave trade, a war widening in Syria, and he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Donald
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:24.320]  Trump quietly goes over to Saudi Arabia where he sees criticism, unifies these Arab countries
[2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:29.800]  who are fairly moderate against the legitimate threat that is destroying this world. And
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:36.040]  what if he gets blamed? It's disgusting. And I really hope that there's an awakening
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:39.720]  state side because it has to happen. As an honorably discharged veteran of this country
[2:51:39.720 --> 2:51:43.760]  and somebody who's been in these fields for a long time, the state of the world right
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:47.920]  now is very bizarre and we got to back Trump.
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:54.800]  I mean, as an individual who's sitting over here right now, we're living... This is unreal.
[2:51:54.800 --> 2:52:00.280]  I'm really at a loss for words and it's occurring. This is happening right now and these things
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:05.360]  are going to be unveiled. This is his first year. And come year two, come year three,
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:10.560]  when his presidency is looked at historically, the things that he's doing for the way he's
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:15.960]  being described is just so incredible. I mean, they're describing him as being ridiculous
[2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:22.800]  or being a sociopath or something like this, but quietly, he is realigning the world to
[2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:28.240]  function at a level where we could survive and get back to some sort of normalcy. There's
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:30.040]  been madness going on generationally.
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:34.240]  That's right. We've had globalists selling us out seven ways this Sunday and selling
[2:52:34.240 --> 2:52:40.640]  destabilization everywhere. And now that 40-50-year program is being reversed and they're angry.
[2:52:40.640 --> 2:52:43.400]  And it's just incredible to see this come.
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:46.960]  Well, Zach, next time you call in, tell them to tell me you're on the line and I'll look
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:50.720]  over there and notice it and go to you. You shouldn't get in trouble for calling into
[2:52:50.720 --> 2:52:55.160]  the show. I mean, all you've talked about your personal opinion as a citizen, but I'm
[2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:58.360]  sad to hear you had to leave the country. Do you even be able to call in?
[2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:02.120]  Well, you know, I do work over here and I have family, but yeah, that was pretty much
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:06.320]  the legal advice. And as far as I'm concerned with my legal team, that I'm just going to
[2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:11.040]  kind of solve itself, state-side for me. The FBI is going through a major shake-up and
[2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:15.960]  I really can't speculate on that, but I mean, it's happening quickly. And from a legal
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:19.960]  team, I could, you know, physically do work here and I have family here right now. So
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:23.600]  unfortunately, I am having a call from here, but I'm not going to stop fighting. I'm not
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:27.360]  going to be intimidated. We're going to do this. We have impacted change. We've inflicted
[2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:29.880]  Well, aren't most of the folks that are still in the military, because we haven't talked
[2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:32.800]  off air, but I would guess, I mean, you were told me on air before, aren't they supporting
[2:53:32.800 --> 2:53:33.800]  you?
[2:53:33.800 --> 2:53:38.480]  Yes. I mean, within, I mean, within the individuals that know me personally, you know, it's absolute
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:42.080]  support for me. And they, you know, people know who I am and we know what we're doing.
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:44.920]  Unfortunately, when you, when you deal with certain fields like this and you deal with
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:48.480]  certain information like we're dealing with, not everybody can know what's going on. So
[2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:49.920]  eventually the story will be told.
[2:53:49.920 --> 2:53:53.080]  Well, they're trying to undermine our republic. They're trying to sabotage a good president.
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:56.560]  And we all have a responsibility to tell the truth about what's happening. The scum that
[2:53:56.560 --> 2:54:01.240]  funded Benghazi and funded the Arab Spring are the people trying to get control of this
[2:54:01.240 --> 2:54:05.600]  country again. And they're on TV saying, arrest all of us that don't play ball as a form
[2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:09.680]  of intimidation. Well, guess what? Your message got received. It didn't intimidate us. It's
[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:15.120]  making us dig in and work even harder. God bless you, Zach. Be safe. And Zach is his
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:18.760]  first name. I'll just leave it at that. But he doesn't want to go public at this point.
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:24.040]  But he's a decorated guy, intelligence operations with the army special operations command and
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:32.000]  doing a lot of work. And he's over there right now working for the US government and telling
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:35.920]  you what the president and our military is doing right now, as it's just totally attacked,
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:41.360]  just totally attacked because it's rolling back the takeover of radical Islam and Trump's
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:45.320]  gotten the Muslim countries to go along with that because they don't like it either. They
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:49.120]  understand it's a double-edged sword meant to cut us and cut them so the globalists like
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:53.400]  Soros above it can play it off against everybody. They understand it's a chaos operation. Okay,
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:57.480]  I'm going to go to your calls just briefly. We have free shipping still running. It's

[2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:17.600]  store.com. Okay. Who's up first? Nicholas Colt, Amanda, Peter. Let's go ahead and talk
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:25.760]  to Peter in New York. Peter, you're on the air. How does it talk about the geomagnetic
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:31.120]  field? Yeah, the earth's rotation is slowing for some reason. That changes the field. That's
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:35.520]  the main driver to climate change, right? I believe that the field is generated in the
[2:56:35.520 --> 2:56:40.960]  mantle and that the lava flows are changing. It's possible. I'm not 100 percent sure what's
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:45.000]  driving it specifically. I just know that it's moved about a thousand miles in a hundred
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:52.200]  years. Yes, sir. And again, right now the earth's rotation is actually slowed a bit
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:57.480]  as well. It will affect all of that. It's affecting the magnetic field itself has been
[2:56:57.480 --> 2:57:02.440]  weakening. And if it weakens to a certain point where they say if it goes into a flux
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:08.600]  point where we have a pole shift, that a solar flare would take out everything. Well, that's
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:15.360]  right. The magnetic field is our shield. And if we lose that, it would take out all of
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:18.960]  our electronics and then we won't be doing too well. They predict 90 percent of people
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:24.920]  will die in one year if there's a power outage. Crazy. Anything else, Peter? I'm glad you
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:27.400]  brought up such a central point and held to do that. You want to hold over? You got more
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:32.280]  to add? I wanted to bring up how it affects climate change. Let's talk about that. When
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:38.400]  we start our number four, then Jack Pasobic and so much more on the other side of this

[2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:50.800]  That's infowarstore.com. America is an information based civil war. That's why now more than
[2:58:50.800 --> 2:58:55.240]  ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're
[2:58:55.240 --> 2:59:00.800]  not backing down from their bully. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of
[2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:07.360]  their wannabe dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free
[2:59:07.360 --> 2:59:14.360]  speech advocate is truly the counter culture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's
[2:59:14.360 --> 2:59:21.040]  pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism
[2:59:21.040 --> 2:59:27.080]  is a counterfeit of Thomas Geverson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalist who
[2:59:27.080 --> 2:59:32.000]  defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women as well as more patriot
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:47.880]  apparel at infowarstore.com. Be part of the second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:47.880 --> 2:59:54.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:17.880 --> 3:00:23.600]  All right, Peter brought up the electromagnetic field of the Earth's been getting weaker. It's
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:31.240]  been changing. And the Earth's rotation has slowed. And of course, the sun's the main
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:37.440]  driver of climate. If we don't have that magnetic field, a lot more of the solar radiation will
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:41.560]  make it into the Earth. And then all these folks thinking they're going to be God like
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:45.720]  Jeff Bezos and others, they're not going to be doing too good like the rest of us here
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:50.160]  on the surface of the planet. They'll have to go into those little bunkers or those little
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:54.520]  bug eyes. But maybe he meant to live in the dark, one eye pointing in the direction. So
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:01:00.120]  a little hammerhead shark looking for monopolies, looking for free press to shut down. He heads
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:03.640]  up the Washington Post. It's calling for free press to be shut down and for the president
[3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:09.560]  to be arrested and for me to be arrested. And he's just a real pig. But Peter in New York,
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:10.560]  go ahead.
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:15.680]  Yeah, I just wanted to close up by saying, you know, they want to focus on CO2, right?
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:17.680]  Something that every plant needs is the fundamental.
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:21.120]  Well, they do that because it's something that's on the Earth. They can tax and control.
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:22.760]  They know it's all a fraud.
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:29.560]  Exactly. Now, if you change the North Pole, where, you know, the entire structure of the
[3:01:29.560 --> 3:01:35.800]  Earth is pointed to the sun based off of our poles, aligning with the sun's poles being
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:40.540]  pulled through space. If you realign that, you're going to have entire climate change
[3:01:40.540 --> 3:01:45.000]  wherever the North Pole is, it's now going to be where the new, you know, coldest area
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:48.040]  is where you have the least sunlight. So you're going to change everything.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:55.040]  So, so we can do a whole show and say a pole shift. And if it put the new pole and say
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:02:00.040]  in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and I mean, that would, he would just have like
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:04.800]  the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the new pole, you'd have a big arctica on one side or arctic
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:06.200]  and then Antarctica.
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:11.000]  Yeah. It's interesting theory that they were saying that they're thinking it might be going
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:16.200]  to where the Bermuda Triangle is, and there's a South China Sea anomaly as well. And that
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:18.720]  might be the new locations of the poles. And that's just the theory.
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:24.480]  Well, that'll fix the problem. China's got lower population. If the new pole, the new
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:27.920]  ice cap hits China, that won't be too pretty.
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:32.720]  No, sir. They're already killing their own people off quick enough. I think they'll lose
[3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:33.720]  a few more.
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:38.840]  I tell you, we're on a very volatile planet. You know, they got volcanoes going off in
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:41.000]  Mali and in Mexico right now.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:46.400]  Yeah. The ring of fire is really, really active. And like I said, if it all comes back, you
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:50.840]  know, you're having a fluctuation of the, of those, those liquid core, those liquid
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:54.120]  lava flows and within the mantle, I mean, that's going to change.
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:58.120]  But if you'll just pay some carbon taxes, it'll all be okay.
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:02.520]  Yeah. Exactly. We just got to cut that carbon dioxide core. A lot of it coming out of that
[3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:08.680]  volcano, but that's okay. It's like when Apple owns a slave factory, as long as it's liberal,
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:13.240]  like as long as the volcano is liberal, then the CO2 is good. Thank you very much. Peter,
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:18.120]  great points. Let's talk to Amanda in Tennessee. You're on the air. What about Tucker Carlson
[3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:20.520]  and a helicopter news? Go ahead.
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:24.840]  Yeah. I was wondering, he had a video that you've tamed, I guess three or four weeks
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:31.000]  ago and did it look like debris or like snow blowing across the video or over half of it?
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:34.360]  And he said it was due to a helicopter hovering over that area,
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:37.480]  but he never went into why there was a helicopter there for so long.
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:41.080]  You're talking about during the Vegas shooting? Yes.
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:46.120]  Well, I know the FBI went and picked up the caller you heard earlier when he talked about it being
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:50.760]  an Islamic attack. They're being shootings all over town and helicopters being used and
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:54.680]  the FBI showed up. They drug the guy on the declared national security. He's had to leave
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:59.480]  the country just over that. So do you think they'd be having the FBI at his house in two hours
[3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:04.600]  after he called in about that if it was just a rumor? No, they don't want that discussed. So
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:11.320]  Vegas is just phony as a $3 bill or as Obama's birth certificate. Wow.
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:17.400]  Isn't that crazy? That is so crazy. So many people.
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:20.360]  They had the Saudi military was having a convention there that week.
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:25.880]  Yeah, because I remember the most I've heard is what you've gone over and the other guy that
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:31.960]  did some research into all the planes that had changed. Well, the FBI showed up and they told
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:37.160]  them they said, you talk about that again, we're going to put you in prison because that's classified
[3:04:37.160 --> 3:04:42.280]  information. Even though he figured it out himself. The fact is the government, the military all knows
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:46.280]  they've been ordered not to talk about it because it's all part of this deal that Trump's got with
[3:04:46.280 --> 3:04:50.680]  the Saudis. We'll see if that's really the case. That was an Islamic terror attack from all the
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:58.440]  evidence we have. Thank you so much. I'm driving home here about to take off a few days for
[3:04:58.440 --> 3:05:04.120]  Thanksgiving and I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I
[3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:10.840]  appreciate you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to reemphasize the point that if you
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:15.800]  weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:20.840]  completely taken over not just this country but other nations. And globalism is a completely
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:27.640]  anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure
[3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:36.360]  power cult will to dominate and control society. And that we have come so far with God's help
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:41.000]  and have turned the tide but the enemy's tracking back. So just please, we should all be so thankful
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:46.680]  to God and thankful to each other for taking action and also girt ourselves and get ready for the
[3:05:46.680 --> 3:05:52.280]  next big fight ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family, God bless you all.
[3:05:52.280 --> 3:06:10.200]  Have a great Thanksgiving. There's a long way to go and it's show time to get there. Give me liberty
[3:06:10.200 --> 3:06:17.800]  or give me death. It's Alex Jones and hosting this hour. The fourth hour is Jack Kosovic.
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:25.160]  Then we've got a 34 hour broadcast going or three hours in. We've got 31 hours left of know your
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:31.880]  enemy. So I had the author of Meet the Bully. I had the author on earlier that's dealing with the
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:38.520]  big bully in Asia, communist China. Jack Kosovic lived over there before he even joined Naval
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:42.520]  Intelligence and was a big part of the Trump campaign as well. But I wanted to have him on
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:47.880]  with us today to get into knowing our enemy. What is our enemy? We know it's mainstream media but
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:54.040]  who owns them? What's their agenda? Why are they trying to block the restoration of this Republic?
[3:06:54.040 --> 3:06:59.240]  I'm going to be back tonight, 8 to 10 p.m. But there's a full list of the talk show hosts,
[3:06:59.240 --> 3:07:04.440]  the guest, the breaking news, the info. But you can be part of the revolution as well
[3:07:04.440 --> 3:07:11.160]  by spreading the live links to us on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube or just info wars.com
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:16.600]  forward slash show because Facebook, Twitter, YouTube are blocking people trying to share
[3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:22.840]  our videos. There's articles on info wars.com about it. They intended to just wear you out with
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:28.280]  the censorship instead of you going, oh my gosh, it's all true. They're censoring the patriots,
[3:07:28.280 --> 3:07:33.000]  the censoring folks that want to reboot America. They just think we'll just kind of give up and
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:39.080]  go away. But instead when you get excited, we've had 30 something million people tune in before
[3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:43.400]  just to extra streams and things during a marathon broadcast. Now that was the biggest ever on election
[3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:50.360]  night and I guess over two days that happened. We did a 34 hour broadcast the other day and
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:54.840]  outside of our regular shows and millions of listeners on AM and FM a day and about a million
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:07:59.960]  views conservatively a day just on YouTube alone or a couple million a day on Facebook,
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:04.520]  we had an additional million and a half people that we could track that came in and watched on
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:11.240]  the streams or saw stuff and those were new people. Those were new IP addresses. We could see in the
[3:08:11.240 --> 3:08:16.760]  aggregate, you know, new people coming in that we're tuning in and that's who we're really looking
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:21.000]  for. It's not that you're being overlooked. You're just appreciated. We know you're awake,
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:24.680]  probably more awake than we are, probably wait before I was born. God bless you. We stay on
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:30.120]  your shoulders, but we're looking for folks that aren't awake. That's how we're going to win. That's
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:33.320]  how we're going to defeat the globals. They want to target kids when they're little and brainwash
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:37.560]  them and do all this and we just want to wake everybody up. Old, young, black, white doesn't
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:42.440]  matter. We're in a fight for hearts and minds and we're just promoting Americana and choice
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:47.880]  and free market and freedom. We're just promoting the thing everybody wanted and it's coming back.
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:54.360]  We're a year into Trump being elected. We're basically 10 and a half months into him being
[3:08:54.360 --> 3:09:01.160]  in office and you already see the economy and record new jobs and record new small businesses
[3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:08.120]  and record low lending. The big mega banks responded by not lending even more to try to
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:12.440]  stop and then try to raise interest rates, but it hasn't worked because people understand
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:19.480]  we're under economic warfare. So that's why when you shop at infowarstore.com there isn't a place
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:26.520]  in this fight where buying the products that you already need, water filters, air filters,
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:31.320]  non-gmo, heirloom seeds, t-shirts that spread the word, high quality supplements. There's not a
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:37.560]  place where buying products has a bigger political effect. You know, I'm waiting in the next month
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:41.080]  or two to see how we're going to expand. I would like to have a higher subject. I'd like to have a
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:45.640]  higher whole bunch of people. I told them to launch a lot of new shows. We've already, you know,
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:51.000]  launched two new broadcasts in the last month. Five days a week, the war room with Owen Schreuer
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.160]  and then of course David Knight and the real news and the enemy's coming after us and I'm not
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:10:01.240]  complaining. I'm just saying we're having an effect. We're having victories and we're trying to gauge
[3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:07.720]  whether we can continue on expanding because there is no getting, you know, zero sum game where we're
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:12.680]  just one size. We've got to either expand or contract. The globalists want us to contract and go away.
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:16.280]  We understand we'll be destroyed if we do that. All of us. We've got to expand. So we've got free
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:20.440]  shipping about the end store wide. It's got to end by tomorrow. We've got Silver Bullet,
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:25.320]  Loyal Silver, Brain Force, the new tropic bestseller, Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, all 50%
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:31.480]  off free shipping. Super mail, knockout, sleep aid, Pro Pure, water filtration. It's all there. 50%
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:37.080]  off free shipping and we have the new, I want to call it new tropic because it's for the brain,
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:42.360]  the heart. You can even make claims on this because it is a multivitamin amino acid. All the minerals
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:47.880]  with Pregnalone that is the precursor to all hormones, but legal according to the Olympic
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:52.680]  Committee because it's the precursor to all the steroids in your body. They're natural
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:57.480]  so your body can make them without it. It can't do it. But if you just take Pregnalone by itself
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:02.040]  without these vitamins and minerals and other amino acids, you can't upload it.
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:06.920]  That's what the scientists that developed this at one of the top firms in the country came up with.
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:12.520]  I had already done the research and said, why aren't we selling an amino acid Pregnalone
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:16.840]  combo? Because I noticed only top medical firms were getting people to pay on their prescription
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:20.920]  for it and people would pay $200 or $300 for something similar to this just because they
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:27.640]  were in a doctor's office. This is $80 usually. It's 50% off. It's $39 right now. Free shipping

[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:39.240]  And now taking over, Jack Pasobic, ladies and gentlemen. Jack, thank you so much for hosting
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:44.440]  the broadcast, my friend. Alex, it's great to be back. Happy Thanksgiving and dare I say it,
[3:11:44.440 --> 3:11:46.840]  Merry Christmas even. I think we're allowed to say that again now.
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:49.960]  Wow. You're really not being politically correct now. How dare you?
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:55.800]  I'm so sorry. I'm just, I'm going crazy. It's Cyber Monday. You know, we saw all the insanity
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:12:00.520]  of Black Friday and now people who are smart aren't going out there and fighting each other
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:05.080]  for, you know, for a new TV and a new computer. They're actually going and just buying stuff
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:07.800]  online that they can do at the airport store. And notice they're saying this Black Friday
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:11.800]  is the biggest ever. And the good news is, yeah, sure Bezos and an extra billion for his
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:16.360]  anti-American activities. He had more than $100 billion this week, but record people are going
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:24.520]  to smaller sites now. There's kind of a kickback, a pushback, a blowback against Amazon right now.
[3:12:25.320 --> 3:12:30.520]  Well, there is because people are finding out so much about how Bezos is essentially
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:34.840]  misappropriating their money, is spending it for his lobbying in Congress, the way that he was
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:39.240]  potentially buying out in many ways, the Obama administration, the way that he's purchased the
[3:12:39.240 --> 3:12:43.560]  Washington Post and has funded all sorts of oppo research crap against Trump and against
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:47.080]  Republicans. And people are fed up with it. The same way they're fed up with the box stores,
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:51.720]  they're set up with the fighting, they're set up with the brawling that goes on in the streets.
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:56.040]  And they're seeing the program and they want to step out of it. I mean, Alex, one of the
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:13:00.280]  observations I had this weekend looking at Black Friday is look at the how ginned up,
[3:13:00.280 --> 3:13:07.080]  look at how aggressive they can make people when it comes for a new TV or a laptop that nobody
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.720]  ever needs. But when you talk about defending liberty, when you talk about getting back their
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:16.040]  country, and people just say, oh, whatever, and they, they swipe to the next thing on their phone,
[3:13:16.040 --> 3:13:20.920]  it's crazy. And that is why we've got to wake people up because this is what they're tuned to,
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:25.320]  they're tuned and they're programmed to. And that's why they're scared of info wars and you
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:30.600]  and others is we have excitement about freedom and show how it's the engine and the progenitor
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:34.680]  of everything. Great. Jack Mesobic takeover. I'll be back tonight, eight o'clock central
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:38.920]  during the 34 hour broadcast. Lots of great people today in the lineup. Back to Jack Mesobic.
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:45.800]  Be sure and follow him on Twitter. Amazing. The 34 hour telecast that goes live now that's that
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:51.880]  we're finally a part of. I'd like to also give a warm and hearty welcome to everyone from Vice
[3:13:51.880 --> 3:13:57.000]  and Buzzfeed and all the other left wing sites out there. Mike, I don't know if they're watching
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.160]  Think Progress, Daily Clause, Politico. See, they actually went in the last 34 hour,
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:08.600]  34 hour livecast that was done. Someone from Vice actually sat and watched and tracked every single
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:14.120]  thing that was on, except that he said, it turned my brain to mush. I couldn't understand what was
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:19.000]  going on. He actually had a conniption fit. Now possibly no, actually it's not the info wars that
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:23.880]  was turning your brain to mush. That is the soy based diet that you've been, you've been taking
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:27.320]  part of for so long, but don't worry. Hopefully we can help you with that. And if your brain is
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:32.280]  having problems, then you simply should try the new, the new real red pill or try the new
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:37.800]  brain force, because then you might actually be able to participate at that level, right? Turn
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:45.080]  my brain to lush Mark Lark Lamarrow. And it was less Fox news and more of a super scary QVC.
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:51.880]  And you look at this guy's face and I question how much of it was much to begin with. I mean,
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:55.560]  are we talking, I don't think this was 100%. We didn't have to go to the full 100%,
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:15:00.600]  but I would like to give a, a firm welcome to Mark and say, thank you so much for watching,
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:06.440]  because it only gets better from here. We've only had our first dose of Alex Jones for the day.
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:10.360]  There's, he's going to come back this evening with breaking even more stories. We've got Jack
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:16.200]  Pasobic right here. I'm live from Washington DC to break down so much of what's going on in this
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:22.040]  corrupt capital that president Trump is fighting, fighting against so much that's going on on the
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:25.400]  internet. We're going to talk about YouTube. We're going to talk about Pelosi. We're going
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:30.120]  to talk about Conyers and Franken who came back to work today, despite the fact that there are
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:35.640]  numerous settlements and allegations against them. Stick right here. We're going to break it all down.

[3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:27.160]  while, you may have known that I recently got married and getting married. It changes your
[3:21:27.160 --> 3:21:32.920]  perspective on so many things in ways that I didn't expect. You know, I was, it was a beautiful
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:37.400]  wedding. My wife looked amazing. So many people were there. Everybody was there, but it changed
[3:21:37.400 --> 3:21:43.640]  your perspective on a lot of things. I didn't see that coming. Honestly, didn't a plan to realize
[3:21:43.640 --> 3:21:48.840]  that, you know, this is it, man. This is your wedding day. You get one. You get one. So this is
[3:21:48.840 --> 3:21:53.960]  my wedding day. My father was there. My mother was there. My whole family was there. So many friends.
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:21:59.560]  But it gets you thinking about life events and it gets you thinking about moving on in life. And
[3:21:59.560 --> 3:22:05.160]  it gets you thinking about, about where you're going. I think it's this generational type moment.
[3:22:05.160 --> 3:22:11.080]  And it got me thinking quite honestly, it got me thinking about getting older and getting and
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:14.680]  thinking about aging and say, you know what? This is it, Jack. This is your wedding. This is your
[3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:18.680]  wedding day. You guys are going to have kids. This is their mom. Here she is. Like this is
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.080]  all set in place and me, I'm 32, but you've got to start thinking about this stuff and the aging
[3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:27.640]  process is going to happen. And by the time he's coming for all of us, right? And that's why there's

[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:01.240]  check it out if you want that type of healthy living that we're all going to need. And my family,
[3:24:01.240 --> 3:24:05.720]  we did a, we did a report on this actually from Thanksgiving dinner. We talked about healthy
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:11.000]  living and we talked about the importance of eating living foods, having vitamins and supplements,
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:17.560]  and, and living that way, going non GMO because we talked about it because my, my wife comes from
[3:24:17.560 --> 3:24:22.760]  Europe and in Europe, people don't eat the way we do here. They eat from the village. They eat
[3:24:22.760 --> 3:24:26.280]  straight. I mean, they don't even talk about farm to table because it is a farm to table. It's all
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:29.560]  farm to table. So they eat straight from the village. They eat vegetables that are straight
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:35.400]  from the garden. It's so different and they have so many vitamins and minerals that are taken out
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:43.720]  of that food in the processing system and the processing process, but other hormones and,
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:47.800]  and estrogens, phytoestrogens and everything that are put in enzymes that are put into the
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:52.280]  meat that we're getting today. So not to get off on that too for too long, but it's really what
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:56.600]  I've been thinking about the past couple days over Thanksgiving, big eating day and really
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:00.360]  talking about how much the supplements here at the infowars store can help with that. But Nancy
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:06.280]  Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press on Sunday, on yesterday morning. I was out and I
[3:25:06.280 --> 3:25:12.280]  was watching this interview and she gets up there today, excuse me, yesterday and they, so they ask
[3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:18.920]  her about John Conyers. Now John Conyers, it's been proven that he had a settlement, a sexual
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:26.520]  harassment settlement with a former staffer who alleged that he demanded that she sleep with him
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:31.000]  and that if she did not, he was gonna fire her. Well, he did fire her, she filed a complaint,
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:35.800]  there was a settlement through this secret house process. Massive story broken by Mike
[3:25:35.800 --> 3:25:39.880]  Cernovich, a lot of the legwork, the journalistic investigation done by the people at Buzzfeed
[3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:44.680]  because he knew they were gonna attack him. But then Pelosi, she comes up there and in the midst
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:51.880]  of all of the Democrat haranguing about Roy Moore and Donald Trump, she goes around and she says,
[3:25:51.880 --> 3:25:57.880]  oh, well, no, if it's John Conyers, we need to have a due process, we need to have an investigation.
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:04.520]  I'm unwilling to look into this stuff because these women haven't come forward publicly. Keep
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:08.600]  in mind, coming forward publicly when you're the victim of sexual assault is what Nancy Pelosi was
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:14.280]  calling for here. And then she said, she basically what happened was the Democrats are now all freaking
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:18.920]  out because she stepped out of line when it comes to the Democrat talking point. So the media's
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:24.040]  obseditor, Chuck Todd from NBC is obseditor, Daily Beast, which is a Clinton organ is super
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:30.920]  obseditor because she spoke out of turn. And she actually had the temerity, believe it,
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:38.120]  the audacity even to suggest that we adhere to constitutional due process and rule of law in
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:43.640]  this country rather than immediately turning over, right? And saying someone is guilty just
[3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:48.440]  because of allegations. And I was there to her on this, to her credit, she's actually right.
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:54.760]  She's actually right. We should have that for any allegations or any due process anytime
[3:26:54.760 --> 3:26:59.000]  there are these allegations, especially in the case of Roy Moore or President Trump,
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:04.280]  when these are done, right, right before an election, we should have investigation.
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:08.840]  But look at NBC, even NBC's headline, she stumbles on alleged harassment. It said,
[3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:14.280]  well, actually Pelosi, what she said was constitutional. What she said was for once
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:19.800]  in her life in line with the United States Constitution that says under the Bill of Rights
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:25.240]  that says that everyone gets the right to due process and a fair trial, believe it's the
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:30.360]  Sixth Amendment. So what her remarks, they were saying, oh, no, the progressives are saying it's
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:36.040]  muddling the message on misconduct. It's putting politics ahead of women. And what she actually
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:41.160]  said was flying in the face of the entire war on women narrative that the whole left,
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:45.720]  the media, the Washington Post, everyone has been trying to say. So she actually pointed out
[3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:50.680]  that it was constitutional to investigate these things. Now, the one point though where I would
[3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:55.240]  suggest that Pelosi is actually wrong in this case is that here's the issue. There was due
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:28:00.680]  process already. There was due process when this was brought before the settlement committee,
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:04.760]  when the committee looked into it and the settlement was agreed upon by John Conyers'
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:10.440]  office and by the complainant, the woman who was the accuser in this case. So there actually was
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:15.880]  due process and it was investigated and it was settled. That's why the 264 settlements which
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:20.040]  need to be unsealed, we're calling it hashtag unsealed the deals, why it needs to come out,
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:25.320]  because these are not just accusations. These have been investigated. These have been proven
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:30.680]  to have merit and millions of dollars, 70 million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money,
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:37.080]  our money essentially is going to cover up these sexual crimes, these schemes of our
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:41.160]  congressmen, possibly congressmen, and we don't even know who's involved in this. We're saying
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:46.280]  unsealed the deals, let us know the names of the members of Congress who are involved in this
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:51.080]  and we are going to get to the bottom of it. We're sticking with the story, so we hope that you
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:55.880]  stick with us here on Infowars. A commemorative President Trump dollar for only five dollars?

[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:42.440]  But was this done to get around YouTube child filters because it would ping it as just, oh,
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:47.080]  a video about Elsa, but then you actually see what Elsa is doing in the video. But no,
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:51.480]  YouTube and Google aren't spending their time focused on this. YouTube and Google are spending
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:57.960]  their time focused on going after info wars, going after us, shutting us down, demonetizing
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:03.800]  the videos like the videos done by the great Paul Joseph Watson, going forward and trying to
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:09.720]  mark dice, so many people that have been affected by this. They took down Conan O'Brien's YouTube page
[3:39:09.720 --> 3:39:13.560]  over the Thanksgiving break, and not a lot of people saw that, but they just completely took
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:18.120]  down Conan O'Brien. And Conan O'Brien, no, I wouldn't say he's a conservative or Trump supporter by
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:22.280]  any stretch of the imagination, but why would they take down his account? Why would they take
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:27.480]  down someone with a huge account like his? You know, talk show host, former Simpsons writer,
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:35.160]  they went after so many people. Meanwhile, there are these predators and disgusting perverts on
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:41.080]  YouTube that are using their service. The same Twitter had the same problem with Periscope,
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:47.000]  Instagram has an issue with this. Even Bloomberg is running stories about Snapchat and Snapchat's
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:52.920]  entire huge problem with so many of these pedophile rings because they're able to use now
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:59.480]  these social media services privately in many cases or going undetected by the higher levels,
[3:39:59.480 --> 3:40:04.440]  because they're not putting their attention towards them. They're putting their attention towards
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:09.000]  conservative voices. They're putting their attention towards the conservatives, the people
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:12.680]  who are Trump supporters, the people who want to take their country back, the people who actually
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:17.640]  want to do the right thing by their country. And you can look at this. You can look at the rings
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:23.560]  of these pedophiles that are committing sex crimes and then broadcasting it for pay over the internet.
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:27.640]  A lot of this happens in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Southeast Asia,
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:33.480]  where they will film children being abused, some as young as two, some as young as nine years old,
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:38.520]  being abused, and then it's pay for play video, pay per view, where they can then go watch it
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:44.440]  on and a lot of the customers tend to be in the United States, tend to be in the UK, Canada.
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:49.080]  This is all out there. Anybody can go and find this information. And I wish, I wish to God,
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:52.760]  we didn't have to talk about this stuff. But why are they so focused, right?
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:58.520]  Philippines, yeah, they just got rid of this one, this huge pedophile ring that was streaming this
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:04.280]  child sex abuse, right? But there's so, there's so much of it that's rampant and still goes on
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:08.920]  on these networks that are still being used. This is deep web stuff. This is huge deep web stuff.
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:12.680]  But why are the internet companies, and this is what you have to ask yourself now,
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:18.280]  why aren't they focused on going after these people? Why should the police have to be involved at
[3:41:18.280 --> 3:41:23.800]  all? Shouldn't they know what content is being pushed on their own ISPs and on their own platforms?
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:27.400]  Shouldn't they know what kind of content is out there? And I'm not saying they should be
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:31.400]  reading emails, but they should definitely know if there are chat rooms and if there are groups,
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:37.240]  and if there are mid videos on YouTube with millions of views, shouldn't they be doing something to
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:42.840]  self police what's going on? Or at least self report the users that are sharing this type
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:49.160]  of deviant and sick content out that they should be reporting it to them police themselves.
[3:41:49.160 --> 3:41:53.720]  But why are the companies then so focused on things like net neutrality? These are the type
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:41:58.600]  of the questions that we need to start asking. These are the type of questions that we need to
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:02.520]  ask ourselves when we want to know our enemy, which is today's theme, the theme of today's
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:07.000]  broadcast. When we want to know our enemy, say, why does the enemy focus so much on set? When
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:10.920]  you first think of censorship, right? Isn't the first thing that you'd say, well, you know,
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:15.240]  child pornography, that should be something that should be censored. Absolutely should be censored.
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:20.600]  So why isn't that their number one priority when instead their number one priority when it comes
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:27.480]  to censorship seems to be focused on shutting down conservatives, shutting down free thinkers,
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:34.520]  libertarians, people who are supporting their country? That is the big question here. Why does
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:38.920]  this only go down when people like Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, Jack Pasobic, Mike Cernovich
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:44.200]  point this stuff out? Then they say, oh, we're sorry. It was a mistake. Is it a mistake?
[3:42:44.200 --> 3:42:48.920]  Or what worse are you trying to cover up? That's the type of questions we're here
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:52.600]  to answer today and every day, hopefully as we continue the broadcast.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:59.320]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing

[3:45:05.560 --> 3:45:11.800]  globalism and the neural orders manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:16.520]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear guard actions to

[3:45:57.960 --> 3:46:04.440]  a Democrat. When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd whether or not embattled rep John Conyers should be in or
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:09.800]  out of Congress as he faces down sexual harassment allegations, Nancy Pelosi replied,
[3:46:09.800 --> 3:46:15.960]  we are strengthened by due process just because someone is accused. And wait, was it one accusation?
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:21.080]  Is it two? Well, Nancy, to answer that question, it was revealed last week the taxpayers put
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:27.640]  at the bill for a $27,000 settlement for a staffer of Conyers that claimed the 88-year-old
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:33.080]  congressman made sexual advances on her and then fired her after she wouldn't succumb to them.
[3:46:33.080 --> 3:46:37.560]  And a lawyer who worked for Conyers said she'd often encounter the congressman in his office
[3:46:37.560 --> 3:46:41.800]  walking around in his underwear. Conyers, who's the longest serving congressman,
[3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:46.520]  has denied all sexual harassment allegations against him. Nancy Pelosi says we need to give
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:47:13.800]  him a pass because Conyers is an icon. Lee and McAdooInfoWars.com.
[3:47:13.800 --> 3:47:19.960]  Defending the Republic From Enemies, Foreign and Domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:13.800]  Jack
[3:47:13.800 --> 3:47:41.400]  is out of the office of congressman Al Alexander Green. Now, we were talking earlier today about these
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:49.560]  unsealed settlements, these case files, so many of them 264 covered and settled by our taxpayer dollars.
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:55.320]  Well, and we talked about how John Conyers, that settlement came out. Then there were some other
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:01.320]  people that started looking into other congressmen and congresswomen. 264, obviously, that is a huge
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:06.200]  number of settlements, especially considering the fact that there are only 435 members of the House
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:14.360]  and 535 members of the Senate. So we're talking 50% if you assume the current serving number. Huge number of
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:22.680]  that. But we've got this one by Al Green, who's a congressman. And he stated that it is a joint
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:27.000]  statement essentially, and I'm reading it right now, a joint press statement that came out between
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:34.280]  himself and a woman named Lucinda R. Davis. And the congressman wrote, in the present climate,
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:42.440]  we wish to quietly and jointly, quiet any curious minds about our former and present relationship with one another. We're friends,
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:47.960]  we have long been friends, at an unfortunate time in our lives, and both of our feelings were hurt. We made
[3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:54.920]  hasty allegations and charges against one another that have been absolutely resolved. And as consenting friends,
[3:48:54.920 --> 3:49:00.840]  we both regret our former claims that have since been maintained, and we since were playing to our
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:05.320]  respectful friendship, we're currently friends, this matter has been resolved without any payment of
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:12.840]  money. So look at how scared they are. Look at how scared they are, because now this was this came from
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:18.920]  a female, there was a former female staffer, at one point was threatening to sue congressman Al Green.
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:23.880]  He filed a lawsuit against her, and then alleged that she had evidence of her dealing drugs,
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:28.760]  she then went away. So was this a silencing of his victim? Was he a victim of a shakedown?
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:35.080]  What was going on? So now, today, just about 40 minutes ago, this new statement by congressman
[3:49:35.080 --> 3:49:41.800]  Al Green, and I'm trying to get his party out here, because I want to make sure you guys know.
[3:49:43.720 --> 3:49:48.120]  Well, maybe the producers can check that for me, but there are so many, there were allegations,
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:54.440]  again, about discrimination, that someone was going after him $1.8 million, that was coming
[3:49:54.440 --> 3:50:01.640]  out of his office. So now, because they know the heat is on, because they know that so much of this
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:07.880]  is coming down on their heads. And I told people, I told people, he is the ninth congressional
[3:50:07.880 --> 3:50:15.160]  district out of Houston, Texas, I told so many people that this was coming out. Oh, excuse me,
[3:50:15.160 --> 3:50:21.480]  this is one of the guys, okay, he filed articles of impeachment against Trump just a few days ago.
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:27.720]  This is one of the guys who was trying to impeach Trump, who actually filed the articles of impeachment
[3:50:27.720 --> 3:50:33.480]  against him. Huge hardcore liberal Democrat, the name just flicked me. I was looking at his account,
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:38.120]  I saw that up there. So now he's putting out this statement that said, oh, well, you know,
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:45.160]  there were claims and there were settlements, the heat is on. The heat is on for every single
[3:50:45.160 --> 3:50:51.000]  one of these scumbags serving in our Congress, representing us or claiming to represent us
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:55.800]  in the United States Congress, the United States government. This shows how far our Republic has
[3:50:55.800 --> 3:51:02.040]  come, how far our Republic has fallen to see this type of behavior being, and there it is,
[3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:06.200]  that the out of nowhere, they're calling it statement. It was a just a quote unquote,
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:11.160]  a circumstance. It was just a circumstance, and it certainly didn't involve the employment
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:15.960]  office or any taxpayer money. But they're so worried about this circumstance coming clean.
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:23.000]  Well, guess what? These are the type of people, these are the type of people that are calling for
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  the president's impeachment. They're claiming that he should be impeached. They're claiming,
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:33.560]  these are the same ones that call President Trump a rapist and a sexual abuser and all this stuff.
[3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:39.320]  And now we see that they're the ones running scared of what they've been doing. This is,
[3:51:39.320 --> 3:51:43.960]  this is a CYA kind of statement. This is a persuasion. This is trying to get the cart
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:49.720]  in front of the horse to let people know because they know what's coming and they know that we're
[3:51:49.720 --> 3:51:55.160]  coming for them. So we're going to stay on that story as it breaks. We're going to keep an eye on
[3:51:55.160 --> 3:52:00.360]  it. But one thing that I wanted to put out today and to let people know, and this was a huge story
[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:07.400]  that broke over the weekend, the fact that there was a child porn case that involved the FBI and
[3:52:07.400 --> 3:52:14.520]  Geek Squad that was thrown out by the judge. And why was it thrown out? Because of a lawsuit
[3:52:14.520 --> 3:52:22.680]  by a George Soros funded organization called the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, excuse me.
[3:52:23.240 --> 3:52:31.080]  And so now we've got George Soros essentially pushing forward to protect suspects of child porn.
[3:52:31.080 --> 3:52:35.880]  And let me put this into context for people. Here's what happened. So there was this guy,
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:45.480]  he was an oncologist, Mark Rittenmeyer. And he was going in Kentucky to get his computer worked on
[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:51.960]  at Geek Squad, his desktop to get his computer worked on at the Geek Squad. And they went in there.
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:58.120]  And as they were working on it, they found a picture that looked very strange to them. It was a
[3:52:58.120 --> 3:53:04.680]  picture of a young girl. And it was a picture that they found in an unallocated space on his
[3:53:04.680 --> 3:53:11.560]  desktop. They were trying to clean it up. But what they actually saw in there was what they deemed
[3:53:11.560 --> 3:53:18.200]  as child erotica. They turned it over to the FBI. The FBI then went and got a search warrant,
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:23.560]  went into this guy's house, went in through all of his items, went in through all of his
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:29.800]  electronic devices. They found hundreds of photos of child porn, hundreds of them.
[3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:35.800]  All throughout his house, they had the evidence, they had him dead to rights. Up until this George
[3:53:35.800 --> 3:53:42.120]  Soros Foundation, the EFF, George Soros Funded Foundation came in and sued, actually sued,
[3:53:42.120 --> 3:53:48.120]  the Department of Justice over the search warrant. And in their lawsuit, they essentially stated that
[3:53:48.120 --> 3:53:57.480]  the search warrant was inadmissible and that all of the evidence should be inadmissible as well
[3:53:57.480 --> 3:54:05.800]  because of the fact, because of two reasons. Because of first, because the FBI gave reward
[3:54:05.800 --> 3:54:12.840]  money to Geek Squad for turning over, for turning over the evidence that they found. The FBI gave
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:20.040]  reward money to the Geek Squad. Well, here's what the Soros Foundation said. They said that if
[3:54:20.040 --> 3:54:31.800]  they had been paid by the FBI, then that kind of made them deputy FBI agents. This is as crazy as it
[3:54:31.800 --> 3:54:38.840]  gets. And that as deputized federal agents, they needed a search warrant to search his computer
[3:54:38.840 --> 3:54:45.160]  in the first place, even after he had turned it over to them. So this is the EFF, this is the
[3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:51.080]  lawsuit. They're concerning the FBI's relationship with Best Buy and other computer repair facilities.
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:55.320]  It's like, no, excuse me, the FBI is actually, and doesn't that make sense? Doesn't that totally
[3:54:55.320 --> 3:54:59.000]  make sense to you that if you want to catch these people, you catch them when they're not going to
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.880]  be looking. So you go to places like Geek Squad, you go to play, now that obviously that relationship
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:08.200]  is burned because now, now that the pedophile rings are going to know not to go to Geek Squad
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:13.720]  because they work with the FBI. But doesn't that make sense? You go to someone when I've worked
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:17.880]  in intelligence, I've done intelligence operations, I've done investigations. This is the type of thing
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:23.240]  you do. You want to put a positive front, a neutral front in front, and this is the way that you
[3:55:23.240 --> 3:55:28.600]  catch these sickos and these creeps. But the Soros Foundation, no, they're interested in
[3:55:29.240 --> 3:55:35.160]  protecting these child porn predators, these perverts, that they want to protect them. And the
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:41.400]  judge actually eventually threw it out because he stated there wasn't a search warrant in the fact
[3:55:41.400 --> 3:55:45.800]  that there was payment, even though they had consent to go into his desktop, he brought it over to them.
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:53.560]  And then he also stated that the picture that they found wasn't essentially erotic enough,
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:56:00.120]  the judge stated, to constitute child porn. And so that the entire search warrant for the man's
[3:56:00.120 --> 3:56:07.160]  house, the oncologist's house, was thrown out as well as any evidence that was found in that search,
[3:56:07.160 --> 3:56:10.920]  meaning the hundreds of pictures of child porn. Now in legal terms, this is legal circles,
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:16.760]  this is known as through to the poison tree. This is known as getting evidence off of a search warrant
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:23.800]  that you can't admit that you can't admit. So no warrant would have been needed originally because
[3:56:23.800 --> 3:56:32.440]  he consented to their search of his desktop. However, the search warrant that they later got
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:40.680]  for his house, the judge said, didn't constitute a child porn filing. And so this guy, for the last
[3:56:40.680 --> 3:56:45.880]  six years, has been fighting this case. And now thanks to the intervention of the George Soros
[3:56:45.880 --> 3:56:50.600]  Foundation, right, this electronic frontiers foundation, it's been thrown out and he walks
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:58.120]  away a free man. This is what happens to justice in our society. This is what happens when we
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:04.840]  actually catch someone like this, one of these sickos and try to put them behind bars, George Soros
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:10.040]  and his cronies in these, in these, you know, saying they're just protecting the digital rights of
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:15.800]  people. Well, excuse me, I don't think that child pornography is a digital rights. And I'm not
[3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:21.320]  exactly sure why George Soros foundations are being listened to by the halls of our government.
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:24.920]  But that is the fight that we're in. And this is the kind of story that you're not going to hear
[3:57:24.920 --> 3:57:29.880]  covered on CNN. You're not going to hear covered on so many of these mainstream media sites. And
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:35.080]  that is why you come here, you come here for the stories about what's really going on in our country
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:40.840]  and getting into the actual issues of what we need to do to fix our nation.

[3:59:03.800 --> 3:59:11.320]  simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot
[3:59:11.320 --> 3:59:16.440]  who's pro America, pro capitalism and pro freedom who at the same time is tolerant.
[3:59:17.080 --> 3:59:22.680]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are
[3:59:22.680 --> 3:59:28.600]  the anti-liberal. To defend free speech, meet like minded friends and promote freedom worldwide.
