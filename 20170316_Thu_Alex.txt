[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  This is the heart of 1760.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about growing up in the White House.
[00:25.000 --> 00:32.000]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.000]  From the front lines of the Info World, it's Alex Jones.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  No!
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  You want a trap? You want a trap?
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please almost stop.
[01:13.000 --> 01:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the 16th day of March 2017. It is Thursday.
[01:23.000 --> 01:34.000]  We have stories that are so incredible today that are so amazingly clarifying it makes my head swim.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  We have footage from Florida. I saw this yesterday after the show.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  Made phone calls, looked it up, confirmed it really happened.
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  A congressman goes into the VA 50 plus days after Trump's in, supposed to be up within a week.
[01:47.000 --> 01:58.000]  And they admit, no, we're not putting up the head of the Veterans Department and the head of the country, Trump, like you're supposed to.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  The congressman puts it up, a security guard comes over and threatens but then backs off.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  Of course, the congressman is a veteran who had both his legs blown off at the knees in Afghanistan.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  And they pulled it down the next day. It's pulled down.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  So they put it up on Tuesday. It was pulled down on Wednesday.
[02:18.000 --> 02:27.000]  Now Fox News obviously picks it up today and just look, this is the open rebellion of the bureaucracy and the scumbags that have hijacked this country.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  Just like this federal judge that came out, look, it was iron tight.
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  What happened, you know, a month ago with his travel ban, a five-year-old could read the law and see the president has way more power than what he even did.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  But the night circuit, the same one that's banned the American flag in schools, and now I guess football games in California.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  Now it's getting banned in Texas too, because it's offensive in American flag.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  This sounds like a joke, doesn't it?
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  Trump has come out and said this is total lawlessness.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  I suspect to have the exact quote right here. We're going to play the video coming up from his latest rally.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  Got a live rally going right now. It's linked on inforwars.com as well.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Judge blocking new immigration order is unprecedented judicial overreach.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  That's putting it lightly.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  This is bureaucratic mutiny, and it's happening all over where they just ignore what Trump says.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  But the thousands of phone calls he's made, thousands a week, quite frankly, hundreds a day to business owners and foreign corporations
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  and everybody else in the announcement that they're going to turn the electricity prices back down through free market and so much more,
[03:36.000 --> 03:45.000]  has created in 55 days better numbers than we saw in 1984 in the Reagan recovery that took three years to get launched.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  It's unbelievable.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  And then there's a paradox though of the globalists openly saying they're raising interest rates to stall Trump.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  That's in the news. And to block America becoming preeminent again, and the American people becoming wealthy again,
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  because the globalists, they have a grand plan and we're not in it.
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  A middle class, a free country that made us so great, that American reboot, they believe they're going to block.
[04:09.000 --> 04:20.000]  And so the fight is 5,000 more times electric than when I would go watch Dallas Cowboy games when I was in middle school and high school
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  and I just thought it was so important that they get that fuel goal and oh yeah, they got the fuel goal.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  This really counts folks, okay?
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  And I just can't believe more people aren't in the game, because this is a game where we're all on the field.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  Just got incredible chills. Wow, it's amazing time to be alive. This is incredible.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  But I got to tell you, I'm so honored to be at the heart with you, the listeners of this broadcast,
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  of the true resistance and the real detonator in the American reboot.
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  Talk, you need to know what you've done. You were the detonator that's already shattered the enemy.
[04:52.000 --> 05:18.000]  They're trying to regroup. We've got to press the attack. Huge news straight ahead.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge declaring the state legally require Roundup to warn its consumers of the potential to cause cancer.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Remember this from a Monsanto lobbyist.
[05:35.000 --> 05:42.000]  Do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer. You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  You want to drink some? We have some here.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  I'd be happy to actually. Not really, but...
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  It's not the truth. It's dangerous to humans.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  No, it's not. So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate? No, I'm not an idiot.
[05:53.000 --> 06:21.000]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's Roundup. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[06:41.000 --> 06:51.000]  Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, the ethical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans need to see this film.
[06:56.000 --> 07:25.000]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[07:27.000 --> 07:36.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research that puts together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  We use only the highest-quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[07:49.000 --> 07:59.000]  If you wish to find Deep Cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  This will be a day long remembered.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  Every day now is a day long remembered, because so much is happening on the side of good and the side of evil.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  It's Thursday, already the 16th day of March 2017, as we move forward into the future.
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  But we have some guests coming up today, and I'll tell you about those a little bit later. But before I go anywhere, look at the story that is from CNN.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  It's one of the top links on DrudgeReport.com.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  You see, now they're using the proper words.
[09:06.000 --> 09:20.000]  This is lawyer games. The New York Times on January 20th, 2017 had the headline that wiretaps picked up Trump officials talking to the Russians.
[09:20.000 --> 09:34.000]  A wiretap is a 1980s and before term, when they would put a tap on the physical copper wire, either at the phone switch system, or at your house, or somewhere in between.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  It's digital hubs since then, ladies and gentlemen, fiber optic.
[09:39.000 --> 09:48.000]  And they simply redirect that system into a recorded data bank.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  Now, they think you're stupid and have no memory.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  Like Gruber said, thank God you're so dumb.
[09:55.000 --> 10:10.000]  Notice Trump in his latest speech, we're going to play clips of it later at one of his rallies last night, brought up Gruber and said, oh, remember Gruber, Obamacare, he thinks you're dumb.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  See, Trump's key, he brings up the big times they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  He brings up the greatest hits of their corruption, just like we do.
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  You've got to continue to remember a memory is one of the most important things to be free, to be successful, and to be prosperous.
[10:28.000 --> 10:38.000]  Everything the globalists do is to annihilate the process of a memory, the process of learning to train your mind to remember important things.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  And it's our job as info warriors, as nationalists, as patriots, to remind folks of that.
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.000]  And remember, they're playing games now, not just with words, and not just with our memories, but with how they arrange the words.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  Angelina Jolie went to the UN as a UN envoy from the US.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  She's been fired from that position.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Her dad's a good guy. She's a monster.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  And said, nationalism can't be confused with patriotism.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  Nationalism can't be confused with patriotism and said, it's bad.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  Patriotism is nationalism, and she knows that.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  But they're turning that into a dirty word, ladies and gentlemen, just like the Ninth Circuit said, you can't have American flags in public schools.
[11:23.000 --> 11:33.000]  And I saw three articles yesterday out of three different states where at football games, basketball games, you know, you name it, people are filing lawsuits, you name it, getting upset,
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  getting angry, demanding that they not see American flags at school events, other flags be taken down.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  I mean, it's just all over the nose.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  People say, that doesn't make sense. You're allowed to have a country.
[11:47.000 --> 11:56.000]  Oh, no, they make it dirty acting like Trump's this weird crazy person that he thinks we should run our own country and shouldn't have some secret TPP negotiated and secret over the last decade,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  part of it written by Hillary Clinton to just suddenly have Obama sign it, Congress can't read it, and then we're under it.
[12:01.000 --> 12:11.000]  Trump said, I use your false executive order to destroy the treaty, pull out of the treaty and send it back to Congress where treaties are supposed to go, a devastating victory.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  And let's remember what he did the first two days in office.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  But let's go to this article.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[12:21.000 --> 12:32.000]  Headline should be House committee returns to reality admits Trump was being surveilled.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  But CNN gives you this dry, no big deal headline line.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  See, it's not called war tapping. It's called surveillance. It's called intercepts.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's called data going through the big hubs being recorded. Everything the president does is recorded.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  Everything the incoming president does, president elect does is recorded.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  Every foreign phone call is publicly recorded and analyzed by 17 intelligence agencies.
[12:57.000 --> 13:05.000]  It is absolutely hardwired into the system, incontrovertible, like the sun rising and setting.
[13:05.000 --> 13:14.000]  100% undebatable. It's like debating that the color red isn't red.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  It's crazy.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  So remember the New York Times, January 20th, Roger Stone, Manafort, all of them are Russian agents.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  We've got the intercepts. We've got the wiretaps.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  And we've got the transcripts. We've got the total proof.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And everybody's like Manafort and Stoner like, we never talked to the Russians about stuff.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  What are you talking about? Release it then.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  I want to go before the Senate committee. Oh, here's some polonium.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Oh, here, let us T-bone your car so you can be dead.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  We have the event and claim that, you know, the hearing and claim that you're this Russian agent.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  But here it is.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  They're all recorded.
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  But they're supposed to, with the digital systems, block out the name on the file of the audiophile or video file.
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  This is law when it's the president and it's picked up another intercepts or top officials carrying out waffle duties
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  of the United States because you're not supposed to be surveilling the internal people in the U.S. without a warrant.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  But if it's overseas, they claim no warrant needed.
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  So they spy overseas at the big British NSA hub there in England, one of the biggest in the world.
[14:27.000 --> 14:35.000]  They pass it all back to Obama who circumvented the chain of command so that he himself could have all the data and pass it on to the DNC.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  And then the New York Times brags about it, is leaked the info, and then has the nerve to come out and say,
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  Trump's insane.
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  There were never any wiretaps when their own headlines, the Washington Post's own headlines, CNN's own headlines, all of a sudden.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  And I know you know this, but for me, it's crazy to watch Congress go along with this and say,
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  we're going to have investigations, Trump has no proof.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  That's what McCain says.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  When the House Intelligence Committee head said, no, we've got all the intercepts, we've got all the recordings, we've got all the transcripts, everything.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And there's nothing there.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  They're not talking to Russians until Flynn, December 15th, is told, line up phone calls for the president-elect to talk to the Russians.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Remember?
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  They're in the news.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  Trump said, I'm going to be talking to Putin in the next two weeks.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  It was being set up.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  That's normal.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  The president's allowed to talk to whoever he wants to.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  But McCain thinks you're an idiot.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  McCain thinks you're a moron.
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  He can meet with the Russian ambassador's member he wants, but Senator Sessions can, even though he was higher ranking on the Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  So here it is.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Unmasking is what it's called.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  That's unmasking of the surveillance.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Surveillance.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Surveillance.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  Rachel Maddow.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Surveillance.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  Glenn Beck saying that none of this happened.
[16:02.000 --> 16:12.000]  All of you, neocons and neolibs, you're disgusting and you've been caught again because anybody that knows how this works, what's even declassified for decades knows the process.
[16:12.000 --> 16:19.000]  It's all in stone.
[16:19.000 --> 16:34.000]  Now, the big news that ties into this, and I'm getting into all the other news and it's massive, is that yesterday, the full clips on infowars.com, John McCain went into the Senate to try to bypass rules if no one objected.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  That's how they got the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and the income tax in 1913.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  Other stuff, remember three senators on December 23rd, everybody was gone for Christmas.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  They came and said no one objected.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  So then they passed it because they were the chairman of the committees.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  Same deal.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  McCain sneaks into the Senate.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  And of course, Paul's got to have people constantly watching C-SPAN, constantly having his aides watching and say, sir, sir, sir.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  That's why all the time you get congressmen or senators on, they've got to run, especially if they're high ranking, because they've got to go vote or object.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  To what's being rammed through.
[17:09.000 --> 17:21.000]  So McCain runs in with a treaty that openly sends in billions of weapons and U.S. troops and declares that NATO will attack Russia if it continues to be in Ukraine, which has been Russian for 500 years and reportedly is pretty much where Russia started.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  I mean, it's undoubtedly Russian.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  Okay.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  Ukraine's gone back and forth.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  The other parts more Germanic and they've always been killing each other and it's two different tribes.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  The Germans split it into the Russians split it into it's been going on for hundreds of years.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  He knows you're ignorant or he thinks you're ignorant.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  He knows his constituents are.
[17:40.000 --> 17:47.000]  And so he runs in and can tell in the body language we were watching the video at infohorses.com.
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  We're about to play it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  We're going to play the whole clip right now.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  He gets angry and says, oh, if you object, it means you're working for the Russians.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  If you object, you know, really, really shows who you are.
[18:00.000 --> 18:09.000]  And then Senator Paul just simply says, yes, yes, I object to you just passing this through without having a full hearing or, you know, full committee.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  So it could then go to a full vote.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  We're going to have some new process here, McCain.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  And McCain goes, that's it.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Respond, respond.
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  The fact that you won't defend it because Rand Paul's walking out shows that you are an agent of Putin and work for him.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  He actually says you work for Putin at the end.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  It's incredible.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  And if you watch C-SPAN, you know full well, constantly for hours, especially when a lot of lawmaking is going on.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  Is this personal pop-up of no one objects?
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  If no one objects, it slips through.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  Or I object.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  I object.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  I don't have little debates about it sometimes.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  But most of the time, if you're busy, like Rand Paul is a professional doctor, it's screwing around.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  I mean, he is very effective.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  Not at his rhetoric so much, but what he gets done, he's one of the best senators we've seen in decades.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  And a patriot.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Amazing.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  I wish he was part of the administration.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  But the point is, and they're starting a little bit close to each other, so that's good.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  These are allies made for each other.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  They both lead a liberty movement.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  We need them.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  And so that's starting to happen.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  Skip the break.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Skip this break for a new listener.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  I skipped a lot of breaks.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  I can't help it.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  And those are network break, though.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  It's not the local station breaks.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  They, you know, they get their sponsorship.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  But expanding on this, this is a whole new level of deception.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Everything McCain says is a lie.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  Oh, this is just the thing to be nice to Ukraine and help it and it got attacked and it's terrible and blah, blah, blah.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  George Soros funded billions.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  The State Department funded five billion.
[19:30.000 --> 19:37.000]  We have powers and all of them at the State Department bragging three years ago that they overthrew Ukraine and the elected government,
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  burned down large parts of cities, started a civil war, started pressing towards the Russian border,
[19:43.000 --> 19:52.000]  and the Russians did send in humanitarian and military for a small area to secure their pipeline that goes out to the Black Sea and out to some other facilities.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  And then they say, I'm a Russian agent because I know the facts and researched it.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  No.
[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  Senator Rand Paul understands this is an act of war on Russia's doorstep when George Soros and John McCain and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry
[20:09.000 --> 20:16.000]  and the normal, usual suspects that funded Al Qaeda, funded ISIS, went and met with the groups, destabilized the Middle East,
[20:16.000 --> 20:25.000]  Africa, blew up Libya, blew up Egypt, a huge civil war, hundreds of thousands dead in Syria.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  They're not trying to start a war with Russia.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  McCain has always said he wants to war with Russia.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  This is a big New Brzezinski plan.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  It's totally insane.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  It's totally out of control.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  Russia is not expansionist.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  It's China that is.
[20:38.000 --> 20:44.000]  It's openly threatening to nuke the United States three times so far this week in official government announcements.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  They're threatening to nuke our aircraft carriers.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  They're threatening to blow up South Korea.
[20:48.000 --> 21:00.000]  Kim Jong-un is firing missiles that crash right off the coast of Japan, threatening to nuke Tokyo with what is it, 20 million people.
[21:00.000 --> 21:13.000]  And then Senator Paul runs in to block it so that he just can't bring it to a full vote without debate and committee hearings with his known war mongering treaty that starts war with Russia.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  It's basically a declaration of war with Russia.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  That's what Republican analysts, Democratic analysts have all said.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  It's the closest to World War Three we've ever been if this happens.
[21:21.000 --> 21:28.000]  This isn't like the Russians moving missiles into Cuba because we move missiles, you know, nukes, medium-range nukes into Turkey.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  This is right up on the border, folks.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  And Russia has said it's a red line.
[21:34.000 --> 21:49.000]  And so here comes Senator Paul and this monster, John McCain, has the nerve, the anti-gun open borders piece of trash, has the nerve to then call him an agent of Putin at the end.
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  He goes from saying, don't be manipulated, don't work for Putin, you know, don't help Putin.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  And then he finally says, oh, that's it.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  You didn't debate me.
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  You scurried off knowing that when they play that on the news, the general public doesn't watch C-SPAN and doesn't know how.
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  Especially in the Senate, those guys are playing games all the time.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  It's just like a football game or a chess game.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  If somebody isn't looking, you can carry the ball across if you're a senior member of the Senate like John McCain is.
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  And most of the senators are getting lazy and won't actually be up there 18 hours a day.
[22:22.000 --> 22:32.000]  Rand Paul is routinely up there when stuff's going on, 18 hours a day, like a doctor, professionally in there with his patient, the country, trying to save it, literally.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  In there just battling, battling, battling.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  He sees that patient, blocks McCain, leaves.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  McCain acts like he's a coward and is a Russian agent.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  This is such an escalation.
[22:42.000 --> 22:49.000]  I cannot describe in words how dangerous this is and how unhinged McCain is and how pissed he is that he's not getting his war with Russia.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  But he's been going to Ukraine trying to start a war.
[22:52.000 --> 23:02.000]  Remember just two weeks ago, he got chumped when a famous Ukrainian prankster called him and pretended to be the prime minister of Ukraine.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  And there's McCain on tape saying, yeah, we want to start a war.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  We want to attack the Russians for you right now.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  I'm trying to get troops in there right now.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  I'm trying to get President Trump to go along with this, but who knows what he'll do.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.000]  It's like a 10 minute conversation.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  You can go listen to the whole thing.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  It's John McCain.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  He admits it's him.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  He's crazy, completely out of his mind.
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.000]  He just a month ago came scurrying back from Syria because Trump is blowing up the ISIS al-Qaeda forces.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  He ran to meet with them and promised them to hold on.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  We're going to try to block this.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  I mean, the guy is like a super villain.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  He is a super villain.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  I think he's so crazy.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  He actually believes he's helping this country.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  He's nuts.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  He's nuts.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Him and him and him and Lindsey Graham reportedly blackmailed too.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  I mean, they're just super dangerous.
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  And let me tell you, if they get in control of this country, people like Trump and myself and others are in deep trouble.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  Let me tell you, McCain didn't play in games.
[23:55.000 --> 24:02.000]  In fact, if I got to point fingers at somebody that I think is behind the 50 plus dead Russians and these black ops quads around the world and rogue groups,
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  John McCain's going to point the finger because he said he wants war with Russia.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  He wants covert action and he's involved in all sorts of deep state stuff.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  And President Trump knows John McCain is the main enemy of this country right now.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  President Trump knows it's not Soros. It's not Hillary anymore.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  It's John McCain.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  John McCain.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  Next is Paul Ryan.
[24:24.000 --> 24:32.000]  And notice, it's his own stinking, traitorous, disgusting party that has this big screw job, you know, the so-called Obamacare fix it.
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  They know Trump's going to rock in a hard place because if they don't do this, it'll implode the whole economy because Obamacare is even worse than the Zion do that.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  But if he doesn't, then he'll be blamed for not repealing it and he may not have the votes.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  So is Trump right or is he wrong?
[24:46.000 --> 24:55.000]  I think he rallies the troops and gets with Senator Paul and we kill the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel.
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  But right now let's go to this unprecedented John McCain yesterday in the Senate, yesterday evening, here it is.
[25:03.000 --> 25:16.000]  President, if there is objection, and I note the Senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this, if there is objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  You're achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small country that has already been the subject of attempt to come.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  You overthrew it.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  No idea.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  They started it.
[25:27.000 --> 25:40.000]  Why anyone would object to this, except that I will say, if they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that-
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  Is there objection?
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  Is Senator from Kentucky?
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  I object.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Objection is heard.
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  Mr. President, I note this Senator from Kentucky leaving the floor.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  The place is empty.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  He sneaks in to do this.
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  The Senator runs in, defeats it, leaves, and again he calls him a coward.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  And remember, they're having a meeting to add Montenegro into NATO.
[26:12.000 --> 26:21.000]  And basically what this new treaty will do, that he's trying to pass through, would have 80% of Ukraine that the Russians aren't in just handed into NATO,
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  so NATO could then come in and have a war with Russia.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  And McCain says he wants to go kick Russia out of eastern Ukraine.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  I mean, it's just totally insane, because that's been part of Russia for 500 years, off and on.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  So, let's go back to the amazing clip.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  Act. Objection is heard.
[26:45.000 --> 26:56.000]  Mr. President, I note this Senator from Kentucky leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action that he has just taken.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  That is really remarkable.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  Good pause.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  Again, stunt after stunt after stunt after stunt.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's totally normal.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  He's been in the Senate for 20 plus years, or longer.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  McCain knows how this works.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  He sees that every day.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  Oh my gosh, he just ran out of here.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  He won't even defend it.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  Unbelievable.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Trying to manipulate the audience.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  Let's go back to the clip.
[27:19.000 --> 27:28.000]  Leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action that he has just taken.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  That is really remarkable.
[27:31.000 --> 27:49.000]  That a Senator blocking a treaty that is supported by the overwhelming number, perhaps 98 at least of his colleagues, would come to the front and object and walk away and walk away.
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[27:55.000 --> 28:07.000]  He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  So I repeat again, the Center from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  That's not true.
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  Not having war with Russia after you and Soros and Obama overturned an elected government.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Grab all the oil fields and gas fields.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  Hogged it all.
[28:27.000 --> 28:35.000]  Let Senator Biden, Vice President Biden's son take over the biggest gas company and keep it for himself.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  I mean, this is just insane.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  But it is McCain.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Putin.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  You hear that?
[28:44.000 --> 28:54.000]  And in a two minute clip, he goes from saying you're now going along with the wishes and goals of Putin to you're working for him.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  See, and now the president's working for him.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  I'm working for him.
[28:56.000 --> 29:09.000]  We're all working for Putin because we don't want to work with the Nazi collaborator who tried to crash the pound, who's tried to crash our dollar, who's trying to cause wars, who funded the Arab Spring to put radical jihadis in 30 plus countries now.
[29:09.000 --> 29:17.000]  And because we don't want to go into Crimea and start a war with Russia, we're all, see, we're not Americans.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  We don't have birthrights.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  We don't care about the country.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  We don't want to make it great.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  We're all Russians.
[29:22.000 --> 29:30.000]  No, you're an agent of al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia and the communist Chinese and you want to get us pinned down and protracted crisis in the east.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  You are a traitor, John McCain.
[29:32.000 --> 29:41.000]  You are a communist Chinese agent who covered for Hillary and all the stuff she did, you're part of the Keating Five, you're part of a crime network that is bringing this country down.
[29:41.000 --> 30:10.000]  You're a communist Chinese globalist agent and need to be arrested for high treason by President Trump.
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  In a new lawsuit, Monsanto has been accused of manipulating research to hide the dangers of roundup.
[30:15.000 --> 30:25.000]  Yolanda Mendoza, a regular user of roundup with stage four cancer, is one of hundreds suing Monsanto, citing a World Health Organization study that says Glyphosate is probably carcinogenic.
[30:25.000 --> 30:33.000]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge declaring the state legally require roundup to warn its consumers of the potential to cause cancer.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  Remember this from a Monsanto lobbyist.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  We believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  You want to drink some? We have some here.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  I'd be happy to, actually. Not really, but...
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  That's the truth.
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's dangerous.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  It's not dangerous to humans. No, it's not.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's roundup.
[30:57.000 --> 31:21.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.

[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  Oh yeah, my friends, some heads are going to roll.
[33:48.000 --> 33:57.000]  So John McCain, the globalist, the guy that got us into NAFTA and GATT wants your guns and wants open borders and the TPP and then the public to be able to see it.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  And wants the EU to expand all through the border countries of Russia.
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  Funding the radical jihadis and actually meeting with al-Qaeda al-Nusra leaders who launched the civil war that killed 300,000 plus mainly Christians and non-radical Muslims in Syria.
[34:14.000 --> 34:22.000]  Why he says that Senator Rand Paul now is working directly for Putin.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  What an incredible statement.
[34:24.000 --> 34:34.000]  And by the way, they have rules in the Senate about what you're allowed to say to other senators that's even stronger in the house. There should be massive censure of John McCain.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  But he's a spoiled thug who's allowed to rip people off in stock scams 30 years ago.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  He's been involved with the missile secrets to communist China.
[34:43.000 --> 34:56.000]  Every dirty sellout of the country, that monster and his monster Democrat wife and his monster Democrat family have just been there, wrecking this country as traders from day one.
[34:56.000 --> 35:03.000]  And in the Hanoi Hilton, it's well documented that he turned on everybody day ones, gave them all the codes, ratted everybody out.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  They call him a hero.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  He's no hero.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  People that were there call him a trader.
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  That's right.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  Hanoi McCain.
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  Hanoi Hilton McCain.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  I've got a lot of other news.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  I want to get to this really important, but let's play that clip.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  We've just joined us one more time.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  They start the war in Ukraine.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  They know half the population or more is Russian.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  They overthrow the government.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  They try to drive the Russians out.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  They start ethnic cleansing.
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.000]  The Russians come in to protect their infrastructure and people and then McCain runs around thinking you're dumb and says Putin did it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  And now because our own military and anybody's a thinking person doesn't want to start a war with Russia when they're not expanding.
[35:47.000 --> 35:56.000]  House Intel Committee seeks names of Obama officials who requested unmasking of Americans picked up on surveillance.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  Oh, Trump was under surveillance and Obama ordered it.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  That's already known, but they think you're dumb and say again, Trump's crazy.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  But here is John McCain, enemy number one of this country right now.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Enemy number one.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  He's the one.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  He's the top of the spear against our heart, against our Republic returning right now.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  He's the face of Sauron.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  Here he is.
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[36:22.000 --> 36:32.000]  He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  It is under assault from the Russians.
[36:34.000 --> 36:40.000]  So I repeat again, the center from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  Wow, let's translate that.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  I'm a piece of garbage who thinks I'm invincible.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  I've been in power so long, unlike the VA employees in Florida who 50-something days later wouldn't put up the president's new picture.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  It's normally done within days.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  And then the congressman came and put it up himself, both his legs blown off in Afghanistan.
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  They take it down right after he leaves and brag about it and tweet that he's not their president.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  Open arrogance by these dirtbags.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  VA hospital refuses to hang photo of president.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  Army Ranger Congressman makes on the spot correction.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  It's now been removed.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  As of today, we have an article up on infowars.com.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  No wonder they won't give you health care.
[37:20.000 --> 37:28.000]  No wonder because, I mean, literally, you see some 400-pound security guard just saying,
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  come over to the congressman and start getting in their face saying you can't hang that.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  They say, yeah, we are. They leave. They take it down.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  And they're not going to put one up until they're all fired.
[37:36.000 --> 37:44.000]  The leadership at that facility needs to have their asses handed to them today.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  The vice president is the one that should handle it with the head of veterans affairs.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  They wouldn't hang his picture up either.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  They need to march their butts in there and call them in there and chew them out and say,
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  who's behind this and find out and say, you're fired and your name's being put out in the news.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Bunch of bullies.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  Sick of these people.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  Oh, Snoop Dogg's nephew says he wants to kidnap Milani and put her into sex slavery.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  And the media is like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  Because it's cool. It's liberal, you know, sex slavery, like Islam.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  Bow-wow. Bow-wow needs to take a bow.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Where'd bow-wow go? Bow-wow fell down.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  Bow-wow wanted to talk about kidnapping women and putting them into sex slavery.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  His uncle wants to talk about killing Trump and trying to organize it.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  Oh, look what happened to Bow-wow's uncle.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  He's so tough. He walks around and says, he's a creep.
[38:40.000 --> 38:49.000]  We're so scared. We're so scared of you, Snoop.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Just keep pushing.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Oh, Michael Savage got attacked, beat up in front of witnesses. His dog attacked.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  He was on the news. TMZ confirmed it.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  But the national media said pro-Trump radio host Michael Savage claims he was assaulted while having dinner with his toy poodle.
[39:05.000 --> 39:12.000]  Oh, and Trump claims he's the president, too. They're saying he didn't rule you elected.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  TMZ called it a melee, but admitted he was attacked and his dog attacked.
[39:16.000 --> 39:26.000]  Our article got it right. Michael Savage attacked during dinner outing for supporting Trump, anti-Trump lunatic assaults radio host.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Because there are a bunch of cowards and fools and want to be gang members.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  And I mean black, white, old, young. It's a gang. It's a cult like the Nazis.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Incredible. Of course, he was on that very day with us. Top link on Drudge.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  Millions of people read about it, saw the videos.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  And they came and started screaming, you support Trump, you support Trump.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  And then reportedly multiple people got involved attacking him when Savage fought back.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  Because, see, Savage doesn't have a right to go in the restaurant and eat dinner.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  I've had him come over to me. One guy slapped me on the back of the head thinking he was going to set me up to fight.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  And I said, oh, you're really tough. Have people knocked my drink cover?
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  And go boo, boo, boo. He's someone on video when I'm in DC. Boo, boo, boo.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  You know, fascist. Oh, you know the word fascist? Boo. Like booing at me.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  Oh my God, I'm going to give up. You booed at me.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  Oh my gosh, you booed.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  I mean, Google just took our advertising away.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  That's 3.3 million last year in money we brought in.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  It was going to be about 5 million this year.
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  I mean, if they blew up 5 million in money we were going to bring in.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  That's a king's ransom. I don't even care. Good.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Everybody's segwaying away from Google advertising now.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  And I already learned that censorship was happening.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  People are exiting the systems that are even better.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  They will destroy themselves by censoring us, but we're going to be there every step of the way
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  using their platforms to reach the people with the truth.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  We're going to use their systems to reach out to the zombies
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  and unlock their minds to the big war that's happening.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  This history is happening.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  Globalism is a complete and utter wicked anti-human monopoly system.
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.000]  And if folks knew the facts, there's no way anybody would be on the side of the globalist.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  But they've got dumbed down people, folks.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  After Sharia Night Live came out Saturday and said that I was deeply racist and all this crap,
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  I saw it all over the web suddenly. Why didn't Alex Jones like black people?
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  Why didn't he think Denzel Washington's as good as him? What?
[41:29.000 --> 41:37.000]  But see, delusionalids think if Alec Baldwin says Alex Jones said that, it must be true.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  Or if the homeland character, they admit supposedly me, says the stuff I say
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  and then adds lies to it, it must be true.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  This is the total reprobate, bottomless corrupt evil of these people
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  and they're preying on the dumbest zombies out there.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Can you imagine being so discredited from reality?
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  You go, I like to kidnap the first lady and put her into sex slavery and make her work for me.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  And then Viacom Force feeds that to young people and young women and liberals
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  think radical Islam and gangster rap enslaving women.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  So they've been 10 men a day in the dirty mattress and putting cigarettes out on them
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  and finally shooting them in the back of the head and throwing them in a river.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  That's how you pimp so good.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  Oh, it's so manly to swagger around and have no responsibility
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  and just use dumbed down stupid women and other people as you act tough.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  And then you see 4,000 people shot in Chicago last year, almost all of them black, over 2,000 deaths.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  You don't say a word about that because you pimp so good for some of the redstone.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  How you pimp so good, Bow Wow.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  Bow Wow gets the war Bow Wow wants.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  And over there in Cripville, it'll be a lot worse than the blood's coming after you.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  Not a million times worse, but I get it, you're a tough guy.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  You act like a man, a little boy's world and you think kidnapping people's wives
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  and putting them into sex slavery is cool.
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  Well, let's just say I bet you're going to have some bad luck.
[43:13.000 --> 43:26.000]  Someday when you're not expecting and I think the good Lord is going to visit some justice on Bow Wow.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  I think Bow Wow.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  What's that name they got for zombies?
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  They got a show. It's called The Walking Dead.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  Let me get back to the news here.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  Oh, look, the House Intel Committee admits that, oh, they were.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  The government was spying on Trump.
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  Oh, but they call it picked up on surveillance.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  Now, oh, Trump was a liar again.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  No, completely right again.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  And the same committee again says, yeah, we've seen all the intelligence,
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  not even phone calls to the Russians till they're president-elect.
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  What you're supposed to do.
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  So let's go to Rand Paul's response to John McCain saying that he actually now works for Putin.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  You work.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  Everybody's a Russian agent now.
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  Man, thank God that Russian agent worked with Trump to get the coal power turned back on.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  The coal miners get their jobs back in Kentucky.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  Thank you, Russia.
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  By the way, you know who's going to get hurt the most by the coal deal here in the United States?
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  Do you know who's going to get hurt the worst by the coal deal here in the United States, the Russians?
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  The main export they have is natural gas.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  Europe doesn't have coal like we do anymore.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  We have it, ship it to them. They've got the systems.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  It will drive down gas prices.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  Oh, by the way, gas prices are the lowest they've been in 20 years basically right now.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  And they're still going down to less than $2 per British cubic foot or whatever they call it.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  Trump just did something that will decimate the Russians in their financing.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  Oh, my, oh, why did a Russian agent do that?
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  McCain, you're the enemy of this country.
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  You're the whore that sold us out to 100 different institutions and groups.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  And you're the one that'll pay you little coward.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  And you know it. And you feel it.
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  You thought you had this country for decades.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  Just running wild. Do whatever you want.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  It won't go on forever.
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  And you can see the end of it now with populism and nationalism rising everywhere.
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.000]  And you'll never put the genie back in the bottle, McCain, because now you've been identified and your types have.
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  Now, I wonder how they ever have a private global corporate government and then deny it existed.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  See, we forced it out in the open.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  Here's your Senator McCain's response.
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  No, no, here is the response.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  Senator McCain from Rand Paul.
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  Well, you know, I think he makes a really, really strong case, you know, for term limits.
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  I think maybe he's passed his prime.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged.
[46:07.000 --> 46:15.000]  I do think that I do think that when we talk about NATO, there can be a rational discussion about the pros and cons of expanding it.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  We currently have troops, combat troops in about six nations.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  We have troops actively just stationed in probably a couple dozen others.
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  We have a $20 debt.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  And one of my favorite articles of the last couple of years was one that talked about the angry McCain's.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  And if we put active troops and got involved in combat where McCain wants us to be,
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  they put a little angry McCain on the globe, on the map, and it's virtually everywhere.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  So his foreign policy is something that would greatly endanger the United States, greatly over extend us.
[46:48.000 --> 46:58.000]  And there has to be the thought whether or not it's in our national interest to pledge to get involved with war if Montenegro has an altercation with anyone.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  That's right. There's some YouTube glitch when you download these videos now.
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  And it's happening to other people, not just us.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  It like does a second pause.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  We're not editing these videos.
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  These are unedited.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  They're just have these glitches now.
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  We're trying to find a workaround, but we've looked on the message boards in other places.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  If somebody knows, please let us know at Showtipsandinforwards.com.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  But getting back to this, yeah, we have to have a debate.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  We have to have armed service committee discussions.
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  We have to talk to the ambassadors.
[47:23.000 --> 47:36.000]  We can't just have McCain pass a bill for a treaty to bring Ukraine that's in a civil war that John McCain literally quarterbacked with Hillary and Obama and George Soros all bragging about it on CNN.
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  We have clips of them all bragging.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  They go start a horrible war.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  They should be getting arrested.
[47:41.000 --> 47:50.000]  And then people that aren't insane, like President Trump, Senator Paul, go, no, we're not going to do that.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  No, we're not.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  Russia has said that if they stabilize the country, they'll even pull out of the small area they're in in Ukraine that's around the Russian border.
[47:58.000 --> 48:08.000]  Most of the country's already been overrun by the globalists and they have all sorts of weapons and paramilitary troops and EU forces, NATO forces have been fighting Russians for years there.
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.000]  There's already a ground war going on.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  And you look at the map, 80% of the country is being run by the West.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  And the Russians have put up parameters along rivers and strategic points right there and are holding them at that point.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  And McCain just wants to roll in and have a war with Russia and they've got these generals that go on Fox News.
[48:29.000 --> 48:41.000]  You can Google it and say, the answer you crave is attack the Russians, even in Russia and a bunch of body bags, just like Operation Barbarossa in 1942.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  I mean, it's the same craziness.
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  Why?
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  What is Russia even doing?
[48:45.000 --> 48:53.000]  It's because the globalists don't want any other power structure they don't control and they made deals with China and they moved our jobs at China and they're making money off China.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  China they've at least are partially in bed with.
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.000]  But meanwhile, China's double crossing them announcing deployment of Marines all over the world and submarines all over the cruise missiles to attack the U.S.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  And, you know, is breaking all their agreements.
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  So this stuff's really degenerating very, very quickly.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  All right, I've got a bunch of news I want to get to here.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  Federal judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[49:18.000 --> 49:24.000]  Violent threats against the president are okay now, that's the hill tying into Bow Wow and all the rest of it.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  Natural gas prices, plunged below, or about to punch low $2, mutiny at VA hospital.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  I'm going to go into details on that.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  Soros, fueling unrest at Macedonia now.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Try to bring the Muslims in there.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  They already got Albanian Kosovo now they want that.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  This guy is literally allied with the radical Muslims.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  I mean, he's just horrible.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  You can't make this up.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Look at James Bond villain.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  Turkey claims they run Europe now.
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  They're threatening, quote, official Ergun and his top minister claim.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  Holy Wars will soon begin in Europe.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  They say they have the sleeper cells to now blow up and burn up Europe and that Europe is weak.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  They're going to take it down.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  And, of course, the socialists brought him in and now Turkey's declaring it's going to conquer Europe.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  This is out of their mouths now.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  Just crazed people on power trips like McCain and Ergun who've been in power so long.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  They're like, we're invincible.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  We'll do everything.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  We'll just take over.
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  And Ergun says they've already had to pull US nuclear weapons out of in the last year.
[50:21.000 --> 50:27.000]  Obama was forced to do it out of bases there because Ergun was talking about seizing them.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Start a war with the United States, Ergun, and seize the nuclear weapons.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  You lunatic.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  Oh, I forgot.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  I must be a Russian agent.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  A Putin agent because I don't want to have war either.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  These people are crazy.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  They're completely out of control.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is the exact climate you see before World Wars.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And all the mainline analysts are saying that.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  But McCain doesn't care.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Soros doesn't care.
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  Hillary doesn't care because they're all demonic, twisted, filthy piles of trash.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  Stay with us.

[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.

[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  That's the good news. We've got the initiative.
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  And that's why they're panicking because they know their end is near politically.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  We hadn't had to fire a shot.
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  The last refuge of tyrants is war when they're hanging on by their fingernails.
[54:42.000 --> 54:50.000]  I got too many friends because they read the papers and they want to be seen with me.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  And again, I'm not saying that to bracket those just the way the point is.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  They intimidate you. They want to make you feel like you can't be politically involved.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  They want to stifle you because they know we're at the tipping point and we're winning.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  They're bullies. They're using peer pressure.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  This is such a critical time.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  We have the thinkers. They have the stinkers.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up again into all the news I'm about to mention.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  Some of them I hit, some of them I haven't dug into yet, but here's the bottom line.
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.000]  There is an open mutiny in every major federal agency against President Trump.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  There is an open mutiny in the news. There's open calls everywhere to killing.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  They are organizing racketeer operations.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  And I mean that in the very sense of the word to launch a civil war in this country.
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.000]  Obama, the last month in, admitted that he was mobilizing and packing agencies with people that didn't even been there before
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  as sleeper cells to just ignore what Trump says.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  So he gets in his first tier, his second tier, that all the rest leak. They lie. They ignore.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  The VA won't hang up his signs. Congressman comes in, hangs it up. They take it down.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  And they brag. We're not doing it. McDonald's comes out and says, you know, Trump's scum. He's trash.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  They go, oh, it's an accident. It's an accident. Guess who one of their head PR people is?
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  It's Gibbs, Robert Gibbs. We got an article coming out where I say it's probably him.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  He's a known liar. He said he lies about the drone program, lies about everything else.
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  He's at McDonald's. You don't think McDonald's really hacked out that thing, attacking Trump?
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  Hack attack. McDonald's blames compromise Twitter account after firing off an insulting tweet
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  at Donald Trump calling him a disgusting excuse of a president with tiny hands.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  That's Gibbs, in my opinion. I think he's the prime suspect, I'll tell you that.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  No one else has pointed this out that I know of.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  We've got Kit Daniels about to put his article up on infowords.com right now.
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  Oh, here it is. I guess he put it on my desk during the break. Was Obama insider Robert Gibbs behind McDonald's anti-Trump tweet?
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  Gibbs, now McDonald's chief communications officer.
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.000]  Oh, he's certainly been allowed it to happen.
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.000]  It's Gibbs. It's Gibbs.
[57:00.000 --> 57:06.000]  It's Gibbs. And that's how you treat the president, eating McDonald's on TV, trying to look provincial.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  Truth is, Trump actually likes it. It's kind of a fetish for some rich guys to eat the best food.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  I've seen it before and I like junk food. It's weird. People in Hollywood do it too.
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  You wouldn't catch me near a McDonald's hamburger. I get sick of it. I eat it.
[57:19.000 --> 57:24.000]  Anyways, I'm not even Mr. Healthy. I eat big old Juicy Cheeseburgers all day. That ain't it.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  By the way, I haven't plugged once this hour. We need your support. We're in a total war.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  I mean, we are in a total war. We have the initiative. We're starting to win, but we need your prayers.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  We need your financial support. We've got products 30% off on SuperMailVitality through this week.

[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  It's been SuperMail and X2 together that have done it. 30% off at infowarslife.com and free shipping.
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.000]  I guess that's the new special, but just on that product and read the five star reviews there at infowarslife.com.
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  We're almost sold out at the Micro ZX Fungus and Anti-East Cleanser.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  We have the great bomb defense that goes like a horse and carriage with that.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  And we have the Trump Pence 2020 shirts.
[58:11.000 --> 58:19.000]  America first in 1776 in FullWars.com. Out of the gates, half off, 9.95 to help spread the word.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  And they're about to sell out. They'll sell out today of the President Total Victory 1776.
[58:25.000 --> 58:35.000]  Donald J. Trump limited edition lowers from Tennessee Arms, exclusive piece of art as well at infowarsstore.com or AAA 2533139.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  It's a war. We're starting to win. Everybody though has to keep pulling and fighting.
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  And it's fun to do. Anyways, we're not going to let them win. Get ready.
[58:43.000 --> 58:48.000]  Second hour is going to be power act. Yeah.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[59:05.000 --> 59:13.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:23.000 --> 59:28.000]  You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[59:41.000 --> 59:46.000]  And you support the broadcast infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:49.000 --> 59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  North Korea.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  And saying they want to openly kill our president and put his wife in sex slavery.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  I'm surprised he might not go out to California and find Bow Wow and talk to him.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  They take our restraint and kindness for weakness.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  You're a bunch of losers. Those that want to kill Trump and torture his wife.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  Those of you that want to shoot your mouths off. You know you're losers. You know you're scum.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Alec Baldwin, Bow Wow, all of your line trash.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Just know this. You get the civil war you want. We're trying to stop it.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Your names are at the top of the list and a lot of trouble.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  But the sedition and criminal activity you're openly calling for.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Turn a little bit more from Earl Haggard.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  I read about some squirrely guy who claims he just don't believe in fight.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And I wonder just how long the rest of us can count and be free.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Oh, they love our milk and honey.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  They love our milk and honey, but they preach about it some other way.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  North Korea, Venezuela, EU.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Yeah, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Thank you, Earl. Now I'm part of legend. I died last year.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Now let's think about this. I don't want to launch wars.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I don't want to fund Al Qaeda and ISIS. Those are bad wars.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  We talk about fighting for ideas, fighting by wearing a t-shirt, standing up for free speech,
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  fighting that women not get beat up, that are going to Trump events,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  fighting to just be able to have political views and freedom in this country.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And to see the so-called left and the right-wing establishment all together against Trump
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  and our Americana movement, and to have Trump 55 days in,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  delivering on almost everything he said he'd do faster than I thought he could do it,
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  with a full-scale mutiny on his hands.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Think of the entitlement of John McCain to now say Senator Rand Paul actually is a Putin agent with no proof.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Now, I mean, talk about walking on the fighting side.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  He is such an arrogant piece of trash.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And you know all the bad stuff McCain did, like I do.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  A lot of you know as well, but I've been following him for 20-plus years.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  McCain's so bad, it's just like, what an arrogant psychopath.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Completely out of his mind.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  He's like that one senator.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  In fact, the guy's even in the photo.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Who was the senator he died right after up in Alaska that thought,
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  the Internet, we can shut it down as much as we want.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  I mean, McCain is like a few years away, and I say this sadly,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  from you know, walking around in nursing, I'm going,
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  war, what?
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  He just wants war.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  At least Iran's been threatening to attack us sometimes.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  Russia's not doing anything.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And they've got nuclear weapons, dumbass.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Excuse me.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  I'm gonna come right back after this break when I've really got some time.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I'm gonna figure out the mutiny that I've already been mentioning
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  when I play the clips and more.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And then I'm gonna tie in to this.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  What are they in a mutiny against?
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  Prosperity.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  A good economy.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  A large growing middle class.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Bringing Americans together, healing all these racial and cultural wounds
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  that have been reopened.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And then in some cases that are brand new.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  I mean, it's full scale.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I saw the New York Times, like I sent it to Nico.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  I need to find it.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I think over the whole stack today, I'm a bad person.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  There was a New York Times article where it said,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  white parents must apologize for the racist kids
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  and must stop your kids from being racist.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  It's like saying, black people, you're bad.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Apologists is a group.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Just, you know, Chinese, you're evil as a group.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  Apologize.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  It's just such race baiting and invoking the minorities
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  that are the majority now to go into race-based politics
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  and literally run around and henpeck white people
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  as the new persecuted group.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  I mean, the Democrats got their butts kicked in the 60s
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  by the Republicans trying to end the race stuff
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  and they're right back at it.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  In his latest move to cut into the budget,
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  President Trump has proposed killing all funding
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  for PBS, NPR, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  This budget cut would include 445 million
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  148 million from the National Endowments,
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  and 230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  This budget cut totals 823 million,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.000] .02% of the bloated U.S. government's
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  200th of a percent of the bloated U.S. government's
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  $4.6 trillion budget.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Now, the tears will start to flow with this proposition,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  but this is President Trump coming through on his promise
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  to cut into the budget, and when you're a businessman
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit,
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  sacrifices have to be made.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  This is just a proposal, so no.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  Your local library or museum is not shutting down
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  As for some of these operations,
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  But for those to which it is, this is a warning sign
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  to start making money or start looking for a new job.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  The U.S. taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  InfoWars.com, this is Alan Schreuer.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  This is Alan Schreuer.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  This is Alan Schreuer.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  This is Alan Schreuer.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  I haven't actually run out of mySUPERfemale,
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.580]  Hitting a gym once again, very exciting.
[1:07:36.580 --> 1:07:43.000]  Feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair's
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  luxurious once again, so, obviouslyุ vSUPERfemale is amazing, I love it.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Nathan Aydine is essential.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  If there's one product that I would say
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.840]  is life changing, then I'd suggest it's
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Nathan Aydine Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  It's a win-win in FullWarsLife.com.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm opening the phones up.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  And then, media activist par excellence.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Mark Dice is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And then, of course, we have Anthony Cooney, always doing a great job, hosting the fourth hour.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Does that twice a month? The fourth hour is that great grab bag, wild card trends.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Mentioned that's so popular now.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  If you just joined us, John McCain came out and said that Rand Paul is an agent of Putin.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  No evidence, no nothing.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  He just doesn't want to have a treaty put through that the United States will invade with NATO.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  The war zone civil war that John McCain and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and George Soros bragged.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  They started three and a half years ago.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  I mean, if you want me, I can pull up the articles and play.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Fareed Zarkaria, CNN, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Samantha Powers.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  All bragging, they started it over through an elected government and tried to steal it from Russia
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  for 500 years, the entire East Crimea has been part of Russia.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  I mean, from what I've researched, that's probably where Russia started was in the Crimea,
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  but kind of like, you know, Plymouth Rock or something.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  This just shows the level we've gotten to here.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  I mean, this is next level, but it's all part of the mutiny in government.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  A month ago, Trump comes out with his travel ban from seven countries, Somalia, Sudan, you name it, Libya,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  hell holes that don't even have properly working airports and don't have any documentation.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  There aren't passports out of Somalia.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  It's incredible that we even let people in from there.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  That's one of the biggest refugee groups, stabbings, murder, shooting.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  I know there's some nice Somali folks.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  I get them wanting to flee that hell on earth, but ladies and gentlemen,
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  the president has the power, but the night circuit, the same one that banned the American flag in schools
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  in California in the night circus, they came out and blocked it.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  So he then had all the top lawyers write something beyond bulletproof because the old border was bulletproof.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  This one is like under a mountain of armor.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  It's like under, you know, six mile mountain.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  I mean, not even nuclear weapons could get it if it was a bunker.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  It's that ironclad.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  Federal judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  This is mutiny and Trump has come out and said this is a rebelling judge.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  I'm going to play that clip here in just a moment from his speech last night.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  More speeches today to crowds of 50,000 people or more.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Trump said that it's unprecedented judicial overreach.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  That is the really kind of a light wash.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  I know he wants to be friends with the judiciary.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Newsflash, Mr. President, all over MSN, they're saying they want to kill you and your family and put Melania in sex slavery.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  And the media is praising Snoop's nephew, Bow Wow.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Will Bow Wow lose his record contract? Will Bow Wow get kicked off MTV?
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  No, he'll be promoted because this group of scum, this group of trash are trying to organize criminal actions everywhere
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  where Michael Savage and his dog get beat up in a restaurant yesterday or the day before yesterday.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  I have these on my show screaming, oh, you support Trump.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Videos all over the country, people getting beaten up.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Not just wearing a Trump hat, but just because you're white.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Total race war.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  New York Times coming out and saying you must order white parents, stop raising races kids.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Wow, this is full on.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  And folks, it's not the minorities that are pushing this.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  It is the weaponized media, the big banks.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks. They said we're losing the culture war. America's coming together.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  The middle class knows what's happening. We've got to go to cultural weapons.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  That's a culture war.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  It's how empires used to control India.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  A few thousand British soldiers controlled India.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  Tens of millions of people because they played each little tribe off against each other.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Each region off against the other.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Federal judges blocked Trump's travel ban. Federal judges.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Two federal judges have temporarily blocked President Trump's travel ban,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  both citing Trump's statements about Muslims during the campaign as part of their rulings.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  It doesn't matter. He has the law. He has the official power.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  You now claim the First Amendment, saying Congress shall make no law,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  respecting and establishing religion.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  It's already a law for 60-plus years. The president can do this.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  It's adjudicated. It's tested. It's peer reviewed.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  There's massive piles and tens of thousands of cases that you can cite as precedent.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  It's so established, it's unbelievable.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  They don't care. It's called mutiny against the president.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  A ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii Wednesday resulted in a temporary restraining order nationwide.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Hours before it was set to go into effect, the decision published Thursday morning
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  another judge in Maryland specifically blocked a 90-day ban on immigration for citizens
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  in six Muslim-majority countries.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  And when there's another terror attack, they'll just cover all that up.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  So while we're talking about mutiny, violent threats against the president are okay now?
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  The Hill.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Here's one from infowars.com.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  After mock assassination, Snoop Dogg nephew Bow Wow threatens to pimp Melania Trump.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  That's sex slavery. A.O., a real Donald Trump.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Shut your punk ass up.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  Talking bleep about my uncle at Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Make her work. Sex slavery.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Hey, listen, dumbass. Let me explain how this works.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Your uncle said he wants to spray police with bullets and that he wants to kill Trump and then simulate it.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  You know, anywhere else, it'd be SWAT teams.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I mean, you understand that.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  You understand that we know Soros wants a civil war like Ukraine, so people are holding back right now.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  But you understand, if you're successful in the civil war, you're going to be living under the jail, my friend.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  I don't want you, Bow Wow, to live under the jail.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  I want you to break the conditioning and not be chumped by George Soros, who is funding unrest in more than 30 countries all behind radical Islam.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  You're like, I like Islam then. It's kind of anti-America.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  Yeah, go live over there then, my friend.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  Under the Wahhabist religion, black people are subhuman.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Well, so you got to, I'm sure, go join it then.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Soros, fueling unrest in Macedonia, tensions risk leading to conflict with Russia as Senate investigates Soros.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  But forget investigating Soros.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  We have John McCain saying that anyone that opposes war with Russia is an agent of Putin.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  So, let's get to the next piece of mutiny.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Trump must march into these VAs and have snap inspections that his photos on the wall. That's very simple.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  This is mutiny, folks. This is the executive branch.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  He's trying to clean it up.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  He's trying to really get people in there to actually help and have reviews of the people that worked there to give good medical care to our veterans instead of a bunch of snot-nosed brats and thugs that fill the VA.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  There's some good people in there. Yes, they're the ones that get pushed to the side. It is a joke how bad it is.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  The death list where a computer just says, don't treat somebody, don't give them any surgery, whatever.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  They literally just want to swindle the money for the bureaucracy.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  The globalists hate our veterans. They hate our patriots. They hate our republic.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  They know who's the most awake. They know who has the seeds of victory and the seeds of renewal for our republic is our veterans in active duty.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  They're trying to convert to a robot automated drone army because they don't want to have to have humans that are honorable.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  They hate strong men and women. They hate dedicated people.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  They fear the fact that you're honorable because you carry in the dark of the night the light of freedom.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  And so, it was already a story that 50-plus days in, there was no head of the VA, head of the Veterans Affairs Department,
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  confirmed weeks and weeks ago, no president of the United States hanging up.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  And so, they'd taken it down where the pictures were hung. They'd taken Obama down.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  But there's such a mutiny in government that no pictures have been sent out across the country.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  So the congressman told about this by his constituents, legs blown off in Afghanistan in his own right, Army Ranger,
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  goes in to hang up the proper size official presidential photo.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  The security guard comes and gets in their face, talk about the arrogance.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  These people are completely psychotic in their arrogance. They come and get in their face and then after they leave, they take it down.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  I mean, again, and you look at the slugs that are actually in their face later trying to stop them.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  It just shows the total disconnect that they think they're the boss.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  They think they can block us. They think they can stop us when we're in the right.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  When all we want to do is restore the Republic, the apple of the world's eye,
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  and Trump's just in 50-something days and the economy is going from dying to turning back on, like Lazarus back from the dead.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  It's unprecedented.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  America's coming back from the dead right now.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  It's happening. Legend is happening.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  Trump's a business guy who hates corrupt managers and bad employees.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  He hates the fact that our veterans have been treated like crap. He's taking action. Skip the break, please.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Let's play the Fox News report on this. We have the full report by Paul Watson at infowars.com
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  because this is part of the mutiny and it gets into the courts mutiny and all the rest of it.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Mutiny, VA hospital in Florida, takes down portrait of President Trump.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  But the veterans, the key group I've been saying, need to tweet your photos or actions like this or whatever,
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  going out and veterans legally and lawfully standing up to the bullies and restoring the Republic.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  And it could be flying an American flag in your yard wearing a Trump is my president shirt.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  Whatever it is, just speak out and be heard or do big things like this congressman did.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Mutiny, VA hospital in Florida, takes down portrait of President Trump,
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  photo removed hours after congressman and local veterans install it.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  A veterans affairs hospital, and again, they hung it where the old photos were.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  A veterans affairs hospital in Florida, sensationally removed.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Portrait photos of President Trump and Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  at a Republican congressman and Army veteran, Brian Maast, demanded they be installed.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Accompanied by a group of local veterans,
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  Maast brought portraits of Trump and Shulkin to the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  only for them to be removed hours later by management staff at the hospital.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  The photos were removed because management could not authenticate the photos
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  and they have to follow protocol, oh yeah.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  How about the president marching there to tell you to hang it up?
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  I'm sorry, my president's Obama.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  The photos were removed because management could not authenticate.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  A VA spokesman later said the congressman's actions were inappropriate.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  Yeah, the congressman, how about we fire all your assets?
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  How about you fire that spokesperson?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Guarantee you the head of the VA didn't think that.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  A VA spokesman later said the congressman's actions were inappropriate
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  and that the portraits needed to come from the VA's central office.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Notice that the congressman brought the official photos.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  The explanation was given for why the portraits hadn't been installed anyway
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  almost two months after president's inauguration.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Massey lost his legs in IED blast while serving on the answer
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  and appeared on Fox & Friends this morning to denounce the move.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  This is exactly what pisses people off about the government
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  is they don't have that kind of reactionary capability
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  to just fix a problem immediately.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Here we see they made an even bigger problem out of the situation.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  It's because they don't want his photo up.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  They don't want to go anywhere all over the country.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  The federal judges are in rebellion.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Hollywood, the media are all saying kill Trump.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  But they can't get to him so instead they beat people to death
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  and attack people and go run around burning stuff and attack women.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  We sit there and put up with it.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  I think they put up with women being beaten with American flags.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  If white guys with American flags were beating up a Hispanic lady.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  But it's okay when it's the other way around.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  And again, I'm not even mad at any of these groups.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Most of these groups aren't involved in this.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  It's the media and the global is trying to invoke this.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  And it goes on and on.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  The good news is Trump's moving to cut half the funding the U.S. does to the U.N.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  They're moving to get rid of the so-called arts funding
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  which is just a bunch of anti-American crap
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  where they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a crucifix and urine
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  from Virgin Mary with elephant crap smear all over.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Hey, go do your own art.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Find a free marketplace.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Dirt bags.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  Don't steal old ladies' pensions or take farmers' money and audits
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  so you can give billions of dollars to all the communists and socialists.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Scumbags.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  It's over.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  We're gutting it all.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  You can't give veterans health care.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  We're going to shut all your crap down.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  NPR, all of it.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  We're going to pull the money.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  See how you like that?
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  You want to fight, you got one.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  But don't forget Bow Wow.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  Look at the arrogant smugness of little rich Bow Bow bitching about the country, everything.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Now, he's a real man.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  He kidnaps women, he says, and puts them into slavery.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  Everybody goes, wow, that's hard.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Man, that's cool.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Man, that's a great family example there.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  That's real nice tweeting right at the president.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  I'll take your wife, put her into sex slavery.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  The left thinks it's really cool.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Isn't that sick?
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  And there's a Hill article right here where they just say it's all over.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Thousands of articles, tweets.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  You can't get away from it.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Kill the president.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Kill the president.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Kill his family.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Kill him.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  And then leftists go, well, he must be doing something wrong then.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  And you're all the leftist are a bunch of wimps and mental patients and weirdos, literally,
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  who are authoritarian, running around bitching, trying to start a war with the most armed,
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  populist in the world, trying to start a war with the veterans.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  And George Soros just loves it.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  He always just sits back and watches it all burn down.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  Turn on your TV or browse your news feeds on social media and you'll be bombarded with
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  calls about the skyfalling and credible threats of violence against conservative figures.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  The FBI investigates a threat to kill Milo Yassopos for the audacity to want to speak
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  on a college campus.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Threats against former labor secretary.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  Wife caused him to withdraw from the consideration.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  Multiple intimidation remarks haunted members of the Trump voting electoral college.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  President Trump has been the target of declarations of violence on a daily basis.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  We mean hundreds of times an hour.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  But public ones every day.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  What would happen if I called for somebody to kidnap Bow Wow and then have people gang
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  rape him?
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  I'm not calling for that.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  He'll probably take that out and said I did, but their liars is what they do.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  What if somebody just called for Bow Wow to be kidnapped into sex slavery and taken to
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  somewhere like Saudi Arabia where they like to rape men as well and just kept him in
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  a closet for the rest of his life and raped him?
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Oh, Bow Wow is a human.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Wow, that's a horrible thing to even talk about something about Bow Wow.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  But you want to openly, publicly to a bunch of your followers and snoop.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  That new record coming out calling.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  It was called Dead Dog or Roadkill or something like that.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Or asking to die was the name of this new record coming out.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Asking for it was the name of it.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  And you know how it works with a sleeping giant.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  People push and they push and they run on and on.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  And then they hope the bear trap closes and they cry for their mommy.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  I mean, I'm not going to hurt Snoop Dogg.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  I don't hurt a fly.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  We're just here trying to restore their Republic and we're trying to do it peacefully and we're having some success.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  A Sumner Redstone wants to back old Bow Wow.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  That's nothing.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  You guys are all commanded by a bunch of 90 year old people that reportedly elevators don't go to the top anymore.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  That's actually what's so dangerous about this is the average age of the globalist commander is above 85.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  The top king pins, you know, done a lot of stuff, made their bones for I was born, done all this horrible stuff, horrible people.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  They're now just battling their kids and people to hold on to their trillions that they've gotten the aggregate.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  And they're just like, whatever, launch full war Bow Wow.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Total war.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Teach five year olds how to have fellatio.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  And that's what Viacom does.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Sexualize the children.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Turn loose hell.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  There's major movements fighting pedophilia.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Just normalize it.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  They'll accept it if we say it's liberal.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Bow Wow.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  That sounds like a really safe move to tweet at the president.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  He went up against the globalist, the whole new world order is victorious.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  Rebuilding our military has the veterans behind him is cleaning out the intelligence agencies.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  You're so sure you're going to win Bow Wow.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  That you're saying you're going to have his wife kidnapped and put into sex slavery.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  That's what he says.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Okay, that was a good plan.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Going to work out for you, Bow Wow.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  But see, for so long, these people have been doing whatever they want, like John McCain saying that Senator Paul is now a Russian agent.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  That is the most over the top 50 times worse than Joe McCarthy at his worst.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  It's just unspeakable.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  It's total and absolute complete over the top La La Land.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  I'm going to open the phones up on any of these subjects specifically I've raised.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  That's a big cornucopia.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  800-25-99231.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  And I'm going to say it again, at least in this first hour of calls we're taking, first time callers.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Have a good phone.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  I'd love to hear from you.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Be ready.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  I'm going to go to you.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  800-25-99231.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  800-25-99231.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Because you've got organized greenlighting for violence and insurrection and burning and looting.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  Run by the corrupt media, the collaborator media that is the opposition party and it's owned by foreign corporations that are in open war with this nation.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  With the Communist Chinese at Davos and here in the U.S. saying, we're going to help you defeat your populist movement and saying, Europe, we're going to help you.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  And they beat, probably in a fake election, the Poles were way ahead and the Netherlands were way ahead in places like Austria, but they're known for fraud.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  So the nationalist leaders have not been winning there.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  They're winning everywhere else.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  But they're growing.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Their numbers are growing.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  It's exciting.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  But Gert Wilder's lost.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  It's a pyrrhic victory.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  There's an article on infowars.com at Clifford cutting him, dealing with that.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  We're talking about the healthcare bill, where that is and some good news on that front.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  We come back.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Further, we've got a big special running on one of our best selling products.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  It takes all the known organic herbs, concentrates them into super concentrate oils.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  I just get better with time from what I've noticed.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  In supermelt vitality and it just has incredible response.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  4.5 reviews out of almost 3,000 reviews.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  I'm looking here.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Is it 2,325?
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  I was looking at a distance.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  So almost 2,500 reviews.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  You can go read them on third party, power reviews, sites, and others.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Why folks love it so much.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  Why it's working so good for them.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  Infowars.com 30% off right now and free shipping on an item.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Supermelt Vitality and Survival Seal X2 are awesome.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  I use Supermelt Vitality and Survival Seal X2 regularly now.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Since mid-December 2016, I am almost down 50 pounds.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  It's incredible.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  I have the drive to exercise.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  I feel more balanced.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  I am usually sick several times during the winter.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Absolutely no sickness except for a few days of stiffy sinuses.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  Yeah, me too.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  I plan to be a user for life.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Thank you, John.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  The IndyCon in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  Go read thousands of them for yourself.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  It's the real deal.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  In his latest move to cut into the budget,
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  President Trump has proposed killing all funding for PBS, NPR,
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  This budget cut would include $445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  $148 million from the National Endowments,
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  and $230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  This budget cut totals $823 million,
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  0.02% of the bloated U.S. government's $200 of a percent of the bloated U.S. government's $4.6 trillion budget.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  Now, the tiers will start to flow with this proposition,
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget,
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  and when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit,
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  sacrifices have to be made.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  This is just a proposal, so no.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  Your local library or museum is not shutting down,
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  As for some of these operations, the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  But for those to which it is, this is a warning sign to start making money
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  or start looking for a new job.
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  The U.S. taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  On the web at infowarsteam.com,
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  it's at infowarsteam.com.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  It's in powder form.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  I take this.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  This is the product that I take.

[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  It's Trump Dimension.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  It's Trump.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  The plan of Trump.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  And thus by extension Trump.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  Trump just trolls you.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  But that's okay.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  It's Trump.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  The plan of Trump.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  And thus by extension Trump.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  And we are back live.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  Seriously though, I'm not up here talking about the fact that Bowell's writing checks.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  I guarantee you he and his punk family can't cash.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  You can't organize violence and say kill Trump, kidnap his wife,
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  sell her into sex slavery, screw Republicans, screw libertarians.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  We're going to come at you.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  We're going to have a civil war.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  And then not have people simply say,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  historically the road you're going down by every angle shows total defeat
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  and authoritarianism on you.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  See, I grew up around people that didn't shoot their mouths off or act tough
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  or go around trying to start trouble.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  People just wanted to help folks in the Salvation Army
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  and just be good sentences, but also go out in barbecue and water ski
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  and just mountain climb and be good people.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But I, as I grew up, thought, wow, most people aren't like my family.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  They're either lazy or they're stupid or they're scum.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Because people have had it so good in this country so long
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  that you have multiple generations of people like Snoop Dogg, fake tough guy rappers,
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  raising people like Bowell that thinks you can tweet at the president
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Ayo at real Donald Trump, shut your punk ass up,
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  talking bleep about my uncle at Snoop Dogg
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  Your uncle did a video saying spray police, shoot police,
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  and simulated killing the president.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Do you understand how this works, jackass?
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  I mean, if you would have said we're at war with you, Trump,
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  prepare to be defeated, I would say, okay, you are at war with Trump.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  Your family is trying to promote people killing him.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  See how that works? See how that works?
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  You come up and punch us in the nose and then the left always bitches
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  like if we hit back, we did it.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  And you have no rules like that Alec Baldwin.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  The media is all like how dare Alec Shone say he wants to break the jaw of Alec Baldwin
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  when all he did was a skit about aliens last Saturday night.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  No, he didn't. He did this whole racist skit saying black people weren't humans
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  and then he learned it from Alex Jones of Info Wars, the talk show host.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  I'm not mad that that's going to actually hurt me in the public.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I'm pissed that our country's fallen so far that that kind of crap's allowed.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I know Alec Baldwin has some great brothers and people, they ought to kick his ass.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  I know he thinks he's the big brother and the big tough guy,
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  and then that Ron Perlman guy says he wants to fight me because I stood up and said
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  stop calling me a racist.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  You damn liars trying to go tell stupid people in the street
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  that you want to organize into racial attacks against white people.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  That's what you're really doing, which will then scapegoat black people.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  I know what you're doing. You're trying to get everybody like in a prison in their groups
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and then you the manager sit up there and play everybody
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  and social engineers like Bow Wow knows full well what he's doing.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  I didn't even know who Bow Wow was. I guess a bunch of people around here know who the idiot is.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  And I guess he settled some court cases. I didn't know about that.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  Hmm. Sounds about right.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  Now we know why you don't like Trump, Bow Wow.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Well, I tell you, never seems to end, doesn't it?
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  Never seems to end.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  Hmm. I want to go to your phone calls here, but I tell you.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Michael Savage was attacked in a restaurant, a nice restaurant where you take your dog.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  He talks about taking his dog there. I don't know why he does that.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  God comes in, starts screaming at him. He supports Trump, slams him to the ground,
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  a seventy-something year old man, and then attacks the toy poodle because it fought back for daddy.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  Now you attack people's dogs because it's Michael Savage's.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  And then somebody else attacks Savage. Savage got up and fought back.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  Other people had to help. And then Savage was so classy.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  He said, fine, don't even arrest this guy.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  It's in the TMZ report, but at the top it's like he claims he was attacked or other things.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  There was a melee. No, he was attacked.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  If you walk up and attack a senior citizen or anybody else,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  if somebody walks up and hits me in the back of the head, I got attacked.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  If I get up and kick their ass, I got attacked. I have a right to do it.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  Let me tell you something.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I'm not going to sit here and let people hit me just because I can take a punch or get up and kick your ass.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  You assault me, just understand. I'm going to light you up.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Just understand that. You're going to get lit up because I'm done playing games with all you people.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  See, I'm not pushing offensive violence, but you're getting everybody in a defensive, weaponized posture
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  with a culture and people that created the country, defeated the enemies, and do the hanging.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And the thing is, the people that do the hanging don't want to have to kill you.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  They don't want to go out of their way and have to kill you.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  They just want you to wake up and at least support free speech.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  You can disagree with us wanting to cut poor people in middle class taxes
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  and wanting to give $25 billion to the black colleges six, seven times what Obama did.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  You can try to block us trying to get fair trade deals.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  You can try to block us doing basic stuff.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Oh, I know, it's horrible, isn't it? Trying to actually make a good country.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  But just don't call for killing us.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And again, I'm trying to explain this to you.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I love how punks and thugs always think we say this because we're weak.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Oh, look, he's scared. He's hoping he didn't get capped.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  That's why I took on Hillary.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  That's why I put airplanes in the air over her saying she's a criminal.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  That's why I had people get in their face all over TV on hundreds of programs
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  saying her husbands are rapists and she's a criminal.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  It's why I had the people that were raped by her clients on the air.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  It's why I put up with all the stuff Hillary has done to me in my life,
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  which I won't even get into.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  I've been dealing with Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton for 22 years.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Well, I started getting attacked 20 years ago and I don't mean just attacked.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  I don't mean just fired off my radio station or my sponsors taken.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  I mean attacked in parking lots.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Told shut up about Bill Clinton.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Shut up about Waco.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  I've experienced it, OK?
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Oh, but here's the good news. See, I stood up against him.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  It was enjoyable, quite frankly.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  And I know all you guys in your basement go, oh, look at Alex,
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  the big tough guy's claiming all this.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  Yeah, I claim we reach billions of people and we got the proof.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  And I claim we change the world. Our audience changed the world.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  Our audience of every race, color and creed are humans with red blood, one race,
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  one God, one country, one republic, one world.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  And we want freedom and we want prosperity and we don't want to kill each other.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  I believe in Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  I believe in unity. I believe in coming together.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  And that's not what the system does.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And the evil MTV and the evil Hollywood that's the real enemy force feeds Bow Wow and Snoop
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  and all these scum and all these other rappers and all these other rock star people,
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  all their stars and all these movie scum saying, kill Donald Trump, rape his wife,
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  his sons, gotta be a mass shooter, all this crap, boycott in their companies,
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  boycott in their families.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  All because there's still some good people in this country
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  and Trump's trying to deliver on restoring this nation.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  They think he's dumb. He hadn't joined the globalist.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  They think he's dumb because he believes in something.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  Because I know the pimps, the folks that are into themselves like John McCain and Bow Wow,
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  they're all about, I'll take care of myself.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  I'm not taking care of anybody.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Damn right, I want to sell somebody out.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Damn right, I want to be nasty.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  Damn right, I want to be low down.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  What an empty evil culture that's been sold.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  I remember they had magazines like Self and the yuppies are all into it.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  It's all about me, me, me, me, me, me.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And when you do that, you destroy yourself because it's okay to have your own things
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  and have your own space and stand up for you to believe in.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  That's absolutely right.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  But when you get so selfish you care about nothing around you,
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  you destroy yourself and your own family and you're not fulfilled.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, but I do need to just briefly go through these headlines.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Let me just do that.

[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  and just tell you shut up if you're videotaping, you know, thing of Churchill or anything.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  They'll come out of the way and say, you have that camera on.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  They're not even aiming at them because they're used to brits that pee down their leg.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  I mean, the brits used to be the type of people around.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  They've been conditioned to grovel.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  I go, get the hell out of my face.

[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  You understand?
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Go intimidate somebody else.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  See, because I'm one of those people that comes from the wild brits that came over here and created this country.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  They've not stayed back over there and been domesticated.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Okay.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  And all the men are playing rugby and games all day.

[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  And the first one is obviously the secret service is not doing a good job.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Why can't Trump have his own security people mixed in?
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  I mean, he does.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  He does.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  It's unprecedented.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  He does has a lot of former special forces people.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  And I'm not going to leave it at that.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  I'm just going to post another details of it.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  But expanding on it, they don't have arrest powers.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  They don't have a power for indictment.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  And the courts are just sitting there letting this giant crescendo build
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  towards kill his wife, rape her, put her in sex slavery, kill his family, kill him.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  Major newspapers call for it.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And so let me tell you something.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  I'm not calling for this, but some of these people, they're the ones calling for death and murder.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  And the way the universe works is some of them, I think you're probably going to start getting hurt.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  What do you think?
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  I think they're going to start getting hurt because what goes around comes around what you put out.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  You will get back tenfold.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  That's right.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  That's why I'm always very careful not calling for violence.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  But I mean, they're calling for violence.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  So that's offensively trying to organize attacks on us.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Total racketeering, total organized conspiracy to commit murder.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  That's worse than murder one.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  That's death penalty.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  The conspiracy to commit murder is worse than the other thing.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  So, you know, here's the deal. You could joke around and say, I hope somebody breaks bow bow's neck.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  I'm not saying that.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  He's saying go out and kill his, his uncle saying kill Trump.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  And he says, why are you talking about about my uncle?
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  He's only saying kill you.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  What's your problem?
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  We're only saying we want to kill you.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  These celebrities that are out there saying these things, they are just completely wrecking themselves
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  or showing who they really are.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  And the American people are sick of it and they're not buying anything.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  I hear you, Kimberly. Do you have more to add?
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  I kind of ran over there. You hold her and say bye-bye.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  I do. I just...
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  Stay there. We're going to go back to the break.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  Don't hang up, Kimberly.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Then Josh, Andrew, Jason, Linda and others.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  I'm Alex Shaw.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  I am a former congressman, physician and presidential candidate.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  The world is in turmoil.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars and famines are commonplace.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat and it lasts up to 25 years.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-763-5999.

[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  See guidelines.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.

[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  President Trump is cleaning up Washington, but the media and Barack Obama want to stop him.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  They've declared total war against him.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Now, David Horowitz' big agenda reveals Obama's secret plan to destroy Trump.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Rush Limbaugh says you must read Big Agenda.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Newsmax calls it the best Trump book yet.

[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  You know, whenever I get up on air and I expose that Communist China has killed over 100 million of their own people,
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  I end up seeing news articles saying Alan Jones hates Chinese.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Okay, because I don't want to kill 100 million Chinese, I'm anti-Chinese.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Or because I don't like North Korea.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I've heard, oh, he doesn't like Koreans.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  Oh, that's why my sister's adopted Korean.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  It's like people that don't know geography or history or anything or sociology or geopolitical strategy,
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  they just say, racist, homophobe, or you don't like this group, you don't like that group.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Or it's like, oh, you don't like...
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  I do see some of the racist comments on both sides.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Just stop it, everybody, on the dog-dog or bow-wow or whatever his name is.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  This is getting everybody to fight with each other, but we have to call it out.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  And I get back to the disconnect.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  He's like, why are you talking about about my uncle Snoop?
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  I'll kidnap your wife, put her in sex slavery.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  The entitlement of that, of these, I guess the millennials or whatever, but everybody,
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  where you just sit there and you say, no connection that his uncle's trying to organize the murder of the president.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  Then that's what he's doing. He's advertising and he's pushing and he's calling for spraying police with bullets.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And then he wonders why people are mad at his uncle.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Same thing to Snoop Dogg.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  I never talked bad about Snoop Dogg and all this thug garbage,
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  but you like going to kill a president that just gave $25 million to the black colleges?
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  More than they're giving to the other colleges combined?
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  I mean, you're just an idiot.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  You work for the big banks and Viacom and Sumner Redstone to divide this country.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  You're the equivalent of the KKK and you make me sick.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Hell, you're not even a black nationalist.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  That's what you want to empower black people.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  You're a pimp.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  You are. You are a globalist house slave, but I'll tell you that everybody's a house slave.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  John McCain, all these people, these globalists and all the liberals that follow this and the Republicans and Mitch McConnell and blue eyes over there.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Paul Ryan, I'm sick of all of them.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Humanity can do anything we want with the technology and prosperity we have if we just have morals.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  But if you don't have morals, you can't have a country.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  It's why Christian nations are the most successful.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  We're not perfect, but that operating system works the best.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Let's go back to Kimberly.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  I'll get to everybody else.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  I'll get to everybody else.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  I've got plenty of time.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Dice didn't come on for a while.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I cut you off earlier.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Go ahead and make a point.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Okay, so the other thing that I wanted to talk to you about also is I'm really glad that Trump wants to cut the UN funding because for one, we have UN troops here that were brought in by Obama to start putting us in FEMA camps.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Well, it's beyond that.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  That's in the executive orders and in the military resettlement act.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  And it's in the emergency centers establishment act and it's also in a bunch of other programs.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  But it's more than it's our police are going under it with the strong cities initiative that Lynch said is the UN controlling our local police through the Justice Department is the enacting power total trees and total.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Absolute just it's so crazy.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's really happening.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Absolutely.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  So what they're doing is they're just putting our military under the UN.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  It's not like even UN troops.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Yeah, they come here.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  It's that our our military is going under the system, but now that's stopping.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  Thank God.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  And the other last thing I wanted to say is I'm really glad that all of these Republican people, senators and congressmen are have problems with the new health care bill.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  That's all Ryan, who is a source huge.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  I'm glad that they're questioning that because the thing is is that's not insurance either.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  How we how can you bail out?
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  He built in a bail out.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  It's always a corporate looting because that's the evil Republicans help write Obamacare.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  It's just what they wanted.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  Exactly.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  The insurance companies directly gang rape you, not just the government.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  So it's almost as bad as Obamacare.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  And that's why it we're going to blow it up together.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  It's happening.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  We're going to get real reform.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  But hey, sorry, everything's not going to be free.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  It never was folks.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  It never will be.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  It's all BS.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  Prosperity is what lowers prices.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  It's the people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  And this is a big part of it.
[1:59:44.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and ForwardsLives.com today.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  The raging war on corruption.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I'm not going to get into any details here, but I've confirmed what we've known for a while.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  The Democratic Party officially at the highest levels is poking around trying to bring down info wars.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  We learned about it from our Trump sources that Pelosi and her daughter were having meetings with Lynch trying to figure out ways to have me arrested or whatever.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  I knew this was good sources.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  The next day she went on Fox and said that I was creating death threats for her.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  It's just total bull.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  I've never even talked about her daughter.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  Other than that she was running the thing to get the unfaithful electors.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  And so it's just all part of this thing.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Let me just tell the listeners we have sharks circling us.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  And I think this is great.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  I've always wanted to fight with these people.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  I'm totally committed and we're changing the world.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Just know info wars is at the heart of the resistance.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  When we say that I've talked to retired and other current high level people in the intelligence community.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  I mean very high and they've done all the tracking they know with the computers that info wars is at the tip of the spear.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  There it is.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  Google the flag offensive content top of drudge.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  See it's breaking by the hour used to be every few months something big than every week than every day now every hour just boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  And they decide what is offensive.
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  All right let's go back to the phone calls.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  I'm going to get all your phone calls here.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  Josh in Ohio then a K and Linda and others.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Hi Alex first off God bless you and your crew.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  You guys are incredible.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  I'm a first time caller.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  I just started listening to you guys about nine months ago and really got plugged into basically the correct side of society how things should be going.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  I looking at the world I think there's two ways to kill the liberal agenda.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  And one of them you mentioned and thank God Mr. Trump is doing is cutting funding to the arts communities and all this crap.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  I was in college in Ohio here and it would be a 60 degree day in November just random warm weather would come in and you'd hear all these liberal people.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Oh my God we're going to die.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  We're going to die global warming global warming wouldn't shut up.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  And a week later there'd be 68 inches of snow on the ground.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  He wouldn't hear a peep out of them.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  And notice it was global freezing in the 70s and 80s.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Then it was global warming.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  Now it's just change and they've gone to 18 attorney generals.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  The feds have under Obama to see if they can start arresting people that don't agree with climate change.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  Of course we all believe in climate change.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  Their definition means it's man made.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  It's bad pay Al Gore money and then they'll save you.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  Exactly.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  And let me tell you I'm a marketing guy and from marketing standpoint the only time you look at.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  Okay let's say Pepsi for example Pepsi's been around forever.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  They've never changed the name ever because people like it for you know whatever reason.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Global climate change global freezing global warming all that.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  Why do you change the name because it didn't work.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  You keep changing it to try and re re jumpstart a new campaign under a new stupid name.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And I tell everybody this if it worked if it was such a massive problem and people believed it.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Why do we keep changing it and why does the severity get less and less and less.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  Now it's like extreme weather.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Is that what they call it now.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  Is that the big term for it.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  Here's the thing there are thousands of micro climates.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  You look at the numbers hundreds of big ones.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  I forget the exact numbers.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  The world's always going through stuff.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  I just know the real science from what's even mainline science.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  They have all the climate science and then they claim it's settled.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  But even the mainline astrophysics or geology or hydrology it's undebated that carbon dioxide has been hundreds of times higher than it is now.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  It's so critical.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  They believe it's off gassing because the earth isn't having as much volcanic activity as it used to.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  And that just like Mars we're losing our atmosphere.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  They've confirmed Mars had oceans you name it volcanoes it lost its atmosphere.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Its gravity is lower its smaller planet and that's part of it.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  But the earth is very old now and is losing its atmosphere.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  That's that's indisputed.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  It's almost like God set it up at this critical point where we'd have all this fossil fuel to then actually terraform back geoengineer to survive.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  It's amazing.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  It's like a movie.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  It's like a simulation like a video game.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  I'm getting chills.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  It's incredible.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  Now the tears will start to flow with this proposition but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  And when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit sacrifices have to be made.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  This is just a proposal.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  So no your local library or museum is not shutting down and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  As for some of these operations the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  But for those to which it is this is a warning sign to start making money or start looking for a new job.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  The U.S. taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  For Infowars.com this is Alex Jones.
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  And seriously I really think everyone should have one of these.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science one of our oldest sponsors.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  Like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  Plus you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  Even better, use coupon code private at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free. Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  Children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  The general public doesn't.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  We're now into hour number three broadcasting worldwide.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Gabe in South Carolina.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  I'm going to go to you.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  Jason, Andrew, Kay, Linda.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  We've got coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  The one the only.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  Mark Dice.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  I've got a few clips I want to get to briefly here now.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  Angelina Jo Leed is a tool of the Council on Farm Relations.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  She has pushed the worst U.N. programs.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  She pushes all the Comey propaganda, even though I knew at the time I've since confirmed with people that were on the ground,
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  that that whole deal in Central Africa, they knew right where he was.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  They leave him there as an excuse to be there.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  They leave them as radical Muslims there as an excuse.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  Trump's going to wipe all that out, by the way.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  I don't want to give away anything, but it's already known.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Oh, there were terrorist camps in this country that have been taken out.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  And believe me, that's not just a statement.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  That's happened.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  But let's just stop right there.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Obama had let some really bad stuff go on.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  It's hard to believe that things have gotten that bad.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  But we're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  Angelina Jo Leed spoke at a U.N. event, and she's a U.N. envoy.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  I think she should be removed from that position.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Trump has the power to do it, though she's actually with the U.N., not with the U.S.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  He should pressure the U.N.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  She doesn't speak for us.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  And she's running around saying that she warns against nationalism,
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  masquerading as patriotism.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  That's perfect PR disinfo from the anorexic.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Nationalism, masquerading, like it's like nationalism's fake,
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  nationalism's not genuine, nationalism's bad,
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  nationalism's abandoned with pantyhose over its face,
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  robbing a liquor store and shooting the clerk.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Nationalism, masquerading as patriotism.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  Patriotism is for your country and your rights and your people and your culture.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  So she says nationalism, masquerading as nationalism.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  The word games they play, it's just mind-blowing.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  It's a Breitbart article, videos up on infowars.com.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  There she is speaking in the Foreign Commonwealth Attacks Office of the British Government,
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  the British Empire.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Perfect.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip. Here it is.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  We see a rising tide of nationalism, masquerading as patriotism,
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  and the reemergence of policies encouraging fear and hatred of others.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  We see some politicians elected partly on the basis of dismissing international institutions and agreements.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  She's so ugly.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  As if our countries have not benefited from cooperation but actually been harmed by it.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  We hear some leaders talking as if some of our proudest achievements are in fact our biggest liabilities.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Whether it is the tradition of successfully integrating refugees into our societies
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  or the institutions and treaties we have built rooted in law and human rights.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  And by ugly, you can see a woman that has like a Barbie doll frame,
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  but they have that weird vampire thing going on where they were repulsive.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  I mean, she's repulsive to me.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  And I don't want to make comments about her physiology or physiology,
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  a new word, physiology or body or the rest of it.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  It's just, I'm telling you, I'm repulsed by her.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  And I'm repulsed by her actions and what she does.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  And you read about her, the weird cultism and blood and rituals and the darkness.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  And she's into some really bad stuff.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  She's a very lost person, so we should pray for Angelina Jolie.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  But what about, oh, the globalism, the treaties, the agreements, the foreign banks,
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  the TPP that hijacked America and sold us out to communist China?
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  You mean that sweetheart?
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Your dad's got to be ashamed of you.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  He's out there trying to get our sovereignty back, fighting hard for this country.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  I don't like bad about people's kids, but you're in the arena, lady.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  You and Bow Wow, and we're done.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  So you're in the arena politically, you're fair game.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  And I think you are a evil-looking person and your actions are evil.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  I mean, she's always creeping me out.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  People like 20 years ago, Angelina Jolie is so beautiful.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  And I'm like, what?
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  A scarecrow with big injected lips?
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  It's like some kind of albino goldfish or something?
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  I mean, I just don't get it.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  But again, that's the Hollywood.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  This is the image of a woman, a desiccated woman, a desiccated woman, a desiccated woman.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  I don't mind women that are skinny if it fits them proportionately,
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  but it's just shrunken women with shrunken souls in a shrunken world with shrunken heads.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  I am the anti-shrunken.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  I got a few more clips of the president I want to go to.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  There's so many great epic speeches.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  He's doing the right thing, getting back on the road,
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  energizing the people's approval ratings going up, up, up, up, up, up,
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  even in their fake polls.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  Where they sample, you know, 15, 20 points more Democrats.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  He's at 55, 56.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  That's 65, 70.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  And that's what they know.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  He had such a landslide.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  It was devastatingly big.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  When told you the polls were fake,
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  told you they fixed the major polling companies,
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  let's see, our sources didn't want you to know that.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  And by the way, I didn't just have sources in Google or sources in Facebook
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  or sources in Bloomberg.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  You know only a select group of billionaires get access to those systems.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  And I have people that have access to it.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  And so I was just given gestalt numbers.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  But you notice it came true exactly as I said because we're jacked in.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  I mean, I'm jacked in.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  Most of the time I'm like, I don't even want to know this.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  I shouldn't even know this.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Don't don't tell me.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  And it gets weirder and weirder.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  Let me tell you what the real upper class is.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  It's people that are dialed into the real info.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  And the global is what more and more info on everybody else,
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  but less and less about them.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  Let's play one clip of Trump and then go to the longest Linda.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  And then a bunch of other callers like Kay and Dustin and others.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Dustin, California is talking about major sigh up right now.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  Let's go to this clip.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Judge blocking immigration order is unprecedented as judicial overreach.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  No, Mr. President, it's mutiny.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  It's clear cut.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  It's ridiculous.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  It's naked.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  And it's outrageous.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Let's go to the president moments ago.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  I learned that a district judge in Hawaii.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  A lot of the much overturned Ninth Circuit Court.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  80% overturned.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  81%, sorry.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  And I have to be nice.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Otherwise, I'll get criticized.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  There are some circuits that overturn like 5%.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  You're speaking poorly about our courts.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  I'll be criticized by these people.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  I wish the president would say they're the ones that ban the American flag in California.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  I will be criticized.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  It's that stupid YouTube glitch.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  By the way, it's not us.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  It's YouTube now has these glitches everywhere.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  Rather than the wall.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  I would never want to do that.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  Even though they're enemies.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  We have a lot of great courts too.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  Our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  That it literally don't even have passports.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  It's like road water.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Somalia is worse than roadway.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  The order he blocked was a watered down version of the first order.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  That was also blocked by another judge.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  And should have never been blocked to start with.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Yeah, the 5 year old could understand the law.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  He has much more authority.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th circuits in my opinion flawed rulings.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  And it wasn't good enough.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  And by the way, the president's allowed to challenge courts.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  It's historical.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  That's weird too.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  The opinion of many an unprecedented judicial overreach.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Absolutely.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  All right.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Linda in Pennsylvania.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  You're on the air worldwide.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Hi, Alex.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  And that's that clip is exactly what I'm calling.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  I know that's why I played the clip first.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  Go ahead.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  He, you know, he, he understands what that it's an overreach.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  The courts are wrong.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  Why can't he ignore this court crap and just go ahead and do the band regardless of what
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  the courts are saying if they have no substance to their cases?
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  Absolutely.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  I mean, we have the judicial, we have the VA, we have all these agencies in rebellion.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Rex Tillerson, they just won't even follow his orders.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  I mean, I think it's time like when Reagan, you know, ordered the air traffic controllers,
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  you know, fired or, you know, to jail.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  This is sedition and it's fraud for people to sit there and take their paychecks and
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  not follow it.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  But again, they're so entitled.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  This is the generation acts, which I'm part of.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  And I'm not saying we're all bad, but I mean, just look what we've turned into for the last
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  200 years because we've had so much freedom.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  And then the millennials and the generation Z, though, seems to be waking up.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  It's crazy.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  I guess they've hit bottom.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  Come on, the Russians have.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  You've got to come up sometime.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  But I just don't even know what to say at this point.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  What do you think?
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  So if these courts keep getting in his way, can we expect to see him just say, you know
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  what, we're going ahead with this?
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  Well, he is a Republican and I don't agree with everything that Lincoln did.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  It was a complex situation.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  Both the north and south were manipulated by British intelligence.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  I want to skip this break so we have more time.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  So actually the whole thing was bad, but Lincoln believed he was in the right.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  He was certainly overall a very intelligent, overall probably honorable man into a lot
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  of weirdness, though.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  But the point is that our first president from Illinois and our first Republican president
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  arrested hundreds of judges, governors, newspaper heads when they openly were clearly not following
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  the Constitution and blocking him during the Civil War.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  So I looked at Obama kept saying he was Lincoln when he's the party of the KKK.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  I mean, it's just true.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  I'm sorry.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  It's not.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  But here's the truth.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  The Republicans lost their soul in the mid sixties.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  They were the abolition movement to begin with in the 1800s.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  And then they got the Republican Party in and they did it all.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  And Christians were pushing it.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  And then the Democrats figured out with demographics that the Republicans were getting all the minorities.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  I mean, the minorities until like 1960s were like 90% voting for Republicans.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  And then they just suddenly the Democrats switched.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  And first thing, oh, we're the party of minorities.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  And strange enough, minorities bought into us.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  The Republicans panicked and said, we'll do the Southern strategy, at least in the South,
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  give them some rhetoric they want.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  They kind of reversed what Eisenhower had done with the, with the, you know, integration
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  and all of it really fast.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  It pissed people off.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  There was a backlash.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  The Democrats pivoted, jumped to being liberal.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  The Republicans didn't kind of pivoted in the South to kind of now being the new KKK in some areas.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Let's just be honest, they did kind of do it, but they weren't the real KKK.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  The real KKK has and always has been.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  And by the way, the KKK folks would rob anybody.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  They would go harass poor people.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  They would take land for everybody.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  It was just a game.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  At first it started as a secret army against the North ring occupation was something completely separate.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  Then it turned into what it is today.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  But today it's a total joke.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  In my grandfather's time, when he was, you know, ran as a Eisenhower Republican for county taxes.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  Sesser was super popular.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  He didn't care who you were.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  If you were poor, couldn't pay your taxes, you'd never pay him.
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  And to tell people like hundreds a year, don't bring pies to my house.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  Don't, you know, don't do this.
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  No, I can't take money from this.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  No, I can't do it.
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  But he wasn't, you know, he was a veteran from World War II.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  He saw people starving all over Europe, fought the Nazis.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  He didn't like it.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  He came back and bucked this whole family who weren't KKK, but they were, you know, Southern Democrats.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  And he was so respected, though, that some of them still really freaked out.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  He ended up turning them all around.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  They ended up becoming Republicans.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  But, you know, it's just to sit there and know the real history of what the Republicans did,
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  and how they just gave it up to the dirtbag Democrats will make your head spin.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  Because all of the countries, veterans came home, especially in the South, and said,
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  listen, we got to uplift people.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  We can't just sit there and treat black people like animals and do this anymore.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  So the Democrats got smart.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  That's why there's letters by LBJ written from the Driscoll Hotel, where he lived most of the time,
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  was Mistress, who I've interviewed many times where she died.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  And he says, I can't even say what's in those letters because MSNBC or Colbert Report will take it and say,
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  I said it, but go read LBJ letters about getting the N words to vote Democrat for 100 years.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  And he's liking these letters going, look at these uppity people, their own hotels and restaurants,
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  and segregation has made a whole other economy and they're getting out of control.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  But let me tell you, the Republicans think they got them.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  I'm going to do all this and get money to their women and then we'll set up government housing
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  and we'll get full control of these people and we'll have them vote Democrat for 100 years.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Don't worry, I got a plan for these people and you've seen it, man.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  And then MTV and gangster culture, folks are gone, but so are the white people.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  Anybody that listens to MTV or this garbage is gone and they know exactly what they're doing
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  and it is pure weaponized evil.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  And LBJ, I'm so proud of Texas, but he was a real Texan.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  This family goes back to the very start of it.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  Some of my friends, good friends are related to LBJ very closely.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  They're good people too.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  LBJ was just a bad seed, man.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  He was a gangster, a thug, had hit men all over the place and they're just a bad guy, man.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  But listen, he didn't just domesticate black people.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  He domesticated everybody.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  LBJ began breaking this country's back like nobody else.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  And he went to the social engineers and all of them and just McNamara, you name it.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  And they figured out a way to screw this country up and to take our strengths and turn it against us.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  Go ahead.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Anything else?
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  She's gone.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  Thank you so much, man.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  Great points.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Kay and Marilyn, then Dustin, Dave and DC.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  Go ahead, Kay.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  Hey, it's Kay Blades from Maryland.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  I just want to make a comment on the whole MTV and Snoop Dogg thing.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  I'm 33 now.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  I probably wrote my first rap back when I was like 15 and I was inspired by Snoop.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  Not because he was so awesome, because he said some of the dumbest things that I ever heard in my life in his rap.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  And I was like, if he gets all that stupid stuff and he's all famous with all of this, you know, glam around him.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  But you know, I've talked to a lot of the top rappers, you name it.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  Those famous founders of it.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  On purpose, there's great empowering rap and hip hop.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  They don't let it get on the charts.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  Oh, well, it's coming.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  I've got a new jam I just made called Trump Card.
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  And hopefully I get the video for it made up this week or this weekend.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  I'm just a new guy with a eight hour day job, cranking it out here for my family.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  But I work all the way up once my son was like five months old.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  I started looking into vaccines and all that.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  And it just just blew blew the top hole created where the rabbit hole is.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  And then I just kept on going.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  Let me say that your phone's a little distorted back off of it, but I'm going to give you some time here.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  Okay.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  And in just a moment, just back off the phone because I want to say this.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  I was talking to Millie Weaver.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  I've talked to Lee and Mackie about this for years.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  We've never had the crew, the staff.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  Plus when you start playing people's music, they're great.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  They sign a deal.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  All of a sudden this happens almost every time they're the label comes after us even though we help launch people.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  We're not asking for anything, but they think like we must be involved because we're helping launch something.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  I have the audience.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  Drudge has even bigger audience to help launch patriotic country music, hip hop, rap, rock, everything.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  It's so good.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  People submit it to us.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  But I just don't have the staff and people to get them to sign forms.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  I mean, here's an example.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  I've had Willie Nelson say you can play this song.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  I've had a shooter Jennings say can play this song, a bunch of others.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  I play it.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Six months later, my YouTube gets shut down because the record company hits me.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  I got to go find a contract, have a lawyer call them.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Record company tells me no way.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  But listen, I want to have a whole hour long show every day, bringing back good music, not wanting any money on our side to literally launch this to win.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  You are the secret weapon.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  I've heard the best rap, hip hop, hardcore stuff out there that understands the real paradigm that is so good.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  But then we never have the time to deal with it, contact them, get it on.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  So I believe me, I need a few crew members.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  I need the funding to set it up because I want to end up having a one or two hour show every day with talk radio that's like 80% music where we play everything.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  And I think it's going to be a mega hit.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  I just have to get the legal in place because believe me.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  Believe me.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  I mean, Willie Nelson has played this new song just for you.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Record company hits me a year later.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  Others, it just happens all the time.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  And so that's what happens.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  But believe me, sir, absolutely is what we want to do.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  So tell us about your new record where people can find it online because I want to find the really good stuff like Joy Vila.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Take her from, you know, number 40,000 on the charts to number one.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  And of course we didn't get a dime for that and of course we didn't just do it. Everybody did it. Drudge did it.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  The point is this is a war.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  I'm looking for the leaders.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  I'm looking for people that have courage.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  We're in this together and this is it.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  And we're going to sink or we're going to swim together.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  We're going to the stars together or we're going to blow ourselves up together.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  Doesn't mean we don't have problems and people hadn't done stuff to each other or whatever.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  It doesn't matter.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  We're living today.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  And the enemies of freedom worldwide are against Trump because he's real.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  Make no mistake about that.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Sorry, Kay.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  Go ahead.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  I'm ranting.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  I'm laughing and crying, sweating and bleeding, marching, fighting, whatever.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  You know, we, we in it together.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  We got to rebuild this culture that's been crushed by this garbage out here on TV and the media.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  It's nuts.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  But with the album that I just, just released as my first one, even though I've been rapping since I was 15,
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  but I just carved out a linoleum stamp and manually stamped each little envelope and put my album in there,
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  mastered up and was handing it out, just handing them out, handing them out.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Not charged.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Nothing just trying to get them.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  Awesome.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  What about digitally putting it out or putting it on YouTube?
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  I mean, what's the name of it?
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  How do folks find out?
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  Uh, my YouTube name is Daffy Duck.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  I got a couple of raps on there.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  Be more kind and a time wrap.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  Sure.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  All I'm saying is, I mean, I get stamping out your own records and sending them off to some stations,
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  but really the obvious way to do it is put it out with an article, post, you know, post your, post your stuff online
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  and then send it off to folks and then, and then tell people, I mean,
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  I've put your first few albums out until you hit traction saying this is fair use, open to the public.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  Then you can do remixes of it and actually, you know, make money, which everybody needs.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  That's what it's all about to be able to find your family and yourself and your ideas.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  We in the Liberty movement, the full spectrum of that true open diversity need to make money
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  and need to understand it's okay for us to make money.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  And so what I'm saying is you should put it out free and then hype it up, get a name for yourself
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  and then do paid releases, you know, that are even produced better.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Uh, so again, I would challenge you to do that.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  We're going to launch this very soon and I'm, I'm, I know it's the way to go.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  It's just, it's a, it's a landmine, it's a minefield, but believe me,
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  we're going to start a whole new YouTube channel, whole new Facebook, so it's separate.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  So if we get copyright issues, there won't be a problem.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. Okay.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  Absolutely.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  How we're going to defeat them is making art, making culture.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  Cause I have been in the room with the executives.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  I've heard about it from Hollywood movie people, executives, major rock stars
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  who were in the rooms and were told it doesn't matter you're selling 10 million records a year.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  We're going to put out gangster rap.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  I've talked to the rappers that were in the rooms that matter you're selling 10 million,
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  15 million records last year.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  You're not going to put out this stuff anymore.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  You're going to talk about killing and stealing and prison to get young people to go live like that,
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  to put them in prison.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  Now that's premeditated and that's evil.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  Let's go to Dave combat vet calling in from South Carolina.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Thanks for holding Dave.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  Yeah. Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  Good. Hey, went to the veteran center.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  I mean a veteran hospital yesterday in Columbia, South Carolina,
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  kind of resonated with you were talking about the VA kind of enemy in the gate,
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  so to speak, not at the gate, but in the gate.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  And just the people, man, they're just so different right now.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  One of the guys inside, it was in the waiting room in the merge to room.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  One of the guys was like, Oh, that Donald Trump, man.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  That's a terrible man.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  Was that one of the veterans or one of the employees?
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  One of the employees.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  Yo, here's the deal.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  They've been lazy.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  They've been bad.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  They've got death list.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Obama put them in computers to literally kill people.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  So they're executioners.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  They're the social engineers over the vets.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  They keep the eye on you.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  They take your rights.
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  You're the enemy there.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  They are the enemy within the gates.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  Not all of them, but the institution.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  So they want to test you and try to bully you.
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  So what you do is you videotape it.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  You you hidden camera.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  You show the Trump signed it and up.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  You're the vets.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  This is the real fight for the homeland.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  You get that out.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  You'll go to the next level.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  I'm going to come right back to you.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  I want to hear this day.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  And then we're going to, of course, the great American and media analyst, Mark Dice,
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  So exciting.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  After we talk today, we'll talk to Dustin, DC, Chris, Patrick and others.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  I got more Trump lifts coming up.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  But who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  It's Anthony Kumiya from New York City.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  Nothing more Americana than New York City when the people of New York are for America.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  It's Blue Ribbon Pride straight ahead.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  We're on the March.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  Monsanto's weed killer Roundup is one of the most used agricultural products around the planet.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  Its main ingredient, glyphosate, has been controversial as it has been linked to cancer.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  In a new lawsuit, Monsanto has been accused of manipulating research to hide the dangers of Roundup.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  Yolanda Mendoza, a regular user of Roundup with stage 4 cancer, is one of hundreds suing Monsanto,
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  citing a World Health Organization study that says glyphosate is probably carcinogenic.
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge declaring the state legally require Roundup
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  to warn its consumers of the potential to cause cancer.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  Order this from a Monsanto lobbyist.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  You want to drink some? We have some here.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  I'd be happy to actually. Not really, but...
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  Tell the truth.
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  It's dangerous to humans.
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  No, it's not.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's Roundup.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  Well, you know what the next boost is gonna be, don't you?
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  It's gonna be coming if you're good.
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all.
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  We ever wonder what happened to America.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  They lost.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  We won.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  Wanna see what drums up against.
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  It's time to ride, boys.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  We need a thousand pallet beers.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  And beef was for supper.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, wanna shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  Let's fix it.
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:08.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  We're in four hours live as we call it.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  Anthony Comey is coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  Mark Dice is a guy that after the show, I'm talking to him on the phone.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  We're in four hours live as we call it.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  Anthony Comey is coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  Mark Dice is a guy that after the show, I'm talking to him on the phone.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  I'm saying, Mark, you need to come to Austin, even if you don't want to come work with us or leave San Diego.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  We want to put your talents to work here with a whole crew and actually syndicate it on radio and kick ass.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  I know he's got his own life there, his own thing he's doing.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  He's like, I can't come to Austin.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  He told my producer today, I'm supposed to be doing laundry and stuff.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  That's a quote.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  Well, I'm going to make Watson probably move here too.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  Watson actually works for me for 16 years.
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  I want Mark Dice to work with us because again, he's very talented and he's a crew behind him.
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  He can even keep his apartment in San Diego.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  He can fly back there a couple of months out of the year.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  But it's just crazy because we need to promote the best people out there.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  But he's doing a great job.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  He does the great media analysis.
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  We played it last night and our expanded coverage where he just destroyed Rachel Maddow.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  But what's great is he did it first.
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  He's like right on it.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  It's kind of good.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  He's on the West Coast.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  A little bit earlier over there, later here, he gets out stuff that other people don't.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  But very, very excited to see what he's doing.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  I'm going to go back to Dave here to finish up his call.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  I'm going to write to Mark Dice, talk about the whole state of the world, what's going on.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  You name it at markdice.com, author, publisher, a media analyst, you name it.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  Let's go to Dave.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Dave, finish up your point about, so you're at the VA.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  The VA employees are badmouthing the Commander-in-Chief because they're a bunch of lazy pieces of garbage
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  that had death panels and death computers that would decide to not treat people that say,
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  you know, had a clogged artery.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  You know, 45-year-old vets, people that could have clear treatment, they're murdering them.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  So, of course, these people have rationalized what they're doing.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  The two things really quick before I lose my train of thought.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  Where do I take all the pictures and all the stories I've got?
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  Because they seem to be lost in translation.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  They can't seem to get them anywhere.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  The whole unit, we've been struggling a lot trying to get stuff anywhere.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  Do you have any...
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  One problem in America is the telephones are so bad now, but I'm saying, where do you...
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  Are you trying to send us pictures or videos?
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  Well, I don't know.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  I don't know who to send it to.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  Yes, send it to Trump support.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  That's where vets send us tips.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  Trump support at infowars.com.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  We're adding new photos.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  We should show it right now.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  Every day, we're going to create a special link.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  We have an article right now about it.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  A national movement launched by troops and veterans to support Trump.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  And we're going to create a whole webpage, a whole section.
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  We have an article right now.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  In fact, if you guys go ask Don, we can put it on screen.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  And we're going to be adding more photos of troops supporting Trump.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  We're going to be doing articles about it.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  But just like this veteran congressman goes in with both his legs blown off
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  and puts the sign up, you know, there in Palm Beach, Florida,
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  that's what veterans can do.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  It's not just send us photos saying you support Trump.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  It's whatever you think's best.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  InfoWars mobilizes grassroots military support for Trump.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  We have photos to Trump support at infowars.com.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  And that's the article from yesterday.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  There's going to be new articles all the time.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  You scroll through it.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  You see the troops doing it, you know, famous Navy SEALs,
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  heads of SEAL teams, you name it, coming on the broadcast.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  You know, such elite troops.
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  They came to tell you what units they were in.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  And then just all doing basic stuff and saying, look,
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  we know he's not a Russian agent.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  We know that McCain's wrong saying that Senator Rand Paul's a Russian agent.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  He's going to have a war with Russia.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  I mean, this is, it's those small steps.
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  I'm with Trump.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  Let these folks know they don't speak for you.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  And will info wars save the world?
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  Will each vet save the world?
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  No, but together we'll do it.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  Dave, God bless you.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  All right.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  Let's go to Mark Dice.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  That's a great question.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  You know, Mark has a degree in media, in radio television film,
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  and in analyzing media.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  He's kind of a political scientist of media.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  And for over 12 years, he's been just dominating.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  Got to be billions of views total, hundreds of millions on his own YouTube channel.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  But what I love about Mark is he's accelerating.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  And I'm not lecturing Mark, but he really should listen to me.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  I told Paul five, six years ago, you're going to do weekly videos.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  You're going to come on.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  You're going to tweet or I'm going to cut your pay in half.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  I pay Paul.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  Well, he serves it.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  He said, okay, Alex.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  And I sent him the map.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  He's better than I am on air.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  Let's just admit it, at least to many audiences.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Mark's as good as I am or better in many ways.
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  Okay, so I said, Mark, stop trying to have national TV shows.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  You've already have them.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  They don't do anything.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  I've done them too.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  Be yourself.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  You will dominate.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  I'm not bragging here.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Now I'm telling Mark, move to Texas, set you up good.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You can run your own awesome program.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  You can share in the victory.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  We need him because I don't have the money or crew to set up in San Diego.
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  I need the best minds and Mark Dice is one of them.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  And I just decided to go ahead and just say it on air.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  There's total transparency here.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Mark, I can't even get Mark out here though.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  So I'll find out what you're going to lose, Mark.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  If you come out, you're coming out here in the next few weeks.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  Paul's coming here in a few weeks for two weeks.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  You must come to the mothership.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  I want you here, not to like be under my even command.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  You're smart.
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  You don't say something you can get sued for.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  The kind of guy I need is like an editor.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  I want to build a whole nother mothership.
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  See, I want a big mothership factory.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Not that I'm in charge of one mothership.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  They can blow that up.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  I want to have a big mothership factory.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  See, but I need somebody that can command a mothership.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  There's only Drudge and Info Wars and Breitbart.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  The others aren't even mothers.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  We need motherships.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  We need command attack information warfare aircraft carriers.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  You understand?
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  We need weapons platforms.
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  We need leaders.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  I need you to join the Info War, Mark Dush.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  You've been a big part of it, but now's the time.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  I know I'm ranting.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  Go ahead.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  I thought you'd really made it when Hillary Clinton called you out,
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  but I think it's almost as big of a badge of honor to get called out
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  by Saturday Night Live.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  And that just goes to show that they finally are really admitting
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  that they're losing the information war.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  And Rachel Maddow's pathetic stunt with her bombshell Donald Trump tax returns.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Not only was it an absolute egg on her face instance,
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  really eclipsing Geraldo's opening of Al Capone's vault.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  It took 30 years for someone to finally top the most overhyped, epic fail,
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  live television reveal.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  But Rachel Maddow did it by hyping up this big bombshell of Donald Trump's taxes,
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  which were going to finally expose his ties to the Russians.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  And it's the smoking gun to finally bring impeachment charges and get them taken down.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  And of course, not only was it nothing, but it actually only just helped him.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And it made Obama and Bernie Sanders, Mitt Romney and others look even worse,
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  because Trump pays a higher percentage of tax than them.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  She goes on last night on Jimmy Fallon, the Tonight Show,
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  not to make fun of herself for overhyping this,
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  not to apologize for this ridiculous clickbait tweet that she sent out hyping up her event,
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  but to actually brag and be egged on and encouraged by Jimmy Fallon
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  about how this was still some supposed big bombshell story.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  This isn't news. They're not news.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  These are enemy propaganda.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  They are conscious. Exactly. That's a great point I hadn't thought of.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  They're still trying to sell a dead corpse.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  Everybody's laughing at her.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  The arrogance level of even after they've taken a fraud,
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  sold to hoax, they're now regurgitating the same fraud in a confidence game,
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  and it's not working. What the hell's their problem?
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  Their audience has become children, and that's why people are flocking to the alternative sources.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  That's why people are getting so popular.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  Smaller people like me over the last 10 years have been just slowly chugging along,
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  chugging along like the little engine that could and now getting some decent viewers,
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  and they're absolutely scrambling.
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Come on, decent viewers. You have millions a week.
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Please stop. We're not trying to brag. I want to be clear.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  It's not about bragging, but we're bigger than they are.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  Drudge is the biggest website in the world after MSM.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  It's number two, and MSM's like billions of emails or something, so it's not even.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  It's all BS. Drudge is the biggest thing in the world,
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  and they have articles every week, Drudge is dead, Drudge is nothing.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  We need to celebrate the fact that we, in the marketplace of ideas,
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  we've won the Super Bowl over and over again like the Patriots.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  There's such phonies if you look at some of the CNN hosts
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  and even some of the folks in the other media outlets, like Geraldo Rivera,
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  he barely has 100,000 Twitter followers.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Someone like Cuomo over at CNN, Chris Cuomo,
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  he has supposedly a million Twitter followers.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  They're like what, 90-something percent of Obama's and Michelle's were fake?
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  He can barely get a dozen.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  I can buy a million Twitter followers tomorrow.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  Paul Watson has like 500,000, I have like 700,000 or something on our channels.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  We're more than that with all of them.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  The point is he has more than the BBC combined in actual reading impressions,
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  and now they're starting to block it.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  We're kicking their butt up one side and now on the other, they're striking back.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Yeah, and first they tried with the fake news that didn't work that backfire
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  and now they're kind of even regretful that they even launched that term.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  And even Jake Tapper, another fake news analyst over at CNN,
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  is admitting that his seven-year-old son calls him fake news in order to taunt him.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  And so they kind of regret concocting this label.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Well, let me ask you that.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Why do you think you're popular with like, so when I found 30 and up like I am,
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  which is a key thinking demographic up to old folks,
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  but let's just face it, Paul Watson, people like that are super hot,
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  people like 10 years old, about 20 or 18.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  That's the demographic the globalists really want.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Everywhere at my kid's school, other schools, softball games, you name it,
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  everyone just runs around, oh, you're Alex Jones,
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  you're the one that has Paul Watson or Gavin McGinnis,
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  other people on Sometimes or PewDiePie or whatever.
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  So why do you, what's happening there, Mark Dice?
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  Why is Generation Z on fire totally recognizing that their parents and the liberals are fake?
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  What's happening?
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  Well, now that they're finally kind of coming of age,
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  they're not necessarily children anymore and they've been living in this environment
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  that has been trying to control them and tell them what they can and cannot say
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  and has been feeding them these bizarre narratives that are-
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  But why are you and I then more popular with young folks but also middle-aged?
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  Why isn't these certain shows that are popular with the kids? Go ahead.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  Well, let's face it, a lot of the information on the smartphones,
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  it's sort of pseudo-synopsis crack.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  It just triggers the dopamine receptors in people's brains.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  Let's say Paul Watson changes the subject every 15 seconds.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  It's great, it's riveting, but it's designed for kids with no attention span.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  People's attention spans are literally that of a goldfish
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  and that's why people watch people play video games online.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  And so the media, they're really entertainment, but they're also enemy propaganda.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  I mean, realistically, CNN, ABC, CBS, all these major liberal outlets-
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  Wasn't that pure truth when Trump said they're the enemy media?
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  They are the enemy of the people because they're not news.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  They're not even liberal news outlets.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  When you look at BET, at least you know what they are.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  They're black entertainment television, which, by the way, you're speaking of Lil' Bawaw in the previous segment.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  The founder of BET, now the wife, the co-founder, admits that she's ashamed of what it's become
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  because they started it back in the 80s as a cable channel for black people and black interests.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  It was then sold to Viacom, one of the big six media companies.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  And she has come out recently and admitted that she's ashamed at what it has become
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  because they obviously just exploit and perpetuate the very worst stereotypes
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  or aspects of thug and ghetto culture.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  And so that's why we see people celebrating what Lil' Bawaw has said.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  And so we're seeing a lot of the young kids as they're coming of age,
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  they're realizing that this system has been so phony, so fraudulent, they're empty inside, they're not satisfied,
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  their relationships are in shambles, they have no real job prospects.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  And so they're trying to find out what it is that's going on.
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  That's why they're flocking to people like me, people like you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  There's a whole crop of, you know, sort of mid-20-year-old millennials now
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  popping up on YouTube that are getting pretty big audience.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  Exactly, so let me ask you this, they're going to strike back with censorship,
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  we'll talk about that in a moment, but look at Bawaw's tweet.
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  His uncle says, you know, kill Trump, shoot the police, spram with bullets,
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  you cover it, we cover it, people are pissed.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  He then says, yo, or a-yo, real Donald Trump, shut your punk ass up talking bleep
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  about my uncle at Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  That's slavery. These millennials don't seem to get.
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  You're threatening, your uncle's threatening to kill the president.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  He responds and says, it's not nice.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  And then you act butthurt and say you want to kidnap and rape his wife, basically.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  I mean, what the hell do they have no, what is wrong with these people?
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  A lot, clearly. And that's why these major news outlets like CNN, the counterfeit news network,
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  they'll take the most minuscule little thing that Donald Trump said that's perhaps controversial.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  And they'll talk about it for three days, for five days, for the entire news cycle.
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  But something like this, it just disappears.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  You may recall the thugs that live tortured that poor guy on Facebook Live.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  That story disappeared. It was mentioned literally once.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  It was perhaps one segment, a 30-second segment on most of these news outlets.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  It disappeared and vanished.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  Now, the media could take a story like that and talk about it for a week, two weeks.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  They could have turned this kid into the next Trayvon Martin.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  That's what they do with their chosen stories.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  They'll pick a certain case and they'll blow it up, turn the person into a martyr,
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  or turn someone into a hero.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  So it's lying by omission, too, because look at the 474 reported pedophiles,
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  30-plus kids in dungeons, confirmed by the police.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  You rescue kids in sex dungeons, 30-plus in California and LA.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  We know Trump's behind exposing it.
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  We have from Eric Prince, CIA, you name it, that are fighting.
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  I can't get into the details, but it's amazing.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  It's covered one time that they found 30 kids in slave dungeons.
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  You can't say that there's not collusion when, if you watch the big three major networks,
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, their evening news shows,
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  they'll have the same stories when it's not a big national story.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  It's an isolated incident, a little story.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  It'll be one white guy allegedly raped a woman.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  They'll just put it out because white guys are rapists,
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  but then they'll cover up a bunch of Muslim rapes.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  There's obvious certain stories that are going to be the top stories
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  that everyone's talking about that should be covered on all major news networks,
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  but then there's other stories which are isolated incidences or local issues that they'll pick,
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  and then all of a sudden, just mysteriously, they're on all of the major networks.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  Sure, and as a media analyst, you're obsessed with that, you should be,
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  but I think the public gets it, so now we're able, with Drudge and others,
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  to actually look at real news, make it the meme, that's why they want to block us.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  I notice what they kill is our stuff that's going viral.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  Now, though, they banned almost all of Paul's articles this week on Facebook,
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  and all I'm saying is, brother, you have your followers and listeners,
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  please do a report about it, because if it happens to you, I'm going to talk about you.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  People don't think Enforce is too big to not need help.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  They're hitting us hard, man.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  Facebook, Twitter, they banned almost all Paul's articles this week.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  I mean, it's getting bad, and they admit they are.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  Google announced Drudge has it today.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  They're going to start, quote, you know, blocking fake news.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  That means anything is truthful, so this is on, man.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  What should we do about that?
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  We need to just ramp it up.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  We need to keep exposing them, and we're just growing.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  That's why they're going to panic, really, because your audience,
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  the truth is just spreading and spreading and spreading,
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  and so we need to actually go old school, like Matt Drudge has been suggesting for some time,
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  instead of using these social media ghettos to rely on to get your information.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Just have blurbs that say, I can't post here.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  Go to my site to see it.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  Well, in bookmarkinforce.com, bookmark Drudge Report on your browser.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  Instead of just following sites on Facebook who are obviously going to filter.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  Yeah, don't use it as your web portal.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  Just like folks went away from using something as their homepage or, you know,
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  the old, you know, nav bars at the top.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Just stop using them as your launch page.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  That's the end of them if you just do it.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  And that's why I think, you know, Drudge treated out last week that the Facebook page
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  for, quote, official Drudge Report and Matt Drudge were not his.
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  And so obviously they were started by a fan, and so then people started following it,
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  not knowing whether it was his or not.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  They weren't verified pages.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  They didn't have the blue check, but they still had 1.2 million followers on one of the pages.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  He had an official page in between million.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  It wasn't Drudge's page.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  He didn't start it.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  He wasn't posting there.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  And so I think he had it pulled because he doesn't want people.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Sure, in a sense, we have to do that ourselves.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  It's nice that folks have sites in my name.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  Then they start putting like on purpose, obviously, racist stuff or whatever the news is like,
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  why do you, why are you doing this?
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  And that's why he had it pulled because people, he doesn't want people to rely on scrolling
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  through your Facebook feed.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  So we need to go.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  It's basically stealing your identity too, because if you let somebody else, fan pages
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  are great, but then it becomes a problem when they give it to somebody else and then they
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  want to sabotage it.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  And then you see instances like what happened with the, you know, when people start tweeting
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  out things on parody Twitter accounts or fan Twitter accounts that get mistaken for real
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  tweets, we see Maxine Waters and other people started talking about a fake tweet that Michael
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  Flynn allegedly posted.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  It was from a fake account.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  I mean, Tommy Lahren was tweeting or was, was, was trending on Twitter a couple weeks ago
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  because saw a fake Twitter account, tweeted some racist things.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  And so everybody starts freaking out calling her racist.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  She's one of the top trends on Twitter.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  That's real fake news.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  And that's why we just need to keep talking to people, really get off of these ghettos
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  like Drudge said.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  That's why I think you guys are doing so well, having your own platform.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  Mark, I agree with you.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  Look at this right here.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Was Obama inside of Robert Gibbs behind McDonald's anti-Trump tweet Gibbs now McDonald's chief
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  communications officer.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  He's over it.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  He's the guy that famously said, I lie to the public all the time.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  I lie about drones.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  I lie about taxes.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  I lie and laughs at us like we're dumb efforts like Zuckerberg and Gruber say.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  And then you read on, I mean, he's a prime suspect.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  He's over it.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  And they put up this anti-Trump tweet about his small hands and how he's a jerk or whatever.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  I mean, look, my gut tells me it's Gibbs.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  What do you think?
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  You know, I think that they have a social media manager that uses something like tweet
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  DAC or has multiple Twitter accounts that they're managing through various software,
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  you know, API platforms.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  And I think that this was someone who thought that they were logged into their own account
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  but was actually logged into the McDonald's account, their social media manager, and then
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  didn't realize that they tweeted it from the wrong account.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  And that's why McDonald's was very careful saying that, well, Twitter told us, we are
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  investigating.
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  There's no police investigation.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  There's no police report.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  What Twitter told them, I think they're talking about the flood of responses because if somebody
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  hacked into Twitter's accounts, the hacker is certainly going to be tech savvy enough
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  to realize that when you respond to someone's tweet without putting a character in front
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  of the at real Donald Trump, that it only shows up to the people who mutually follow
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  those two accounts.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  So if the hacker wanted everybody who's following the McDonald's account to see them slamming
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  Donald Trump, they wouldn't have tweeted just once.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  And they certainly wouldn't have just replied to Trump or they wouldn't have just replied
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  in that manner.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  They would have quoted the tweet.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Sure.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  Why did they pin it to the top?
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  I didn't know that they pinned it to the top.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  That's okay.
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Well, now that changes everything right there.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  I don't even know how it all works.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  I mean, you're better at this than I am.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  I'm just asking you.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  I got Paul's good at it, isn't he?
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  So let me ask you this.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  What do we do, though, as they start to strangle us?
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  Look, I get, we're getting more radio stations, you know.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  But I mean, tell you, they are, they are decimating us on Facebook, on YouTube.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  They've admittedly have all these governors blocking stuff being spread.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  We have three million subscribers on our channels, two million on one.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  They, most people don't get the subscription.
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  I guess people just have to remember, like you said, to pin our page, to remember it
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  and come back to it and then spread it.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  If our listeners just keep spreading articles, keep spreading videos.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  We'll beat this.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  What do you have to know?
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  This is a war.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  This isn't about me making more money or Mark dies.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  I'm so happy right now.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  I don't ever need more money in my life.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I got my family got a ranch.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  I don't need anything.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  I don't want to have a bunch of crap.
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  I got a Dodge, you know, car.
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  I love it.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  I want to beat these people that literally think the country belongs to them that want
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  to brainwash our kids, take full control of society.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  They're not leaving us alone.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  They're bullies.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  So my full will is against these people.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  You know, people think they just go old school again and start communicating again.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  I mean, it's become common knowledge that people, it's almost a joke where people don't
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  talk on the phone.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  They just communicate through social media, which is not communicating because in 60 seconds
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  verbally on the phone or face to face over at a barbecue, you can communicate more information
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  than you could in pretty much 30 minutes, tweeting it out or texting it.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  Again, it's human communication.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  It's not what somebody else did sending it out.
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  And I'm not saying don't send our stuff out, but more listeners should create their own
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  YouTube or Facebook accounts or their own site and whatever it is, whether it's gardening
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  or whether it's, you know, stargazing or birdwatching, whatever it is or music, just your own humanity
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  that isn't centralized and controlled, that will bring them down.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Going old school, like I said, I can't stress enough to bookmark certain pages.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  You go and then check out your three, four, five favorite news sources directly and then
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  that way you're not being filtered through Facebook.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  I tried boosting posts on Facebook.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  A lot of people may not be familiar with this.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  Even paid.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  It doesn't work.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  It's a joke for those aren't familiar.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  When you have a fan page or a public page like Alex and I have, you, they restrict the distribution
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  of our posts.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  And so in order to allow those posts to be distributed and show up on people's news feeds, they ask
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  us to pay them.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  And so you can go through the budget and I mean, it's something like like $4,000.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  It's a total scam.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  We've done it.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  It doesn't work.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  And then meanwhile, our own people go, our listeners go and post it.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  Let's spam and take it off.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  And then again, they're taking stuff off our own page.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  They won't even let us know if it's bought like a, like a senator comes on.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  They delete that.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  I know when something's really credible and really big, they just block it.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  Well, it's incredible.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  I've had multiple videos demonetized from YouTube.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  I mean, for well over a year, year and a half, and they say it's sensitive content.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  We just will allow you to have it on here, but we're not going to let you run ads on this.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  Meanwhile, the same exact story or the same exact clip is shown on CNN's page on some big
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  liberal.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  Hollywood's run these big monopoly screwing everybody.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  It's all coming to an end.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Undoubtedly it's coming down.
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  Even if they try to shut us down, they can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  How do you predict in the next five years?
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  Look at the future.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  How is this all going to end?
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  What do you see in five years?
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  I think they're going to try to try to bring down some other big YouTubers like PewDiePie
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  only not just entertainers.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  I think they're going to start to come after people.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  The credit is showing effects.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Everybody rolls over.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  Yeah.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  And they're going to try to hit us financially.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  We just saw BuzzFeed published an article targeting certain news YouTube channels naming
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  Paul Joseph Watson specifically.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  Oh, he's the target.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  They're scared of him.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  And they're trying to go after us financially.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  And they're going to say, well, we'll allow you to maybe still have your channel.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  They're telling their people, go flag this shut down Paul Watson because his average
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  video has five million views that they cannot stand it.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  They cannot stand it.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  When you look at the propaganda they're putting out on the official, you know, YouTube creators
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  pages, they're always a 50% thumbs down.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  I mean, you look at it and nobody wants what YouTube's force feeding.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Well, that's why they kicked Jay Leno off of the NBC tonight show.
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  He was number one for almost 20 years.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  They replaced him with Jimmy Fallon.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  And that's because I know behind the scenes, he's also that the guy's actually a libertarian
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  patriot.
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  He's a great guy.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  He is a great guy.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  He's a great guy in politics because he went after everyone pretty, pretty equally.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  But Leno openly is an Americana guy.
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  And he didn't, the execs didn't like him.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  He bucked out of people that work on the show and people that know Jay.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  I'm leaving it at that.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  Jay is a patriot.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  Jay's a listener.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I've been told six years ago, Jay's a listener, but I'm going to stop.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  I mean, hell Jay plugged me 18 years ago on air.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  Go ahead.
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  There's a clip of Jimmy Kimmel on David Letterman back in 2008 or 2009 when Jimmy Kimmel got
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  into the show.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.500]  And he told, he told David Letterman that he was actually surprised and he wishes that
[2:57:26.500 --> 2:57:30.000]  Letterman would have told him that he would be lying for a living.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  And he would, he has to lie about liking the television shows.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  He has to lie about liking the celebrities.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  He has to promote all these different products and television shows.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  And that's what these people do.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  A lot of them, when they, when they sign those.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  And Jay Leno isn't a horse, even though he had top ratings, just like Larry King.
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Larry King wasn't perfect, but he was his own guy.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  They couldn't tell him what to do.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  When he's gone, they put in Pierce Morgan total failure.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  Do five more minutes with us, my friend.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  There's Mark Dice.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  Find his books more at markdice.com.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  I can say go to his Twitter or Facebook.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  They're much bigger, but that will be gone next week.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  This is a war folks.

[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  That's at cost, by the way.
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  And like competitors have the same amount of one ingredient costs 45 bucks.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  This costs a third of that.
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  And it is half off right now.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  infowarslive.com.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  We'll be back with the fourth hour.
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  Anthony Coomia coming up in about eight minutes.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  I'm going to finish up with Mark Dice.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  Stay with us.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  It's a war folks.
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  You cannot high pal real.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  We have the new product at infowarslive.com, bio true selenium.
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium.
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  And just recently we were able to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must haves.
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  I'm taking it now every day.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  This is so key.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  Bio true selenium is the product.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  Excusably available at infowarslive.com or by calling toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:59:49.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  All right, Mark Dyson's here.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  I got more calls.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  Dustin and Joe and BC and Jim and Patrick and I apologize I haven't gotten to yet.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  I need to get to your calls.
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  We also have another guest host coming up.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  It does a great job.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  Anthony Cumia in closing here, Mark.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  We're back in force.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  We're ranting about this.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  I just hope listeners and myself don't miss the fact that history is happening.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  The elite is collapsing.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  Nationalist movements are exploding.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  The rediscovery of humanity.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  Normal human culture is here.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  They've tried to jam that attack that people are organically going back to it.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  Kind of like bugs.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  You spray with pesticides.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Some become immune.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  This is an exciting time to be alive.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  What more do you want to say?
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  What else do you see coming in the future?
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  This is finally restoring the Republic.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  This is what we've been fighting for.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  For you for 20 years.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Me for 12 years.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  We've had a tremendous victory.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  It's exciting to see we're taking back the country.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  We're taking back the culture.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  And this small minority, this very loud, active and well-funded minority of social justice warriors are absolutely scrambling now because they're losing control.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  And every attack that they try to make against us now just blows up in their face.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  We have the president of the United States calling out major news networks as fake news, the very label that they had literally coined in order to try to demonize.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  And then they're retreating.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  They're retreating saying, don't use it too late, too late.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  They're admitting that it had backfired.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  Washington Post, which literally coined the term, is admitting and slayed and all these other liberal outlets are admitting that it's backfired.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  And when the president of the United States is now calling, very creators of this term, the name that they use to try to demonize and shut down the rising alternative independent media, you know that they have a serious problem.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  And you can look at their numbers.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  Their Twitter followers are fake.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  You can look at the likes.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  You can buy likes and retweets as well.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  But look at the engagement.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Nobody's watching these people.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Nobody cares.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  Oh, they're dead.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  And big corporations are desperate.
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  Okay.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  The old lies didn't work.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  Triple the lies.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  But now we're seeing liberal brainwashing collapsing on YouTube and Facebook.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  Their resistance is collapsing.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  I think that's why the, I think that's why the censorship is intensified, trying to bolster their own trips.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  But it's like Hitler at the Battle of the Bulge.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  He's only slowing down his final defeat.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  You know, the liberals are sort of like, Hillary got left at the altar at the wedding and all the guests arrived.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  The reception tables were set.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  The meals were cooked and ready to serve.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  And then all of a sudden, Hillary got left at the altar.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  Exactly.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  They're still, they're still real heartbroken.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  They're upset.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  And they keep getting these false sense of hope with the, oh, a recount.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  We're going to get a recount.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  No, you're not.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  We're going to have the electoral college shut them down.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  No.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Then they just keep getting more and more desperate like Rosie O'Donnell.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  Now the intelligence committee came out and said, okay, they were spying on Trump.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  It's insane.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  And, you know, to say that there's not a shadow government working against him is absurd.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  And he can't even get his pictures hung up at the VA.
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  The fact that they're so viciously against him goes to show that they're getting desperate because.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  They're not certified Trump is pure gold at the whole globalist enemy from the Communist Chinese, the Islamists.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  They're all just crapping themselves.
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  This is delicious irony.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  This is great.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  You know, I think this is the reprieve of Nineveh, man.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  This was the hand of God stopping the final destruction of this country.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  We were right at the edge.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  I mean, we were, we were, we were this close to the point.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  And by the way, I've prayed about this and I know I've studied history in the Bible.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  God didn't do this because of us.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  The ancestors were so good and that because of their work, we've been given this final reprieve.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  If we don't take this, we'll be destroyed.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  Go ahead.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  A lot of people fell asleep at the wheel and just sort of let things go and got lost in an entertainment wasteland.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  But this is, this is the great awakening now.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  And not only is it, you know, reflective, but in the audience that you have that I have,
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  but it's also showing with the youth because I'm telling you in the last year, really six months.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  I mean, I've seen so many, you know, young college kids, millennials popping up on YouTube and getting involved.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  And that's what scares them.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  We're seeing a whole new crop of millennial commentators now on Fox News, Writers for the Hill,
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  that article that you wrote that you read about Pow Wow on the Hill that's linked up on Drudge Report.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  That was written by a millennial.
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  That's right. Stay there.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  I'm going to say body in the break and coming up.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  In his latest move to cut into the budget, President Trump has proposed killing all funding for PBS, NPR,
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  and the National Endowment for the Arts.
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  This budget cut would include 445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  148 million from the National Endowments,
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  and 230 million from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  This budget cut totals 823 million, 0.02% of the bloated U.S. government's
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  200th of a percent of the bloated U.S. government's $4.6 trillion budget.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  Now, the tears will start to flow with this proposition,
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  but this is President Trump coming through on his promise to cut into the budget.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  And when you're a businessman that sees trillions in debt and a constant deficit,
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  sacrifices have to be made.
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  This is just a proposal, so no.
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  Your local library or museum is not shutting down, and Big Bird will be on tomorrow.
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  As for some of these operations, the federal funding is not its lifeblood.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  But for those to which it is, this is a warning sign to start making money or start looking for a new job.
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  The U.S. taxpayer isn't footing your bills anymore.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  Today, we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com,
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom,
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself in ForwardsLife.com today.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  Let's go to Debit in Florida. Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.

[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  vitamin, and infusion. I've got the body armor.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's amazing.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  That's really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys, I love the info, it's true.
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  just buy it, you will love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  It's a win-win, infowarslife.com.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  Hey, we have the Anthony Cumia liners. Even if I'm like running into his show, we need to run Anthony Cumia
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  live from New York or Florida where he's at today, joining us with his great media organization.
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  We're going to tell you about the great work he's doing.
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  I just want to spend a few minutes with him because I want to pick his brain about what's happening.
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  Let's cue that clip up. John McCain says that Rand Paul works for Vladimir Putin.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  I thought he worked for Santa Claus, but we'll go to that in a moment.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  And you've got all these great job numbers coming in.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  You've got the best small business startups since 1984, peak of the Reagan recovery.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  You've got the whole world just rushing into the U.S. now that we're open for business.
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  All this happening, and you've got Snoop Dogg saying kill the president.
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  His nephew saying kidnap his wife, put her in sex slavery.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  You've got just that intro liner.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  I've been there in those type of liners for 20 years, deep behind enemy lines, female region six.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  Under globalism. America's being taken over by multinationals.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  And as I say, if Trump succeeds, I won't run those promos anymore.
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  Intro saying deep behind enemy lines, female region six.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  But I mean, I'm in a U.N. stronghold, a model U.N. city, where they have all this social engineering
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  and high taxes, just like New York or San Francisco.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  And they admit they're doing it to screw the little guy.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  And then the VA, not just in Florida, we're learning all over the country.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  Won't hang up Trump pitchers. They won't hang them up in federal buildings.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  There's a total revolt of all these lazy jerks.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  And then the federal judges, again, connection to the Ninth Circuit, they come out and say,
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  oh, we're just ignoring the travel ban from countries that don't even have passports or airfields at work.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Just random people from basically barbarian hellholes.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  Barbarians saying something, actually. They live better than folks in these countries.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  I feel sorry for these folks, but they can't just come here.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  And so there's just this open revolt by the shadow state that just thinks it owns everything.
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  The good news is everything they do turns to crap.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  Everything they do blows up in their face, but they don't care.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  They're just moving forward.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  So what happens when the immovable object runs into the unstoppable force?
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  That there was a C.S. Lewis book, the unstoppable force.
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  I read that like 20 years ago or more than that.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  God, I'm getting old. Maybe I was like 12 years old.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  30 years ago, got a money longer than that.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  So here we are. What's going to happen?
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Because everybody saying kill the president, even newspapers say,
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  are you allowed to say that now? They're organ.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  And it's a bunch of wimps.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  Well, you get the biggest armed force in history,
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  100 plus million armed gun owners, 50 plus million veterans,
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  a lot of military age who don't want trouble, but are done.
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  And then Snoop says, kill the president, shoot cops in a video,
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  brags about it and tweets, yeah, you ought to die.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  His little punk Bow Wow comes out and says, ah, shut up.
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  Don't criticize my uncle or I'll kidnap your wife,
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  put her in a gang rate facility like the Muslims do.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  So he said, and he's bitching like,
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  how dare the president say something back
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  when my uncle says he wants to kill you?
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  How dare you? You're supposed to just roll over and let us kill you.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  Now Bow Wow's deleted that.
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  So Anthony Cumia joins us.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Anthony, I'm going to let you take over.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  I apologize for jumping into your show.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  Of course, it's a compoundmedia.com.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  The Cumia show, C-U-M-I-A show on Twitter while we're still there.
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  We've been strangled back 90% the last month
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  on Facebook, Google, Twitter, you name it.
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  It's okay. The listeners are coming to us.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  Our numbers have gone up here, but you've been fired off everywhere
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  for being a conservative or libertarian
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  or just a common sense guy.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  You know, you had the top show on XM,
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  and we had a huge show on XM for like eight years,
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  and they said, oh, sorry,
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  we're 100-plus hosts who were being kicked off two years ago
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  because Obama wants you off.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  They would tell you, are you going to back off Obama
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  or are you going to be off here?
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  And we're supposed to just roll over like the Soviet Union.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  Oh, you know, we're popular.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  We're just telling the truth.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  Mom and Apple Pie, here, just kick us off the air.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  The problem is the people now are awake.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  They know what's going on. They're coming to us.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  So where do you see this whole fight going?
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  No more banner. I'm going to turn it over to you.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  Anthony and Cumia, thank you, sir.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  Thank you. Thank you, Alex.
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  I love this.
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  I was getting all pumped up listening to Alex
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  and Mr. Dice there.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  It's just amazing.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  I feel like re-energized.
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  We've wanted something like this for so long.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  We've been sitting around under at least the eight years of Obama,
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  and even before that, feeling powerless.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  Just feeling so powerless, nothing we could possibly...
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  And we didn't say kill anybody when Obama was doing bad stuff.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  Imagine if you were, I said, kill Obama.
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  It'd be in 500 newspapers or more tomorrow.
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  We'd be arrested.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  The double standard is unbelievable with the left.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  That little punk bow-ow talks about prostituting,
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  sending the first lady putting her out on the street.
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  And I was saying on Twitter, I was like,
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  can you imagine if a country artist,
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  because they deem country artists as horrid racists anyway,
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  a country artist would have said the same thing
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  about Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  They would have been shunned from society.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  Never mind just reprimanded or forced to apologize.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  They would have been removed from society
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  never to be heard from again.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  But that stuff just wasn't happening.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  People tried to equate it with Ted Nugent,
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  who used to speak actually quite accurately about Barack Obama,
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  who saw that as being horrible and racist and terrible.
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  Well, the guy, after that, pretty much has to live on his own compound
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  in the middle of nowhere and play guitar for his fans on Periscope.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  He has been shunned.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  Oh, what about Ted Nugent?
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  He said some things.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Yeah, and look where he is.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  He had shows canceled, sponsors that canceled on him.
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  Believe me, Ted Nugent is an outcast of society
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  because of his political views.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  But because of him and other people's courage,
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  and you got fired too, we're here.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  We kicked their ass.
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  But a lot of people, including myself,
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  we lost 5 million just last month.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  3.3 last year was scheduled to make 5 plus million this year.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  Google just said you can't run ads for frickin' multivitamins.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  I mean, I don't make money outside of here.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  I can just be cold-blooded business guy and make 10 times the money.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  I'm not stupid.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  And it's just crazy.
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  I take money from outside to find the truth,
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  and then they cut that off.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  They're going to great lengths.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  As you were explaining before, the desperation is palpable.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  It's amazing how desperate the left and globalists
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  and corporations have gotten at this point because they see,
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  uh-oh, they've cracked the surface.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  They got a guy in there now who's not one of the regular players.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  We are in trouble.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  That's their desperation.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  And other ones are getting elected everywhere.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  Yes, and the usual suspects,
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  the boys club that have been in charge for so long,
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  are freaking out.
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  And by the way, I'm going to leave here because I don't want to take over,
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  but I'm just going to say this metaphysically, historically,
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  from my gut, everything I've got,
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  if everybody just keeps pushing forward and taking action
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  and working hard and being good and being classy,
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  but also speaking up and not being intimidated, we're going to win.
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  Just like against the British, in my very gut,
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  it's going to be a hard fight.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  We're going to win this in the next few years.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  We're going to break the will of this monopoly.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  These corporations that are monopoly,
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  that are anti-free market, things won't be some utopia.
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  We're not offering that, but instead of this big screw job,
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  anti-prosperity, anti-family, anti-private property,
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  anti-man and woman, this whole fake corporate pipe dream,
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  globalism, like Peter Thiel has said, is gone.
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  It's over. They're already dead.
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  They're just in a rearguard action buying, you know, redoubts
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  in Tasmania and Kauai. They admit they're done.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  They just hope that they can try to reorganize something
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  and some vengeance deal. They're losers.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  And when I say that, it's from the perspective of a winner,
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  who the enemy even credits,
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  our operation druds you, everybody, as the reason this happened.
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  We're just the messengers that don't want to be slaves.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  I don't care about power or anything. I want to be independent.
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:07.000]  I take it very fundamentally, personally,
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  that people want to make me their slave and my family.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  They want to fight. They've got an information war.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  They want to start a civil war. We're not pushing that.
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:17.000]  Believe me, guys, official fights much easier against you guys.
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  I don't want that, but let me tell you,
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  we're going to win one way or another. I feel that in my gut.
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  We're going to skip this break so you have more time,
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  but take over anti-akumia of compoundmedia.com.
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  Everybody should support the great work you're doing
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  with yourself, Gavin McGinnis, the other guys, rock stars.
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:33.000]  You know, you're kind of like me, more people 30 and older.
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  I got to tell you, Gavin, the other crew at high school,
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  softball games I go to, oh, I saw you once on compound media,
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:41.000]  rock stars with the young kids.
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  That's the coveted demographic of folks that don't know
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  that everybody wants forming those minds early.
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  We're not forming minds. They've been having their minds formed.
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  They want the open, free society.
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  They're genetics. They're guts. Their spirit gets it.
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  So, Anthony, tell me where you think this is going. Take over.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:17:59.000]  Great. Thanks, Alex.
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  It's one of these situations where we just want the people
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  to be in charge again.
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  The people have not been in charge for so long.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  We almost forgot what it was like.
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  And when you see people being exposed,
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  all those professional politicians that have just been
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  working a goof on us for so long,
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  just a scam, getting money, favors,
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  all these things that added up to us being slaves.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  We really have just been slaves to their whim and will.
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  And it's great to be able to have these platforms
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  to expose these crooks and criminals for what they are.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  And I couldn't be happier that it's actually working.
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  We've gotten through. People are listening, which is amazing.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  I love it. I love that they can no longer go on network news
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  and just blather on with complete dishonesty
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  and have people believe it because that's all they had.
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  That's all they had to listen to was network news
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:17.000]  and cable news outlets that have been exposed as the liars
[3:19:17.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  that they are, manipulators that they are with their own agendas.
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  And what's so bad about wanting to have the people in charge again
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  and have the people free to pursue what they want
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  in this great country that has so many opportunities
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  yet the government itself has, over the years,
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  just cut back on allowing the people to be a free nation
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  and want to excel and do things.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:47.000]  And you see it happening now. You really do.
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  You start seeing it happening where businesses are coming back.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  People are excited.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  The market's going up because it's not this fake bubble.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:05.000]  People are excited that business is coming back.
[3:20:05.000 --> 3:20:09.000]  People have confidence in this country again
[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  that things are going to be made in this country,
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  that we're going to be a strong nation and competitive
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  with the rest of the world once again.
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  Not bowing and apologizing wherever we go around the globe
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  for what they see as past atrocities
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  that we must just be so sorry for forever.
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  Those are the kinds of things I'm enjoying seeing
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  coming out of this new media and it's refreshing.
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  It really is.
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  Talking again about, quickly, about Bow Wow and Snoop.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  I mean, there were people that were upset
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  that Bow Wow said that about the First Lady
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  and Snoop portrays a Donald Trump clown in one of his videos
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  and he shoots him.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  Yeah, and it's horrible.
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  And people were upset about it.
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  Even some people in that community,
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  the rap community, were upset about it.
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  But here's what I don't understand.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  All Trump has done, Trump has called a racist constantly.
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  All he ever said about minorities in this country
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  is that they should have the opportunities
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  that everyone else has in this country.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  Isn't that a terrible thing to say?
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  Isn't it terrible that the Democrats for years and years
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  and years for generations have kept minorities in this country
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  on a per diem through welfare that keeps them in poverty,
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  just keeps them cycle of poverty over and over again,
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  which creates the cycle of violence and drug abuse
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  and out of wedlock children.
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  It's just this thing that continues to happen
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  generation after generation with no one addressing it.
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  The Democrats only want their votes. That's it.
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  But the racist Donald Trump is saying,
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  look, we can do so much better.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  We can make these inner cities safe again
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  through real law enforcement.
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  We can give opportunity to people by bringing in more jobs,
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  more industry that has been taken out of this country,
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  and actually give people what this country was about,
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  the opportunity to be successful,
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  Again, it's never a guarantee.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  That's the amazing thing about this country.
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  It's not a guarantee, but you can increase your odds
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  of being successful by having those opportunities
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  available for you, working hard,
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  being innovative, educating yourself.
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  All these things add to your chances
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  that what this country is about
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  will lead to you being a successful person in this country
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  and leading a nice life and having something
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  for the next generation that comes out.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  That's all he ever said about minorities in this country.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  Yet it's looked at and talked about
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  like he is a horrible racist.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  I don't even know how you interpret that
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  into something other than wonderful
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  for people that have been in this cycle of poverty for so long.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  And when you go on social media
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  and you read some of these tweets that come out of Black Twitter,
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  which is actually a thing.
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  It's an amazing part of Twitter
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  where you just read what people in the Black community are saying.
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  And the hatred for Donald Trump
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  and the calls for his assassination
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  and just without even any thought behind some of these tweets
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  that maybe the Secret Service might knock on your door
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  is astounding to me when all he's saying is,
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  we can do much better than just ignoring the problem
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  and hoping every two or four years
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  these same people go out and vote
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  for the Democrats on the ticket.
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  Because that's all they see minorities as.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  It's really the crux of everything they do
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  is to get votes, welfare,
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  this illegal immigration into this country.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  It's all about control
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  and them staying in power
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  and whoops, it just didn't work last time, did it?
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  They were so sure it was going to work again for them
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  and they would have another at least four,
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  maybe eight year run under Queen Clinton
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  and it didn't work out.
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  And they were none too pleased about that.
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  So like I said, I don't understand where that comes from,
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  where that mindset of Trump is a bad guy
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  for saying everybody should have the opportunity
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  to share in the wonder that is the United States of America.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Also, the travel ban that he wants to put in place,
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  at every turn, just being knocked down,
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  at every turn he is not allowed to be the president
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  of the United States because these judges
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  that were appointed by Obama
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  and other Democrats will not let him do his job
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  as president of the United States.
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  His job first and foremost, the protection of this country
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  and its people and that is what these executive orders
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  have been protecting this nation against terrorists
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  that come into this country in all kinds of ways.
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  But how about we check out where they're coming from,
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  especially when they're coming in from nations
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  that are known terrorist havens?
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  Well, that can't be done.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  Judges have smacked it down now twice.
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  He had another executive order drawn up
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  with different language and it doesn't matter at this point.
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  It does not matter what he does,
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  what language he puts it in.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  There will be judges that will overreach their powers
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  and strike him down like we have in Hawaii.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  What a coincidence that is, huh?
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  Obama's home state, Hawaii,
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  and he just decides he's going to be the one
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  that puts the kibosh on another executive order.
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  Obama makes a surprise visit to Hawaii
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  48 hours before the judge blocks Trump's travel ban.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  How insane is that?
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  If anyone doesn't think,
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  now I'm maybe the last one to sound conspiratorial,
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  but I mean how many things have to happen
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  before you know this relatively young man.
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  He's one of the youngest presidents that we've had.
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  He's obviously one of the youngest ex-presidents we've had.
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  He's not just going to fade into the woodwork
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  and retire somewhere.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  This guy loves power.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  He loves that he had this ability to rule
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  and he's not going away.
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  He's not going away.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  What he's doing is ruling from behind.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  He's got a lot of buffers in place
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  and he wants to keep Donald Trump from succeeding
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  in ripping down his legacy,
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  a legacy that has done nothing but harm this country
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  and what we're supposed to be embarrassed
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  for being Americans.
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  We're supposed to enter the global community
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  and not be exceptional.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  Exceptionalism is such a bad word.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  We are exceptional.
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  This country is amazing.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  People come here all the time when they need things
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  and they want to get things done.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  They come here to America.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  And Obama for eight years was trying to make
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  the United States just another nation on the globe.
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  We're no more special than anyone else.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  Well, we are.
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  And Trump being in there is showing this.
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  And what are we supposed to do?
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  Just ignore the fact that he's still pulling strings,
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  that Obama is still pulling these strings on people
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  and he's ruling.
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  He's ruling from behind.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  The dark shadow government, as they call it.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  And I don't know, I think it is a little odd
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  that he went there 48 hours before the judge
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  makes this decision to block Trump's travel ban.
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  Oh, it's a Muslim ban.
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  Aren't Muslims allowed in from every other country
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  except the six on the list?
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  If a Christian in one of those countries
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  wants to come here, he can't either.
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  So how is it possibly a Muslim ban?
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  And haven't we bombed some of those countries?
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  Does it mean we're just bombing them because they're Muslim?
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  Wouldn't that be the same exact thing?
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  Oh, we bombed Muslims.
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  Was Obama bombing Muslims for all those years?
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  I guess he was.
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  That seems to be exactly what they believe,
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  that if anything happens in those countries,
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  it's because they're Muslim.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  That's ludicrous.
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  It's ridiculous.
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  Things are changing.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  We're seeing it.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:43.000]  I love it.
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:46.000]  We'll be back in a matter of moments.
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  Don't go anywhere, infowars.com.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  I'm Anthony Kumiya.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:42.000]  The eulogy of the Muslim minority,
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  that says Glyphosate is probably carcinogenic.
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:45.000]  This also comes on the heels of a California judge
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:47.000]  declaring the state legally require Roundup
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  It's not the truth.
[3:30:48.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:50.000]  No.
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:51.000]  It's not.
[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:52.000]  So are you ready to drink while you're glass up?
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  No.
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:54.000]  I'm not an idiot.
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:30:56.960]  Maybe now you'll think twice about Monsanto's Roundup.
[3:30:56.960 --> 3:31:24.960]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.

[3:31:58.960 --> 3:32:00.960]  Today we call it Bone Broth.
[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:07.960]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:10.960]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com.
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:20.960]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[3:32:20.960 --> 3:32:21.960]  Caveman.
[3:32:21.960 --> 3:32:26.960]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[3:32:26.960 --> 3:32:28.960]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:31.960]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[3:32:31.960 --> 3:32:34.960]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[3:32:34.960 --> 3:32:42.960]  But you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[3:32:42.960 --> 3:32:45.960]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:52.960]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[3:32:52.960 --> 3:32:53.960]  And this is a big part of it.
[3:32:53.960 --> 3:33:10.960]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLife.com today.
[3:33:10.960 --> 3:33:15.960]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:22.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:21.960]  Yes.
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:26.960]  Welcome, welcome back. Infowars.com.
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:32.960]  I'm Anthony Comea here at the Compound Media Facility in New York.
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:41.960]  Unfortunately, I envy the people down in Texas and they feel like they're under a dictatorship a lot of times.
[3:34:41.960 --> 3:34:48.960]  But man, when you're in New York, it is just a disaster of liberalism.
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:54.960]  They had, what's her name, Jildebrand, that senator we have here in New York,
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:35:06.960]  given the commandant of the Marines, the old what have you, given him a load of garbage because of this sex photo,
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:13.960]  I guess nude photos of some of the Marine women or at least one of them. I don't even know how many.
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:26.960]  These pictures were given to a Marine by her when they were boyfriend and girlfriend. And when they broke up, the guy decided to post them in public.
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:32.960]  This has been happening since the internet. I mean, it's nothing new.
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:41.960]  But again, they make it sound like it's running rampant, that this whole thing's running rampant in the Marines.
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:55.960]  When it's actually an isolated incident. But the commandant of the Marines had to sit there and listen to Jildebrand just lay into him about how the Marine Corps has to change.
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:36:01.960]  The ideology has to change. And I just don't understand it.
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:09.960]  We need the Marines to be these aggressive, over-the-top trained killers.
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  It might sound crazy in 2017, but that's their job.
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:22.960]  Their job is to be ready to defend this nation and kill people.
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:36.960]  That whole attitude that they pump these Marines up with is not conducive to having young ladies thrown in there and think they're going to be treated in a gentlemanly fashion.
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  I'm sorry. Sexuality is hardwired into us as human beings.
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:50.960]  And if you think that can change with sensitivity training, you're sorely mistaken.
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:37:00.960]  These are very aggressive young men. They're trained that way. They need to be trained that way.
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:10.960]  Good luck in finding Marines that will be killers and gentlemen at the same time.
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:12.960]  It just doesn't happen that way.
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:29.960]  But to see the commandant of the Marines getting bitched out, as it were, by a couple of these women's senators, feminists and whatnot, it hurt a bit.
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:41.960]  Look at this guy. Do you think this general wants to be yelled at by a senator woman?
[3:37:41.960 --> 3:37:46.960]  Hell no. He doesn't.
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  But he had to sit there and apologize. It was dreadful to watch, and I felt for him.
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:57.960]  Other things that are happening in this wonderful world,
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  I guess people are mad now because the National Endowment for the Arts won't be getting the funding it was getting for years and years and years.
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:12.960]  Trump wants to cut that. He's got better things to pay for.
[3:38:12.960 --> 3:38:20.960]  What do you think? He's got the wall to be paid for before he goes in and grabs a truck from Mexico.
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:30.960]  You got to pay for it somehow at the start. The military is going to get a few billion dollars, so we need some money.
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:41.960]  I don't think the National Endowment for the Arts should be a federally funded operation because of things like, remember, Pisschrist it was called?
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:56.960]  It was a crucifix in a jar of urine. That was art, and the National Endowment for the Arts loved that one.
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:04.960]  How about there was an elephant crap was used to create a picture of the Virgin Mary also.
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:13.960]  This was more of the artwork that we taxpayers had to fund.
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:22.960]  I think we could do without it. If you want to show your art, if you want to support the arts, that's fine.
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:27.960]  But I don't think taxpayers should be forced to anymore.
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:34.960]  What else? Sesame Street? Isn't that a popular show? It's popular, you know, supported.
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:42.960]  I watch public television, they go, oh, and this was supported by, and there were other groups, they don't need to be federally funded.
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:52.960]  And for how they're indoctrinating children on Sesame Street, I don't want to sound too crazy, but they got an agenda over there.
[3:39:52.960 --> 3:39:59.960]  And they're teaching the kids quite the liberal ideology.
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:08.960]  Rachel Maddow, I got to mention this. Oh, my dear Lord, what were they thinking over there at MSNBC?
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:18.960]  They've been talking Trump's taxes for, my God, the second he announced his candidacy, they wanted to see his taxes.
[3:40:18.960 --> 3:40:26.960]  Well, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC got a hold of Trump's 2005 tax return.
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:37.960]  And let me tell you, scandalous, it appears, it appears he made a lot of money and paid a lot of taxes.
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:40.960]  That seems to be what the big exclusive was.
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:53.960]  She sat there like an idiot, trying to twist this thing around and make it a negative on Donald Trump.
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:58.960]  And even, yes, even Stephen Colbert mocked Rachel Maddow.
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:07.960]  Now Colbert and his show is one of the most, oh, my God, just liberal drivel constantly bashing Trump.
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:12.960]  He seems to be doing better these days doing that, so he's not going to stop anytime soon.
[3:41:12.960 --> 3:41:20.960]  But even he and the liberals can't defend Rachel Maddow talking about Trump's tax return
[3:41:20.960 --> 3:41:28.960]  and just exposing that he did indeed pay at a much higher rate than many of her heroes,
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  including the Obamas and Bernie Sanders, he paid a higher tax rate,
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:40.960]  paid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, and made a lot of money too.
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:48.960]  So it dispelled two things, that he's a failure as a businessman and that he didn't pay his taxes.
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:54.960]  And if he did indeed leak these, he's more brilliant than we ever could have imagined
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:42:00.960]  than we ever could have imagined because they fell for it.
[3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:04.960]  They took it hook, line, and sinker.
[3:42:04.960 --> 3:42:09.960]  Trump O5 tax return was sterling because Melania needed citizenship.
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:20.960]  The attempts they're making at trying to find something bad that he did is astounding.
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:23.960]  And she wound up looking very foolish.
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:29.960]  What were they thinking when they got the tax form and looked at it and knew they had nothing?
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:36.960]  Like, what were they thinking then? Go on anyway? Were they hallucinating because they had heard
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:42.960]  that there must be something bad in it? So they thought if they just go on the air, something will appear?
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:52.960]  I don't know. But I'm very glad she looked very foolish. Rachel Maddow.
[3:42:52.960 --> 3:42:57.960]  The other thing I wanted to talk about was, yeah, there she is, fail. That's what they're doing.
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:43:01.960]  They're just calling it a giant fail.
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:08.960]  Another thing, the CIA and our gadgetry around our houses.
[3:43:08.960 --> 3:43:12.960]  This is another thing that intrigues me.
[3:43:12.960 --> 3:43:18.960]  Did you know that all of your electronics aren't self-contained?
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:24.960]  When you talk on your phone, when you send a Siri, an inquiry, it goes somewhere.
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:29.960]  And then it comes back to your phone. And that's that.
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:38.960]  You've put your voice and your ideas and everything in a cloud server that is to be used by anybody.
[3:43:38.960 --> 3:43:44.960]  And it appears the CIA is very interested in what people are talking about.
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:50.960]  If you have a Samsung Smart TV, it can be off in your house.
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:55.960]  And people can still monitor what you're talking about in your own home.
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:44:00.960]  A lot of people would say, well, I'm not doing anything bad. What does it matter?
[3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:05.960]  I'm not saying anything the CIA would worry about.
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  Well, think of this scenario. Think of what you say in the privacy of your own home.
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:16.960]  I bet there are certain times you might say something that could be deemed very offensive.
[3:44:16.960 --> 3:44:25.960]  Maybe if that then becomes a recording, what if you're running for public office in years from now?
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:29.960]  And a tape comes out of you saying something horrible.
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:33.960]  Well, oh, it couldn't happen.
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:39.960]  Oh boy, that's power right there. Having something to blackmail somebody with.
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:48.960]  So I don't know. It's a strange thing. All of these gadgets have always been presented to us to be conveniences.
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:58.960]  A TV you can talk to and it changes the channels and goes to various other ways of watching programming.
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:00.960]  Oh yeah, I'll put that in my house.
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:07.960]  If the CIA knocked on your door said, hi, we'd like to put a bug in your house.
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:09.960]  Wouldn't you chase him away?
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:19.960]  If like the 50s and 60s movies of floating orb around your city was peering in your window at night with a stamp of the government on it,
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:22.960]  you'd be a little upset, wouldn't you?
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:24.960]  But it's a TV you could talk to.
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:27.960]  We've always wanted cool stuff like that, haven't we?
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:35.960]  So you hang it right up on your wall and you just put your own bug in your own house.
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:38.960]  That's how all of this stuff is given to us.
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:42.960]  Leave the house without your phone. You freak out.
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  You'll lose your mind because you're not connected anymore.
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:54.960]  Well, you're walking around with them or they used to say that the government was going to put chips in everybody,
[3:45:54.960 --> 3:46:00.960]  tracking devices and you'd have cameras constantly watching you and recording what you say.
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:03.960]  Watch what you say.
[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  Well, again, if anybody asked you and said they wanted to do that, you'd lose your mind and say, no,
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:19.960]  we voluntarily have picked up tracking devices and we actually lose our minds and freak out when we don't have them on us.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:23.960]  It's really brilliant if this was the plan and I think it was.
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:32.960]  I don't know who, where, what, but man, make them want to carry the tracking device.
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:35.960]  Make them want to bug their house.
[3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:43.960]  Cars are becoming more autonomous and they communicate with the Internet
[3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:45.960]  and they know where you're going.
[3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:50.960]  Yeah, we'd like to know exactly where you go every day.
[3:46:50.960 --> 3:46:52.960]  Yeah, screw you. I'm not going to do it.
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:53.960]  All right.
[3:46:53.960 --> 3:46:57.960]  Hey, check this car out. It's got GPS and navigation and everything.
[3:46:57.960 --> 3:46:59.960]  Oh, great. It's convenient.
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:01.960]  Yes, it is.
[3:47:01.960 --> 3:47:05.960]  Be driving and you're now being tracked.
[3:47:05.960 --> 3:47:13.960]  It will always come as doing you a favor, as making your life easier.
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:23.960]  That's how these things enter our lives and these gadgets that run our houses now turn on and off lights.
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:26.960]  It sounds so innocent and simple.
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:28.960]  Remember the clapper?
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:31.960]  You could talk all day to your clapper. It wasn't going to rat you out.
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:37.960]  But now you got these devices running your house like the Amazon Alexa and whatnot.
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:43.960]  You say, Alexa, turn on kitchen lights and it does it and it'll tell you things and tell you the weather and everything.
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:52.960]  And it's listening to everything you say and keeping a record of comings and goings at your house
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:55.960]  and what you've been saying, who you talk to.
[3:47:55.960 --> 3:48:01.960]  It really is amazing.
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:05.960]  I have one of these devices in my house. It's been unplugged for quite a while.
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:12.960]  But just the other day, because it was in the news, I decided to plug it in and just see what happens.
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:15.960]  It just starts up out of nowhere sometimes.
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:22.960]  The blue ring on top lights up and it just says, I cannot answer that question.
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:27.960]  And I said nothing. I think it's talking to the TV sometimes,
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:32.960]  which is really frightening if you think about the TV says something
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:38.960]  and then a machine on the table is talking back to it in my own house.
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:43.960]  This is a vision of the future. I don't think we ever imagined.
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:48.960]  We imagined flying cars and wristwatch televisions.
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:53.960]  But we never imagined we'd have devices chit chatting with each other,
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:49:00.960]  gathering up our information and shipping it off out of our house to places unknown.
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:04.960]  I don't know where my inquiries go.
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:07.960]  They go to some place called the cloud.
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:13.960]  They go to a server that we don't even know what it is, where it is, who has access to it.
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:19.960]  We freely do this. And I think we should be more concerned.
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:24.960]  But as humans, we just like conveniences.
[3:49:24.960 --> 3:49:35.960]  So like I was saying just before, if it was a planned thing to get us to want to be monitored,
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:41.960]  it's one of the most brilliant moves in human history.
[3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:48.960]  They've gotten almost everything they wanted as far as monitoring the general public
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:52.960]  and bugging them and putting them on camera constantly.
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:58.960]  And we wanted it. We screamed for it. We save up for it.
[3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  We go into debt to bug our own houses.
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:06.960]  It's astounding. It really is.
[3:50:06.960 --> 3:50:14.960]  I sound panicky sometimes with this, maybe, but these things are being used against people.
[3:50:14.960 --> 3:50:20.960]  EasyPass is a prime example, one of the very early things we put in our lives to make it more convenient.
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:25.960]  Who wants to wait at a toll booth line? Who wants to get change from somebody?
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:27.960]  Like a whiz right through. It's convenient.
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:32.960]  And then there you are in court explaining why you went through that toll booth at that time
[3:50:32.960 --> 3:50:36.960]  and why your wife is mad at you and your divorce lawyer is mad.
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:38.960]  It's always presented as a convenience.
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:42.960]  Anthony Kumiya for infowars.com.
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:45.960]  We'll come back, right? Coming back again?
[3:50:45.960 --> 3:51:03.960]  Yeah, we'll be right back in a couple of moments. Don't you go anywhere.
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:22.960]  We'll be right back in a couple of moments.
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:52:01.960]  Is your child's school not lining up with your family values?

[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:32.960]  President Trump is cleaning up Washington, but the media and Barack Obama want to stop him.
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:34.960]  They've declared total war against him.

[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:01.960]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:05.960]  feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:08.960]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[3:53:08.960 --> 3:53:12.960]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[3:53:12.960 --> 3:53:14.960]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[3:53:14.960 --> 3:53:20.960]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[3:53:20.960 --> 3:53:25.960]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins,
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:30.960]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[3:53:30.960 --> 3:53:37.960]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:41.960]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic cells.
[3:53:41.960 --> 3:54:07.960]  The body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[3:54:07.960 --> 3:54:11.960]  I've got to run to keep from heading.
[3:54:11.960 --> 3:54:13.960]  I love that song.

[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:21.960]  Hi, people.
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:27.960]  We'll finish up today with, I guess, a sign of the impending apocalypse.
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:34.960]  Detroit mother and son share transitional journey to father and daughter.
[3:55:34.960 --> 3:55:36.960]  Yes, you heard right.
[3:55:36.960 --> 3:55:46.960]  A mother and son are transitioning to a father and daughter.
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:50.960]  Now, who am I to say what you do?
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:52.960]  I don't care.
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:54.960]  I really don't care.
[3:55:54.960 --> 3:56:04.960]  But this is looked at as like a great heroic thing instead of the freak show, which it should be looked at as.
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:09.960]  I guess the mom, the son, I don't even know what to call it.
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:12.960]  I don't even know how to present this.
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:18.960]  Back in September 2015, the story of 15-year-old Corey Mason,
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:25.960]  the decision to become a female went viral through a video showing mom Erica's support for the teen
[3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:30.960]  to get hormone treatment at 15, because that's what you want to do.
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:34.960]  You want to make that life decision at 15 years old or younger sometimes.
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:38.960]  I've heard people six, seven years old, their parents are like,
[3:56:38.960 --> 3:56:40.960]  yeah, he wants to be a girl.
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:42.960]  You can make a life decision at six.
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:47.960]  If I made a life decision at six, I would be a dinosaur,
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:49.960]  because I think I want it to be a dinosaur.
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:55.960]  That's the kind of goofy decisions six-year-olds and seven-year-olds make.
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:57:03.960]  But then the mother decides she wanted to become a father.
[3:57:03.960 --> 3:57:08.960]  She used to wish for cancer so that she would have to get a mastectomy.
[3:57:08.960 --> 3:57:15.960]  How insane and mentally damaged is this person?
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:21.960]  The only regret I have is not being educated sooner about what transgenderism was,
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:26.960]  so I could do it sooner, she added.
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:30.960]  Sometimes our children lead the way.
[3:57:30.960 --> 3:57:34.960]  Corey 14 socially transitioned from boy to girl the past few years.
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:37.960]  She gave her mom, Eric,
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:50.960]  the courage to begin her own transition from female to male.
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:55.960]  They are moving in opposite directions, but towards their true selves.
[3:57:55.960 --> 3:57:59.960]  See, this has to be presented for what it is.
[3:57:59.960 --> 3:58:07.960]  This is the whole, everything is fine, liberal ideology.
[3:58:07.960 --> 3:58:10.960]  And again, I don't care what you do.
[3:58:10.960 --> 3:58:13.960]  It's your life. Have fun with it.
[3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:20.960]  But the fact that it's looked at as courageous and honest,
[3:58:20.960 --> 3:58:24.960]  heroics and courage these days are looked at horribly.
[3:58:24.960 --> 3:58:29.960]  As some form of male showmatism or misogyny.
[3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:32.960]  But this is courageous.
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:35.960]  Thanks for joining me, Anthony Comey, and for Infowars.com.
[3:58:35.960 --> 3:58:55.960]  See me on Compound Media. Thanks, everybody.
