[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  About a week away from the 2020 election, Democrat Party nominee Joe Biden is in desperate
[00:16.680 --> 00:22.760]  denial of the fact that he is now the central character in the most despicable corruption
[00:22.760 --> 00:25.760]  scandal in American history.
[00:25.760 --> 00:31.480]  The subversion of the US government by Communist China is being exposed.
[00:31.480 --> 00:36.560]  A group of Chinese whistleblowers managed to get a hard drive containing evidence of
[00:36.560 --> 00:44.040]  serious crimes committed by the Biden family into the hands of Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani.
[00:44.040 --> 00:50.000]  Lude media claimed a month ago that a hard drive would surface before the election, containing
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.520]  videos of Hunter Biden violently raping Chinese children.
[00:55.520 --> 00:59.360]  Those who have seen the videos support this claim.
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.800]  To any good person, this is shocking and horrific, and to many, it is incomprehensible.
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.360]  But for as long as man has had power to gain, the art of blackmail has been exploited.
[01:13.360 --> 01:17.280]  This was the purpose of a man like Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.200]  According to Lude media, these child rape videos of Hunter Biden were produced by the
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.600]  Communist Chinese as a means of control, and were being sent to the Biden family and other
[01:29.600 --> 01:36.640]  CCP assets in America as a threat, a reminder of who owns them.
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.640]  There are no rules in the game of power, only ruthlessness, and so children become the currency
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.040]  of those who seek to control others.
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.600]  Her business partner of the Biden family, Tony Bobolinski, worked as CEO for Sino Hawk
[01:53.600 --> 02:00.760]  Holdings, a company formed by the Bidens and China's largest private energy company.
[02:00.760 --> 02:06.680]  Bobolinski has provided evidence that shows Sino Hawk was used to funnel millions of dollars
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.720]  from the Communist Chinese directly into the family coffers of the Bidens.
[02:12.720 --> 02:19.720]  The mainstream media in what must certainly be a criminal act has been ignoring this incredible
[02:19.720 --> 02:26.600]  story while pushing their audience into voting for a decrepit, lying, perverted fraud, with
[02:26.600 --> 02:33.120]  a monstrous family and loyalty to the Communist Chinese.
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.200]  We likely know what's coming next.
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.480]  The Democrat Party will claim that Trump stole the election, the corporate media will play
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.760]  along, and those still brainwashed by the globalist-run propaganda media machine will
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.520]  undoubtedly believe it.
[02:50.520 --> 02:56.560]  With massive crowds of people all over the country showing overwhelming grassroots support
[02:56.560 --> 03:04.040]  for President Trump in ways never before seen, contrasted with Joe Biden and Obama at public
[03:04.040 --> 03:10.560]  events practically devoid of all people, the media will still say that Trump had to steal
[03:10.560 --> 03:18.720]  the election, they will cite their fake polls, and the brainwashed sheep will believe them.
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.400]  If justice is served, which needs to happen, then there will be arrests of powerful people,
[03:25.400 --> 03:31.640]  and the corporate media will report that Trump is literally Hitler rounding up the innocent,
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.600]  and the brainwashed sheep will believe them.
[03:35.600 --> 03:37.600]  There is no doubt.
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.040]  If they can be made to wear masks and fear those who don't, then they will believe whatever
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.520]  they are told.
[03:45.520 --> 03:51.520]  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening
[03:51.520 --> 03:53.880]  wolves.
[03:53.880 --> 03:56.760]  Humanity is awakening, but not everyone.
[03:56.760 --> 04:02.880]  The brainwashed are being manipulated into defending the corrupt, deep-state establishment.
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.920]  Some are even murdering Trump supporters in cold blood.
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.640]  It seems clear that Trump will win the 2020 election, but then what?
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.040]  If the corporate mainstream media is allowed to operate as normal, then there will be total
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.200]  chaos.
[04:21.200 --> 04:39.640]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:39.640 --> 04:53.040]  Prepare yourself for the most dangerous election in history, that is the video.
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.040]  That is the report.
[04:54.040 --> 04:59.600]  Prepare yourself for the most dangerous election in history.
[04:59.600 --> 05:02.000]  I admire President Trump.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.440]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched, his wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[05:07.440 --> 05:10.800]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[05:10.800 --> 05:17.960]  He's not God, he's not an angel, he's not perfect, but the way he has used judo on the
[05:17.960 --> 05:22.400]  forces of the New World Order has been really incredible, the way he's pragmatically stood
[05:22.400 --> 05:29.680]  up for prosperity and basic freedom, and the way he stood up against these America-hating,
[05:29.680 --> 05:32.880]  God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[05:32.880 --> 05:33.880]  And I'm serious.
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.560]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning thinking about President
[05:37.560 --> 05:38.560]  Trump.
[05:38.560 --> 05:44.160]  I just want to say I admire the President so much, and I appreciate you the listeners and
[05:44.160 --> 05:45.440]  everybody for what you've done.
[05:45.440 --> 05:46.440]  I admire you.
[05:46.440 --> 05:48.880]  That's what you call it and thank me, folks.
[05:48.880 --> 05:49.880]  I admire you.
[05:49.880 --> 05:50.880]  I admire Trump.
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.200]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight, and I just wish I could do more.
[05:55.200 --> 05:56.200]  We're going to win this fight together.
[05:56.200 --> 05:57.680]  This election is so important.
[05:57.680 --> 06:08.640]  Please pray for President Trump.
[06:08.640 --> 06:13.000]  Have you ever wondered how the United Nations, the powerful, robber-bearing corporations
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.400]  that funded the control it would take over America and the rest of the once-free world?
[06:18.400 --> 06:19.640]  You're now seeing it.
[06:19.640 --> 06:25.080]  Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Mellon negates the U.N. in many drills like lockstep and
[06:25.080 --> 06:27.800]  event 201 and dark winter.
[06:27.800 --> 06:34.320]  The last 30 years told us they would use the fear of a deadly virus to take control and
[06:34.320 --> 06:38.240]  basically bring in permanent martial law.
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.800]  And now they have the big tech in place.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.360]  Now they have the contact tracing in place.
[06:41.360 --> 06:45.080]  Now they have the excuse to make you all get used to getting permission to leave your
[06:45.080 --> 06:46.080]  house.
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.720]  It's happening.
[06:47.720 --> 06:52.680]  It started in Spain and Australia and other areas, and the U.N. said, they had, quote,
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.640]  the U.N. emergency response team said, we're going to go in and finally take children out
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.640]  of homes.
[06:58.640 --> 07:02.360]  We're going to take people that refuse to be tested for COVID-19.
[07:02.360 --> 07:05.840]  We're going to force them to be inoculate people, everything.
[07:05.840 --> 07:08.600]  And now it's not just Australia.
[07:08.600 --> 07:10.640]  It's not just Spain.
[07:10.640 --> 07:19.880]  But now in Texas, in blue cities, like El Paso, Infowars.com has the local ABC News report.
[07:19.880 --> 07:26.560]  C.V. 1984, tyranny in Texas as police show up at El Paso residence, doorsteps, ordering
[07:26.560 --> 07:33.280]  quarantine because they went to a restaurant, scanned their phone into the QR code, thinking
[07:33.280 --> 07:34.280]  they were getting the menu.
[07:34.280 --> 07:37.240]  Notice no menus now, and they were put to database.
[07:37.240 --> 07:40.520]  Later, that database found someone had COVID in the restaurant.
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.720]  Now you can't leave your home.
[07:42.720 --> 07:47.840]  No judge, no jury, doesn't matter if the Supreme Court rules is unconstitutional, they're going
[07:47.840 --> 07:54.320]  to enforce it, and the police are under blue city control, El Paso is a Democrat martial
[07:54.320 --> 08:00.440]  law facility run by Beto's crime syndicate family.
[08:00.440 --> 08:03.560]  And they're on TV saying, you challenge our authority, why?
[08:03.560 --> 08:06.480]  We're going to lock your ass up.
[08:06.480 --> 08:08.040]  Now what happened in Atlanta?
[08:08.040 --> 08:09.520]  What happened in Houston?
[08:09.520 --> 08:10.560]  What happened in LA?
[08:10.560 --> 08:13.200]  What happened in Orlando?
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.520]  What happened in Seattle?
[08:14.520 --> 08:15.520]  What happened in Portland?
[08:15.520 --> 08:17.920]  What happened in Detroit?
[08:17.920 --> 08:18.920]  What happened in New York?
[08:18.920 --> 08:19.920]  A month ago.
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.160]  Oh, we're here to do a COVID test.
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.080]  It's not the law, but we'd like you to come out with the police and do it, color of law.
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.840]  I'm not against the police, I'm against them being given an unconstitutional order.
[08:31.840 --> 08:37.600]  And then again, depending on the test, 90% of the positives, it turns out, with the quick
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.640]  reaction 15-minute test are false positives.
[08:40.640 --> 08:41.640]  Did you hear that?
[08:41.640 --> 08:49.080]  I'm going to show you the headlines, 90% in a study done in New York of positives were
[08:49.080 --> 08:50.080]  false.
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.360]  Didn't mean 90% of the tests were positive was less than 10%, but remember the meatpacking
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.920]  plants were 3,000 people and 2,000 people who was in the Associated Press as well.
[08:58.920 --> 08:59.920]  Look it up.
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.680]  Thousands would be tested, none of them were sick, and they'd find half of them.
[09:04.680 --> 09:09.640]  Or a third of, depending on the plant had COVID-19 because they didn't.
[09:09.640 --> 09:11.560]  This is the perfect thing.
[09:11.560 --> 09:16.240]  Testing goes up, numbers of COVID go up, they go, oh, we've got to shut down, COVID numbers
[09:16.240 --> 09:19.640]  are up, but morbidity goes down and down and down.
[09:19.640 --> 09:26.200]  We were told it was going to be 5% and 4% and 3% of the public was going to die.
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.920]  Well, if there was something killing 5% of people, baby, I'd be in my house eight months
[09:30.920 --> 09:31.920]  later.
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.560]  I mean, you wouldn't, I'd be doing my show from home, if there was something that could
[09:35.560 --> 09:44.880]  kill 5% of people, baby, I'd be not out there, but they admit that it is less than one-tenth
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.760]  of 1%, and those people have comorbidities, meaning they're overweight, they have diabetes,
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.680]  and have already had cancer surgeries, usually already have cancer, heart disease, and in
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.640]  a normal flu or cold, it'll kill you even worse.
[09:57.640 --> 10:02.080]  So you see the headlines, oh, meatpacking plants have become COVID-19 hotspots, but
[10:02.080 --> 10:09.720]  type in, thousands tested at meatpacking plant, all asymptomatic, meaning they don't have
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.280]  a cold, they don't have a cough, they don't have a fever, and when we've been over this,
[10:14.280 --> 10:15.280]  we've been over this.
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.640]  There's a headline, up to 90% who tested COVID-positive, wrongly diagnosed, and the truth is it's
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.920]  a whole lot worse, even more of the people didn't have it, print me that article please.
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.880]  So I was talking to a major national talk show host, just the other day, they're testing
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.920]  everyone that goes on his show, because the company says so, and then of course they have
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.440]  false positive folks that feel completely good, because you've had a bacterial infection,
[10:42.440 --> 10:50.280]  a viral infection, in the last, on average, bacterial a year, flew about 10 years, colds
[10:50.280 --> 10:57.000]  about five years, the studies vary, but I mean, I had a rotten tooth three months ago
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.440]  pulled out, my teeth got old, I clenched them, they were the best teeth ever, now they're
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.240]  going out, it was rotting, they went and pulled it out, haven't gotten an implant yet to fix
[11:04.240 --> 11:11.520]  it, and I looked it up, I'll probably test positive for COVID, because I had a major
[11:11.520 --> 11:14.920]  infection in my mouth, I mean, I don't want to get graphic here, but I waited too long,
[11:14.920 --> 11:19.880]  and it was a mess when they pulled it out, quite a bit of pus, they got down in my jaw,
[11:19.880 --> 11:24.880]  I'll test positive for COVID, because that's what the tests do, the antibody test takes
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.960]  10 days to get, it's the only one that's accurate, and it's still inaccurate, about 10% of the
[11:30.960 --> 11:38.840]  time, so I'm digressing here, but look at the military times headline, how the president
[11:38.840 --> 11:44.760]  could invoke martial law, but what do you think COVID-19 is, worldwide, where all of
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.400]  your regular rights are suspended, this article is excellent by the way, it lays out the history
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.560]  of martial law, how it works in other parts of the world, how it works here, when it's
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.360]  constitutional, when it's not, it's not a lengthy article, it's not a short article,
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.080]  but I think this is pretty accurate stuff, I read it earlier, you should probably go
[12:01.080 --> 12:06.200]  read it as well, but the thing is they're saying, oh, the climate that's been created
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.800]  may have to have martial law, we're already under martial law, when they come to your
[12:10.800 --> 12:18.800]  house and go, you were at a deli last week, and somebody came up with COVID-19 there,
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.920]  you can't leave your house, and you're gonna give us a test, all color of law, all illegal,
[12:24.920 --> 12:31.880]  all crazy, and the news is doing the normalization, I bet the El Paso cops aren't gonna pull this,
[12:31.880 --> 12:36.320]  they're not idiots, but they're still gonna act like, oh look, it's the law, because it's
[12:36.320 --> 12:42.360]  all UN run to set the precedent for the medical tyranny of the UN WHO running it, here's a
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.000]  local newscast, I suggest you share it, it's on infowars.com and newswars.com, this is
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.480]  absolutely insane how they just normalize this, this is real martial law, they're trying
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.520]  to bait a test right now, it's not coming from Trump, he's the one saying normalize,
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.000]  all the studies show, locking people up, doesn't protect you, we gotta get herd immunity, I'll
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.680]  show you that after we play this clip, but here it is, that's nearly 3,000 more coronavirus
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.840]  cases in the last eight days, city officials say they have to take a more aggressive approach,
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.920]  ABC7's JC Navrete has a look at the measures the city is taking to get a grasp on COVID-19,
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.960]  he joins us live, JC.
[13:20.960 --> 13:27.320]  That's right Eric, Saola, knock on your door or ring of your doorbell are very real possibilities
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.880]  from law enforcement and health officials for anyone not cooperating with the contact
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.480]  tracing process, this as El Paso hits an all time high in active cases.
[13:37.480 --> 13:44.160]  This is a very concerning situation, we have seen an increase in cases, hospitalizations
[13:44.160 --> 13:49.160]  and deaths from COVID-19 that is not stopping.
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.000]  City and county health authority Dr. Hector Ocaranza not missing words, as the number
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.840]  of active cases has now surpassed 6,000, in the last eight days more than 3,000 additional
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.560]  cases were also reported, with the flu season in full swing, officials are now concerned
[14:03.560 --> 14:05.920]  about the spike in hospitalizations.
[14:05.920 --> 14:13.720]  When you combine the influenza plus the COVID, it will overwhelm our health care system very
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.200]  easily if we don't take personal responsibility, so your watch out.
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.080]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already laid out the benchmarks on what happens if hospitalizations
[14:22.080 --> 14:24.080]  climb above 15 percent.
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.000]  In which he is going to be implementing restrictions, but nonetheless we're not going to be waiting
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  for the governor to implement restrictions.
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  We need it to start implementing those restrictions and our restrictions are going to be stricter.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.560]  Angela de la Mora, the newly appointed director of the El Paso public health department, saying
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.680]  health officials cannot do their job once the contact tracing process gets combative.
[14:48.680 --> 14:54.280]  They hang up on us, they challenge our authority, in many cases they tell us that they know
[14:54.280 --> 14:56.680]  better how to take care of their families.
[14:56.680 --> 15:03.560]  We are immediately with Dr. Ocaranza's assistance, we are issuing health orders that are delivered
[15:03.560 --> 15:08.880]  by a police officer and a public health official to their domicile.
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.000]  We spoke to residents who are frustrated that the situation has not improved in the more
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.360]  than 200 days we've been in this pandemic.
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.640]  It's really frustrating when someone who has been locked down themselves of their own
[15:19.640 --> 15:26.800]  volition then somehow they get COVID and it's because out in the world not everyone is acting
[15:26.800 --> 15:27.800]  that way.
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.280]  And so, yeah, it is really frustrating.
[15:33.280 --> 15:35.080]  Enough of this, we'll play more of it.
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.720]  But if we'd all just submit, oh no, it was 15 days it would all be gone, the hospital
[15:38.720 --> 15:41.040]  would be full, 2 million dead, none of it was true.
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.960]  They're counting the flu and cold, it's never going to end.
[15:43.960 --> 15:44.960]  I told you.
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.960]  It's a power grab, it's a takeover, and now they're coming to arrest you, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:49.960 --> 15:51.880]  Now they're coming to force inoculate you.
[15:51.880 --> 15:59.920]  This is the build up for forced inoculation, don't answer the door.
[15:59.920 --> 16:05.240]  China is open, America is closed, and in the European Union where the people are revolting
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.000]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.000]  lockdown.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  It's very simple.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.600]  We're authoritarians, already have complete control of communist China, oh, there's no
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.880]  more lockdowns and they're heroes, and the UN says they're the example for assault.
[16:21.880 --> 16:25.320]  After all, that's where the virus came from, after all, that's where the fear mongering
[16:25.320 --> 16:27.520]  came from, the lockdown came from.
[16:27.520 --> 16:34.080]  But that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little syndrome being created that
[16:34.080 --> 16:41.720]  was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass
[16:41.720 --> 16:42.720]  hysteria.
[16:42.720 --> 16:49.360]  And so far it's been incredibly successful, until just the last few weeks as across the
[16:49.360 --> 16:55.440]  world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN communist Chinese world government
[16:55.440 --> 16:57.940]  power grab.
[16:57.940 --> 17:02.880]  With two weeks left until the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[17:02.880 --> 17:05.640]  the top some already amazing sales.
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.080]  It's Black Friday comes in October special, something we did last year that was very,
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.080]  very popular.
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.400]  We did it for the whole month last year, we can only do it for 11 days until the end
[17:15.400 --> 17:18.880]  of the month because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.120]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.120]  shipping is Ultra 12, incredible high quality B12, take it under the tongue, look into how
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.560]  great it is, your body's defenses, your health, your stamina, that's back in stock and vitamin
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.640]  mineral fusion with the zinc and the other vitamins and minerals that are essential, and
[17:38.640 --> 17:42.160]  amino acids to make sure your body uploads it better.
[17:42.160 --> 17:48.640]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com, vitamin mineral fusion and Ultra 12, the flagship
[17:48.640 --> 17:59.560]  products of Black Friday comes in October sale at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[17:59.560 --> 18:05.480]  In fiction super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic, huge
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.920]  global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[18:09.920 --> 18:15.640]  And I might have told you a year ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire
[18:15.640 --> 18:20.720]  who controls the UN would roll out a global hysteria and a lot down the planet, starve
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.200]  millions of people and would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.760]  your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all going to work from home
[18:28.760 --> 18:34.320]  now and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human population.
[18:34.320 --> 18:37.800]  You tell me that's crazy, you tell me that's a dystopian, you tell me that's some type
[18:37.800 --> 18:42.520]  of science fiction comic book, but in reality it really did happen.
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.880]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[18:47.880 --> 18:50.480]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.720]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[18:53.720 --> 18:59.000]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates' property, it's time to expose Bill Gates.
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.320]  2020ElectionCenter.com, just type it in one time and you've got to save right there in

[19:24.520 --> 19:27.680]  same videos, we can comment, we can share them everything.
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.920]  This system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[19:33.920 --> 19:38.280]  Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going to take action once reelected against
[19:38.280 --> 19:40.320]  big tech, I mean he's modern in the situation.
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.560]  Well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and cry because
[19:43.560 --> 19:44.760]  he has taken action.
[19:44.760 --> 19:49.240]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[19:49.240 --> 19:55.000]  2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com and sharing that
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  link.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.840]  I'm really upset some, oh yeah.
[20:01.840 --> 20:20.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, Dr. Michael J. Ryan, Big Brother, mainstream
[20:20.480 --> 20:27.040]  media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny, well so does he.
[20:27.040 --> 20:33.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.800 --> 20:41.880]  I have hundreds of articles, dozens of incredible clips, two huge guests coming up, having told
[20:41.880 --> 20:48.320]  you about yet, massive Joe Biden, pedophile corruption news, it'll be exclusive.
[20:48.320 --> 20:53.920]  So why don't I say the same thing I've said a thousand times again because you need to
[20:53.920 --> 20:55.160]  understand it.
[20:55.160 --> 20:58.880]  People are really freaking out right now, I mean I've been meeting with a lot of high
[20:58.880 --> 21:02.720]  level people and they're just like, Jones, we want to know how do you know all this?
[21:02.720 --> 21:06.040]  And I go, do you not listen to the show?
[21:06.040 --> 21:10.920]  The globalists all say what they're going to do, I know who runs it, it's a consortium
[21:10.920 --> 21:16.400]  multinational corporations that meet at DeBose, Bilderberg, Club of Rome and a few other groups.
[21:16.400 --> 21:23.080]  There's only like 10 guys chair all of them and they admit their plan and they damn well
[21:23.080 --> 21:28.280]  have been executing it, they've gotten most of it done.
[21:28.280 --> 21:32.280]  So again, if I've got a road map and nobody else does, they go, how do you know this road
[21:32.280 --> 21:35.720]  runs into that road and I go to this road you go there and if you turn to this road
[21:35.720 --> 21:42.240]  you go to this town, I've got a freaking road map, man.
[21:42.240 --> 21:47.200]  So I read academic stuff, the general public watches the news, okay?
[21:47.200 --> 21:51.040]  And so if you watch the news, you're going to get stuff 10 years late.
[21:51.040 --> 21:56.080]  There's a Fox News article that everybody called me about, like Fox News says smart TVs
[21:56.080 --> 22:00.160]  have microphones at hidden cameras for 10 years and are watching and listening and selling
[22:00.160 --> 22:04.080]  the data and that the home assistants are building psychological profiles on you and
[22:04.080 --> 22:09.760]  they're going to enforce COVID lockdowns, how the hell the hell did you know this, Jones?
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.960]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.080]  They called them smart devices then, they said they'll have home assistants that watch
[22:18.080 --> 22:29.880]  you and that if there's any bad stuff in the house, it'll call the police, it's here, folks.
[22:29.880 --> 22:36.000]  So I told you it would come to Texas, I told you it would come to America because the UN
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.840]  said it would, here's the UN's director of global emergency response and you hear on
[22:42.840 --> 22:49.320]  the news the UN runs policy on this, the lockdowns killing millions of starvation, all of it.
[22:49.320 --> 22:53.280]  Not even close to a million have died from COVID, but millions have already started
[22:53.280 --> 22:57.160]  that and here he is and we need to go into the homes, they want the power to take away
[22:57.160 --> 23:00.800]  who they want and they can false positive anybody they want.
[23:00.800 --> 23:07.240]  This is the cover for UN takeover and Trump finally gets it, but with eight days left
[23:07.240 --> 23:08.560]  they're getting ready to try to steal it.
[23:08.560 --> 23:13.480]  I mean this is epic stuff, this is white knuckle stuff, this is all an enemy that can't defeat
[23:13.480 --> 23:18.360]  you militarily, does it covertly through wizardry, through scams.
[23:18.360 --> 23:23.240]  Here's what he had to say six months ago and now it's here in America, we know exactly
[23:23.240 --> 23:28.080]  what's coming in the phases because they've already done it in places they fully control
[23:28.080 --> 23:29.080]  before this.
[23:29.080 --> 23:35.760]  The exact phases, 15 days they say to stop hospitals overwhelmed, it's made up, roll
[23:35.760 --> 23:42.120]  out massive testing, the tester falls to you, mainly false positives, then they say wear
[23:42.120 --> 23:46.160]  masks wherever there's a sign of compliance to divide the public and create fear and remind
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.360]  you constantly of the COVID and that you're in danger falsely so you don't look at actual
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.160]  numbers.
[23:52.160 --> 23:57.960]  Then they start saying contact tracing, paper, menus are bad, everything's bad, we gotta
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.160]  scan QR codes that show where you're at, now that's contact tracing, now somebody got COVID
[24:03.160 --> 24:07.840]  and tested positive or had a false positive, now they gotta come talk to you, now you've
[24:07.840 --> 24:12.280]  gotta do a test, you've gotta submit, you're guilty and they do it where anybody's had
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.480]  a bacterial infection or the flu or cold in the last few years is positive, so now you've
[24:17.480 --> 24:25.640]  got to lock down, China's open for business, you're not, it's an economic weapon.
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.160]  So here is the UN director of the operation, here he is.
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.000]  At the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.040]  that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family
[24:40.040 --> 24:45.280]  level, in some senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into
[24:45.280 --> 24:52.520]  family units, now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick
[24:52.520 --> 24:55.960]  and remove them and isolate them in a safe way.
[24:55.960 --> 25:01.800]  Because you can never fix it, oh, cut the curve, flatten the curve, oh we promise it
[25:01.800 --> 25:05.880]  never ends, it's a power grab, that's why Bill Gates now says, oh, 10 years of mask.
[25:05.880 --> 25:10.280]  I've got an article right here of the Stanford research scientist that works with all these
[25:10.280 --> 25:20.400]  guys, here's her bio, Dr. Krugta Kampali and she says, I feel like there's this perception
[25:20.400 --> 25:26.240]  that once we have a hashtag coronavirus vaccine, life will go back to normal, life will not
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.640]  be like that pre-COVID, even after we have a vaccine, you will still need to use good
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.080]  hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, avoid crowds and wear masks, and of course
[25:36.080 --> 25:38.800]  be tracked by all the apps that control your life.
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.520]  They're creating a mental phobia, a mental illness, COVID-19 is a hysteric mental illness,
[25:45.520 --> 25:53.160]  a collapse of civilization, it is a giant hysteria, where you now think normal life
[25:53.160 --> 25:58.160]  is bad and I got studies out of the mask actually making you sick, those are being suppressed,
[25:58.160 --> 26:04.680]  this is a giant power grab because the public is so incredibly ignorant about the facts.
[26:04.680 --> 26:10.720]  Go see it, if you just joined us, Marshall Law in Texas and Houston will be next and
[26:10.720 --> 26:23.680]  then Dallas and Austin and it's starting where Joe Rogan, everyone that goes on a show, Spotify
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.520]  says must be COVID tested, it's a 15 minute rapid test that has the highest level of false
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.440]  positive, you're like, oh, you feel totally fine, but sorry, we have to shut down what
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.640]  we're doing because of this and I've got articles here where they're getting rid of
[26:38.640 --> 26:51.320]  the 911 service in major cities because in Pennsylvania and other states they found that
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.880]  oh, if one person gets sick in the 911 center or does a positive test, the whole thing just
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.680]  shuts down, so the factories are shutting down, the farms are shutting down, millions
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.520]  have already started to death around the world, we're gonna have a depression and then Davos
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.680]  Group says they're doing it to cause a global depression to make you not socially mobile
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.840]  so they can control you and put you on a guaranteed income, that's a welfare, so you're about
[27:16.840 --> 27:22.880]  to be forced on the welfare and economically your economy is being militarily destroyed
[27:22.880 --> 27:30.000]  to make you dependent, this is 21st century war, we've been hit, Trump finally figures
[27:30.000 --> 27:37.200]  it out and now 60% of restaurants that have closed are permanent because they were not
[27:37.200 --> 27:44.760]  essential, they were all the mom and pops and people just get used to it, well it must
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.120]  be real, I'm wearing a mask, well it must be and so when you comply with this, it's
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.440]  the end of civilization and then they're not just coming with a regular deadly vaccine,
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.960]  Yates says you'll take five a year of an mRNA vaccine that go, it's not even a vaccine,
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.440]  it's a reprogramming cancer injection that goes in and changes all your cells and puts
[28:04.440 --> 28:09.040]  out proteins that they admit can kill you and cause all these autoimmune disorders and
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.040]  he says well we've had a lot of people die on the trials but it's okay, you're gonna
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.360]  take it or you're not gonna get groceries and you're not gonna have a job, so see this
[28:18.360 --> 28:23.760]  is collapsing into the tyranny and Australia in leftist controlled cities like Melbourne
[28:23.760 --> 28:29.600]  is under eight months of total lockdown where you can't ever even leave your home and all
[28:29.600 --> 28:35.120]  the college students, all the SJWs, they believe in it, they know it's a scam, they're evil
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.000]  people, they're coming to your house, backed up by cops with guns, they're not responding
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.320]  to crime, murders, rapes, no no, they're coming to stick needles in you and sterilize you
[28:45.320 --> 28:50.400]  and they love it and they know what they're doing, so get ready folks and guard yourself
[28:50.400 --> 28:55.400]  for true, we'll be right back with the latest on Joe Biden and his daughter's diaries reportedly
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.920]  leaked, oh yes we'll cover it all.
[28:58.920 --> 29:04.720]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months,
[29:04.720 --> 29:08.600]  they're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins
[29:08.600 --> 29:13.960]  minerals especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[29:13.960 --> 29:20.040]  immune system, well both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com just two weeks
[29:20.040 --> 29:25.880]  after the election and we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple
[29:25.880 --> 29:30.320]  patriot points to your next order, also if you sign up for auto shipping an additional
[29:30.320 --> 29:34.800]  10% off, that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders, now we have had a big
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.280]  clearance sale going so a lot of stuff sold out, a lot of the other stuff is close to
[29:38.280 --> 29:41.640]  selling out, some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually
[29:41.640 --> 29:46.440]  come back in to stock and because of your support we've had the money to reorder and
[29:46.440 --> 29:50.080]  get the other things that have actually sold out so those should be back in stock as well
[29:50.080 --> 29:51.080]  soon.
[29:51.080 --> 29:54.000]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year, obviously we're critical of the
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.840]  fight and you've helped win the war against the globalist so far.
[29:58.840 --> 30:02.040]  It's on record, it's not disputed, it was rolled out more than 8 months ago in common
[30:02.040 --> 30:06.840]  to China, now it's in Europe, now it's the United States, Canada and most other industrial
[30:06.840 --> 30:12.800]  parts of the planet, every restaurant you go into even small mom and pops have QR codes
[30:12.800 --> 30:17.440]  for you to supposedly check their menu and they really get upset when you ask for a
[30:17.440 --> 30:20.880]  paper menu but of course they have them, now what are they saying there, well you've
[30:20.880 --> 30:24.920]  got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't have a piece
[30:24.920 --> 30:29.920]  of paper because oh everybody's diseased and you know we're spreading germs, it's absolutely
[30:29.920 --> 30:33.720]  asinized they can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[30:33.720 --> 30:38.960]  Now what this really is, is a contact tracing database, again this is admitted that everyone's
[30:38.960 --> 30:43.760]  being habituated in a scan to be part of so in the future everywhere you go is tracked
[30:43.760 --> 30:47.600]  officially and your cell phones already track you, you already have home assistants watching
[30:47.600 --> 30:51.440]  and listening to you in your house but now this is officially rolling the sound where
[30:51.440 --> 30:55.720]  you won't buy or sell, have a job, get an airplane without it and Bill Gates even admits it
[30:55.720 --> 30:58.720]  so think about that folks and we'll look out.
[30:58.720 --> 31:04.760]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince congress and the
[31:04.760 --> 31:09.840]  rest of the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for coordinated
[31:09.840 --> 31:14.920]  big tech censorship, now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and
[31:14.920 --> 31:18.840]  a half years for the learning curve to take place this time.
[31:18.840 --> 31:24.440]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent, it is a plan to
[31:24.440 --> 31:30.240]  lower carbon footprint, it is a plan to make the world population poor, it is a diabolical
[31:30.240 --> 31:35.560]  power grab, it is a revolution against the industrial revolution, they call it the post
[31:35.560 --> 31:40.680]  industrial world and it's the excuse for them to take control of every facet of our lives
[31:40.680 --> 31:44.640]  and implement absolute authoritarianism so again to everybody out there if you love your
[31:44.640 --> 31:49.080]  children or my daughter that just woke up here and if you care about yourselves in any
[31:49.080 --> 31:53.600]  future you need to get awake, you need to understand this information, you need to warn others
[31:53.600 --> 31:59.200]  okay, it's a life and death situation.
[31:59.200 --> 32:05.120]  Finally the stagnant republican establishment understands what infowars understands, what
[32:05.120 --> 32:11.280]  our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands, we are in a digital civil war,
[32:11.280 --> 32:17.240]  there are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech
[32:17.240 --> 32:22.640]  platform and now they're doing it to the private apps, they're doing it to text messages, they're
[32:22.640 --> 32:29.240]  doing it to email, this is mafia organized crime election meddling, but finally when
[32:29.240 --> 32:35.360]  they blocked 100 Biden and the barisma information and the Chinese information and the photos
[32:35.360 --> 32:39.400]  and the crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't
[32:39.400 --> 32:43.960]  denied it, finally congress got pissed and said this is out of control, you've got to
[32:43.960 --> 32:48.400]  stop it now, we're taking action, oh injectors, you went oh it's a mistake, it's an accident,
[32:48.400 --> 32:53.680]  but they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff, well infowars
[32:53.680 --> 33:01.840]  is calling their bluff and I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[33:01.840 --> 33:28.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.680 --> 33:44.840]  Alright National File has a great lead investigative journalist Patrick Cowley who's written for
[33:44.840 --> 33:53.080]  Epic Times, many other big publications and they reportedly got the diary of Joe Biden's
[33:53.080 --> 33:58.160]  daughter and this fits into their whole MO, all the rest of it, but you've also got
[33:58.160 --> 34:03.280]  confirmation now by the FBI over a week ago, but now it's mainstream news, confirmation
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.680]  by even the Associated Press Reuters, you name it, that indeed okay these are real emails,
[34:07.680 --> 34:11.200]  they've got a bunch of witnesses that got the emails on the other side that have gone
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.160]  public, there's all the sex tape videos and videos of 100 Biden's smoking crack, but
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.880]  you notice Giuliani slowly dribbling it out with eight days left of the election and
[34:20.880 --> 34:26.840]  letting them deny it and then bringing it out, so here's a compilation of the folks
[34:26.840 --> 34:34.320]  working with Giuliani, the Chinese billionaire and others that are talking about what's
[34:34.320 --> 34:40.680]  coming out with Hunter Biden and again this is the same videos off the laptop, this situation
[34:40.680 --> 34:47.080]  with the diary is totally separate and was found by someone else, but it shows the public
[34:47.080 --> 34:54.040]  is watching very carefully, exclusive source, Biden daughter's diary tells not appropriate
[34:54.040 --> 35:01.440]  showers with Joe as a child, was I molested, she says I think so, reportedly it's what
[35:01.440 --> 35:04.680]  she's saying, they're not denying this at this point, we'll get the latest from Patrick
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.960]  Halley at the moment, but first we've blurred out the video, I'm even afraid to watch all
[35:08.960 --> 35:13.400]  these videos, there's hundreds of them already out, reportedly it's what we were told by
[35:13.400 --> 35:18.360]  the Chinese sources a few weeks ago, some of these videos look like underage girls,
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.200]  no one even has the nerve, the New York Post said we can't put them out, it looks like
[35:22.200 --> 35:27.000]  pedophilia, so what people are putting out is the stuff that isn't pedophilia because
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.960]  you become part of it publishing, so people are like well why is it just him having sex
[35:31.960 --> 35:37.040]  and smoking crap, with Asian women, white women you name it, but it's him over in China
[35:37.040 --> 35:41.720]  and some of these videos reportedly, well I'm not clicking on these things, I've talked
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.840]  to folks that have and I've read the reports and it's bad folks, I saw reports out there
[35:47.840 --> 35:51.440]  of stuff I'm not going to mention, we've already talked about what's reportedly on these, but
[35:51.440 --> 35:55.520]  it's bad folks and it's just hard for the course, he went well why would he do that
[35:55.520 --> 35:59.680]  because he knew he was being compromised, he was the bag man, he was going over there
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.040]  because he likes to do this, he's proving to the Chinese I'm corrupt, you've got me
[36:04.040 --> 36:18.400]  by the short hairs, here's a short report, we'll go to Patrick Halley, so again we've
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.640]  got some text here for everybody, who is not a TV viewer, and then we've got it in Chinese
[36:24.640 --> 36:41.240]  and in American, the first plan is the aforementioned BGY plan and the second is the 3-4 plan which
[36:41.240 --> 36:50.680]  foment weakens, foments chaos and chaos destruction, today I swear with my life, implement the
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.800]  U.S. by the kleptocrats, is carried out so successfully quickly that it will cause
[36:56.800 --> 37:06.960]  tremendous damage, with the American bombs, the reassess, this damage is not just equivalent
[37:06.960 --> 37:12.720]  to that of 9 out of 10, it can be 100 or 1000 times that, darkness is going to be prepared
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.120]  to snatch the press club, we've got to release them, darkness is about the CPPs, kleptocrats
[37:17.120 --> 37:23.720]  is coming, will pervade throughout the entire world, no one is safe, be prepared, and here
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.840]  he is, underbidens, smoking that crack, they don't deny it, and then we blurt it out where
[37:28.840 --> 37:47.960]  he's having sex, the trashiest drug on the planet, crack okay, his dad signed a crime
[37:47.960 --> 37:55.960]  bill, he did black people's sentences three times longer, three times longer if he smoked
[37:55.960 --> 38:03.120]  that, the level of their hypocrisy is just staggering, in radio lizards you don't have
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.560]  to look at this, but there it is, and a lot more coming out, Patrick Howley thank you
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.880]  so much for joining us, obviously next time we'll get into your big story, the diary,
[38:13.880 --> 38:18.640]  more of that's been published at naturalphile.com, but just in general, how are they going to
[38:18.640 --> 38:23.440]  deny all this now, as it all comes out, and as it's confirmed to be accurate, and from
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.040]  your sources, what's the next shoe to drop?
[38:27.040 --> 38:33.240]  Well I was just locked out of Twitter for breaking the Ashley Biden diary story, there's
[38:33.240 --> 38:38.880]  no way that Ashley Biden can deny this, and by the way Twitter has locked me out for supposedly
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.280]  violating the child exploitation policy, so they're admitting that Joe Biden did in fact
[38:44.280 --> 38:49.840]  exploit a child, which was his daughter, which is what Ashley Biden wrote in her diary, and
[38:49.840 --> 38:58.280]  I am perfectly capable of saying that Ashley Biden has confirmed that it is her diary,
[38:58.280 --> 39:04.440]  on tape with a whistleblower, we have numerous tapes proving that it is Ashley Biden's diary,
[39:04.440 --> 39:09.880]  one of the top people at the very top of the food chain at Fox News confirmed to me that
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.440]  yes it is real, and I was the only one who went out there and broke the story, nobody
[39:15.440 --> 39:19.080]  else wants to break the story apparently, apparently there's all kinds of institutional
[39:19.080 --> 39:26.040]  pressure, you got all these folks like John Solomon from Fox News going around and trying
[39:26.040 --> 39:31.600]  to shut everything down, and it's all controlled opposition, and we're so tired of this, look
[39:31.600 --> 39:35.720]  how long they talked about Spygate on Fox News for four years, just so they could run
[39:35.720 --> 39:40.240]  out the clock and then nothing ever happened, we are so tired of the deep state and the
[39:40.240 --> 39:46.400]  CIA manipulating our media on the independent conservative side, and that includes Jack
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.760]  Posobiak who is caught tweeting from CIA headquarters and then tried to cover it up, we are so
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.600]  sick and tired of this controlled opposition because we all know what's going on, Epstein
[39:55.600 --> 40:02.880]  got caught, Maxwell got caught, Bronfman got caught, the Mossad families got caught, blackmailing
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.200]  politicians controlling the United States of America through blackmail, I know it, I've
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.280]  known it for ten years, every single thing I've reported over the last ten years has
[40:12.280 --> 40:18.640]  proved this, I'm right, I'm the true visionary and you as well Alex on a bigger level but
[40:18.640 --> 40:24.360]  me as a reporter, I've been right, I've been absolutely 100% vindicated, I know what the
[40:24.360 --> 40:29.360]  power structure of the world is and people need to wake up to it.
[40:29.360 --> 40:33.280]  Well the truth is these people are degenerates who are totally compromised and who are out
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.240]  of control of their own worst nightmare, I think by visionary we just have clear sight,
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.960]  other people are in denial but I don't see them ever putting this back together again
[40:41.960 --> 40:46.640]  but they're full of more bravada than ever, they're full of more hubris, what do you expect
[40:46.640 --> 40:48.200]  to see in the next eight days?
[40:48.200 --> 40:55.240]  Well I expect to see a lot more scandals broken by me that I have on my, well I'm not going
[40:55.240 --> 40:58.560]  to say where I have it, I have it a lot of different places and there are other people
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.200]  who have it too and it's all backed up and I know that some people are watching right
[41:02.200 --> 41:08.520]  now from the deep state which is this big monolithic entity and that's fine, I'm going
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.360]  to break a whole lot more scandals in the next few days as I always do and I'm going
[41:12.360 --> 41:16.040]  to wake the people up and the only way that the Democrats can win this election is by
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.560]  jamming through vote by mail fraud as I have already busted in Houston a massive voter
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.360]  fraud operation on the Democrat side that the FBI has actually shut down but they don't
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.920]  want it to come out in the public because the FBI line is that there's no such thing
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.360]  as voter fraud and that's just a ran, sowing doubt, that's just a ran, sowing doubt.
[41:36.360 --> 41:40.840]  Oh yeah, notice Ray comes out and says that so that letting every rank and file FBI agent
[41:40.840 --> 41:42.840]  know if you do your job you're going to get in trouble.
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.720]  The guys are disgusting fraud and his body language when he gives those speeches is like
[41:46.720 --> 41:51.480]  he just looks like a criminal used car salesman.
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.560]  He's yeah, ridiculous, I mean he does look like a used car salesman and that's exactly
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.680]  what he looks like, he's like a Kurt Vonnegut character, this sleazy used car salesman guy
[42:00.680 --> 42:05.640]  Christopher Ray and the narrative that they're pushing is there's no such thing as voter
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.720]  fraud and that's Iranian disinformation.
[42:09.720 --> 42:14.560]  And what they do is they appeal to the right left paradigm, this is what they do so effectively.
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.160]  Oh, conservatives who watch Fox, do you hate Iran?
[42:18.160 --> 42:22.160]  Do you know how Trump is against Iran and Iran is against Trump?
[42:22.160 --> 42:24.520]  It's not Iran saying there's election fraud.
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.360]  That's total BS, Iran can't even wipe its ass.
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.160]  So then they get the conservatives to be like, oh the voter fraud is being spread by Iran
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.720]  and all the influencers who are all on the take are all on the CIA doll, it's the biggest
[42:38.720 --> 42:39.720]  fraud ever.
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.760]  You're the only one who's actually independent, Alex, that's why I, yeah, there's a lot of
[42:43.760 --> 42:44.760]  independence out there.
[42:44.760 --> 42:45.760]  People are waking up at better.
[42:45.760 --> 42:48.160]  Let's talk about what's in the diary.
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.040]  The silence is deafening just like the emails.
[42:52.040 --> 42:53.040]  Is it real?
[42:53.040 --> 42:58.520]  Looks more like it is right back.
[42:58.520 --> 43:00.920]  I admire President Trump.
[43:00.920 --> 43:06.320]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched, his wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[43:06.320 --> 43:09.720]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[43:09.720 --> 43:10.720]  He's not God.
[43:10.720 --> 43:11.920]  He's not an angel.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.920]  He's not perfect.
[43:12.920 --> 43:19.720]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[43:19.720 --> 43:26.800]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom and the way he stood up against
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.720]  these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[43:31.720 --> 43:32.720]  And I'm serious.
[43:32.720 --> 43:36.440]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning, thinking about President
[43:36.440 --> 43:37.440]  Trump.
[43:37.440 --> 43:43.080]  I just want to say I admire the President so much and I appreciate you, the listeners and
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.360]  everybody for what you've done.
[43:44.360 --> 43:45.360]  I admire you.
[43:45.360 --> 43:47.800]  That's what you call it, thank me, folks.
[43:47.800 --> 43:48.800]  I admire you.
[43:48.800 --> 43:49.800]  I admire Trump.
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.640]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight and I just wish I could do more.
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.200]  We're going to win this fight together.
[43:55.200 --> 43:56.720]  This election is so important.
[43:56.720 --> 43:58.720]  Let's pray for President Trump.
[43:58.720 --> 44:13.680]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.080]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.320]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[44:20.320 --> 44:23.800]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[44:23.800 --> 44:25.920]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[44:25.920 --> 44:28.160]  I suggest Band.Video.
[44:28.160 --> 44:32.760]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[44:32.760 --> 44:33.760]  to stop it.
[44:33.760 --> 44:37.880]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.080]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.120]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the Share buttons below

[44:56.920 --> 45:05.520]  The future isn't coming, it's here, and in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.720]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.400]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset, the world being built by the technocrats,
[45:16.400 --> 45:22.400]  and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning
[45:22.400 --> 45:31.000]  of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.840]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[45:36.840 --> 45:37.840]  2050.
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.840]  This is their stated goal.
[45:39.840 --> 45:46.360]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[45:46.360 --> 45:49.360]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[45:49.360 --> 45:50.360]  We turn this around.
[45:50.360 --> 45:55.440]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips
[45:55.440 --> 45:56.440]  with it.
[45:56.440 --> 45:58.560]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[45:58.560 --> 46:01.080]  Black Friday in October.
[46:01.080 --> 46:05.520]  Last year that was one of our most popular sales that we ran in the last couple weeks
[46:05.520 --> 46:06.520]  of October.
[46:06.520 --> 46:07.520]  It was popular for a reason.
[46:07.520 --> 46:13.200]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[46:13.200 --> 46:18.680]  That means 30 to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points, that's 15%
[46:18.680 --> 46:19.680]  off your next order.
[46:19.680 --> 46:23.120]  Everybody that signs up for auto-shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these
[46:23.120 --> 46:25.120]  items lost leaders now.
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.200]  A lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there, but some good news.
[46:29.200 --> 46:32.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals and
[46:32.800 --> 46:36.640]  amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.520]  It is back in stock, back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election, and more good
[46:41.520 --> 46:42.520]  news.
[46:42.520 --> 46:48.800]  Number 12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason, highest quality 5MV12, take it under the tongue
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.800]  for full absorption.
[46:49.800 --> 46:56.680]  It is now back in stock, both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[46:56.680 --> 47:01.280]  Black Friday comes in October.
[47:01.280 --> 47:13.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.480 --> 47:26.560]  I was on the phone today, the former Major General.
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.560]  He said, Jones, you need to be really careful what you're up to, you know, they're gonna
[47:31.560 --> 47:32.560]  try to kill you for this.
[47:32.560 --> 47:36.440]  And I said, you know, I don't really think about that.
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.360]  I just think about whether the information's accurate or not, and it's my duty to do it.
[47:40.360 --> 47:45.640]  There's an extreme enjoyment in having zero fear, because when you realize you're following
[47:45.640 --> 47:52.800]  God's will and commit to it, that's all that's left, is victory.
[47:52.800 --> 47:56.520]  But it is true that this is very dangerous, so everybody tuning in to understand the enemy
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.360]  did everything they could to shut this down.
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.960]  You kept this on air, so we're on air right now.
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.440]  So you are the folks that get the credit here.
[48:03.440 --> 48:08.360]  I knew what I signed on to a long time ago, because I'm not gonna be part of these people.
[48:08.360 --> 48:11.080]  It's one thing to pay lip service against the pedophile rings.
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.960]  It's one thing to pay lip service against the chai comms of the Satanist.
[48:13.960 --> 48:17.640]  It's one thing to pay lip service and say you're not for it, but then sit there and
[48:17.640 --> 48:19.240]  count to it.
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.160]  But I'm doing this because I realize how bad it's gonna be if they win.
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.280]  Everybody in major cities of the U.S., they're sitting police to people's doors, saying you
[48:27.280 --> 48:29.520]  will give COVID tests outside of law.
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.360]  They don't care if federal and state courts rule it's illegal.
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.360]  This is a U.N.
[48:33.360 --> 48:34.360]  power grab.
[48:34.360 --> 48:35.360]  It's now.
[48:35.360 --> 48:36.840]  Patrick Howley of nationalfile.com.
[48:36.840 --> 48:38.440]  Get back into your story.
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.240]  You've broken three more stories since you were on with us on emergency report Saturday
[48:42.240 --> 48:48.120]  night, last night, recap how big this is, who Joe Biden's daughter is, and what's unfolding
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.320]  and the fact that so far they've been reached out to for a while on this.
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.360]  There's been tape admitting reportedly it's real, but they're not putting out public denials
[48:55.360 --> 48:58.960]  right now, even though this has gone viral.
[48:58.960 --> 49:03.160]  Ashley Biden is on videotape admitting that the diary is hers.
[49:03.160 --> 49:08.480]  The diary details inappropriate showers that she took with her father, Joe.
[49:08.480 --> 49:12.880]  It details her belief that she was in fact molested, that she was hyper-sexualized at
[49:12.880 --> 49:18.400]  a young age with Caroline, who we believe is her cousin, Caroline Biden.
[49:18.400 --> 49:21.480]  And this is one of the biggest stories in the world right now.
[49:21.480 --> 49:26.160]  I have just been locked out of Twitter purportedly for violating the child exploitation policy.
[49:26.160 --> 49:31.080]  So I guess Twitter's admitting that Joe Biden did in fact exploit a child because I reported
[49:31.080 --> 49:36.320]  on this and this diary, they're confirming, oh, it's all legitimate, it's all real.
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.440]  You don't know something's true until they deny it.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.440]  Them blocking this really shows.
[49:42.440 --> 49:43.440]  Yeah.
[49:43.440 --> 49:44.440]  Well, they're not denying it.
[49:44.440 --> 49:45.440]  They're trying to shut it down.
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.800]  But if they intact this and say we were liars, it'd be one thing, they just are totally quiet.
[49:51.800 --> 49:52.800]  Exactly.
[49:52.800 --> 49:55.200]  And this is just what it is.
[49:55.200 --> 49:57.280]  Look, we know what this is.
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.800]  I come from one of the families that built this country.
[49:59.800 --> 50:00.800]  I'm Irish.
[50:00.800 --> 50:02.480]  I didn't have anything to do with slavery.
[50:02.480 --> 50:07.080]  The European elites, the people who are still over there at Bilderberg, the European elites,
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.600]  they should be talked to about slavery.
[50:08.600 --> 50:12.040]  Black Lives Matter should go over there, but they never will because Black Lives Matter
[50:12.040 --> 50:14.280]  is a controlled up.
[50:14.280 --> 50:19.520]  It's middle-class white people and middle-class people of all colors, really, who just love
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.920]  this country, who are patriots, are being destroyed in this country, replaced, totally
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.360]  demolished, our businesses bankrupted, just kicked in the face.
[50:28.360 --> 50:32.080]  Oh, they admit the COVID-19 thing is just destroying hundreds of years of wealth.
[50:32.080 --> 50:34.280]  It's annihilating all the average people.
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.280]  Totally sick.
[50:35.280 --> 50:36.280]  Absolutely.
[50:36.280 --> 50:41.680]  Wiping out small business, wiping out all the wealth of the average people and giving
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.080]  a treasury bailout to the big corporations and Wall Street so that they can consolidate
[50:46.080 --> 50:49.960]  their wealth so that they can continue to kick us in the face.
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.800]  And it's going at a very, very rapid pace now.
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.320]  They're talking about the great reset now, which is basically tearing down everything
[50:56.320 --> 51:00.720]  that we built in this great civilization and turning it into an awful civilization.
[51:00.720 --> 51:01.840]  They've already done that.
[51:01.840 --> 51:02.840]  We live in a strip-raw society.
[51:02.840 --> 51:05.880]  And they're building it as tell you because the elites, when they're corrupt, want to
[51:05.880 --> 51:06.880]  see you poor.
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.800]  It makes them more happy that they're fat and wealthy while you're starving.
[51:10.800 --> 51:11.800]  Business surfed them.
[51:11.800 --> 51:13.000]  They do it on purpose.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.400]  They enjoy it.
[51:15.400 --> 51:17.280]  And they get sexual satisfaction from that.
[51:17.280 --> 51:19.040]  I know that for a fact.
[51:19.040 --> 51:25.640]  They get sexual satisfaction from the suffering of children and from the suffering of white,
[51:25.640 --> 51:30.640]  normal, regular American patriotic people, the people who they despise more than anything.
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.280]  You used to be able to drive down beautiful highways, country roads, as John Denver would
[51:35.280 --> 51:36.280]  say.
[51:36.280 --> 51:39.200]  And now it's just one disgusting strip mall after another.
[51:39.200 --> 51:41.960]  And, you know, that's better than even...
[51:41.960 --> 51:42.960]  But let's be clear.
[51:42.960 --> 51:44.080]  It's not brown people that run this.
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.960]  It's a bunch of rich, old, white people.
[51:45.960 --> 51:46.960]  But you're right.
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.720]  They hate the West because the Christian eat those.
[51:48.720 --> 51:49.880]  I wouldn't say it's white people.
[51:49.880 --> 51:54.360]  I'd say it's that white people have been the group battling them.
[51:54.360 --> 51:57.720]  They just so happen to be white as well, but they're the rulers over us.
[51:57.720 --> 52:04.320]  Well, yes, because America was traditionally run by white men, they see white men who
[52:04.320 --> 52:09.520]  are Christians and want to have a stable society as the biggest threat to them and
[52:09.520 --> 52:13.560]  the biggest threat to their globalist, one-world, new-world order.
[52:13.560 --> 52:16.880]  And so that's why we see the constant demonization of white males.
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.360]  Nobody can deny that this is happening.
[52:18.360 --> 52:19.360]  Sure, I get it.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.360]  You're particularly sick of that.
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.360]  And so am I.
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.840]  You just get the reverse psychology that's trying to turn us into racists so they can
[52:24.840 --> 52:25.840]  divide us all.
[52:25.840 --> 52:26.840]  I mean, that's the game.
[52:26.840 --> 52:27.840]  Yeah.
[52:27.840 --> 52:29.340]  And I'm not a racist, obviously.
[52:29.340 --> 52:30.340]  No, no, no.
[52:30.340 --> 52:31.340]  I agree.
[52:31.340 --> 52:32.340]  I'm just discussing the whole paradigm.
[52:32.340 --> 52:35.840]  Everybody should stand up and be proud of themselves and be aware that they can program
[52:35.840 --> 52:36.840]  smite.
[52:36.840 --> 52:37.840]  Hey, you're white.
[52:37.840 --> 52:38.840]  That's a real brown racist.
[52:38.840 --> 52:41.120]  It's got to be dealt with versus, you know, white racism as well.
[52:41.120 --> 52:45.040]  I'm just saying we have to pull back and see the larger programming of how they're trying
[52:45.040 --> 52:49.840]  to divide us all when we should be unifying in a pro-human future right now.
[52:49.840 --> 52:50.840]  I think that's right.
[52:50.840 --> 52:55.480]  We should unify as a humanity against the globalist oligarchs, the so-called insect
[52:55.480 --> 52:56.480]  people.
[52:56.480 --> 52:58.440]  I don't mean that literally, but that's what I call them.
[52:58.440 --> 53:03.080]  And this AI transhumanist future, they have contempt for humanity.
[53:03.080 --> 53:07.360]  And so by pitting humanity against each other, they keep us at each other's throats.
[53:07.360 --> 53:12.640]  That's what this whole right-left paradigm is about, even though the same kind of neoliberal
[53:12.640 --> 53:16.280]  banksters and corrupt oligarchs run both sides.
[53:16.280 --> 53:20.040]  I mean, sure, if I saw headlines that blacks were inherently evil, I would fight those.
[53:20.040 --> 53:21.040]  It's not true.
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.080]  But now they say whites are inherently evil at all these colleges we put up with it.
[53:24.080 --> 53:28.420]  But shifting out of that clue, the great reset, the COVID lockdown, all of this is the
[53:28.420 --> 53:34.160]  establishment hysterical Bill Gates that was working with Epstein to blackmail scientists,
[53:34.160 --> 53:37.320]  obviously, with the sex ops that's come out.
[53:37.320 --> 53:38.320]  They're desperate.
[53:38.320 --> 53:39.320]  So we see this and get depressed.
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.320]  I get depressed.
[53:40.320 --> 53:45.040]  We've got to be positive and realize we made them play their ace card because they're
[53:45.040 --> 53:46.040]  in so much damn trouble.
[53:46.040 --> 53:48.760]  So we just got to see this through.
[53:48.760 --> 53:54.520]  The entire concept of their wealth is rendered meaningless by the fact that we can get information
[53:54.520 --> 53:55.520]  out there.
[53:55.520 --> 54:01.680]  We are a ragtag band of citizen journalists, and we have stood up to people who have literally
[54:01.680 --> 54:06.720]  trillions of trillions of dollars in wealth who can just print money and hand it out to
[54:06.720 --> 54:07.720]  themselves.
[54:07.720 --> 54:09.440]  But it shows it's like Wizard of Oz behind the curtain.
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.480]  It's all it's all just vapor.
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.480]  It is.
[54:13.480 --> 54:14.480]  That's what it is.
[54:14.480 --> 54:15.480]  It's all vapor.
[54:15.480 --> 54:16.480]  It doesn't come to anything.
[54:16.480 --> 54:17.680]  It doesn't mean anything.
[54:17.680 --> 54:19.320]  The money is not backed up by gold.
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.320]  It's just whatever worth they say it is.
[54:21.320 --> 54:23.400]  Let's get back to your report.
[54:23.400 --> 54:28.640]  I'm told you've got more big reports in this 100 plus page diary, which again, you reportedly
[54:28.640 --> 54:32.360]  has the whistleblowers recordings of her admitting it, recordings of the whistleblower talking
[54:32.360 --> 54:33.360]  about it.
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.120]  The fact that they're not denying it and they're simply trying to ignore it shows me just like
[54:37.120 --> 54:38.120]  the emails.
[54:38.120 --> 54:39.120]  It's Bonafini.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[54:40.120 --> 54:41.120]  100%.
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.440]  This, there's no question that this is an accurate story.
[54:46.440 --> 54:47.680]  And I'm always right.
[54:47.680 --> 54:48.680]  And you know what?
[54:48.680 --> 54:50.560]  We are going to continue to expose these people.
[54:50.560 --> 54:55.440]  We're going to continue to expose how Nancy Pelosi rented office space to a group that
[54:55.440 --> 54:58.160]  was basically designed.
[54:58.160 --> 55:00.520]  The architect of this group was a notorious pedophile.
[55:00.520 --> 55:01.920]  It was an open secret.
[55:01.920 --> 55:03.000]  Everybody knows this.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  And now, you know, I was the one who exposed Paul Pelosi, Jr. Nancy Pelosi's son.
[55:07.000 --> 55:13.600]  Now he's showing up in the Hunter Biden scandal and I noticed a bunch of other big Democrats
[55:13.600 --> 55:17.520]  are getting tied in, not just to the diary, but to the Biden corruption scandal.
[55:17.520 --> 55:19.020]  Oh, yeah.
[55:19.020 --> 55:20.880]  These people couldn't even get a security clearance.
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.200]  We're going to have a big, big, big problem here if any of these people actually get elected
[55:25.200 --> 55:26.200]  or go forward.
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.840]  God forbid if Nancy Pelosi manages to drag this out until late January and then installs
[55:30.840 --> 55:34.960]  herself as the president, oh, she's got even bigger problems than Joe.
[55:34.960 --> 55:38.640]  These people are sick people and they, there's so much blackmail.
[55:38.640 --> 55:40.400]  Rudy Giuliani is a great American.
[55:40.400 --> 55:43.200]  I don't blame him for the slow trickle of this.
[55:43.200 --> 55:46.400]  I blame a tremendous amount of institutional pressure.
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.640]  I blame some people who are close to him who I don't think have his best interests at heart
[55:50.640 --> 55:53.640]  in terms of being media experts or whatever on this story.
[55:53.640 --> 55:54.640]  Rudy's the real deal though.
[55:54.640 --> 55:55.640]  I know Rudy.
[55:55.640 --> 55:56.640]  Rudy's a great guy.
[55:56.640 --> 55:58.320]  Rudy wants to save America.
[55:58.320 --> 56:00.000]  He's our James Bond right now.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.040]  We've got a rally behind Rudy.
[56:02.040 --> 56:05.000]  He got all this information himself.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.040]  This is just like other children molested.
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.040]  Was I molested?
[56:08.040 --> 56:09.040]  I think so.
[56:09.040 --> 56:11.720]  I can't remember specifics, but I do remember trauma.
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.600]  Wrote the author before listing a series of potential incidents, one of which may have
[56:15.600 --> 56:21.200]  included Ashley Biden's cousin, Caroline Biden, as the author says, remembers being somewhat
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.120]  sexualized alongside a person named Caroline.
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.800]  And then her, her, her brother, Hunter is in emails now confirmed saying, I'm smoking
[56:29.800 --> 56:30.880]  crack with 14 year olds.
[56:30.880 --> 56:31.880]  I'm caught on video.
[56:31.880 --> 56:33.880]  What am I going to do to his dad?
[56:33.880 --> 56:37.240]  I mean, this is, this is insane.
[56:37.240 --> 56:38.240]  These are confirmed emails.
[56:38.240 --> 56:40.520]  I mean, these people are nuts, man.
[56:40.520 --> 56:41.520]  Yep.
[56:41.520 --> 56:42.600]  But it's a crime family.
[56:42.600 --> 56:46.040]  They were going around the world making a tremendous amount of money selling access and they're
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.040]  going to sell access to the White House of Joe Biden gets in there.
[56:49.040 --> 56:51.080]  We are finished if Joe Biden gets in there.
[56:51.080 --> 56:52.240]  I can't say this enough.
[56:52.240 --> 56:57.080]  I say this to people who I know in my own personal life who are like normies and they,
[56:57.080 --> 56:58.080]  they're middle class.
[56:58.080 --> 57:01.240]  Oh, well, you know, well, I don't know about conspiracy theories.
[57:01.240 --> 57:02.440]  Enough is enough.
[57:02.440 --> 57:05.480]  These people are criminals and they're ruling over us.
[57:05.480 --> 57:11.080]  How is your life better by virtue of the fact that the sicko degenerate Biden family gets
[57:11.080 --> 57:14.320]  to rule over you and have nuclear weapons?
[57:14.320 --> 57:15.580]  This is nonsense.
[57:15.580 --> 57:16.580]  This is madness.
[57:16.580 --> 57:20.680]  I agree with you because when I see how pathetic they are, it makes me feel pathetic that they've
[57:20.680 --> 57:21.680]  been ruling over us.
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.760]  Let's do five more minutes ahead of Laura Loomer, who's the leader now ahead in polls
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.280]  to win in the congressional seat there in Palm Beach where Trump is Trump just voted
[57:32.280 --> 57:33.520]  for her yesterday.
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.200]  It's big national loser pulling their hair out.
[57:35.200 --> 57:36.200]  Patrick Hall is our guest.
[57:36.200 --> 57:39.600]  I'm Alan Jones with info wars.com and news wars.com.
[57:39.600 --> 57:42.360]  Anyway, those links get shared is you doing a great job.
[57:42.360 --> 57:43.760]  We thank you and salute you.
[57:43.760 --> 57:44.760]  Stay with us.
[57:44.760 --> 57:49.880]  Hour number two straight ahead that Owen Troyer takes over with two weeks left to the historic
[57:49.880 --> 57:51.120]  election.
[57:51.120 --> 57:53.120]  We're launching the biggest sell of the year.
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.880]  The top some already amazing sales.
[57:55.880 --> 57:59.280]  It's Black Friday comes in October special.
[57:59.280 --> 58:00.280]  Something we did last year.
[58:00.280 --> 58:01.380]  It was very, very popular.
[58:01.380 --> 58:02.960]  We did it for the whole month last year.
[58:02.960 --> 58:07.720]  We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month because stocks are low and a
[58:07.720 --> 58:09.080]  lot of our best selling products.
[58:09.080 --> 58:14.360]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free
[58:14.360 --> 58:19.040]  shipping is ultra 12 incredible high quality B12 taken under the tongue.
[58:19.040 --> 58:20.040]  Look into how great it is.

[58:23.800 --> 58:28.840]  mineral fusion with the zinc and the other vitamins and minerals that are essential and
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.360]  amino acids to make sure your body uploads it better.
[58:32.360 --> 58:38.840]  It's back in stock at info wars store.com, vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 the flagship
[58:38.840 --> 58:44.880]  products of Black Friday comes in October sale at info wars store.com or triple eight
[58:44.880 --> 58:50.440]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[58:50.440 --> 58:55.800]  China is open America is closed and in the European Union where the people are revolting
[58:55.800 --> 59:00.520]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of
[59:00.520 --> 59:01.520]  lock job.
[59:01.520 --> 59:02.520]  It's very simple.
[59:02.520 --> 59:06.200]  Where authoritarians are you have complete control of commerce China.
[59:06.200 --> 59:11.840]  Oh, there's no more lockdowns and their heroes and the UN says, for example, for assault.
[59:11.840 --> 59:13.920]  After all, that's where the virus came from.
[59:13.920 --> 59:18.120]  After all, that's where the fear monster came from the lockdown came from.
[59:18.120 --> 59:24.720]  But that was a weapon psychological hysteria, a chicken little syndrome being created that
[59:24.720 --> 59:32.360]  was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass
[59:32.360 --> 59:33.360]  hysteria.
[59:33.360 --> 59:39.960]  And so far, it's been incredibly successful until just the last few weeks as across the
[59:39.960 --> 59:46.040]  world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN communist Chinese world government
[59:46.040 --> 59:52.240]  power graph.
[59:52.240 --> 1:00:05.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:10.480]  Well, we ever wondered that Americans would stand up and fight against the global's takeover.
[1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.880]  You're tuned in, you're spreading the word, you're in the damn fight.
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:13.880]  I hope you understand that.
[1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:14.880]  And me?
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:15.880]  I'm absolutely committed on her tip this time.
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:16.880]  I've been in this fight so long.
[1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  I'm ready for everything.
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:22.880]  I got, I got God on my side.
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:24.880]  That doesn't mean I'm physically going to win this.
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  I may have been the biggest loser ever in the news.
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:35.120]  Well, that doesn't matter to me, what matters is the eyes of God, I can feel those eyes.
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:38.640]  So Patrick, I really appreciate you, the great work you're doing.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:39.920]  They're not denying this report.
[1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:41.920]  It fits into all the rest of the M.O.
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:42.920]  More is coming out.
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:43.920]  You got a lot of sources.
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:46.280]  What else should we look to be dropping here?
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:50.800]  Well, look, when you look at Ashley Biden, when you look at the relapses that she's had,
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:55.400]  when you look at the resentment that she has for her father, for his emotional manipulation
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:01:00.320]  as she says in this diary, when you look at her sex addiction, when you look at how she
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:06.160]  was in her belief molested as a child, the inappropriate showers with Joe, when you look
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:11.880]  at how sick these children are after growing up around Joe Biden, when you look at the
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:15.800]  crime family, when you look at all the money that these people are making, selling access
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:19.440]  to the United States of America, there is no one in their right mind who thinks this
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:21.920]  man Joe Biden should have the nuclear codes.
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:25.120]  There's no one in their right mind who thinks he should have the nuclear football, let alone
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:28.720]  any kind of red phone, let alone any kind of power whatsoever.
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:35.960]  And I am so sick and tired of this country, which my family built being destroyed by criminals,
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.960]  by grifters, by liars, and then they turn on the fake media and they demonize people
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:46.640]  like me for our skin color or whatever, and they say, oh, yeah, you know, they get all
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:51.480]  the normies on board with these people and try to pretend that these evil, sicko criminals
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:56.400]  are real kind of philanthropists or whatever, oh, they're social workers, you know, they're
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:02.000]  going to come to your house and help you raise your kids when we know damn well what CPS
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.880]  is doing, which is taking little kids out of their houses and selling them into sex slavery.
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:11.960]  And I'm sick of that, my family built this country and I'm not going to stand for it.
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.000]  Donald Trump is the last guard.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:21.280]  He's the last one standing up for this country to try to protect decency and Christian values
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.280]  and Western civilization.
[1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:26.320]  I want to tell the left-hand thing, everybody I know that's protecting them wants to get
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:27.320]  rid of them.
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:31.560]  So if they get the civil war they want, I just hope they realize they have no idea how
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:33.520]  they're about to get their asses handed to them.
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:34.520]  That's not a threat.
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:35.520]  I'm not going to do anything to them.
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:38.240]  I've done it themselves, I'm just saying they're done.
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:41.320]  All of them, big tech heads, all of them.
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.280]  It's not a civil war if only one side is fighting.
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:47.880]  Right now these riot squads, Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the rest of them are going
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:54.440]  around and punching us in the face and humiliating us and nobody's doing anything, okay?
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:03:00.480]  So we need to really come together and we need to realize that humanity is at stake here
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:04.440]  and I appeal to every single politician out there, including Laura Loomer and all the
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:08.280]  rest of the politicians, she's a friend of mine but she's a politician, so who knows
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:10.040]  what she's going to do if she gets into office.
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:15.440]  I appeal to every single politician out there to realize the suffering of the American people
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:19.760]  and to actually give two bigs about the people who built this country who are now living in
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:24.240]  squalor because of the globalist elites and how they have kicked us in the face and destroyed
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.240]  us.
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:26.240]  Enough is enough.
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:29.720]  I'm not leaving this country, I'm not fleeing this country, I'm going to be a distant in
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:33.240]  this country and I'm going to keep holding politicians accountable and I'm going to keep
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:36.920]  showing them for the evil scumbags that they are.
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:37.920]  I hear you.
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:43.080]  Well, I think Laura Loomer is a highly censored person and a fighter, she's not in office
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:46.160]  yet, I don't think she's been a politician, Patrick, I think she's going to kick ass if
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:47.160]  she gets elected.
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:52.000]  She's very close to being elected, showing the major backlash, you know, she won that
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.240]  primary when she wasn't supposed to and now a lot of polls have her head.
[1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:58.400]  I think that's good news for Trump.
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:02.240]  Well, Trump is what I care about and Trump is going to win this election.
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:07.560]  I feel confident that Trump's going to win this election because I'm going to be running
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:13.320]  the database of all of the voter fraud and pointing to each and every single case and
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:18.440]  getting these dumb, you know, RNC lawyers to look at every single thing that I have
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.320]  to say because I'm plugged in right now.
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:24.760]  You see Don Jr. tweeting me, you see Shirley Kirk tweeting me, I'm plugged in, I'm in the
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:26.080]  driver's seat right now.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:28.520]  The Republican Party answers to me, okay?
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:29.520]  That's what's happening.
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:32.960]  I'm going to win this election.
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.520]  It's an amazing time to be alive, Patrick.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:35.520]  Listen, I'm glad you're angry.
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:41.720]  We need to get angry like Howard Beale said in the 1970s network to get out of our comfort
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  zone.
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:43.720]  I don't want you to ride.
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:44.720]  I don't want you to ride.
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:45.720]  I don't want you to march.
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:46.720]  I want you to just go and get mad.
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:49.320]  First, you've got to get mad and say, I'm a human being.
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:50.320]  My life has value.
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.320]  You've got to say you have a stake to the systems that they know.
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:54.320]  Thank you.
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:55.320]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:05:00.640]  History is now.
[1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:02.280]  History is taking place in front of us.
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:03.880]  We are at the crossroads.
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:08.760]  We are now only two weeks out from the most historic and important election in world history.
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:12.720]  I've been saying that for over a year, but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:13.720]  This is so critical.
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:16.440]  The New World Order wants to repudiate the nation state.
[1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:18.120]  They'll repudiate the idea of America.
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:23.440]  They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:28.520]  So they are throwing everything they've got, not just the American people, but the people
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  of the world.
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:32.520]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond king.
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:33.520]  It is paramount.
[1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:38.120]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you shoot your own video,
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:41.240]  or write your own article, or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them, or call
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:43.600]  your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:47.760]  When you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it
[1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:49.640]  adds up into giant things.
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.680]  Many hands make life work.
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:58.680]  Things happen now, take action now while you still can, please, for all of our futures.
[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:35.080]  There's a reason the globalists are fighting so hard to shut us down.
[1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:38.040]  They know the spirit of 1776.
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:43.360]  The spirit of the Renaissance shines brightly from in full wars.
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:49.860]  That spirit of fighting evil is growing stronger, not weaker under attack, because your will
[1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:51.360]  is strong.
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:55.160]  And make no mistake, this is a war of wills.
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:07:02.200]  In full wars, main mission is to expose the globalist blueprint, rally humanity, and stop
[1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:04.560]  them dead in their tracks.
[1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:10.600]  As modern Paul reveres, it's critical for all Americans to do their part in the animating
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:16.680]  contest of liberty to expose darkness and promote freedom and a pro-human future everywhere
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:18.040]  we go.
[1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:19.960]  The quickening is here.
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:27.400]  We are now entering the crossroads, and in full wars is rising to the challenge.
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:33.640]  In full wars and our dedicated, committed crew is fighting harder than ever.
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:39.200]  We live in the most historical times ever seen in the history of our species.
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  Everyone can see it, they can feel it, they can taste it.
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:47.120]  But now, it's all going to the next level.
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:52.200]  Evil is rising, and to challenge it, good is rising as well.
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.240]  The fact that you're awake, the fact that you're involved, the fact that you're engaged,
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:08:03.880]  even in the smallest way, is giant, it's massive, it's consciousness.
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:11.120]  Now, with only days until the election, we must redouble our efforts like never before
[1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:17.000]  in the fight to bring down the deep state and defeat the globalist anti-human system.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:23.240]  The only way our information gets out is when you spread it and when you support it by funding
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:27.840]  our operations, which are your operations at infowarstore.com.
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:36.480]  All right, Laura Loomer joins us from Florida where Trump just voted for her yesterday.
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:43.000]  In fact, it's become a big press issue, but Trump has publicly defended her and said she's
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.200]  a great person, he platformed, censored, almost at a level more than I have, except I've had
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:51.640]  bank accounts taken, I've been blocked on a bunch of the things as well.
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.640]  But I mean, she's one of the most persecuted people out there.
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:57.680]  We'll go to her in a moment, but here's President Trump yesterday getting on Air Force One being
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:01.680]  asked about it by the press.
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:02.680]  Thank you very much.
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:03.680]  Did you vote for Laura Loomer today?
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:04.680]  Did you vote for her?
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:05.680]  Did I vote?
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:06.680]  Did you vote for Laura Loomer?
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:07.680]  I voted straight Republican.
[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:08.680]  Okay.
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:09.680]  Thank you.
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:12.160]  So they wanted like, oh, Laura Loomer's bad, Laura Loomer's bad.
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:17.000]  This is insane because she exposed AOC as anti-American, everything she's exposed has
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  been true.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  She's worked for Project Veritas.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  She's amazing.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.160]  Laura Loomer, you're on the street.
[1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:23.000]  Tell us where you are in Florida.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  We love you.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.760]  And hopefully in eight days, if there is an election fraud, you're going to win.
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:30.760]  I know you're ahead in the polls, just like you were ahead and they tried to deny it in
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:31.760]  the primaries.
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:32.760]  We salute you, Laura.
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:37.840]  Well, I love you too, Alex, and I love the info warriors out there.
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:42.960]  And right now, I'm currently at the Summit Library right across the street from the Trump
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:48.400]  International Golf Club here in West Palm Beach, Florida, where I early voted yesterday
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:50.560]  along with President Trump.
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:56.040]  President Trump voted for me at this early voting location, and it was just amazing.
[1:09:56.040 --> 1:10:00.320]  So no one really gets to say that they voted for the president and the president voted
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:06.560]  for them, you know, in Florida, you know, at the same polling location.
[1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:10.200]  Victory was made, and the president of the United States yesterday voted for the most
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:11.600]  banned woman in the world.
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:17.600]  So this is a win for all who have been de-platformed, for all who have been silenced, and, you
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:22.480]  know, look, we're about eight, eight and a half days away from an election victory.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:26.040]  And everywhere I go, there's just massive amounts of energy and momentum.
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:30.240]  I got out here on a bullhorn when Trump was here and, you know, we had our own little
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:36.480]  mini rally and pretty much everybody was honking their horn saying they're voting for me.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:38.960]  It's absolutely beautiful, Laura, what you're doing.
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:43.040]  And the system's so scared of it, so they tried to get Trump to deny you.
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:45.080]  They've been trying this for months, but it's not working.
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:48.720]  He actually endorsed you when they first attacked him for it.
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  It just shows how they operate.
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:51.720]  Right.
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  Isn't that funny?
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:55.280]  So they weren't concerned about just Trump voting in general.
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:58.000]  All the reporters, they were shouting questions here on the street.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.720]  Did you vote for Ms.... Did you vote for Laura Loomer, President Trump?
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  What about Laura Loomer?
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.360]  Did you disavow her and then, you know, all the press was talking about how I was there
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:13.000]  because, you know, you can see here that we have, you know, walls of Laura Loomer for
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.680]  Congress science and my supporters out here waving flags at all the locations.
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:23.320]  And you saw in that video from Air Force One, they're like, oh, did you vote for Laura Loomer?
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:29.560]  And this made it into the official White House notes from his briefing.
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:32.800]  Well, they always attack what's populist.
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:36.000]  They always attack Laura what they fear.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.680]  And so what can we do eight days out to make sure people vote there in that key battleground
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:42.040]  county to get you in?
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.720]  I mean, I know they're crapping bricks right now.
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:50.880]  Well, my district includes parts of West Boca, Delray, Boynton Beach, Lantana, Lake Worth,
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:55.440]  Comby, Dryland, Wellington, Green Acres, and West Palm Beach, and of course, Mar-a-Lago,
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:56.440]  Comby, Dryland.
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:00.320]  So if you live in any of those areas, please come out to vote for me, get 10 of your friends
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:04.760]  to come out and vote for me and tell everyone you know to donate to my campaign.
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.240]  Even if it's just five or $10, if, you know, all the info warriors contributed, we'll have
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:14.040]  all the resources we need because we still need to run more ads, we still need to get
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:15.240]  more signs.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:19.720]  And we have a very robust ground game going on, knocking on thousands of doors here.
[1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:21.560]  And I'm ahead of Lois Frankel.
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:25.360]  And, you know, she's running scared and she's pretending like she doesn't know my name.
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:31.600]  CBS News the other day did an interview with us and they did a separate interview with her
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.520]  and they asked her, they said, Hey, you're, you know, your, your opponent says that you're
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:37.880]  publicly avoiding saying her name.
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:40.480]  And Lois Frankel said, what is her name?
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:43.760]  And Lois has said that I don't deserve to be recognized.
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.840]  She said that people shouldn't say my name and that I don't deserve to have a platform
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:48.840]  or be able to run for office.
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:53.120]  So not only have you platformed me off of all the internet and off of everywhere, you're
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:56.960]  fighting back, your example of a real fighter that I admired truly.
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:01.560]  I hope my daughters are like you and they are, but now they're trying to de-platform your
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:03.640]  name itself as a major candidate.
[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:06.080]  She literally wants to put you in the Phantom Zone.
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:07.240]  This is insane.
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:12.440]  And so winning is to be such a victory, not just not just what you're going to do it.
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:13.960]  Tell folks what you're doing in Congress.
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:15.800]  You're going to call major hearings.
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:19.040]  Well, look, I've had enough of these hearings, right?
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.920]  You're going to make such a big noise in Congress.
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:23.080]  It's time for these executives to go to prison.
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:24.640]  They are committing treason.
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:26.360]  They are committing perjury.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:27.720]  They lied to Congress.
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:32.240]  And like Nancy Pelosi always says, and I agree with her, nobody is above the law.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:36.120]  These tech executives, just because they're, you know, leftist mega donor billionaires
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:39.920]  doesn't mean that they get to censor and silence us and interfere in our elections.
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:44.520]  The Democrats wanted to send everyone in the Trump administration to jail for so-called
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:45.640]  election interference.
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:47.480]  They always call us conspiracy theorists.
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:49.560]  They're the conspiracy theorists.
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:54.720]  We all know this, writing, you know, Russian propaganda hoaxes about the proud boys that
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:58.400]  was really the result of Muslim extremists in Iran, okay?
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.240]  It's the Muslim extremists in Iran who are interfering in our elections, okay?
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  It's Antifa.
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  It's Black Lives Matter.
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:06.240]  It's Gattorsi.
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  Sundar.
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:08.240]  Pekai.
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:09.240]  And they're all against Trump.
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:10.240]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:11.240]  They're all against Trump.
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:12.240]  Exactly.
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:13.960]  And so they need to go to jail.
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:17.840]  And I really do think that the FBI needs to raid Twitter and Facebook.
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:21.440]  I think that they need to do a full-blown raid, Roger Stone style of it, where they
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.520]  show up, you know, from all ends.
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:30.200]  Because I personally think that there are probably Chinese spy and Islamic spy.
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:31.200]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:35.040]  You don't think it came out that Facebook's hired a bunch of communist Chinese and former
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:37.320]  East German stasi to run this, isn't it?
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:40.080]  But I think that that's a national security threat.
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:45.320]  And there's news this last week that some Dutch individual also hacked the president's
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:46.320]  Twitter account.
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:47.960]  It's a national security risk.
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:52.160]  And when you have Chinese spies and, you know, Saudi Arabian spies working inside these
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:56.400]  companies and they're, you know, taking people's personal information, when you have Turkish
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:02.440]  Muslim brotherhood, you know, sympathizers deactivating the president's Twitter account,
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.600]  that's a problem.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:05.400]  And I think that people need to be held accountable.
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:06.920]  By the way, I totally agree with you.
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.360]  Big Tech is a national security issue, not a censorship issue.
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:14.600]  Censorship flows from the fact that they're in bed with the Chai comms, in bed with Iran,
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:18.840]  in bed with all these extremist groups, and they admit they are suppressing our vote.
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:20.360]  This is real election meddling.
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:23.880]  This is what the Democrats falsely claimed the last four years.
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:28.880]  Yeah, and they've been talking about election interference for the last four years, hijacking
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.120]  our news cycle, you know, inciting violence with their fake news.
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:38.080]  But they are interfering with the elections by, by, by conspiring with Big Tech to shut
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:39.080]  us down.
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:40.080]  You're going to stay there.
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.480]  I want to talk more to you about the election in general.
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:43.480]  What you think is coming.
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:46.720]  You know, these amazing ladies, you can hold the mic up to them, that works when we come
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:47.720]  back.
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:48.720]  Laura Loomer, four cars.
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:49.720]  Laura, we got to go to break Laura.
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:53.120]  Back in a few minutes with Laura Loomer.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:56.160]  We are excited, ladies, yes.
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:57.160]  It's on record.
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:15:58.160]  It's not disputed.
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:00.520]  It was rolled out more than eight months ago in common China.
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:01.520]  Now it's in Europe.
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:05.920]  Now it's the United States, Canada, and the most other industrial parts of the planet.
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:11.520]  Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:15.640]  check their menu and they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  they have them.
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:17.640]  Now, what are they saying there?
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:21.880]  Well, you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't
[1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:26.440]  have a piece of paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading terms.
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  It's absolutely asinine.
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:31.000]  They can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.240]  Now what this really is, is a contact tracing database.
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:39.120]  Again, this is admitted that everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of.
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.840]  So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially.
[1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:43.720]  Now your cell phones already track you.
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:46.720]  You already have home assistants watching and listening to you in your house, but now this
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.200]  is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell, have a job, get an airplane
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:52.200]  without it.
[1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:53.200]  And Bill Gates even admits it.
[1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:56.680]  So think about that, folks, and we'll look out.
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:02.480]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.440]  They're sold out because people know that high-quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins,
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:11.720]  minerals, especially zinc, boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:12.720]  immune system.
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:18.960]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com, just two weeks after the election.
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:24.560]  And we're offering them both at 50% off, free shipping, and triple-patria points at your
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:25.560]  next order.
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.120]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off.
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:31.680]  That makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:35.440]  Now we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out while the other
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:36.640]  stuff is close to selling out.
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:40.360]  Well, some of our best sellers are still there, and some of them have actually come back into
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:41.360]  stock.
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:45.000]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.280]  that have actually sold out.
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:48.080]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:50.600]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the air.
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:57.040]  Obviously, we're critical to fight, and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:01.520]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying, and more importantly,
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:07.680]  what they're actually doing, when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story, that was
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:13.080]  a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information.
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.440]  Because they've also been on record saying, coming up on election day and thereafter,
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:21.320]  they're not going to let anyone but, quote, authoritative sources, that means CNN, New
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:26.040]  York Times, what a joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.360]  That way they can contest the election, even though Trump's declared winner, hold everything
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:34.520]  up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession, and have the UN
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:37.200]  come in and declare the election for Biden.
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.960]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:44.280]  And so when you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:48.800]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:53.480]  the public that Big Tech works in unison to suppress speech and information.
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:55.280]  This is Election Meddling 101.

[1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:03.960]  Just type it in one time, you've got to save right there in your browser, and then you

[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:16.800]  text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned.video
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:22.920]  of 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:25.760]  videos, we can comment, we can share them, everything.
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:32.000]  This system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.360]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action once reelected against
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:38.040]  Big Tech, I mean, he's modern in this situation.
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:40.640]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:42.800]  cry because he has to take an action.
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:47.920]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:52.920]  2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new redesigned infomores.com and sharing
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:53.920]  that link.
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:59.760]  It's really upset some old, yeah.
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:11.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:18.520]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:20.160]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:23.800]  Laura Loomer is on the ground in Palm Beach, Florida.
[1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:30.160]  Right outside Mern Lago, President Trump just voted for her yesterday, and when I look at
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:34.840]  what she's been through, what I've been through, we're both success stories because of you
[1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:35.840]  supporting us.
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:40.680]  And so you talk about two peas in the pod, it's just, I really feel good watching her
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:41.680]  not give up.
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.720]  Most people that got censored gave up.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:47.520]  They particularly censored her because when they started censoring, she didn't give up.
[1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:51.440]  They wanted to punish her, they wanted to defeat her, but they didn't, and now she's
[1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:54.160]  about to get vindication, probably winning an election.
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:58.560]  Even if she lost, she fought back, did incredible things, will probably run again and win, but
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:02.040]  she's in the fight, probably going to win, knock on wood.
[1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:06.360]  Laura Loomer continued, tell me about that great crew you're out there with in Florida.
[1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:07.360]  Let's talk to some of them.
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:08.360]  Yeah.
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:09.360]  So these are my volunteers.
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:12.000]  I have the best volunteers in the world.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.240]  You know, some of them are, we're out here yesterday at 4.30 in the morning waiting, getting
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:19.280]  everything set up for me for President Trump's arrival.
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:23.600]  We're out here every day knocking doors and, and, and sign waving and talking to voters
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:28.000]  and, you know, I have a ton of volunteers, but these are some of the ladies that came
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  out with me today.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Hey, you're awesome.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:32.160]  We love you.
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:33.160]  This is Renee.
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:34.160]  Thank you.
[1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.160]  Love you too.
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:36.160]  Kimberly.
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:37.160]  Hi, Alex.
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:38.160]  Hi.
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:39.160]  Jay Ruby.
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:40.160]  Hi, Alex.
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:41.160]  Let's see you guys.
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:42.160]  Love you.
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:43.160]  Love you Alex.
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:48.040]  And then, and then Jody over here, who is, is recording this, but, but yesterday we had,
[1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:52.200]  you know, over 200 of my, uh, supporters out here lined up with Lord Lumer for Congress
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:57.360]  signs and, you know, we got on the bullhorn and we, uh, we had, uh, Trump's flags and we
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:58.360]  had our own little roundup.
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:02.800]  The point is you're fighting back, you're not taking it lying down and you're an example
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:04.440]  of your winning.
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.560]  Usually folks fight for decades of victories.
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:09.520]  You're winning instantly because you've got the fire.
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:11.560]  This is the American dream, Alex.
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:16.560]  Only in the United States of America can you be defamed, deplatformed, censored, threatened
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:21.360]  and totally shut down, have your civil rights violated, only to go on, to, you know, run
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:26.080]  for Congress, win a nomination by double digits with no social media, raise over $1 million.
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.080]  Let's be clear.
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.920]  The whole media laughing at you, trying to destroy you, trying to make, but America knew
[1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:32.680]  it was a fraud and backed you.
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:33.680]  Yeah.
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:37.840]  And the presidents of the United States voted for me yesterday and we made history, Alex.
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:43.160]  They say deplatforming work, but I say deplatforming doesn't work and you can shove it up your
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:44.160]  ass.
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:50.760]  People like the Daily Beast, people at CNN who say deplatforming works and they're so
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:57.880]  nasty and they want us to suffer financially, but guess what, guess it's just it's lagging
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:02.760]  right now, but I say guess what, you know, when you deplatform people, you only create
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:07.520]  a stricend effect and now more people than ever want to know who Laura Loomer is.
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:10.160]  And here we are, you know, I'm recovering my phone.
[1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:12.080]  Oh, Laura, you're a blueprint for victory.
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:15.280]  I don't want to insert myself in this, but lists are supporting us.
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:18.040]  Info wars is more popular than ever because folks stuck with us.
[1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:21.960]  It's just an example of the American spirit that these bastards can't break.
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:26.440]  These billionaire tech people want to bankrupt you, bankrupt me, shut us up because we support
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:30.360]  America and it just, it's blown up in their face and it's beautiful.
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:31.360]  Yeah.
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:35.320]  Well, I can't wait to be their worst nightmare straight out of hell when I, when I win my
[1:23:35.320 --> 1:23:37.600]  race because it's coming.
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:38.600]  It's coming.
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:40.320]  Tell us what you're going to do once you're in Congress.
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:41.320]  Tell us what you're going to do.
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:44.800]  Well, one of the first things I want to do is I want to update our civil rights act to
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:48.760]  include political affiliation as a protected class, so that Trump supporters and really
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:54.640]  people have all walked the life are protected from, from, from gay, lesbian, black, white
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:55.640]  should be protected.
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:24:00.760]  Hispanic, Asian, how about conservative, liberal, how about everybody's protected and can't
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:03.160]  be discriminated against for their political views?
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.160]  Yep.
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:08.560]  One of the, another thing I want to do is I want to make social security tax free because
[1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:12.600]  it's ridiculous that people have to pay taxes on their social security.
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:18.320]  Also too, I want to take down the big tech giants and I really want to push in, you know,
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:23.960]  a public advocacy campaign and, and, and really make it the biggest issue in the country.
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:27.440]  And that is that these executives need to go to prison.
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.960]  They need to pay for their treason.
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.480]  They need to pay for committing perjury and they need to pay for committing human rights
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:38.240]  and civil rights violations against millions of people around the world.
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.080]  And their time is going to come in the most epic form of poetic justice.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:47.280]  When I win my race without any social media besides Farler and Gab, and when I win my
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:51.760]  race, you know, just by all these odds, so they have it coming.
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:55.120]  Listen, I know you came from behind.
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:58.800]  I know they said you were going to lose the primary when you won by more, I guess more
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:24:59.800]  votes from all the other candidates.
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:00.800]  Yeah.
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.480]  And even you were skeptical, you know, even you were skeptical.
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:05.520]  You didn't think I don't think anyone really thought I was skeptical.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:08.600]  I was saying you were a winner just for running.
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:12.640]  That's I was saying, at least you built name, at least you got, it's beautiful what you
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:13.640]  did.
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:14.640]  It's beautiful.
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:19.400]  Well, you know, Alex, I think that what you're doing is beautiful and I, I'm going to invite
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:24.640]  you as my guest to testify when I am put on the House Energy Commerce Committee and
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:28.760]  when I'm able to grill Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pekai.
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:30.360]  And I want you to testify.
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:32.080]  I want Gavin to testify.
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:33.080]  I want Milo to testify.
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:38.240]  I want to be clear, I donated and total listeners to donate and I believe it was a moral cause
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:39.840]  and I thought you were going to win.
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:43.440]  I just was saying with all the cheating and everything and like what five other candidates,
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.120]  whatever it was, that you won the primary was amazing.
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:48.600]  It shows what you, but people are awake what you did.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:51.880]  But I think you have a really good chance of now winning the general election.
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:54.080]  They are really upset right now.
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:59.040]  All throughout Florida, there's, there's a ton of Republican votes that there, the Republicans
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:01.200]  are out voting the Democrats in Florida.
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:03.640]  So we are going to flip Palm County red this year.
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:04.640]  You'll see.
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:08.360]  And Congresswoman Laura Loomer is going to become a reality on, on November 3rd.
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:10.200]  You, you take it to the bank.
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:14.080]  And in order to make that happen, I need everybody who's watching to donate because we're up
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:15.080]  in the polls.
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:16.320]  I've out fundraised her.
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:17.320]  She's freaking out.
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:18.320]  Okay.
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:19.320]  She, she doesn't know what to do.
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:20.600]  You're like the only Republican doing that.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.200]  I was, I was talking to Roger Stone, I know helps you.
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:26.080]  The Democrats are out spending five to one in Florida.
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:28.760]  So folks don't get that was two to one last time.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:29.760]  Trump needs money.
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:30.760]  So do you.
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  Thank God.
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:32.760]  You're, you're out.
[1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:33.760]  Yeah.
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:36.160]  And, and, and the Republican party, of course, they're not helping me.
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:41.200]  They're just sitting around on their ass, you know, helping candidate to a lot of them
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:43.920]  aren't even going to win and wasting money.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:44.920]  Okay.
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:45.920]  The reports.
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:48.800]  Well, you know, a lot of the Republicans are a third column there, but Trump's getting
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:49.800]  rid of it.
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:50.800]  Yeah.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:52.920]  They raised $191 million that they haven't given me a dime.
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:54.000]  And this is a winnable race.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.680]  It's the president's home district and they don't want to support.
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:26:57.680]  So it's up to you.
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:02.040]  They're making a plea to the info warriors to donate whatever you can to help me because
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:03.040]  I totally agree.
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:07.200]  But a month ago when you won the primary, whatever it was two months ago, Trump said,
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:08.200]  I like her.
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:09.200]  He didn't back off from you.
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:13.160]  But I know some of the staff tried to block him because they, they work with big tech.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.880]  We need Trump in a press conference because he flies places to support candidates.
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:20.840]  He needs to spend 10 minutes on you from our logo.
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:21.840]  He should meet with you.
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:23.840]  I'm going to get this message to Trump.
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:25.320]  I'm sure Roger's trying.
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:26.320]  He should have.
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  Yeah.
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:28.320]  He should meet with you at the press conference.
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:34.000]  That'll guarantee you in look, I agree with you completely, you know, and I, I know there's
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  people telling him not to say my name because, you know, he paused on the, uh, you know,
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.640]  the Karmak and he, he said he voted down ballot Republican and it's not, you know, it's,
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:45.400]  he clearly, he clearly likes me.
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:50.080]  He endorsed me and he tweeted in support of my candidacy, but he has a lot of, you know,
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:54.520]  bad advisors surrounding him and they're giving him bad information around him.
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:55.520]  Yeah.
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:00.840]  And, uh, it's time for them to, to get on board because we are, we are pulling very
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:01.840]  high.
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:02.840]  I mean, I'm not against Netanyahu.
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:03.840]  I like him a lot.
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:07.480]  The other candidates over in Israel, but even when Trump asked Netanyahu to attack Biden,
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:08.480]  he wouldn't do it.
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:11.200]  Everyone is so scared to attack the Democrats.
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:15.320]  The Democrats are chai, calm, globalist, Iranian agents.
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:18.320]  So why didn't Netanyahu come out against that?
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:23.400]  Well, look, you know, Alex, a lot of people are scared to confront the Democrats, which
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:26.840]  is why I'm needed in Congress because I don't, I don't give a damn who you are.
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.560]  You know, if you're, if you're committing injustice in this country, if you're in the
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:35.320]  Democrat party or the Republican party, I'll, I'll come after you and, and confront you
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.320]  and expose you.
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:37.320]  I totally agree.
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:38.320]  I totally agree.
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:39.320]  Laura Loomer, amazing.
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.640]  Laura Loomer for Congress, Laura, join us again tomorrow the next day.
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:43.640]  We love you.
[1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:44.640]  Thank you so much.
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:45.640]  More news straight ahead.
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:48.280]  Laura Loomer is kicking some major globalist butt.
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:50.640]  We really appreciate her and that great crew out there.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:51.640]  Yeah.
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.640]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.160]  Stay with us.
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:01.560]  Black Friday in October, last year, that was one of our most popular sales that we ran
[1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:05.880]  in the last couple of weeks of October, and it was popular for a reason, some of the biggest
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:10.720]  sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:16.240]  And that means 30 to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points at 15% off
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:17.240]  your next order.
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:20.640]  Everybody that signs up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.240]  items lost leaders.
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:25.960]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there, but some good
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:26.960]  news.
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:30.200]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals
[1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.160]  and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:38.440]  It is back and stocked back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election.
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:43.040]  And more good news, Ultra 12 has got the name Ultra for a reason.
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:48.320]  Highest quality vitamin B12, taken under the tongue for full absorption, it is now back
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:49.320]  in stock.
[1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:56.800]  Those are 50% off at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsStore.com, Black Friday comes in October.
[1:29:56.800 --> 1:30:00.160]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:04.480]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:09.160]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:13.680]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:18.480]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:24.240]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:30.240]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:30:30.240 --> 1:30:36.880]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:41.480]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:47.240]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:50.080]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:31:20.040]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:31.720]  This is our new neurotic control freak society, overseen by robots, overseen by AI, and all
[1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:35.200]  of it is designed to make humans non-essential.
[1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:42.400]  Apply out of the gates, they tell us, you are non-essential, you are non-essential.
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:48.040]  Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is non-essential.
[1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:53.720]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated, and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[1:31:53.720 --> 1:31:56.680]  Come on, folks, let's reject this.
[1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:59.080]  I admire President Trump.
[1:31:59.080 --> 1:32:02.240]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched.
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:06.960]  His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy, and I just want to affirm my admiration for
[1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:07.960]  President Trump.
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:15.040]  He's not God, he's not an angel, he's not perfect, but the way he has used judo on the
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.320]  forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:24.480]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom, and the way he stood up
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:30.920]  against these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful, and I'm serious.
[1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:34.600]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning thinking about President
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:35.600]  Trump.
[1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:41.240]  I just want to say I admire the President so much, and I appreciate you, the listeners,
[1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:45.960]  everybody, for what you've done, I admire you, that's what you call it, thank me, folks.
[1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:50.520]  I admire you, I admire Trump, I admire all of you that are involved in this fight, and
[1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:52.240]  I just wish I could do more.
[1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:54.840]  We're going to win this fight together, this election's so important.
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:59.800]  Please pray for President Trump.
[1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:13.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:17.400]  Sunday, October 25, 2020, eight days to election.
[1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:20.560]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:22.960]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:29.600]  We are the tip of the spear, and we're ready for war and death.
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:41.760]  It's true, all the preparation to this moment, decades of war, as God took his hammer to
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:49.640]  us in the fires, preparing us to strike, preparing us to have the will, preparing us to smile
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:53.920]  in the face of certain death.
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:34:06.080]  I rule the midnight air, the destroyer.
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:07.080]  Deadly mashed.
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:15.640]  I'm not talking about me, talking about the big guy.
[1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:16.640]  I will pass.
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:20.760]  All right, let's go ahead and knock it out.
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:24.440]  I hardly ever air a special report twice.
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:29.000]  When I saw this special report before the show, it was so good, I started the broadcast
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  with it.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.520]  I've got tons to cover, huge amounts of things to get into.
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:41.480]  Owen Shroyer went to this big Trump parade, with probably a thousand cars wherever it
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:44.400]  was, just going through Austin and the left threatening to kill him.
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:46.600]  All that's coming up.
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:52.400]  But Greg Rees' report, he put out, Greg Rees was up here last night with one other person
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:57.600]  and shot that whole special report to like 10 at night, finished it up with me, did a
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:05.880]  great job on the diary of Hunter Biden's sister, Joe Biden's daughter, and all the
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:08.320]  horrible pedophilia reports.
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:12.320]  And then he put this report out this morning that just went live before we went on, it's
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:18.640]  a Band-Aid video, grace yourself for the most violent, the most dangerous, the most uncertain
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:19.640]  election in history.
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:20.640]  There it is.
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:22.640]  Prepare yourself for the most dangerous election in history.
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:23.640]  It's got 11,000 views.
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:24.640]  Great.
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:25.640]  Went up a couple hours ago.
[1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:26.640]  It needs millions of views.
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:32.120]  And when you get excited, that happens, you know, the CFR run media matters and the George
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:38.640]  Soros group all came out and bitched this week in hundreds of articles, you know, Politifact,
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:43.160]  New York Times, Washington Post, all lying, they went, oh, it's got millions of views.
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:48.680]  This article about sex tape with Biden underage girls, which is all coming out now to his
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:50.520]  damn emails.
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:54.000]  We said it before it was in the emails that he's talking to his dad saying, yeah, I'm
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.680]  with little 14 year old girls.
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:58.400]  What do I do?
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:02.920]  The New York Post says we can't publish it, it's pedophilia and all the laughs and all
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:05.880]  the media defense it.
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:10.160]  That has three and a half million views right now and banned on video.
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:16.040]  You know how much that pisses Mark Zuckerberg off and how much that pisses off CNN and Jeff
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:21.800]  Zucker and how much that pisses off Brian Stelter and how much that angers them that
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:23.520]  you built info wars.
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:28.680]  We built this infrastructure and that video on our own platform has three plus million
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:29.680]  views.
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:34.200]  I mean, that is just everything they fear.
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:35.200]  Absolutely right there.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:36.400]  What is all about?
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:38.840]  It's the blood of victory.
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:42.080]  It's the very essence of victory.
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:47.200]  So I'm just I'm so fulfilled right now and I salute you to my very core.
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:58.280]  I salute you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you are the sword, you are the mind, you are
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:03.280]  the blood, you are the faith, you are the guardian, you are the resistance, you are the
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:07.800]  very will to cross the enemy and that spirit spreads.
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:08.800]  It's over for them.
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:12.280]  That's what they want to suppress us because we have the spirit of victory.
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:17.200]  So here's the report that they don't want you to see hear this.
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:23.400]  About a week away from the 2020 election, Democrat Party nominee Joe Biden is in desperate
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:29.520]  denial of the fact that he is now the central character in the most despicable corruption
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:32.480]  scandal in American history.
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:38.200]  The subversion of the U.S. government by Communist China is being exposed.
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:43.840]  A group of Chinese whistleblowers managed to get a hard drive containing evidence of serious
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:50.760]  crimes committed by the Biden family into the hands of Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani.
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:56.720]  Lude media claimed a month ago that a hard drive would surface before the election, containing
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:02.240]  videos of Hunter Biden violently raping Chinese children.
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:06.120]  Those who have seen the videos support this claim.
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:10.360]  To any good person, this is shocking and horrific.
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:13.520]  And to many, it is incomprehensible.
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:20.120]  But for as long as man has had power to gain, the art of blackmail has been exploited.
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:24.320]  This was the purpose of a man like Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:29.960]  According to Lude media, these child rape videos of Hunter Biden were produced by the
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:36.560]  Communist Chinese as a means of control and were being sent to the Biden family and other
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:43.440]  CCP assets in America as a threat, a reminder of who owns them.
[1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:48.160]  There are no rules in the game of power, only ruthlessness.
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.800]  And so children become the currency of those who seek to control others.
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:39:00.200]  Former business partner of the Biden family, Tony Bobolinski, worked as CEO for Sino-Hawk
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:07.520]  Holdings, a company formed by the Bidens and China's largest private energy company.
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:13.440]  Bobolinski has provided evidence that shows Sino-Hawk was used to funnel millions of dollars
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:19.480]  from the Communist Chinese directly into the family coffers of the Bidens.
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:26.480]  The mainstream media in what must certainly be a criminal act has been ignoring this incredible
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:33.360]  story while pushing their audience into voting for a decrepit, lying, perverted fraud with
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:39.880]  a monstrous family and loyalty to the Communist Chinese.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.960]  We likely know what's coming next.
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:48.240]  The Democrat Party will claim that Trump stole the election, the corporate media will play
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:54.480]  along, and those still brainwashed by the globalist-run propaganda media machine will
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:57.240]  undoubtedly believe it.
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:03.280]  With massive crowds of people all over the country showing overwhelming grassroots support
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:10.800]  for President Trump in ways never before seen, contrasted with Joe Biden and Obama at public
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:17.280]  events practically devoid of all people, the media will still say that Trump had to steal
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:25.480]  the election, they will cite their fake polls, and the brainwashed sheep will believe them.
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:32.160]  If justice is served, which needs to happen, then there will be arrests of powerful people,
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:38.400]  and the corporate media will report that Trump is literally Hitler rounding up the innocent,
[1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:42.360]  and the brainwashed sheep will believe them.
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:44.360]  There is no doubt.
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:49.840]  If they can be made to wear masks and fear those who don't, then they will believe whatever
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:52.360]  they are told.
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:58.320]  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:00.680]  wolves.
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:03.520]  Humanity is awakening, but not everyone.
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:09.680]  The brainwashed are being manipulated into defending the corrupt, deep-state establishment.
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:14.720]  Some are even murdering Trump supporters in cold blood.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:20.440]  It seems clear that Trump will win the 2020 election, but then what?
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:25.960]  If the corporate mainstream media is allowed to operate as normal, then there will be total
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:27.960]  chaos.
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:57.600]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:13.640]  Wow, just as they hit refresh, it's gone from 11,000 to 46,000, nice.
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:18.360]  We need 10 million on that, by the way, there's not even ads on the damn thing.
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:21.480]  We just pay to put this up with our own platform.
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:24.600]  I'm all like trying to get views on the videos as we even make money off that.
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:26.560]  I don't care about money.
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:30.720]  Money is fuel to fund this fight, and we're so close to ending the enemy, and all you
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:38.240]  gotta do is decide, stop caring what they say or do to you, and just go to war.
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:43.360]  And I'm being as good as I can at the information war ahead of physical war, but whatever happens
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:49.280]  will never submit to Satan, and these globalists will pay, and those that have persecuted children
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:56.320]  will be thrown to the deepest ocean with millstones.
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:59.680]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:01.680]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:03.480]  Is your city too safe?
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:11.680]  Well, not anymore, introducing Democrats, politicians so incompetent they'll fill your
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:18.480]  neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:23.520]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:29.840]  No more pesky law and order, when Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:34.520]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:40.760]  But wait, vote for Democrats now, and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:56.000]  cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes, Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:01.360]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election, and the globalist
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.800]  controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:10.600]  The whole planet is in a huge populace for alignment, and so they've openly said, we
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:15.560]  need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:19.400]  arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:23.800]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:28.360]  Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:33.680]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying, it's what the Obama bots are saying,
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:37.840]  it's what Keith Overman's saying, it's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:43.480]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent, and they intend to keep the lockdowns
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:45.680]  going forever and force denoculations.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:50.080]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns, and this thing vaccines will be voluntary.
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:51.480]  Donald Trump or die.
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:55.880]  We've got to get Trump in, everybody get out there and vote, and tell your family to vote
[1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:56.880]  now.
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:01.520]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:03.480]  GPS location.
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:09.080]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:15.040]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids,
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:19.600]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.600]  to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:30.240]  on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:36.360]  like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.440]  systems to be saved forever.
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.400]  Your phone is spying on you, and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:43.720]  based on information.
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:46.920]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:04.280]  the top some already amazing sales.

[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:09.760]  very popular.

[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:17.480]  the month because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.

[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:31.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I want to thank all the great affiliates picking us up, all
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:33.680]  the great listeners and everybody.
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:37.600]  We normally take calls, we haven't done this today but tomorrow we obviously will be doing
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:42.440]  that, some other big surprises on the show this week, I'm going to leave it at that but
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:47.680]  with seven days left to election starting tomorrow, you're going to see some big fireworks
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:52.880]  and a lot of big breaking, huge exclusive information, believe it, big stuff for the
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:57.920]  next 48 hours right here at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com, I'm not somebody that
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:03.920]  overhyped stuff, I underhyped things, I overdeliver, believe me you're going to want to stay tuned
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:04.920]  in.
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:11.120]  All right, every weekend we have an armored vehicle that I bought over a year and a half
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:18.880]  ago at a very low price to be able to go out and cover antifuck as they attack your vehicle,
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:26.840]  they were attacked with hammers, with shovels, with knives, with fireworks, with everything
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:36.960]  and there was a car parade where Trump had just happened yesterday and most people loved
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:37.960]  it.
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:42.200]  We'll talk about a thousand vehicles out there but some of the left went crazy and said I'm
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:51.840]  going to assassinate you, I'm going to murder you, here's some of the video.
[1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:58.360]  We must reelect Donald Trump and save this country, Trump is our last chance, I have
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:05.160]  to come to you, fuck your mother, don't fuck your mother, fuck your mother, I'm sanctioned,
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:11.240]  I will fucking assassinate you, I'm sanctioned too, you are getting a fucking bullet.
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:15.200]  So that's a death threat right there for a Biden voter, you want that to run the country
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:16.200]  folks?
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:17.200]  Wow.
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:27.080]  Again, you can go watch because they streamed on the internet hours of footage at Band-Aut
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:32.040]  video where it's like hey, we love America, hey, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to murder
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:40.280]  you, I'm going to get you, total intimidators, total pieces of garbage.
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:43.240]  That's one of my weak spots, I'm like if some dude's like I'm going to kill you for no reason,
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:46.600]  I'm like well I'm going to show him, he's about to not go what he wants, oh did a great
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:53.120]  job just relaxing during it, but imagine I'm going to assassinate you, I'm going to kill
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:59.280]  you and it's dozens of incidents like this where these soy boys that hate the military
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:01.960]  hate America, they live in all this, they love G.G.
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:06.240]  Ping, they literally think they're going to dominate and destroy this, in fact let's play
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.840]  the clip one more time emblematic of how they hate free speech, how they hate America and
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:38.640]  who they are, here it is, he's dreaming of this communist world, so here's the deal,
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:43.600]  notice they're demons, they're interdimensional, he's not a person, he's infested, I mean I
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:48.760]  used to believe this till I just saw enough of it, a few years ago I was in Seattle and
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:51.880]  they saw me live streaming and they go F you and your mother, we're going to get you and
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:56.080]  your family, I'd cross the next street and they go you just heard us, we're getting
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:03.640]  your family, yes it's us, the earth is ours, and then another dude does it, it's like
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:09.360]  in the matrix, where do you think the Wachowski brothers came up with that, we're in the matrix,
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:13.040]  Agent Smith jumping from person to person, I mean you don't believe in this till you
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:19.760]  see it and they finish each other's sentences in the cities they control, it's like I don't
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:22.920]  know what it is, I don't know what it is, I don't know who they are, I don't know what
[1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:29.840]  they're doing, they're ESP'd in man and they're like your mother must die for you being born,
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:34.600]  we would have killed you if you would have, we want your mommy to die, why does your mommy
[1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:40.520]  we want your mommy, we want to kill you, your mommy should have killed you, it's like a
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:46.480]  transmission kill you, kill your mommy, die, die, die, die, die, it's the same transmission
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:51.320]  die, die, die, and they don't have Christ, they don't have any defense so they give
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:58.080]  into it, Stockholm Syndrome, she see that little empty guy driving his Miata, Miata and
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:03.320]  he's like saying ask your mother, ask your mother I am sanctioned to kill you, like we're
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:11.200]  sanctioned by your god, you're like okay and then like it happens more on the same video
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:17.360]  like I am sanctioned by y'all kill your mother, they're all, it's like what were they programmed
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:22.800]  or they hooked up to something, I don't know but man they're a military of chicken-neck
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:29.760]  weird dudes that hate god, hate freedom, hate success, hate family, hate babies and they're
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:36.120]  all of their selfishness like I have nothing, I will never be nice, but I'm liberal and
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:44.440]  I love pedophilia, do what I say, in fact let's play the clip one more time in Austin
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:56.600]  of I am sanctioned to kill you, I will assassinate you, ask your mother, die and after you run
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:26.440]  into it I thought I was like what the hell is up with these dudes, here go ahead and
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:52.400]  kill your mother, I am sanctioned to kill you, I am sanctioned to kill you, I am sanctioned
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:54:21.720]  to kill you, I am sanctioned to kill you, I am sanctioned to kill you, I am sanctioned
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:23.280]  10th time you saw a black person go,
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:25.560]  do you want those degenerate headwords?
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:27.360]  I'm gonna get them in the name of Satan.
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:30.400]  And you're like, what the hell?
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:31.920]  I mean, I already believed in God did,
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:33.320]  but then I really got it.
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:37.240]  You go out and face these people,
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.840]  you'll find out what demons are real quick, folks.
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:43.160]  And man, they are crazy.
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:45.320]  And I'll just tell you, they wanna kill black people.
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:46.160]  It's their favorite.
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:47.760]  They won't kill everybody, but they just love
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:48.600]  killing black people.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:49.800]  I don't know what's going on.
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:51.520]  It's like a bloodhound or a dog trained
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:52.760]  to kill a certain thing.
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:53.800]  They just go crazy.
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:57.720]  It's like, I'm gonna get them.
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:54:58.720]  That's mine.
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.800]  I'm gonna kill your mommy.
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:00.720]  I'm gonna get you.
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:03.800]  So you can bow down to them all day if you want.
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:07.120]  One of these demons that ran the whole HIV operation
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.400]  to kill everybody with the testing drugs was Fauci.
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:12.160]  He doesn't want you to have vitamin D3.
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:13.560]  He doesn't want you to have zinc.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:14.440]  He doesn't want you to have C
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:17.880]  because he's a devil worshipping little slime bag pile of crap.
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:18.720]  But you know what?
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:19.560]  We want you to have it.
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:21.360]  And even though this is selling out,
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:24.120]  we have a discounted right now at 50%
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.520]  with store on free shipping.
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:26.360]  That's about the thing.
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:27.200]  It's about to sell out.
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:28.880]  We have all this great hand sanitizer,
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:31.240]  this natural essential oils.
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:32.200]  That's selling out.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.920]  We have super strong, super high grade iodine.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:40.000]  That's a great hand sanitizer and top sanitizer.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:41.440]  And we have one that's oral as well.
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:42.880]  X2, this is the separate one.
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:44.200]  You don't take this orally.
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:45.520]  It's extremely strong.
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:47.800]  M4warstore.com.
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:50.640]  And that funds our whole stinking operation.
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:53.680]  But I mean, it just comes down to the end of it.
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.120]  I haven't figured it all out.
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.520]  I just learned these people are on the same frequency
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:59.280]  and they're getting a transmission.
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:01.040]  Like if I turned 100 different radios,
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:02.720]  the same channel, I heard the same channel.
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:03.880]  I've literally watched there
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:05.440]  and I've turned different channels
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:07.720]  and they're all saying the same damn thing at the same time.
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:08.680]  So this is not an act.
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:10.120]  They couldn't do this on their own.
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:13.040]  I have, God has actually shown me in Seattle
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:14.800]  where block after block,
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:16.760]  Zimmerman got so scared he refused to come out of the hotel.
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:17.680]  He's a great guy.
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.320]  He said, no, this is a demonic city.
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:20.640]  I've never seen anything like it.
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:21.680]  He was totally scared by the end of it.
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:25.160]  He's like, those people are all demonically possessed.
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:26.840]  He witnesses for himself.
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:27.840]  And I'm putting Zimmerman down.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:29.040]  I'm just telling you a story.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  He wouldn't leave the hotel room
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:31.120]  after a couple of days of this.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.880]  He's like, this is real folks.
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:36.120]  These people are controlled by something.
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:36.960]  I don't know.
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.680]  Aliens, whatever you want to call it,
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:39.960]  they're out to kill everybody.
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:41.720]  I mean, my God, you already figured that out.
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:45.000]  Like we're not wanting to screw kids like Biden and all them.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.720]  I mean, they want to hurt us folks.
[1:56:47.720 --> 1:56:49.000]  They want to hurt us.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.520]  And we're not going to put up with it.
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:53.520]  Owen Shroyer is about to take over.
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:55.720]  We do a show called Sunday Live.
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:56:57.080]  And it should be on all the feeds.
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  I love the crew.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:56:59.880]  Last week was only on the sub feeds.
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.440]  You'll find it at Band-Aid video, the War Room feed.
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:05.640]  Hopefully today it's going to be on all the feeds.
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:08.440]  But Owen Shroyer is about to take over with Sunday Live.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:10.960]  But this is a spiritual battle.
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:12.520]  And then I'll be back tomorrow.
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:13.520]  David, I'll be back tomorrow.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:14.920]  Owen Shroyer, the whole crew.
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:17.280]  Weeknights, we've got election coverage every night.
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.160]  Seven nights a week, right through it.
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:20.480]  Such huge times to be here.
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:24.000]  We only have you to thank to be on air and, of course, in God.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.360]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:27.840]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now on your email,
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.200]  your text message, Facebook, everywhere about Owen Shroyer
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:32.880]  and Sunday Live.
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:36.000]  Send out the feed and say, Forbidden Information Now.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.360]  Or put your head between your legs in case you're asked goodbye.
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:39.200]  This is a war.
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:42.160]  It's not something you just do as a side issue.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.520]  You've got to fight back with your word of mouth now.
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:47.480]  And I know you will.
