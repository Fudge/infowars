[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:14.240 --> 00:35.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.680 --> 00:41.600]  this is going to be an extremely heavy news day Donald Trump was set to come
[00:41.600 --> 00:46.280]  down to the Laredo Texas border one of the most dangerous areas on the 2200
[00:46.280 --> 00:54.200]  mile border with Mexico so we sent down Joe Biggs and Josh Owens and while
[00:54.200 --> 00:58.520]  they're there just shooting a report yesterday evening at about 8 o'clock
[00:58.520 --> 01:03.600]  when it's still daylight you see about 10 guys swim across the river with huge
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.800]  containers in front of them huge bundles drug bundles and they were able to get
[01:08.800 --> 01:14.040]  in their car drive over and film from like 60 yards away on a busy highway
[01:14.040 --> 01:18.960]  them loading the contraband on and then the smugglers running back into the
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.280]  bushes some of the most powerful drug smuggling footage I've ever seen and
[01:24.280 --> 01:28.720]  then there's a lot of it out there the video caught on camera illegal smuggled
[01:28.720 --> 01:34.320]  drugs into Laredo before Trump visit this is the middle of a major city with
[01:34.320 --> 01:41.120]  18 wheelers and cars and school buses driving around then they had the spotters
[01:41.120 --> 01:46.440]  they recognized casing them last night and early this morning at their hotel
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.040]  they've got so many spies and operatives famous intelligence network with the
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.600]  cartel so our guys went ahead for security reasons and bugged out they are
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.600]  almost back and they will be in studio with us today both Josh Owens and of
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.520]  course Joe Biggs and Joe Biggs went into where they reported the ISIS compound a
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.480]  few months ago that made national news and indeed there was a bizarre mosque
[02:10.480 --> 02:17.040]  built in the middle of the town and the FBI then showed up at the airport wanting
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.600]  to debrief the crew and said we just can't believe that you had the courage
[02:21.600 --> 02:28.000]  to do that my question is where's the mainstream media on this in fact where's
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.480]  the coverage of our video that's been out since last night it's nowhere it's
[02:33.480 --> 02:38.240]  up on info wars.com just like Jacarie Jackson and Adon Salazar went down there
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.360]  and to one of our contacts in McCallan with ICE and they said just come to this
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.800]  place you'll see us loading them on buses with vouchers to ship them into the US
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.880]  it took the New York Times five months to report on it and they just admitted
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.360]  matter of factly yeah we ship the illegals into the country and then Fox
[02:57.360 --> 03:01.840]  News asked a senior current Border Patrol member about it on TV and he said
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.920]  yeah we complete the smuggling process but we get hauled in for reprimands and
[03:06.920 --> 03:13.640]  even basically charged with releasing classified info if we tell you we're
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.800]  completing the smuggling process so there they are keeping that quasi secret
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.360]  and even when info wars.com does our job and millions of people hear about it
[03:23.360 --> 03:29.280]  here and see it still the mainstream media won't cover it so that report from
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.160]  Joe Biggs and that powerful video is coming up in the next segment we've got
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.000]  Texas governor just an amazing statesman I just can't believe we have a
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.760]  governor this good I mean he's a presidential material Greg Abbott
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.440]  basically investigating and looking at criminal indictments of Planned Parenthood
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.440]  for selling baby parts we've got other governors doing it of course leading this
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.280]  is Rand Paul with the original call for it so there's leadership there's
[03:58.280 --> 04:01.560]  statesmanship right there Rand Paul spearheaded the effort starting last
[04:01.560 --> 04:06.160]  week to defund Planned Parenthood it's coming up next week in Congress now the
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.280]  GOP is now moving thanks to the leadership of Rand Paul Greg Abbott our
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.880]  listeners and others drudge report covering it to defund Planned Parenthood
[04:14.880 --> 04:23.840]  how does the establishment respond MSNBC salon media matters they are now
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.720]  saying the Planned Parenthood video is a hoax you heard me right and it's not
[04:30.720 --> 04:35.840]  real then they go on to admit it's real but say our interpretations a hoax and
[04:35.840 --> 04:43.280]  then get this they say Margaret Sanger was not racist and I guess Hitler loved
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.240]  Jews too right conspiracy theorist of hijacked the GOP what happens when
[04:48.240 --> 04:53.720]  Trump Cruz and Carson start following Alex Jones lead and then they go in
[04:53.720 --> 04:59.920]  there and say there's no Planned Parenthood baby part sales and Margaret
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.040]  Sanger's good info wars caught shocking video of drugs being smuggled across the
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.400]  US Mexico border validating Donald Trump's claims that illegal immigrants
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.760]  are bringing drugs into the United States info wars reporters Joe Biggs and
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.160]  Josh Owens traveled to Laredo to cover Trump's highly publicized visit while
[05:18.160 --> 05:21.760]  recording footage of the Rio Grande River a group of illegals were spotted
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.560]  crossing the water on rafts soon after one man is nervously holding open the
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.920]  trunk of a red SUV while four illegals frantically toss huge packs of what are
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.040]  almost certainly drugs into the back car those men flee back to wars Mexico while
[05:37.040 --> 05:41.800]  the vehicle drives off into America Mexican drug cartels make up to 29
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.440]  billion dollars annually from US drug sales and the footage illustrates how
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.760]  easy it would be for terrorists to bring militants weapons and explosives into

[09:52.120 --> 09:57.960]  he'll be joining us for about 40 minutes of the third hour we are going to be
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.680]  having Joe Biggs and Josh Owens in studio as soon as they get back from the
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.720]  Texas Mexico border on the Rio Grande where yesterday evening before dark they
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.680]  got HD footage of illegal swimming across with bundles of what is clearly
[10:15.680 --> 10:21.320]  drugs loading them into a truck and then driving off on a busy highway we even
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.040]  got the license number and are giving it to the quote authorities as we speak and
[10:26.040 --> 10:31.200]  the issue here is the border is wide open but they've got the border patrol on
[10:31.200 --> 10:37.160]  duties upwards to a hundred miles inland searching citizens cars meanwhile the
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.360]  big banks are caught laundering with drug money that powerful report with Joe
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.200]  Biggs intro is coming up here in just a few minutes Donald Trump was supposed to
[10:46.200 --> 10:50.880]  show up down there but then canceled his visit last night 1130 we certainly had
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.680]  some questions for him also we're going to hand him a world net daily research
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.040]  article and some other proofs that McCain actually was a trustee at the
[10:59.040 --> 11:04.440]  Hanoi Hilton and a lot of POWs said he was a trader during their five years of
[11:04.440 --> 11:09.440]  captivity so that he could truly strike back at McCain and not give a half
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.320]  baked response that being shot down and being a prisoner doesn't make you a
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.120]  hero I don't know in most cases getting shot down and being tortured for five
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.840]  years makes you pretty heroic and again that's my issue with with Trump is he
[11:24.840 --> 11:31.200]  super smart and does he say stuff like this to derail himself on purpose but
[11:31.200 --> 11:35.080]  he's standing by what he said and people are standing by him because folks are
[11:35.080 --> 11:41.820]  tired of double talk so I certainly like that and Trump now has told Anderson
[11:41.820 --> 11:45.120]  Cooper that people don't trust you and the mainstream media and that's
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.680]  absolutely the type of talk folks want to hear MSNBC is stunned by Clinton's
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.040]  upside down poll numbers in fact in battleground states every Republican
[11:55.040 --> 12:02.480]  frontrunner is between 10 and 15 points ahead of her Trump's 15 Rand Paul's 10
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.400]  it's it's just amazing that this is going on and I like Rand Paul he's been
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.960]  on the show for 20 years he is a listener the the the media makes a big deal
[12:13.960 --> 12:17.280]  out of that he should be running towards that not away from it and he's not
[12:17.280 --> 12:22.960]  running away from it last time senator Paul was on I got a call and they said
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.000]  the senator wants to come on he said he'd come on your show and he came on
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.080]  because the media was making a big deal out of the fact that he's been coming on
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.360]  the show since he was campaigning for his dad for Congress 20 years ago quite
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.960]  frankly Rand Paul coming on the show doesn't boost our ratings I can cover
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.520]  the info that's what matters I'm not begging to get any of these politicians
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.920]  on the show I don't even try to get him on or make an issue out of it because
[12:50.920 --> 12:57.400]  they do spin it they do twist it and it at some levels might hurt him but I
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.800]  only raised this issue because I know he's got people in his office who are
[13:02.800 --> 13:09.280]  basically rhinos and they are advising him to go to the center which is the
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.120]  opposite when the left is off in totalitarian la la land at warp speed
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.880]  acting like a cult you don't moderate towards them you stand on the
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.400]  Constitution and Bill of Rights and you point out that they're a bunch of
[13:25.400 --> 13:30.920]  insane criminals which he's doing to a certain extent but stunts like taking a
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.400]  chainsaw to the tax code you don't need to do that need to just say I'm going to
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.400]  abolish the IRS and we do have a lot of criminals pouring into the country and
[13:40.400 --> 13:45.600]  Donald Trump's right the problem is he's given so much money to Democrats I
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.960]  don't trust him that's what Rand Paul should be doing not saying he
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.760]  disagrees with Donald Trump statements but actually saying it in a more
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.480]  statesman like way and look I only say this because I know this goes directly
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.320]  to the senator I know he routinely listens to the show and it just if he
[14:01.320 --> 14:07.160]  wants to be president I know he's a gentleman and I know that he's a good
[14:07.160 --> 14:13.120]  guy and a classy guy he needs to get aggressive that's I mean his dad that
[14:13.120 --> 14:17.320]  was my problem of his dad is he was just not aggressive enough and I you know I
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.280]  love Ron Paul it's just the political pundits are constantly telling people to
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.120]  be milked us to be nice to compromise that's how the country got in the
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.120]  position we're in right now the Social Security Administration is going to be
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.880]  commanded now by the VA the FBI and the ATF with some secret formula like the
[14:38.880 --> 14:46.880]  no-fly list to take Social Security recipients guns this has been announced
[14:46.880 --> 14:54.120]  the FBI memos public it's in the LA Times we've got a full-on mega alert and
[14:54.120 --> 14:58.800]  the good news is this is the good part about the Republicans they are talking
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.800]  about having hearings they're talking about cutting funding they're saying
[15:02.800 --> 15:08.680]  Social Security do not do this well we need more than that we need to have
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.200]  people resigning over an attempt outside of law to do something like this it is
[15:14.200 --> 15:22.560]  unprecedented let me just read to you some of the headlines Texas Governor
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.880]  calls for expanded probe of Planned Parenthood in wake of new video ran Paul
[15:26.880 --> 15:30.560]  spearheads effort to defund Planned Parenthood that's bold that's wonderful
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.880]  I love the senator I'm just saying go further he's the only one saying abolish
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.480]  the Patriot Act only one saying get rid of foreign funding only one saying you
[15:39.480 --> 15:45.560]  know we shouldn't have funded ISIS GOP moves to defund Planned Parenthood see
[15:45.560 --> 15:52.280]  following his lead Kansas and Missouri call for investigation of Planned
[15:52.280 --> 15:59.360]  Parenthood among questions about aborted fetuses being sold and then how
[15:59.360 --> 16:06.480]  does White House talking point repeater station salon put it conspiracy
[16:06.480 --> 16:12.280]  theorist of hijacked the GOP what happens when Trump Cruz and Carson start
[16:12.280 --> 16:19.160]  following Alex Jones's lead and they go on to say it's a hoax there is no
[16:19.160 --> 16:22.640]  Planned Parenthood and that Margaret Sanger basically love black people I
[16:22.640 --> 16:34.280]  mean this Bob Sesca is like a dark satire comedy writer I mean next he's
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.160]  gonna say the moon is made out of cheese I mean Margaret Sanger got awards from
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.880]  Hitler gave awards from Hitler her letters in her own hand or public at
[16:41.880 --> 16:45.240]  major University saying we can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate the
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.200]  weeds we got to hire all the black leaders and call ourselves liberal and
[16:49.200 --> 16:53.320]  then you sit there saying she's a wonderful family you people are sick you
[16:53.320 --> 16:58.400]  really are sick Planned Parenthood admits those videos are real and claims it
[16:58.400 --> 17:04.200]  doesn't represent them and you don't care you pray on your cult readers who
[17:04.200 --> 17:08.840]  would drink cyanide kool-aid if they were ordered to and tell them that we're
[17:08.840 --> 17:16.800]  liars I mean you people are sick you're sick this is the publication calling for
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.160]  me to be arrested or shut off the air they're totalitarians here's another

[24:23.760 --> 24:30.280]  with us coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today extremely
[24:30.280 --> 24:36.640]  powerful footage is up on infowars.com shot from what looks like about 60
[24:36.640 --> 24:43.240]  yards away caught on camera illegal smuggle drugs into the US into Laredo
[24:43.240 --> 24:48.440]  before Trump visits shock video validates Trump's assertion on Mexicans
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.720]  bringing drugs into America Paul Watson says validates it Trump simply said
[24:54.720 --> 25:01.440]  organized crime cartels are pouring in Mexico's collapsed the main business is
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.920]  the drug trade and now we've got kidnapping and just all these other
[25:05.920 --> 25:10.640]  Latin American crime wave type things coming here and that's why South
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.800]  America so scary folks you get kidnapped you get killed it's it's just
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.800]  very scary in many areas and that's what's being exported here now doesn't
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.520]  mean everybody's like that but the crime wave is real and they sit there and
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.480]  go no it's a hoax no one's a criminal and our own government released 36,000
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.120]  aggravated felons in the last 12 months and they won't even pick up people
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.320]  who've been deported five times and have committed seven felonies so the guy goes
[25:40.320 --> 25:47.040]  out in San Francisco and just shoot some 30 year old woman and for fun this is
[25:47.040 --> 25:53.320]  crazy there have been 611,000 crimes committed by legals just in Texas in
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.920]  the last few years 2.5 million illegal immigrants flooded US during Obama
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.440]  administration many of them hardened criminals because you can get away with
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.400]  it up here and Joe Biggs and Josh Owens were there shooting a report at the
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.880]  river the Rio Grande when they saw a bunch of men swimming across pushing big
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.800]  packages in front of them they caught mules on tape here's the footage for
[26:15.800 --> 26:21.000]  radio listeners go to info wars.com see the video see the report and email it
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.560]  to your friends and family because just because the dinosaur media is gonna try
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.760]  to cover this up doesn't mean they can stop you you have the power so spread
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.320]  this info here it is. Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now you might be
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.440]  asking yourself as to why I'm sitting in front of this random white backdrop
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.760]  that's because right now Josh Owens and I are currently on the run from a cartel
[26:41.760 --> 26:47.400]  now we got very very golden footage the kind of footage that most reporters
[26:47.400 --> 26:51.120]  would wait their entire life in hopes to get and probably would never ever get a
[26:51.120 --> 26:57.760]  chance we actually witnessed a drug smuggling operation from Mexico into
[26:57.760 --> 27:03.400]  the US now this is intense we were seen by spotters they walked up they got
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.120]  pictures of our license plate they got pictures of me and that's why we're
[27:07.120 --> 27:12.040]  doing this this is not a joke we had to take our license plate off our vehicle
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.600]  we had to hide the vehicle and now we are in hiding and we're hoping we can
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.920]  get this footage out to you guys so you can see because the reason we came out
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.480]  here was to talk about Donald Trump because he's coming out here to visit
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.120]  Laredo and one of the things we want to talk about was how our borders are so
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.120]  wide open now we have proof for the American people to show you just how
[27:32.120 --> 27:37.800]  wide open the borders are to show you how easy it is for a large amount of
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.920]  drugs to come across the Rio Grande River and into the back of a vehicle to
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.640]  speed away into the unknown this is a real problem and now we're gonna take a
[27:47.640 --> 27:51.600]  look at that footage as you can see we're sitting on the side of the border
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.080]  right here the Rio Grande Valley or the Rio Grande River I should say in Laredo
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.880]  Texas there are people coming over in rafts across the border over to the US
[27:59.880 --> 28:04.400]  side this is actually happening right now we just saw this cameraman Joshua
[28:04.400 --> 28:08.920]  Owen saw it over my shoulder as we were just reporting on Donald Trump coming
[28:08.920 --> 28:15.800]  in to talk about the unsecured border this is breaking news right here in
[28:15.800 --> 28:26.640]  full force catches it we just caught these guys coming across the border
[28:26.640 --> 28:32.360]  they're jumping in they just jumped in the rafts they're coming up 1 2 3 4 they
[28:32.360 --> 28:51.480]  have big satchels that was a red Ford Explorer right yeah
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.680]  and this is going on up and down the border I saw similar things and got
[29:00.680 --> 29:06.920]  footage of it though it wasn't as up close in Big Bend and the border patrol
[29:06.920 --> 29:10.960]  is 75 miles away in that case searching people's that it vehicle
[29:10.960 --> 29:19.000]  citizens and then they had the park rangers riding college kids as if they're
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.480]  kids adults and a bunch of UT lawyer alumni who were out throwing a football
[29:24.480 --> 29:27.520]  to each other and had like little coolers with a couple curves lights in
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.560]  them they were they were riding them tickets and threatening them and getting
[29:31.560 --> 29:36.640]  real aggressive when they're just Americans out drinking a couple beers
[29:36.640 --> 29:42.040]  meanwhile the illegals were pouring across shelling drugs to people that
[29:42.040 --> 29:46.520]  were coming to the border to buy them as retail purchasers right there in
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.720]  front of me this of course was probably a hundred million dollars and fifty
[29:49.720 --> 29:54.480]  million who knows we're on the product we just video buyers on the run Alex
[29:54.480 --> 30:03.000]  Jones and the GCN radio network a job reporter have you ever dreamt of having
[30:03.000 --> 30:07.680]  superpowers well what if I told you there are real life superhumans and
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.520]  their DNA could be worth billions drug companies have their eyes on people like
[30:12.520 --> 30:18.120]  Steven Pete who can put his hand on a hot stove or step on glass and feel no
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.160]  pain and about 100 people share Timothy Dreyer's condition his bones are so
[30:23.160 --> 30:28.320]  dense he could walk away from a mangled wreck unscathed both men's apparent
[30:28.320 --> 30:33.240]  superpowers come from uncommon deviations in their DNA but rather than
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.400]  freakish these traits are seen as a gift from God to the drug companies who want
[30:38.400 --> 30:43.180]  to turn them into something useful something good for business the
[30:43.180 --> 30:47.680]  painkiller market alone is worth 18 billion a year so of course the industry

[33:19.440 --> 33:24.720]  corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation I talk along about the
[33:24.720 --> 33:29.880]  Manhattan Project in fact you guys give me a print-up from the encyclopedia on
[33:29.880 --> 33:38.480]  that to talk about a program that in today's dollars cost over a trillion
[33:38.480 --> 33:46.160]  dollars it was tens of billions back at the time and they kept its secret for
[33:46.160 --> 33:53.680]  four years with more than a hundred thousand people working directly on the
[33:53.680 --> 33:58.720]  project with pretty much full knowledge with hundreds of thousands of others
[33:58.720 --> 34:05.960]  having partial knowledge now the eugenics global takeover the new world order
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.880]  takeover is conservatively about a hundred times bigger than the Manhattan
[34:10.880 --> 34:15.600]  Project because within it you have the geoengineering project that's bigger than
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.840]  the Manhattan Project and kept secret you've got all these other projects the
[34:20.840 --> 34:25.200]  soft kill projects the fluoride in the water the GMO designed to brain damage
[34:25.200 --> 34:29.840]  and cause infertility the chemicals added to the plastics and the globalist
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.800]  even write books admitting they're doing it and it comes out maybe see news
[34:34.800 --> 34:39.760]  secret meeting at Einstein University with the Rockefellers and royalty on how
[34:39.760 --> 34:44.720]  to reduce population and then we go read the minutes of sub directorates that are
[34:44.720 --> 34:52.120]  public and they're admitting the plan and I've talked about it they tried to
[34:52.120 --> 34:55.800]  bring my dad into this Manhattan Project when he was a junior in high school
[34:55.800 --> 35:00.840]  they tested 150 of the highest test score people he would spend a lot of his
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.520]  high school time that year when he was a junior and senior at University of
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.360]  Texas being inducted into their plan to program and he got called aside by the
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.160]  director of the program six of them took them into his office for coffee this is
[35:16.160 --> 35:22.480]  when they were seniors he entered it was a junior and he told him by the way my
[35:22.480 --> 35:28.360]  dad remained friends with this guy and when I was a kid and we'd come down to
[35:28.360 --> 35:34.480]  Austin to visit my grandparents my mom's parents lived here they sometimes would
[35:34.480 --> 35:38.960]  break away and you know go say hi to him at his house and that was professor
[35:38.960 --> 35:45.920]  Speer who was from Germany but was Jewish head of the botany department and he
[35:45.920 --> 35:49.720]  called my dad in with five other people and said you are from our test the
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.840]  smartest people wide spectrum in Texas he's obsessed with breeding plants and
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.040]  breeding moths and all his other stuff and he said we'd like to induct you guys
[35:58.040 --> 36:02.120]  into a eugenics program to get you seated in place in governmental
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.040]  positions and it is eugenics it's not like the Nazi eugenics it's a larger plan
[36:07.040 --> 36:15.280]  across the board for the good and my dad never became a part of it and the
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.920]  reason I raised that here before I get into all this other news is the border
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.320]  being wide open is now proven to be public that the government pays the
[36:23.320 --> 36:27.160]  ship the illegals in and ships in a democratic controlled basis large
[36:27.160 --> 36:31.000]  churches and other facilities to then be given a driver's license and able to
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.960]  vote and then to be put on welfare to bring the country down and we broke it
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.520]  it's been proven it's the fact they could keep that secret for a year it took
[36:42.520 --> 36:47.600]  us a year to discover it and it was only because the board of patrol called us
[36:47.600 --> 36:57.160]  this was going on for a year now it's two years completely open completely
[36:57.160 --> 37:02.960]  illegal gigantic program shipping millions in 40 something thousand pairs
[37:02.960 --> 37:06.560]  of 6x underwear
[37:09.840 --> 37:13.560]  I mean that's the folks they're shipping in from Latin America is the total
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.440]  welfare heads where those countries are collapsing not the hard work and folks
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.520]  we've gotten in the past how could they keep that secret how do they keep it
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.360]  secret that they've been funding ISIS and al Qaeda for five years against Syria
[37:25.360 --> 37:31.120]  Libya and Egypt and now it's come out in Congress they just do it how do they
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.120]  keep it secret that they work with Saudi Arabia to carry out 9-11 and now it's
[37:35.120 --> 37:44.000]  starting to come out so all of this is like a Manhattan project the whole new
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.480]  world order operates that way using our resources our money I was on Jenny McCarthy
[37:49.480 --> 37:54.400]  syndicated radio show this morning I'm gonna get her come on ours and she was
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.840]  like no that makes a lot of sense I understand it and we were going over the
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.480]  soft kill documents in the plan how they don't want you to just you know they
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.760]  give you a shot you die in an hour that becomes too obvious they give you a shot
[38:05.760 --> 38:12.640]  and then you die cancer 10 years later everyone I know has a close friend who's
[38:12.640 --> 38:22.080]  20 25 30 35 40 who's dying of cancer I have two close friends who their best
[38:22.080 --> 38:31.200]  friends are dying both women age 30 and 36 right now super healthy people yoga
[38:31.200 --> 38:34.320]  teachers you name it
[38:36.240 --> 38:40.400]  cancer rates and children depending on the cancer but on average are up more
[38:40.400 --> 38:46.680]  than 10,000 percent since 1955 look it up lung cancer in women is up seven fold
[38:46.680 --> 38:51.000]  even though smoking has declined over the last 30 years and women and men we're
[38:51.000 --> 38:59.400]  being murdered they're spraying aluminum salts and barium and everything else you
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.320]  can imagine added to the jet fuel it's partially declassified to giant
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.720]  Department of Energy program NASA admits the earth is now 30% darker because of
[39:07.720 --> 39:16.560]  it the persistent contrails that's another Manhattan project they estimate
[39:16.560 --> 39:24.680]  half the public by 2025 in England will have cancer we're being murdered by a
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.520]  globalist eugenics Manhattan project and I'm gonna say it again before I get to
[39:28.520 --> 39:32.880]  the news because it's it's all that matters at the end of the day and I'm
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.000]  gonna go back into the history books and actually do some reports on this it
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.440]  came out the Nuremberg trial the plan that the Germans had working with the
[39:42.440 --> 39:50.480]  UK and and working with what they saw as Aryan populations to resettle but but
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.600]  they were going to be liberators to Africa Latin America Asia they ran the
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.040]  Japanese as the super race over the Asians and they were going to allow them
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.920]  to operate they believe the Japanese were smart enough to be able to be part of
[40:02.920 --> 40:06.840]  the conspiracy and the Emperor was a big eugenicist that's all well known of
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.600]  Japan and they were going to take over advertise that they were there to help
[40:11.600 --> 40:15.520]  keep the leaders of the group of whatever racial group they were taking
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.040]  over in you know up front just like Margaret Sanger did buying off the
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.840]  black leaders that they would then put poison in the water and the food to
[40:22.840 --> 40:26.600]  slowly debilitate and dump the public down over several generations then
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.760]  phasing everyone out and that's what we're under we're being murdered do you
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.600]  understand that I mean you think we tell you ten years ago that Planned
[40:35.600 --> 40:39.640]  Parenthood sells baby parts that had come out in lawsuits then now it's all
[40:39.640 --> 40:48.160]  admitted and so I just want to warn everybody over at these White House run
[40:48.160 --> 40:56.200]  outfits who make jokes at media matters and make jokes at Salon and make jokes
[40:56.200 --> 41:02.400]  at Raw Story and make jokes over at MSNBC listen it's all gonna come out and
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.120]  people are gonna remember those of you that went along with this and you're
[41:06.120 --> 41:11.160]  gonna be held accountable at Nuremberg style trials this isn't funny
[41:14.920 --> 41:18.800]  so you go ahead and try to indict the governor try to indict the attorney
[41:18.800 --> 41:21.840]  general in Texas because they're investigating Planned Parenthood and
[41:21.840 --> 41:25.360]  because they're investigating the carbon tax and because they're investigating
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.200]  the open border you go ahead and try to indict me because I know they got me
[41:29.200 --> 41:32.760]  getting followed around you go ahead and pull whatever you're gonna pull we're
[41:32.760 --> 41:39.680]  not on the side that chops up babies and sells their organs got it so you've
[41:39.680 --> 41:46.720]  picked your side that's good but those people out there that read your
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.240]  publications and watch your television shows that are being prayed on need to
[41:50.240 --> 41:56.400]  understand you're working under some very very evil people and you might want
[41:56.400 --> 42:03.160]  to think twice about what you're part of because they put fluoride in everybody's
[42:03.160 --> 42:07.320]  water they try to force inoculations on everybody including their servants and
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.880]  it's come out that in the US and in Europe and in China and Japan the elites
[42:11.880 --> 42:18.360]  get clean good engineered true vaccines that have side effects but really can
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.320]  protect you you try to misrepresent that we're against the science of
[42:23.320 --> 42:29.440]  inoculation that's not what's being said here you put out poisonous bilge
[42:32.720 --> 42:45.000]  and you're basically taking part in this whole situation when you defend it
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.840]  guys they've got a warehouse door open over there into my studio they don't have
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.000]  both doors sealed it sounds like a freight trains wrecking in there we get
[42:52.000 --> 43:00.320]  those shut thank you now continuing here ladies and gentlemen we have a
[43:00.320 --> 43:10.240]  decision to make and now the federal government is announcing they're going
[43:10.240 --> 43:13.960]  to track adults that are unvaccinated and start trying to basically force you
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.960]  to take shots and use the IRS is the enforcement mechanism just as they're
[43:17.960 --> 43:25.480]  now doing in Australia this is a global plan and believe me being trendy
[43:25.480 --> 43:31.120]  wearing different color socks that don't match going to a gay pride parade and
[43:31.120 --> 43:34.880]  supporting Caitlyn Jenner I know you think is a force field that makes you
[43:34.880 --> 43:39.440]  morally super intellectual and super smart but I'm gonna try to explain to you
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.800]  that's all just pop diversions while the real world goes on to have us fighting
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.880]  with each other and you're drinking poison water you're being injected with
[43:48.880 --> 43:53.640]  deadly cancer viruses you're being fed GMO that kills the guinea pigs that eat
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.960]  it you're being fed corn that kills the pigs that eat it and so when you get
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.840]  cancer at 40 or your wife or husband does or your son or daughter does or when
[44:03.840 --> 44:06.720]  you you know everybody in your family history had healthy kids but you have
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.360]  two kids and both of them one of them's brain damage and the other ones got
[44:10.360 --> 44:15.960]  deformities just understand you were hit and hit hard and you deserve to know
[44:15.960 --> 44:26.000]  who killed you you see the 223 or 556 bullet was developed to not kill
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.280]  statistically on average but to wound because they found that that would sap
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.000]  enemy resources having to take care of a person that was wounded by a high
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.880]  velocity round that goes 2300 feet per second that tends to break up inside the
[44:39.880 --> 44:46.480]  body because the Geneva Convention banned hollow point bullets the Pentagon got
[44:46.480 --> 44:51.480]  around it by creating a fragmentation full metal jacket round that would get
[44:51.480 --> 44:57.200]  around the Geneva Convention now why do I bring that up because that's what
[44:57.200 --> 45:02.160]  autism is that's what neurological disorders skyrocketing are it's not
[45:02.160 --> 45:05.840]  just the background radiation threefold what it was in 1945 in the Northern
[45:05.840 --> 45:11.920]  Hemisphere it's not just the chemicals and the glyphosates in the water it's
[45:11.920 --> 45:15.640]  not just the plastic linings it's not just the vaccines it's not it's all of
[45:15.640 --> 45:20.120]  it together and they're just exacerbating it to make it as horrible as
[45:20.120 --> 45:28.280]  they can so remember you're laughing now you won't be laughing later so just
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.880]  remember when you're burying your small child who dies from cancer or who dies
[45:32.880 --> 45:38.240]  from having violent seizures every hour just remember when you take your 18
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.160]  month old in and get that third round of shots and they have a convulsion in the
[45:42.160 --> 45:53.600]  car and then they never talk again that I warned you and it wasn't funny it's not
[45:53.600 --> 45:59.880]  funny for Jenny McCarthy she said I don't know what's going on but there was
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.440]  one in 25,000 30 years ago with autism and now it's one in 58 and it's set to
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.840]  be one in 10 by 2025 and then one in five and then one in three until suddenly
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.240]  nobody can talk and everyone's drooling and the average person is throwing
[46:15.240 --> 46:19.920]  feces up against the wall and then no one's asking what's going on why is
[46:19.920 --> 46:24.400]  this happening because there's a giant globalist program poisoning the food
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.640]  and water by design Reed John P. Holdren the White House science are his own book
[46:29.640 --> 46:41.200]  written 40 years ago 41 years ago now in 1974 with Paul Ehrlich and again I've
[46:41.200 --> 46:45.600]  got hundreds of incredible articles important stuff to cover I've got a
[46:45.600 --> 46:50.600]  mother saying the murder by the illegal alien of her son was a 9-11 attack for
[46:50.600 --> 46:58.760]  their family we've got a woman who died in Texas jail cell mentioned previous
[46:58.760 --> 47:09.320]  suicide attempts we've got commodities collapse just before last stock market
[47:09.320 --> 47:16.400]  crash so guess what's happening right now we're gonna go over that it's all
[47:16.400 --> 47:21.000]  coming up today but before I go any further I'm gonna fund this operation
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.760]  right now it is such an honor to be your host such an honor to be able to be
[47:24.760 --> 47:29.120]  independent such an honor to be able to put up a defensive liberty you see the
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.240]  White House run publications every day screaming in anger now calling for us to
[47:34.240 --> 47:40.440]  be shut down and shut up open to Talitarianism because we are just
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.920]  beating them over the head with the truth and it's not just info wars but
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.120]  info wars is another key platform to put out the Planned Parenthood videos and
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.040]  then to put it into context that's where we're really dangerous to the
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.000]  establishment as we show how it connects into the larger plan I mean they
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.040]  thought you were dumb they thought you'd never wake up to geoengineering
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.480]  they thought you never wake up to soft kill in the food chain they thought you
[48:02.480 --> 48:05.320]  never wake up to what carbon taxes really were they thought you never wake
[48:05.320 --> 48:09.240]  up to radical Islam being funded by criminals in the Western intelligence
[48:09.240 --> 48:14.080]  agencies as a pretext to take over they never thought you'd wake up to
[48:14.080 --> 48:17.920]  cloward and piven origin of 21 they thought you'd never get it because it
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.280]  was so horrifying but now people get it and they don't care what the mainstream
[48:22.280 --> 48:26.280]  media says or how much they laugh at us or when they come out and say there is
[48:26.280 --> 48:30.480]  no Planned Parenthood video and none of it's real it's a hoax and Margaret
[48:30.480 --> 48:37.840]  Sanger love black people that's what they're in the news that they say good
[48:37.840 --> 48:45.280]  lie more continue to spew your bull tell people the sky is sky is red
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.160]  conspiracy theorists that means think for yourself have hijacked the GOP what
[48:50.160 --> 48:56.880]  happens when Trump Cruz and Carson start following Alex Jones's lead and that is
[48:56.880 --> 49:00.320]  our greatest victory is that we've changed the talking points from the
[49:00.320 --> 49:07.360]  Rhino-Neocon folks they used to have talk radio hosts say there's no world
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.640]  government no plan for anything no plan for a carbon tax the Federal Reserve is
[49:11.640 --> 49:16.400]  not private the CFR loves you do you hear any Republican hosts talk like that
[49:16.400 --> 49:22.040]  now no they sound like me and they will get more and more hardcore so that's my
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.480]  ultimate victory and your ultimate victory is that we are changing the
[49:25.480 --> 49:29.560]  course of the debate and they can't stand it you're not in charge lecturing us
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.840]  MSNBC you go shoot your kids up with vaccines oh they don't you talk to
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.200]  attorney generals of states you talk to high-level media people they laugh and
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.400]  go of course I don't give my kids shots Alex you have a good one half the time
[49:44.400 --> 49:50.280]  they go hey I'm just doing my job we don't hate you just Alex come on I mean
[49:50.280 --> 49:54.600]  I've had police chiefs governors you name it just go listen I know this stuff's
[49:54.600 --> 49:58.400]  true but man I can't believe you're still alive you got to watch it well what
[49:58.400 --> 50:04.440]  do I do let me tell you the thinking people know what's really going on so

[54:39.320 --> 54:44.720]  being interrogated and it's exhausting and I've thought about the fact I need

[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.960]  because other countries have already implemented like Australia and we know
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.280]  exactly what's going to happen and then we hold stuff back and people go where
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.400]  is it where is it where's the tracker box in my car to taxi by the mile well it
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.600]  started the six states this year through the federal pilot program you're like
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.640]  okay that came true what about the other stuff it's all coming true we're like
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.680]  battling to keep the gates from collapsing they're on fire the hordes of
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.600]  globalist tyranny are about to pour in if you're an unborn baby you're already
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.440]  getting chopped up and having your organs sold it's a depression if you're out of
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.400]  work it's a recession of your neighbor is it's the same thing people have
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.200]  perception problems the world is collapsing the world is going into
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.200]  staged revolution Soros is funding the collapse of at least five countries
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:02.160]  currently the new Cold War has started US troops are battling as advisors
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.280]  Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine right now in the Crimea our government is
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:14.160]  funding proxy armies of al-Qaeda under the name ISIS to take over I mean it's
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.760]  epic but we sit here in what's left to the West with our cushy jobs and even
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.400]  if you're poor you're better off than most people in the world and folks don't
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.320]  know how good they've got it and we're beat over the head by political
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:34.720]  correctness and now we have the model of abusing the veterans Obama cares based
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.600]  off VA abuse and rationing care and computers saying what care you get and
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.640]  the Watson computer controlling it all so humans can write you off and claim
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:50.560]  they're not guilty now they're going to use that system of the VA on all
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.280]  retirees are to be looked at by computers and one criteria is taking an
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.040]  automatic transfer of your social security check and having your bills on
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.200]  autopay they deem that that you now are inept and that you now can be found to
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.080]  be incompetent they've already disarmed over a million veterans in the last
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.440]  decade and now they're coming and I saw this week and a half ago the daily
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.600]  caller couldn't hardly believe it they had the FBI memo saying prepare to do
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.560]  this and then now it's been in the LA Times endorsing it last Sunday and so
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:28.360]  now Republicans threaten to block Obama administration latest gun control move
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.440]  Republicans in letter urging social security to abandon the plan how about
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.560]  their hauled up and whoever called for it is fired and how about the president's
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.640]  call before Congress and told you stop taking guns outside of law the 68 gun
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.160]  control act it's unconstitutional and been found to be unconstitutional by
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:52.360]  DC versus Heller but still it doesn't matter you are not going to keep acting
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.360]  like an emperor but the very same Republicans can't have their cake and
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.000]  eat it too they don't want him to act as dictator on one issue but they do on the
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.840]  border they do on power plants they do let him do it on Obamacare they let him
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:15.680]  do it on so many other issues TPP just incredible Guantanamo Bay closure plan
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.000]  and final stages been in that for seven years that's just a public camp to show
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.600]  the public it's a laboratory research facility they admit that run by the CIA
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.040]  the real ghost sites are all over the world and US citizens are in them IRS
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:35.280]  encrypts an entire CD of documents in response to four year request on their
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.460]  persecution the American people tech dirt breaks down so they can follow the
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:46.520]  for you but then no one can decode it Trump supporters stand by their man in
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.720]  presidential race poll show he's just as popular as he's ever been after they
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.920]  misconstrue what he has to say about the trader McCain Trump to Anderson Cooper
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.680]  again during interview says the people don't trust you and the media and that's
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:08.240]  absolutely true MSNBC and I want to play this clip is stunned by Clinton's
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.360]  upside-down poll numbers a morning job panel on MSNBC found it difficult to
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.800]  accept that Hillary Clinton is unpopular in her poll numbers are upside down in
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.640]  crucial swing states well I mean no one wants Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush and
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.600]  this game of thrones where they pass this crown back and forth between these
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:35.800]  two royal dynasties here's that clip Hillary is upside down by 23 in Iowa
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:42.360]  she's upside down by 9 in Virginia which he has to win she's upside down by 23
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:51.920]  in Colorado and Mika I think we just in that one snapshot is shown and I'm sure
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:58.800]  Jeb Bush isn't much better why somebody out of I was gonna say left field he's
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.960]  not left field or right field why somebody like Donald Trump attacking
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.840]  politicians is actually getting support oh my gosh it's incredible the people
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.440]  don't buy into it coming up US decides against publicly blaming China for the
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.960]  biggest data breach of national security information ever we're gonna get more
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.880]  into those drones they say are gonna be attacking scientists warned the world to
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.120]  think twice before replying to alien signals from outer space liberal
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.240]  tolerance transgender threatens to put conservative pundit in the hospital and
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:41.480]  has praised we're gonna get into all of this and more today but dr. Edward
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:48.080]  group patriot army special ops veteran anti-newworld order expert one of the
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.280]  biggest supplement formulators in the country very successful I was on Jenny
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.800]  McCarthy show today and you were pointing out in her book she wrote about
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.520]  your oxy powder a decade ago the point is he's pretty important guy for folks
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.760]  that you know don't know about supplement formulation he's teamed up with
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.400]  info wars.com to help us come out with our flagship products he manufacturers
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:11.760]  about a third of our products the other two big labs we use he helps look over
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.120]  the ingredients and helps look over the testing to advise us he's a great
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.320]  consultant but don't worry I'm not gonna infomercial towards the end of this hour
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.200]  to fund our operation with some new products we're gonna be announcing
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.280]  today he's here to cover the waterfront on huge breaking health news and to give
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:33.560]  us his take on the state of the world but before we go there doctor group what
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.000]  do you make of the Planned Parenthood videos where their director their
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.400]  national head of their board of directors says I want to get a better you
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.480]  know price on this I want to buy Lamborghini and ghoulishly haggling and
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.480]  then they have White House groups media matters and others come out and say that
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.000]  I'm lying that this video isn't even real when Planned Parenthood admits it's
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.200]  real and that Margaret Sanger wasn't a racist I mean that's like saying that's
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.800]  like saying Adolf Hitler wasn't a racist I mean it's just what there seems to be
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.160]  an insanity because I'm not left or right I'm just libertarian like you there
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.280]  seems to be a mental illness insanity by the so-called left today where they are
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.880]  lying and telling whoppers bigger than Al Gore saying he invented the internet
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:28.160]  what do you make of this doctor group well it's it's just a sick process that's
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.800]  going on I mean you meant you mentioned mental illness and that's to me is
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.360]  another weapon that the governments are going to use for gun control because if
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.080]  you think about the push to put every single person on some form of psychiatric
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.640]  or psychotropic drug right now even including pregnant women and young
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:52.200]  children is early as three four five the violence the suicides the gun the
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.640]  school shootings look that's an easy way to take guns away from somebody because
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.000]  all they have to do is pull up your medical records and say hey you have a
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.880]  history of being on psychotropic medications we're gonna take your gun
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.120]  away and now you have eight out of ten people being on some sort of psychotropic
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.920]  medication and it's beyond that they're now saying in the FBI memo if you take
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.760]  automatic transfer of your Social Security that you're inept right if you
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.880]  leave a psychiatrist's office without a medication they actually have a code in
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.720]  the DSM saying you're crazy for leaving the office without accepting a
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.080]  prescription so I mean I think the Planned Parenthood that goes back to
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.800]  Bill Gates organization we're gonna skip this right back to eugenics that goes
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.720]  back to the control of the population it all goes back to the multitude of
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.720]  things that they're being they're bombarding us with including all the
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.920]  environmental toxins the endocrine disrupting chemical no wonder there's
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:50.320]  so many mental problems well exactly I mean honey bees are acting insane other
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.840]  mammals are fish and shrimp are committing suicide seeing in they
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.880]  swim up to the birds to be eaten because of the Prozac runoff right I mean we have
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.920]  so many chemicals in the water supply the air I mean that's that's pretty much
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.240]  what we've linked to every single type of disease we've been getting calls I
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.960]  didn't even realize how many calls we had till the other day I was talking to
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.200]  some of the guys in the customer service department and they said that the
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.720]  hairs women are calling in saying their hair is falling out oh yeah it's
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.760]  everywhere that's all over the women's eyes where the thyroids are swelling up
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.320]  they're spraying aluminum on us what what's gonna happen when half of us have
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.960]  cancer the radiation from Fukushima cancer this is a report how are they
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.040]  gonna cover this up how are they gonna get away with it they're not I mean
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.640]  people are gonna have to wake up and figure out that there's the solutions to
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.800]  it I mean it's in broad daylight they're out there saying everything there the
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.080]  government is reporting on increased cancer they're linking it to chemicals
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.600]  there's environmental chemists right now coming out and doing studies on all
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.320]  types of different types of cosmetic product the FDA and EPA have said take
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.280]  all the fluoride out and the and the globalists say no there's eight billion
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:09.240]  pounds right now of BPA alone being produced every single year there's
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:15.240]  fire retardants being produced say that again eight billion pounds eight billion
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.280]  of BPA and so much of that runs off in the rivers of the ocean that now
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:26.560]  upwards of half of the fish are basically have both sexual organs there's two
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:31.160]  points but see we're being homophobic it's good that they've changed the whole
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.720]  world is changing and the problem is it's not only affecting us as the humans
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.280]  it's affecting the pets it's affecting all of the animals on the planet it's
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:44.080]  affecting the the fish the the herbs the trees is this like an oblivion plotline
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.760]  that aliens are doing this or something I say that more and more because it's so
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.080]  diabolical and then we get the documents they're doing it on purpose who are
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:58.160]  these people I don't know but I mean my main focus is on the solutions just like
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.680]  you telling people what they can do I mean there's a lot of different things
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.440]  out there that we could talk about the negative the negative the negative of
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.920]  everything but really the what people want to hear is they want to hear okay
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:15.480]  what are some of the solutions we can do I just found out that fragrances I
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.480]  mean I've known about the toxic effects of fragrances and fragrances for
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.120]  anybody who doesn't know your dryer sheet anything that smells nice anything
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:28.840]  you buy in the grocery store even foods that are sitting next to fragrances now
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.380]  are being contaminated with chemicals oh I get sick when I walk through the
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:36.160]  grocery store when I was a kid my eyes would burn I'd get a headache walking
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.520]  through the tom-tom grocery store through the chemical oil or when I would be
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.080]  at you know the hardware store walking by the pesticide aisle my eyes would burn
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.360]  I'd get a headache so fragrances fragrance if it says natural fragrance or
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:53.440]  anything on a label that fragrance can contain anywhere from 12 usually 12 is
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:22:01.520]  the minimum to over 200 toxic chemicals in that fragrance alone and doing more
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.820]  research into this I found that fragrances aren't even required to put
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.400]  on the labels natural flavors because it's grandfathered and
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.160]  proprietary exactly and fragrances are not they don't need to be listed on the
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.800]  msds sheets the material safety data sheets that are required by the government
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.080]  for any type of supplement or any type of chemical fragrances are not allowed
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.840]  and let me give them a big conspiracy just like cigarette companies spent
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.080]  tens of billions with up to 300 chemicals per cigarette brand to make it
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.480]  more addictive where the chemicals are what you're addicted to not even the
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.760]  nicotine that's what caused so much to cancer not the tobacco is good either but
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.320]  just like foods and designer food additives as you know your dad was a
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.040]  top chemist was also to make food addictive and so you want to keep eating
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.360]  it the Doritos the McDonald's well it's the same thing with fragrances they
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:57.640]  want to make their brand of poisonous dishwashing fluid clothes washing fluid
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:03.280]  air freshener addictive a lot of poisons are addictive as folks know so that you
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.440]  get addicted to their brand and they compete for more aggressive neurotoxins
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.760]  right they did actually did a study where they tested people were getting
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:19.040]  sick next that live next door to where the dryer vents came out outside into
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.200]  the outside air so they did a study and they took samples of the dryer air
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.840]  coming out they found I think 46 different VOC's volatile organic
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.720]  compounds and toxic chemicals conspiracy restricted by the EPA and listed as
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.520]  toxic air contaminants coming out everywhere into the air from everybody
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:42.520]  using dryer sheets and toxic laundry detergent goddess listen Hitler just
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.840]  got shut down because they were in competition it'd be like one dime in
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.360]  an Italian mob taken out of the other dawn not because they're against the
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:53.960]  mafia but they're just taking over and Hitler again had the plan to put all
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:58.320]  these poisons and food and water so the populations they were dominating didn't
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.440]  know they were being dumbed down and they've done it to us they really did it
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:09.040]  dr. group soft kill it is it's a soft kill because every person is has a
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.680]  different reaction to different chemicals like let's say someone can die
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.760]  from eating a peanut right if they're allergic to peanuts and everybody has
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.760]  different reactions to different chemicals so that's why they use a
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.760]  combination of chemicals environmental pollutants chemicals in the food the
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.720]  water the phthalates the endocrine disrupting chemical they're mad scientist
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.640]  I mean sunscreen why do you think in the 50s in comic books the Joker was
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.720]  always putting poison in cosmetics and other products so he couldn't get caught
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.120]  poisoning people they were telling us what they were doing then that's what
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.120]  the Joker does I'm so sick of these people man yeah I'm telling you the
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.840]  good news is there's a solution I'll tell you what it just would you know I'm
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.800]  constantly looking into cleansing and detoxification we're gonna be talking
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.440]  about a new product here pretty soon but we looked at there and actually there
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.600]  was a study done there was a guy that wrote a book called talks in talks out
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.840]  and he actually looked at what type of chemicals were secreted in your sweat
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.320]  because the body has women have five ways to eliminate chemicals and toxins
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.080]  and these can be any type of chemical you're going to breathe them out with
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.640]  heavy respiration with exercise you want to sweat them out you're gonna
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.680]  defecate them out you're gonna urinate them out and women have menses for their
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.760]  menstrual cycle to get rid of toxins that weather estimate they live about six
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.440]  years longer yes but I mean right now all the menstrual cycles and practically
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.080]  every woman is messed up and not ready and everybody's not having to bow
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.160]  movement today nobody's urinating enough because they're not drinking enough
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.480]  water and you know nobody's sweating and breathing enough because they're not
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.040]  exercising so basically we've had we have an accumulation of chemicals soup of
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.240]  chemicals and toxins coming in and nobody's letting them out well everybody
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.480]  I know is freaking out I mean everyone I know knows a young person dying of
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:59.160]  cancer it's scary it is I mean it is scary I'm gonna get really serious about
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.720]  detoxifying even more and only eating organic and moving out to the country
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.520]  and I already had a place in the country but it's just not right I got to get
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.000]  something where I can really get organic well this guy went into a sauna and
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.640]  started measuring people taking sweat samples and he found out that our body
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.460]  is so effective at detoxification I mean especially when you have a clean
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.840]  liver and clean intestines that he could actually measure a lot of the phthalates
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.200]  BPAs chemicals and toxins coming out through the sweat so it's just a good
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.760]  free tip for people out there if you really want to detoxify not only is it
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.880]  good to take all these additional supplements that we have developed for
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.280]  infowars life but also sure sweat I mean it's free go just sweat sweat get in a
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.520]  steam room go for a hike let me ask you this question almost everyone I know
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.880]  dying of cancer or has died is either a child or a woman and I've seen the
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.680]  numbers that like lung cancer ABC News reported a few years ago was up seven
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.440]  fold and women from your research what's happening to women I read they're
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.120]  three times more likely now with thyroid it seems like they're being targeted I
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.000]  think there well there's a lot of different factors number one their
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.440]  endocrine system is different than the male their thyroid is four times
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.520]  larger they're a little more sensitive because of their cycle and their
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.440]  historically cover right their history they usually live longer than men I
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:28.000]  mean historically women live like gunshot wounds anything women daughters
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.960]  will tell you are more resilient unless it's just an upfront brutal attack right
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.720]  my mom actually was shot six times point blank range in the head with a 22
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.600]  rifle and she survived good Lord I know that story well you were talking about
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:48.960]  resiliency Wow yes she she survived that but I think that when you take a
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.920]  reproductive system of a woman and then you alter it so much because women you
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.840]  men are to usually higher in testosterone women are higher in estrogen
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.680]  what's happening is women are spiking so high in estrogen and estrogen is a
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.120]  cancer-causing substance they're spiking so high in estrogen that their
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.920]  progesterone levels and testosterone levels are falling so low so you're
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.400]  getting these cancer more cancer-causing molecules besides the fact that
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:24.000]  they're deficient in also so how do women naturally in iodine but also women use
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.920]  10 more for the amount of perfumes and fragrances and cosmetics that they rub
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.080]  on their skin than men do and that is a huge problem that we're dealing with
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:40.520]  right now when we come back or start telling me how does a woman block the
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.280]  overproduction of estrogens or artificial estrogens and how do men do it
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.520]  because I wouldn't have my blood tested by a medical doctor about a year ago
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.160]  they said no you've got high testosterone most men it's really low
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.240]  nowadays yours is actually pretty good the problem is it's converting to
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.520]  estrogen and you've got estrogen mimickers in you so what what do you do
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.360]  naturally to block that what you do the first thing I always do is have them do
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.720]  a liver cleanse or maybe a couple liver cleanses because that's really when your
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.960]  liver becomes congested there's two organs the medical profession never
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.240]  wants you to learn about one is the intestines and the second one is the
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.840]  liver the liver you get into is the only organ in the body that regenerates
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.200]  completely or regrows itself within 90 days right so that's why it's there the
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.040]  liver had performs over 500 different functions it's so important to make sure
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.880]  that you have a clean and functioning liver and a healthy gut everything
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.840]  starts from there and if that's messed up then at the your estrogen is not going
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.200]  to be pretty you know what I feel a little bit intellectually threatened by
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:47.080]  you I'm just gonna call your racist now I'm better than well then you might need
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.120]  to be on some mental a medic absolutely absolutely better detox we'll be back
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:58.680]  we're gonna go over these other articles Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.760]  All right, I'm gonna stop right there
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.760]  We've got Dr. Group here with us in studio
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.760]  And he wants to take some phone calls
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760]  Questions or comments about toxins
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.760]  About what's in the household
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.760]  About waves of detox
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.760]  The reason he wants to join us is
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.760]  800-259-9231
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.760]  And I think we need to fire up my call board in here
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.760]  I guess that turned off or something
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.760]  But 800-259-9231
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760]  And we'll take some of your phone calls
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.760]  Dr. Group, again, is my guest in studio
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  The reason I like to have him in sometimes
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.760]  He's a good friend of mine, really smart
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760]  Knows his stuff
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.760]  And he's all about solutions
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.760]  Chemicals you unknowingly smear on your face
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.760]  This morning
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.760]  And remember, a lot of drugs you put on your skin
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]  To be absorbed
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:55.760]  The skin is the biggest organ
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.760]  This is crazy
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  Feminine care products increases women exposure
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.760]  To harmful chemicals
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.760]  We'll go into that right now
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.760]  This futuristic bracelet tells you
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.760]  How toxic your environment is
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.760]  Is your child's coloring with asbestos
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.760]  That's another article Group wants to get into
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.760]  Because this is crazy
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.760]  It's not just that they're getting rid of byproducts
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.760]  Of the petrochemical industry
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.760]  And then just putting it in things so we pay for it
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]  That's part of it
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.760]  But even when they have ways to put out safer products
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  They don't do it
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.760]  Even though that's a whole other market for them
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760]  And then you learn this is by design
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.760]  But regardless, they're not doing anything about it
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.760]  Dr. Group, please continue
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.760]  Well, this is one of the most shocking things
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.760]  Is that they just found out that cancer causing asbestos
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.760]  Fibers were found in several children's crayon brands
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  And, you know
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.760]  Why are you hating on asbestos?
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760]  Because I'm trying to protect the children
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.760]  Are you an asbestos fob?
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.760]  I am an asbestos fob
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.760]  I'm a chemical and toxic everything fob
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.760]  One of the reasons that I really wanted to come on today
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.760]  Was to let people know that they are exposed
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.760]  To so many different chemicals in their home
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.760]  Every single day, from fragrances
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.760]  To environmental pollutants
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  To VOCs in the air
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.760]  To BPA, to phthalates, to glyphosate
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.760]  The artificial colors, the artificial sweeteners
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.760]  You know, asbestos and who would have thought
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.760]  They buy their kids crayons and they're breathing toxic compounds
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.760]  But another reason why is to announce that
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.760]  We spent over a year trying to put together something
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]  For somebody, for everybody
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.760]  Especially working with Alex and the team over here
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:45.760]  To create a product that would focus on helping people
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.760]  Clean environmental chemicals and toxins from their body
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  And how to detox those from the system
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.760]  We have a lot of good products over here from the X2
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  For the, you know, all of the liver cleanse products
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.760]  The oxy powder, the winter sun
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760]  I mean, you name it, down the line, everything is great
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.760]  Today, though, I'm really excited
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  Because this is something that you guys have the exclusive for
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760]  Which is a product called Deep Cleanse
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.760]  That we have, that is going to be launched today
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.760]  And why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.760]  Almost like the iodine crystals
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.760]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.760]  And we knew this was going to be big
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.760]  So I did this time order a ton of it
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.760]  So we do have it stockpiled
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.760]  We did get a ton of it in, freshly made
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.760]  And it's got the best, which one of our graphic people
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  Designed this, the label is beautiful
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760]  But what's really important is what's in it
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.760]  And explain the manufacturing process
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.760]  You cold press and concentrate this
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.760]  That's why the super male, the super female
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.760]  All this stuff blows people's socks off
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  And we wanted to come out with the ultimate deep cleanse
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.760]  For the whole body, tell people what's in it, Dr. Group
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.760]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:10.760]  And it's called Shilijit
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.760]  And it's actually known as Blood of the Mountain
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.760]  Or Rock Sweat because years ago, thousands of years ago
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.760]  As a matter of fact, this ingredient was only given
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.760]  To the elite of the elite, thousands of years ago
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.760]  Up in the Himalayan Mountains and in Tibet
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.760]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.760]  But we couldn't get an organic form
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.760]  Right, I mean I
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:33.760]  So let's explain, I mean this stuff's so good
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.760]  We couldn't put it out for years
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.760]  Right, so I had to actually
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:38.760]  It's kind of like the iodine crystals
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  Finding a source deep in the earth
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760]  That we could get the cleanest source available
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.760]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan Mountains
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.760]  Thousands of years ago, they found, they watched these monkeys
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  And during the summer months, the monkeys would go up
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760]  Into the mountains
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  And they would pick this black substance from the mountains
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:02.760]  And so in Russia, they actually
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.760]  It grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayans
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760]  And only in the summer
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.760]  And Chilajit is actually the decomposition of 7
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.760]  Up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.760]  So it decomposes all these different herbs
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760]  Decomposing the Himalayan Mountains
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  And the volcanic soil up there
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.760]  And what happens in the summertime
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  So it's almost like an oil from
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.760]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.760]  It's claiming oil is really from decomposed animals
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.760]  And plants
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.760]  There is some oil that is based from fossils
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.760]  But most of it's really abiotic
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.760]  So this is a true fossil source
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760]  Explain it to me
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  It is, it's really the decomposition
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.760]  Like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.760]  And plants
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.760]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.760]  It freezes and during the summertime
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.760]  And the pressures build it up
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  It oozes out
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:59.760]  It oozes out
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.760]  So it literally oozes out of the mountains
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  It's like rock sap
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.760]  It's like rock sap, it's black
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.760]  And it's highly nutritious
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.760]  Even in the 1980s when the Olympic athletes
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760]  In Russia were accused of being on steroids
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  They found out that they were actually
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  Been given Chilajit
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.760]  Because it works as an anabolic as well
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  And it builds muscles
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  Muscle and as well
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  So this is going to supercharge me even more
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]  I haven't taken it yet
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]  This is amazing
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.760]  Because what it's designed to do
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.760]  It's actually the king of ayurvedic herbs
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.760]  Like I said, it was never given to the elite
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.760]  And we have the exclusive area in the mountains
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.760]  That we've worked for over a year and a half
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760]  To develop and get
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760]  So we get the production
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760]  It's hand harvested from the mountains
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.760]  And that's the main ingredient
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.760]  And you tell me it's a big dose of it
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  It's a big dose in there
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.760]  The second big main ingredient in there
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.760]  Is a volcanic zeolite concentrate
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.760]  And what this formula is designed to do
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.760]  Diabean races against volcanoes
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.760]  Is to grab and detoxify
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.760]  And help cleanse your body
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.760]  Of all these environmental chemicals and toxins
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.760]  Because these, the Chilajit and the zeolites
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760]  Have a real strong negative charge
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.760]  And VOCs have positive charges
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.760]  So these go in, they grab it
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.760]  And then they safely eliminate it through the body
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.760]  So you can become healthy
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.760]  I mean, this is an amazing formula
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.760]  I wish I actually had it
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.760]  But because this was an exclusive
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:34.760]  Info Wars life product
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  You're the only one in the world that has this formula now
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.760]  And there is going to be a limited supply available
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.760]  When you sell out
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.760]  Because you can only harvest this once a year
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.760]  Well, that's why we went ahead and doubled down
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.760]  And have gotten one of the biggest orders ever
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.760]  Is because I'm sick of...
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  Well, I mean, you said they are
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.760]  Now for industrial purposes
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  Buying up the deep earth crystals
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.760]  Because it's used for so much drug manufacturing
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.760]  Not illegal drug manufacturing
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.760]  Shifting yours for a moment
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.760]  Into the iodine
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.760]  Why is iodine used in so much manufacturing
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.760]  Of drugs and chemicals and everything?
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.760]  Well, really, I think they're starting to see
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.760]  More and more radiation damage all over the world
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.760]  And that's the number one use for iodine
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.760]  They can soak different things in iodine solutions
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  They see that it works for...
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  There's just as many pets now
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.760]  Coming out with a thyroid dysfunction
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.760]  And so, veterinary use for iodine
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.760]  There's a lot of chemical use for iodine
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.760]  They can clean substance, chemical substances with it
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760]  Before they...
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.760]  So it's not toxic or it's not a radiate
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.760]  The point is, is it really getting hard to get?
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.760]  The point is, people are starting to jump on the bandwagon with iodine
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.760]  And they're starting to see the demand for it
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.760]  They're starting to see how effective it is
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:52.760]  And they're starting to buy it up
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.760]  And by the way, since we're talking about pets
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.760]  Yeah, let's go back to the new deep cleanse
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.760]  Exclusively available at mfolwarslife.com
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.760]  And you help fund the savage operation
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.760]  And the promotion of liberty
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.760]  Pets are just as susceptible to diseases we are
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.760]  And people all over the world love their pets
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.760]  And they're spending a massive amount of money on their pets
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  And pets are exposed to massive amounts
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.760]  Of chemicals because they're close to the carpet
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:18.760]  They're breathing in VOCs
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.760]  All the pet food out there is highly contaminated
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.760]  So this is also a great...
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.760]  And so is the X2
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.760]  Great to use for your pets to keep your pets healthy
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.760]  What do you do? Put it on their wet food?
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.760]  Or put it in the water?
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.760]  Personally, I just stick it right in there
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.760]  I just have a dog and I just put it right in here
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:38.760]  That's what I do with old dogs I've had
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.760]  When I give them like Advil
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.760]  I just grab their mouth and throw it in there
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.760]  I just do it for the X2 and I do it for...
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.760]  Well, I'm going to get some deep cleansing
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.760]  I'm going to be detoxing my dog from that
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  But my dog eats organic food anyway
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.760]  So we are...
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.760]  I mean, it's proven...
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.760]  You got to be a white savior to your dog?
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.760]  I'm going to be a white savior to the dog
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760]  Yeah, I have a hybrid dog
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.760]  It's actually called a golden doodle
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.760]  It's like a...
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.760]  It stays a golden racist
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.760]  See, it's golden racist...
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.760]  And again, the reason I'm being sarcastic
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.760]  We have a new MTV show out where they call it microaggression
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.760]  Where a brown bag is racist
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.760]  Or like, if I have my elbows on a black table
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.760]  It means it's actually going to dominate black people
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760]  And just everything's racist
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.760]  So we have to now realize that that's what this is all about
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.760]  Well, if solutions are racist
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.760]  Then I guess I'm racist
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.760]  Because the whole purpose is to provide people with solutions
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.760]  Where do you think this craziness is going though?
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.760]  I think that there's a...
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.760]  There's a lot of good that's happening
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.760]  You know, obviously people are standing up
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.760]  They're fighting more against genetically modified organisms
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.760]  Except now they're trying to come...
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.760]  So they want to just distract us off
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.760]  Because they know there's an awakening
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:51.760]  And we're coming together
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.760]  Right
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.760]  The only solution that I see
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.760]  And I still have that feeling
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.760]  That something's going to be happening
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.760]  Starting around September 20th
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.760]  That's kind of what I've been feeling personally
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.760]  And I know you've been having those feelings too
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.760]  And some nights are fine with me
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.760]  And then some nights I'd wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  And you say you've never been like that?
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.760]  I've never been like that
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:16.760]  I've never felt this strong about something
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760]  I mean, actually...
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.760]  Even on secret operations in the military
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  By North Korea, you never felt like that
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  No, no, because this affects me and my family
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.760]  And like something big that's happening with the world
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.760]  I mean, I was just back there talking to Anthony about...
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.760]  You can really feel it
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.760]  You know, what to do
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.760]  You know, should we take our...
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.760]  I've already converted a lot of money into silver
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.760]  You've already moved out to a ranch
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  And I try to tell people
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.760]  Make sure that you have a stock
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.760]  Of all the things that you're going to need
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.760]  Because the attack, it could come through the air
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.760]  It could come through the water
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.760]  I mean, I was on my way up here in Bastrop
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.760]  And saw a sign at the Bucky's right there
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.760]  You sent me a photo
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:01.760]  It said FEMA, just, you know, FEMA amp or something
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.760]  Let me pull it up
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.760]  Yeah, so what I'm saying is right now
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.760]  It seems like there's a lot of...
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.760]  Especially with Jade Helm and everything that's happening
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.760]  That's why I want to just give people answers
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.760]  That's why I want to help
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  Because I've done all the research
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.760]  I've studied all these chemicals
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  And it's easy for me to say, look
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.760]  All these high rates in cancer
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.760]  All the problems that you're having with your child
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.760]  All of the so-called mental illness that's out there
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.760]  That they're saying is caused by some
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.760]  Dumb chemical reaction in your brain
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.760]  It's not a chemical reaction in your brain
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.760]  It's because your liver's toxic
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.760]  Your liver's congested
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.760]  And you have too many chemicals coming into your body
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.760]  So it's all about...
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:46.760]  That's why everything that we develop
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.760]  Everything I develop
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.760]  For Info Wars or for Global Healing Center
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.760]  It doesn't matter, it's all geared to help you
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.760]  Change your environment
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.760]  And reduce the amount of chemicals and toxins
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:58.760]  That are coming into your body
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:47:59.760]  And it's a win-win
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.760]  You're really into reap what you sow, karma, whatever
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  We knew radically
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.760]  That's why I went with you
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.760]  It took me years to research this
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.760]  Most big manufacturers, we go to them
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.760]  And they're like, oh, you want to put out something quality?
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.760]  Wow, no one wants to do that
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.760]  They just make it all about the marketing
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.760]  And we're like, no, we really want to do
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  As we would do under others as we want to be done to us
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.760]  Plus, when we end up having the best products
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.760]  We'll end up dominating the market
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.760]  Funding our operation and crushing the globalist
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.760]  It's old-fashioned Americana
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.760]  I mean, I want to have the best products
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.760]  That's why everybody else out there focuses on the symptoms
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.760]  And we don't focus on the symptoms
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:39.760]  We focus on the root cause
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.760]  I mean, that's the way it should be
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.760]  Everybody has a self-healing mechanism inside their own body
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.760]  And it took me years to figure that out
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.760]  Because no one ever taught me that
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760]  Sure
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.760]  All we're doing is the best and easiest and fastest way
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.760]  To reactivate your body's self-healing mechanism
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]  To cleanse
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.760]  Your immune system is to clean your body
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.760]  And we're sold out of the liver cleanse
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.760]  We're going to be back in soon
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.760]  We've misestimated how many people would want it
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.760]  We have a lot of the deep cleanse
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.760]  And quite frankly, you're even more excited about this
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.760]  Than the liver cleanse
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  Because go over the other things that are in it
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.760]  Well, the other thing, and it is a specifically
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  Designed zeolite concentrate
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.760]  Now, all the products and ingredients
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.760]  That were chosen for deep cleanse
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.760]  Were hand-picked by me
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.760]  And there's many different forms of Shilajit out there
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.760]  Actually, too
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.760]  I find the one that was grown in the best organic
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.760]  Or produced in the best organic mountains
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.760]  The zeolites, we actually spent years
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:40.760]  Trying to concentrate those into a solution
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.760]  And what are zeolites, folks?
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:44.760]  Zeolites are actually a combination
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:47.760]  They're formed hundreds of thousands of years ago
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  Millions of years ago when volcanic lava
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.760]  Met seawater
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.760]  Okay, so when the lava from volcanoes
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.760]  Touched the seawater
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.760]  It formed a special type of compound
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.760]  And that's called a zeolite
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  A matrix
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.760]  A matrix, and so
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:07.760]  These little tiny zeolites
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.760]  Which go through your body are actually
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.760]  Like almost structured forms
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.760]  That are highly charged
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.760]  Have a high negative charge on them
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.760]  That have an affinity for any type of chemicals
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]  And toxins that are inside
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  So it's like a super antioxidant
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.760]  It's like a super antioxidant
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  That grabs, that goes through the blood
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.760]  Goes through everything and grabs and bonds
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.760]  It's like a magnet, really
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.760]  It bonds to all these chemicals
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  It's a hardcore formula
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]  Your purchase supports the broadcast
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  I'm going to be taking it every single day
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  So I'm actually going to be buying it from you guys
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  And by the way, I'll tell you something
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]  That's the biggest sleeper product
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760]  We didn't even promote it
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  It's secret 12
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.760]  The medical bottom and bottom will be 12
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  People that order it just keep reordering it
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  That's one of our best sellers now
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.760]  With no promotion
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.760]  Because it just works so good
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  Everybody needs B12

[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  Because it's such an important topic
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.760]  But I want to be able to take phone calls
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.760]  From Kathy Bill, Robert, Spencer, Patrick
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  And many others that are patiently holding
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.760]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.760]  So Dr. Gripple, we'll be with us
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.760]  30 minutes to the next hour
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.760]  I will, though, some of that time
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.760]  Get into breaking news and info
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  And get your take on that as well
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.760]  Then we're going to have Joe Biggs and Josh Owens
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.760]  Who were just at the border
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.760]  Donald Trump said he was going down to Laredo
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  Then he wasn't
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.760]  Now he's going back this weekend
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  I mean, whatever
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.760]  But we caught drug smuggling going on
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.760]  On pretty powerful footage
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  And just illustrates exactly what we're all talking about
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760]  And so they're going to be joining us
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.760]  The last 30 minutes
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.760]  Just briefly on the deep cleanse
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.760]  Exclusively available at infowarslife.com
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.760]  Just 30 seconds on this
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.760]  Then I want to go to calls, questions and comments
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:12.760]  Dr. Gripple, how do people take it?
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:14.760]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.760]  Just a daily dose?
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.760]  Yeah, daily dose. The instructions are on the label
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.760]  Of course, I kind of modify it for each individual
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.760]  It depends on what your lifestyle is
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.760]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:28.760]  Is for you to avoid all these chemicals
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.760]  And toxins in your environment
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:33.760]  And try to identify them and start slowly reducing them
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.760]  But personally, I'm going to probably take it every day
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  Every other day
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.760]  And I'll probably go with about a dropper full
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.760]  To maybe two dropper fulls
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:44.760]  And I don't expose myself to any chemicals
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.760]  But it's out there in the air and everything
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.760]  I mean, let's say what I do
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:49.760]  I've never been a supplement person
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.760]  I keep it now on the kitchen table
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.760]  With a lazy Susan
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.760]  And when I just make myself take it all every day
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  I feel so much better
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.760]  My problem is getting in the habit
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.760]  And I still haven't done it completely
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.760]  I had a lady come into my office actually
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  And her sister is an avid info wars fan
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.760]  And she told me that her sister was sent home to die
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  And had two months to live because she had a lung disease
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.760]  She didn't specify what it was
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  If it was lung cancer or whatever
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  And she told me
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  She heard us talking about the lung cleanse from info wars
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  And she purchased like seven or eight bottles
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.760]  And she started spraying it and using the instructions
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:30.760]  Like ten times a day
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  And she went back to her doctor's office a month later
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:36.760]  And her doctor said, what in the world are you doing
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.760]  Your lung condition is halfway cleared up
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.760]  And she said she didn't want to tell
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  Because she watched us talking about it
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  And she didn't want to tell her doctor what she was doing
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.760]  And then the next month she went back in
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:51.760]  And her lung condition was completely gone in two months
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.760]  Well, a lot of the lung stuff you buy even in health food stores
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.760]  You just spray it and it's only got two or three ingredients
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  It's real watery
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:56:59.760]  This is so good
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.760]  You've got to unstop the sprayer a lot
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  Because it's like thick essential oil
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.760]  Explain the difference
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:08.760]  Well, because of all the research that I did on air pollutants
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.760]  And I mean I drove up from Houston today
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  And just getting here
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  I could tell that there was something in the air
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:16.760]  And there's no way to avoid air
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.760]  And indoor air is more toxic than outdoor air
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:23.760]  So the reason why we did lung cleanse was to help support
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.760]  The natural detoxification of your lungs
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  I just chose the top best ingredients
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:32.760]  Therapeutic levels
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.760]  We concentrate them in the formula
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:38.760]  And now since it's been out for a long time
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.760]  I mean you can look at the reviews
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.760]  And we have people that are using it
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.760]  For all different types of conditions
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.760]  See chemicals and toxins
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.760]  They go straight into your bloodstream when you breathe them in
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:52.760]  Whereas if they come in through the intestines
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.760]  They have to go through your liver for processing
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.760]  That's why the livers are so congested on everybody
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.760]  But this is directly into the bloodstream through the lungs
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.760]  And so when you're breathing all those chemicals in
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  I wanted to be able to produce something for everybody out there
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.760]  That they could keep their lungs clean
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.760]  And it's got a whole bunch of ingredients in it
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.760]  Especially since chemtrails are bombarding the whole world right now
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.760]  So what it does is it stimulates the mucus production in your lungs
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.760]  And usually you'll cough up a lot of that stuff and just spit it out
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.760]  But it also helps neutralize any of the chemicals or toxins you're coming in

[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:52.760]  Good brother
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.760]  Just recently started using your products
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.760]  Everything you said about them is correct
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.760]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.760]  And it's made a lot of changes in our lives here
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.760]  It's because it also funds our operation
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.760]  But doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:06.760]  Super male vitality was developed

[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.760]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals

[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.760]  Big changes, a lot of energy
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:19.760]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.760]  Energy shots
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.760]  Statement, ton of money there
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.760]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.760]  Harvested around the planet
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.760]  And then concentrated or maximum potency
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.760]  They want to stun and dumb down
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.760]  And energy drinks and stuff
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.760]  Just cover that up for a while
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.760]  But then burn you out in my experience
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:38.760]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:40.760]  Goes right to the source
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:42.760]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.760]  Visit infowarslife.com today
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.760]  To secure your super male vitality
[01:59:46.760 --> 02:00:00.760]  And other powerful products from infowarslife
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:25.760]  This article just went live on infowars.com
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:27.760]  We're going to cover it after calls
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.760]  CDC tells mothers to lay breastfeeding
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:32.760]  To enhance vaccine
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.760]  I mean your baby will lose weight
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.760]  Get brain damage if you don't get them food right away
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:38.760]  But see they know and they don't want
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:40.760]  That mother's shielding milk
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:42.760]  To give it sustenance to the brain damage
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.760]  And can't happen as bad
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.760]  For the brain that's already starved for sugar
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:48.760]  Just goes into total collapse
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.760]  I mean the savage evil
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.760]  The colostrum in the milk is the natural vaccine
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.760]  They're trying to prevent the baby
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:00.760]  From getting the natural colostrum in the breast milk
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:01.760]  That is sick
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.760]  Until five years ago as you know
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.760]  They said never give a pregnant woman a vaccine
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.760]  Because they know it could cause a miscarriage
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.760]  Or different disorders
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.760]  Now they say give them extra
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.760]  It's all about doubling down
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.760]  There's no Planned Parenthood
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:15.760]  Alex made it up
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:17.760]  They're not selling babies
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:19.760]  The Margaret Singer wasn't racist
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:20.760]  That's today
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:21.760]  Double the shots
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.760]  Double them
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:23.760]  And then your kid dies
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.760]  And it's funny
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:25.760]  They're like loving, loving
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.760]  They're like demon clowns or something
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.760]  Let's go to Patrick
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:29.760]  Then Kathy
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:30.760]  Then Bill
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.760]  Then Robert
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:32.760]  Then Spencer
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.760]  Patrick in California
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.760]  They're on the air with Dr. Edward Groot
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.760]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call guys
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:39.760]  I'm a 49 year old male
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.760]  I live in Southern California
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.760]  With a pack of a chemical
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.760]  A pesticide spill on me
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.760]  Lid popped open
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.760]  When I put the backpack on
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.760]  This happened, like I said, in 04
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.760]  So I've been dealing with like
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.760]  Chemical sensitivity
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.760]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.760]  The media says pesticides are not bad
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:00.760]  They're good for you
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:03.760]  You're not sick
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:04.760]  Yeah, exactly
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:06.760]  Why are you being racist, sir?
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:07.760]  Why are you against Obama?
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.760]  See, because anytime you bring up something real
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:10.760]  I just change the subject
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.760]  I don't act it
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.760]  I'm just teaching folks how they work
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.760]  I'm sorry, you know, obviously pesticides
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.760]  They think killed my dad's dad
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.760]  Cooper talks with basically cyanide
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:19.760]  Gave him lung cancer
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.760]  But I apologize for interrupting you
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.760]  Go ahead, tell us what you're going through
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.760]  Yeah, so I'm trying to find some ways
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:29.760]  To get the stuff out of my system
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:32.760]  I know when I exercise or do saunas
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.760]  I mean, I get pretty damn sick
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.760]  But I'm just trying to find some ways
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.760]  To get this safely out
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.760]  So can you help me, doctor?
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.760]  Yeah, when it starts coming out of his fat
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.760]  He starts getting sick
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.760]  You know, that happens as I lose weight
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:45.760]  I kind of feel like crap
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:46.760]  When I go on a 10-mile hike
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:47.760]  And lose like six pounds
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  I feel great the next day
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:49.760]  I'm kind of like, whoa
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:50.760]  And like get some zits
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:51.760]  And feel irritable
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:52.760]  What do you do?
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.760]  Believe it or not
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.760]  Water is one of the best ways to detoxify
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.760]  This is what we...
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:59.760]  Because it's clear, like a white part of...
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.760]  It's your body
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:03.760]  Every living substance is 90% water
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:04.760]  So what I recommend is
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.760]  The first thing with any type of pesticide
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.760]  Or chemical exposure like that
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:09.760]  Is liver cleansing
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.760]  I mean, what happens is the liver...
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.760]  Even though the liver regenerates itself
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.760]  Some of those pesticides
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:16.760]  Have damaged the liver cells
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.760]  When they went through into the blood
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.760]  And probably the...
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:19.760]  They deserve a home?
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:21.760]  So intestinal cleansing, gut health
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.760]  As well as liver cleansing
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:25.760]  Probably like two or three liver cleanses
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:26.760]  In a row is what we've done
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.760]  For somebody who's spilled chemicals
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:29.760]  Or toxins or pesticides
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.760]  But this deep cleanse is specifically designed
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.760]  To focus more on those environmental chemicals
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.760]  And pollutants
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:39.760]  So I would highly recommend getting some cleansing
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:40.760]  Let me ask you this question
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.760]  Wedding, again
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:44.760]  Have you done the liver cleanse yet?
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:45.760]  No, no, I haven't
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:46.760]  Well, let me just tell you
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.760]  It's spectacular for almost everyone
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.760]  I mean, we're talking on day six
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  Spewing green balls
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.760]  Yeah, yeah
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.760]  It's one of the most effective things
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:00.760]  That I've found for detoxification
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:01.760]  People don't believe it
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:02.760]  They go, I thought you were joking
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  When you were like 30, 40 green balls
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:06.760]  Come out of your gallbladder and deliver
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:07.760]  This really happens
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:08.760]  It really happens
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.760]  Yes, it does, yeah
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.760]  And then, you know
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:13.760]  We're being racist against Martian green balls
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.760]  We don't want them in our gallbladder
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.760]  We're getting rid of them
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.760]  And that's why the medical science
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.760]  And the big pharma does not want you
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.760]  To learn how to repair and create
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.760]  A healthy gut environment and have a clean liver
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:26.760]  Because every single person with any disease
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.760]  Or toxicity that we've evaluated
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.760]  You do not get any symptoms or any disease
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  Unless your liver is functioning below 50%
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.760]  Sure, I'm sorry being sarcastic
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  Taking your time up
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  I want to hold you over and come back
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.760]  And get a few more minutes with you
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:40.760]  So you can finish your question
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.760]  But here's the question when we come back
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.760]  What type of pesticide was it that got on you?
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.760]  Were you working for an exterminator service
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.760]  Or what was it?
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:49.760]  Yeah, yeah
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:52.760]  It was for a pest control company
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  Wow, I want to hear about this when we come back
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.760]  I remember
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.760]  I'll tell the story when we come back
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:00.760]  Stay with us
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.760]  Have you ever dreamt of having superpowers?
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:04.760]  Well, what if I told you
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.760]  There are real life superhumans
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:09.760]  And their DNA could be worth billions
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:11.760]  Drug companies have their eyes on people
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.760]  Like Steven Peet
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.760]  Who can put his hand on a hot stove
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.760]  Or step on glass
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.760]  And feel no pain
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:21.760]  And about 100 people share Timothy Dreyer's condition
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:23.760]  His bones are so dense
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:26.760]  He could walk away from a mangled wreck unscathed
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:28.760]  Both men's apparent superpowers
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.760]  Come from uncommon deviations in their DNA
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.760]  But rather than freakish
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:35.760]  These traits are seen as a gift from God
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.760]  To the drug companies
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:40.760]  Who want to turn them into something useful
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:42.760]  Something good for business
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:45.760]  The painkiller market alone is worth 18 billion a year
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:47.760]  So of course the industry is pressing ahead
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.760]  With research into genetic irregularities
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:53.760]  For better or worse, find out how this research
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.760]  Will change humanity forever
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:02.760]  At infowars.com
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:29.760]  Or call 888-253-3139
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:58.760]  Another major health threat
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.760]  This one in Toledo, Ohio
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.760]  Where everybody in the entire city
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.760]  Has been told not to drink the water
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:06.760]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.760]  Did you know that the average person
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:11.760]  Uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:13.760]  At home every single day
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:15.760]  If there's a water emergency
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:16.760]  Will you be prepared?
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.760]  Panicked residents forming long lines
[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:19.760]  Throughout the day
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:21.760]  Well, here at a supermarket in Toledo
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:23.760]  You can see the shelves and windows

[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:23.760]  By the way, Dr. Gertman
[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:26.760]  When I was talking to you and you joined us
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:27.760]  It reminded me
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.760]  I'll go down to the Texas coast
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:29.760]  To go deep sea fishing
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:31.760]  A couple times a year with my son
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:32.760]  And my daughters too
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:33.760]  But they like bay fishing
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.760]  Because there's all the waves
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:36.760]  And they don't get seasick
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.760]  And a lot of times when I go down there
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:39.760]  They have these trucks
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:42.760]  That drive around at like midnight
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.760]  And one time I was going down to the car
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.760]  To get something from the condo we were renting
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.760]  And here comes this truck
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:49.760]  Just spraying poison
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:51.760]  And I tried to look up what they were spraying
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.760]  And there was even an article about
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.760]  They don't have to tell because of a state contract
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.760]  And we were just discussing it during the break
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.760]  But the famous footage of DDT
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.760]  With the trucks spraying the kids
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:02.760]  And the swimming pools
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:05.760]  And the kids walking behind the cars
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:07.760]  And saying it's totally safe
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:09.760]  Just like roundup
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.760]  Well, the truth is
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.760]  The UN got it banned
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.760]  And it probably did
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.760]  And I'm killing more people because of malaria
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:18.760]  But still, it has side effects
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  Let's be honest
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:20.760]  But the new stuff
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.760]  One night I was on coast to coast A.M.
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:25.760]  Till four in the morning
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.760]  And that was back when I was stupid enough
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:29.760]  To still occasionally smoke cigarettes
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.760]  I smoked like a half pack a week probably
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:33.760]  In college maybe a pack a day
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.760]  But I smoked about a half pack a week
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:37.760]  I smoked a couple cigarettes a night
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:38.760]  Especially when I was up late
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.760]  And I was on the back porch
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:41.760]  It was like 3 a.m.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:42.760]  I got to go to sleep
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.760]  I pop a beer, 3.30, whatever
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:45.760]  I'd gone off coast to coast A.M.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:47.760]  And a sessna flies right over
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:50.760]  Like 200 feet spraying chemicals
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:51.760]  So I go in and I Google it
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:53.760]  This is like 10 years ago
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.760]  And it goes, sure enough
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.760]  There will be moth eradication
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.760]  This week in Austin
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:00.760]  But the aircraft will be flying at night
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:01.760]  So there shouldn't be any
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:02.760]  And I saw it
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  Bigger than Dallas
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.760]  Flying spray and stuff on me
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:06.760]  And it's like
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:07.760]  What are they spraying?
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:08.760]  So we were going to go back to Patrick
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.760]  He worked for a pesticide company
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:11.760]  And talk about what
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:13.760]  Just one exposure of it dumping on him did
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:15.760]  Imagine how he was breathing that every day
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  Or the little bit that got on his skin
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.760]  See, he got hit hard
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.760]  And it made him sick
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:21.760]  And he knew it
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:23.760]  But soft kill is cumulative
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.760]  So you were going to talk about that
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.760]  Well, I had a lady
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:28.760]  That came into my office
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:30.760]  About two years ago in Houston
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:31.760]  Apparently they changed up
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.760]  Or strengthened the spray
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:34.760]  The pesticide spray
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:36.760]  Because the same thing
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:37.760]  In the summertime
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:38.760]  For about three months
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.760]  About midnight
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.760]  To one o'clock in the morning
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  You'll hear the
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:43.760]  Truck coming through
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.760]  Your neighborhood spraying
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.760]  And I've been trying to get them to stop
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.760]  Of course, you know
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:49.760]  There's nothing you can do about it
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.760]  Because it's so secretive
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:53.760]  About two years ago
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:55.760]  Of someone who mixed it or whatever
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.760]  They sprayed at night
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.760]  And everybody woke up in the morning
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.760]  That had plastic mailboxes in Houston
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:02.760]  And the mailboxes were literally melted
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:04.760]  So, and it was a big deal
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:05.760]  And a bunch of people were sick
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:06.760]  And they went to the city
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:07.760]  And they said
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.760]  We want you to replace our mailboxes
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:12.760]  What in the world were you spraying
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:14.760]  That melted our mailboxes
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  And they denied it, denied it
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.760]  And they tried to get the list of ingredients
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:19.760]  And it was just a bunch of red tape
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:20.760]  And to this day
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:21.760]  We still haven't found out
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.760]  What they ended up spraying that night
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:26.760]  So we know that there's some massive
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:29.760]  Hardcore chemicals being sprayed
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:30.760]  At night
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  What can you do about that?
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:32.760]  But then we've got Patrick
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.760]  Patrick for folks that just joined us
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:35.760]  Without me interrupting
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.760]  With sick jokes
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.760]  And I apologize
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:38.760]  That's how I coped them
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:39.760]  This gives me really upset
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:40.760]  Either blow up
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:41.760]  Or I make jokes
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.760]  And I apologize for that
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:45.760]  But talk about what happened to you specifically
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.760]  Go ahead
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:48.760]  Yeah, Alex
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.760]  I was a pest control applicator
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:52.760]  I was working for a company
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:55.760]  And basically I put the backpack
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.760]  Of the chemical up onto the
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.760]  You know, you have the sprayer
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.760]  And you put on the lip of the truck
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:01.760]  And then when I was, you know,
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.760]  Popping it on my back
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:07.760]  You know, the liquid popped open the lid
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.760]  And basically soaked into my back
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.760]  Of my shirt
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.760]  I mean, it really doused me
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  And immediately I developed
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:15.760]  Chemical sensitivity
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.760]  I didn't know it at the time
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  But I felt like I was in, like, a fog
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:19.760]  You know
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:21.760]  And, you know, the following day
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]  I came back out to spray
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:23.760]  And I'm like, Dan
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.760]  Why do I feel like I have the flu
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  Every time I'm breathing this in
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.760]  I went to the co-workers
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.760]  And I was like, do you guys feel sick
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:31.760]  When you spray this thing?
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.760]  Oh, no
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.760]  So I didn't realize I was already injured
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:35.760]  Oh, yeah, that's the thing
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.760]  You're a conspiracy theorist
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:40.760]  When you get sick from it
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.760]  Yeah, exactly
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:42.760]  Did they ever tell you
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.760]  Did you ever know exactly what chemicals
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.760]  That you were spraying?
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:48.760]  Yeah, yeah, I do
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  It was a chemical called fibrinol
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.760]  They used a lot in the dog collars
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:56.760]  I found out
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.760]  And when I looked up the MSDS
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:02.760]  It showed that it does cost drastic alterations
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:03.760]  And testosterone
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:05.760]  And also thyroid tumors
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  And I'm dealing with some nodules in my thyroid right now
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:09.760]  Oh
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:11.760]  Well, that's another good reason to be on the X, too
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:14.760]  You know, any type of thyroid conditions
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:18.760]  Whether it's Hashimoto's, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:21.760]  Usually is linked to an iodine deficiency
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:24.760]  Although we do highly recommend you check with your
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  Qualified healthcare practitioner
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.760]  To get an evaluation done
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.760]  So, Patrick, thanks for the call
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.760]  You want to move on to...
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:34.760]  Absolutely
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:35.760]  An informative caller
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  But notice he got a big dose so it hit him
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:38.760]  He knew it did it
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:39.760]  But the little dose
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.760]  He just slowly eased into the fog
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  And that was the story I was going to tell
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.760]  I didn't know he was about to do that
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.760]  One time
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  Because I have a cousin who was
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:52.760]  He finally got out of the army after 35 years
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.760]  He's an older cousin
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:59.760]  And there were a few times where
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.760]  Well, I was working with him
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  But also his brother
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.760]  My other cousin
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:05.760]  And they would just go out for extra money
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  And do termite stuff
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  And so my grandma would just say
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.760]  When I was down there for a few weeks during the summer
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.760]  I was like, Tim, when this happened
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  Hey, go work with them, you know
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.760]  Because they sent me to all different types of jobs
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  Just to get experience
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:22.760]  And I remember going under houses with him
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:23.760]  Spraying
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  Doing three or four houses
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:25.760]  Going and getting lunch
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.760]  And just being high
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:27.760]  Even though I was wearing a mask
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.760]  High at the Dairy Queen
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:30.760]  Eating a hamburger
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:33.760]  After I'd gone and just done a few houses
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:35.760]  And it was just so clear
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:37.760]  That I was high off the poison
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  And that's just what he was just saying
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:40.760]  He spilt it on himself
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:42.760]  And it was just in a daze
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:44.760]  And that's what the general public's like
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:47.760]  We're stunned in a daze, Dr. Group
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.760]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:51.760]  And that's why we're here
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.760]  Giving out solutions
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:54.760]  Let's talk to Kathy in Michigan
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:56.760]  You're on the air
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.760]  Hello?
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:58.760]  Yes, go ahead, Kathy
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:00.760]  Yes, hi, Dr.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.760]  I noticed it's been a couple of weeks
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.760]  Mostly on my husband's side
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:06.760]  On our sheets
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  It's been staining with like a blueish gray color
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  And it's like from the upper torso
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.760]  And the lower torso
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.760]  And I just changed the sheets a little while ago
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:20.760]  And I noticed my second sheets are ruined
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.760]  So you're saying blue is coming out of your husband
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  Yes, it's like a blueish gray color
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.760]  On his side of the sheets
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.760]  And I noticed his white t-shirts have been missing
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  I noticed that yesterday
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:36.760]  And he's been wearing these beige t-shirts to bed
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  And even I see a little bit coming on his armpit
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:40.760]  Of the color
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  And I just wonder
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.760]  Dr. Group, do you have any idea what that could be?
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:45.760]  Well, it could be a multitude of things
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:46.760]  I don't know if he's changed
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  And he's using a new type
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.760]  If he's using a body lotion, for example
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.760]  That can mix with different chemicals and sweat
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:53.760]  And cause different colors
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.760]  If he's doing a different type of deodorant
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.760]  I mean, the first thing I would look at is
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.760]  Is he putting anything on his skin
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:02.760]  That's reacting with his sweat
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.760]  That's maybe changing colors
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:05.760]  Or maybe it's a new detergent
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:06.760]  That's reacting with his skin
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:07.760]  A new detergent
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  I would look at the environmental factors
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:13.760]  And then see what's changed around that time
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:14.760]  Before if he wasn't
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:15.760]  If you weren't noticing that before
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:17.760]  And you're noticing it now
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.760]  There's something that he's doing
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  Or that he's exposing himself to
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  That needs to be looked at
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:24.760]  Because I'm glad you're noticing that
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.760]  A lot of people don't pay attention to that
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:27.760]  Well, if you asked him
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:28.760]  You say he's wearing a Bay shirt now
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:30.760]  Was he trying to cover this up?
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.760]  I tell you, I'm going to ask him today
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.760]  And also, he works with a lot of chemicals at GM
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:38.760]  And he does a lot of roundup
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:40.760]  Around our property in the country
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:43.760]  And also, he uses what was called iron out
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.760]  And I said, get this out of the house
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  I can't stand that smell
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  To take the stains out of our sinks
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:50.760]  And our bathtub
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:52.760]  He only put a mask on when he does that
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:54.760]  Well, I notice a lot of chemical people
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:55.760]  Are actually like
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  They don't know they're like Huffers
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:58.760]  But they are
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:16:59.760]  And they're all into more chemicals
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.760]  And they just
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:01.760]  And then they pour them everywhere
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:02.760]  And they mess with them
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:04.760]  And they're basically bombed out of their brains
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:05.760]  Yeah, I would highly suggest
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:07.760]  That you pull up some information
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  You can type any glyphosate
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:11.760]  Or any of that in Info Wars
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:12.760]  A search bar
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:13.760]  And pull up a lot of information
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.760]  Yeah, their PR guy kept saying
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:16.760]  I'll drink it, I'll drink it
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:17.760]  So they go, drink it
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.760]  And he goes, no way
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:19.760]  You're right
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.760]  I mean, the thing is
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:22.760]  Especially with glyphosate
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  It's parts per billion
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.760]  That can affect you
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.760]  And work as an endocrine-disrupting chemical
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  It's not like you need to drink it
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  Yeah, and if you want to grow giant tumors
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:30.760]  Knock yourself out
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:31.760]  Well, God bless you, man
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:32.760]  Appreciate your call
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:33.760]  Bill, and make sure
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.760]  You definitely have them detoxify
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:36.760]  Absolutely
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.760]  But if you have a lot of pesticide exposure
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.760]  It might not feel too good, right?
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.760]  No, you might go through some sort of reactions
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:43.760]  As a matter of fact
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.760]  I mean, when you start pulling
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:45.760]  All these things out of your system
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:47.760]  You might feel worse
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:49.760]  For the first two, three, four days
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:51.760]  Before your body starts to...
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.760]  Well, you said two to three weeks
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:53.760]  For the iodine
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:54.760]  But you're saying this may be the first...
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:55.760]  Well, for the iodine
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:57.760]  You're talking about pulling deep bromines
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  And chlorine fluorides
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:17:59.760]  So this is three, four days, though
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  That, it just depends on
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:02.760]  How many chemicals and toxins everybody has
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:03.760]  The thing is
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:04.760]  You can't predict
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:05.760]  Everybody's different
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:06.760]  Sure, Bill and Michigan
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:07.760]  You're on the air
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.760]  Go ahead
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:09.760]  Hi, guys
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:11.760]  God bless you both
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:13.760]  I want to start with you, Alex
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:15.760]  So far, my gut tells me you're a good guy
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:17.760]  Not a bad guy like some people
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:18.760]  Pushing on YouTube
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  Sorry for my voice
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:22.760]  I went to the Deskelunds concert last night
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:25.760]  Now, I pray my gut is correct
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  Because I've gone all in with infowars
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:28.760]  I'm committed to it
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:29.760]  Well, thank you, brother
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:30.760]  I'm playing it
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:33.760]  I buy everything
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:34.760]  Well, we couldn't do it without you
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:35.760]  It's hard to fund this operation
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:37.760]  That's why every few weeks
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:39.760]  We, you know, kind of fund things here
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:41.760]  But absolutely, sir
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:42.760]  I mean, I'm all in
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.760]  Don't just believe me
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:45.760]  Trust but verify
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  The world government's unfolding
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.760]  In front of everybody
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:49.760]  I mean, the Pope
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.760]  Just called for world government
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:52.760]  Checking it all out
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:55.760]  And so I got to trust my gut on this one
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:58.760]  Also, Alex, my license plate says
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:00.760]  Infowar
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.760]  Well, God bless you, brother
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:03.760]  Thank you
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.760]  Okay, so, Dr. Groot
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:07.760]  I'm a 52-year-old white male
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:09.760]  Fruit-carrying
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.760]  Which he'll call bladder
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.760]  And my drink mix
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:17.760]  That I take every day is
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  It fills up a quart jar
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.760]  Got orange juice
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  Eight drops of X2
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  Two straws of secret 12
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.760]  Two straws of D3
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:31.760]  A scoop of one-world-way
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.760]  About a half an ounce of
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.760]  Hydrocell silver
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.760]  Am I messing myself up with this thing?
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.760]  Well, first of all, it's very rare
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:46.760]  To hear from a fruitarian
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.760]  So congratulations on that
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.760]  No, you're not
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  I mean, even fruitarians
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.760]  Should you take silver every day?
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:55.760]  You can if you want
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:57.760]  It's definitely not going to harm you
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:19:59.760]  And I just take it when everybody's got
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:01.760]  Really bad bacterial infections around me
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:02.760]  Well, the thing is
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.760]  We're exposed to different types of microorganisms
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:05.760]  Every single day
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.760]  And that's why, you know, I guess
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.760]  We'll talk about now
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:10.760]  Launching a product here
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:12.760]  Another exclusive product on InfoWars2
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:14.760]  That is going to be addressing
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:16.760]  The parasites and the harmful organisms
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:17.760]  In the body
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:18.760]  Which is probably going to be
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:20.760]  Then we'll have the full spectrum
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:21.760]  Of everything everybody needs
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:22.760]  But yes, we're exposed
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.760]  Doesn't matter if you're, you know
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.760]  Drinking juicing, a raw vegan
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:27.760]  We're exposed to these things
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:28.760]  Every single day
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:30.760]  So usually I like to try to give
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:31.760]  The body a chance
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.760]  The self-healing mechanism
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:33.760]  To try to work on its own
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:36.760]  So I'll try to take things one day
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:37.760]  And then give the body a day rest
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:39.760]  And then take things the other day
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.760]  So you can kind of balance out
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.760]  Your schedule
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:44.760]  Yeah, I mean, don't you
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.760]  Gave for yourself what feels better?
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:48.760]  Ultimately, yes
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:49.760]  I mean, ultimately we are
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:51.760]  Our own physician, our own doctors
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:53.760]  Just that we're never trained
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:54.760]  I mean, really what should happen
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:55.760]  In every single school
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:57.760]  When children start going to school
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.760]  Is there should be classes on
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:01.760]  Teaching the children how to be
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.760]  Their own physician
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:03.760]  And how to reactivate their body
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:04.760]  Well, what makes sense to me
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:05.760]  Is they ought to be learning
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.760]  How to wash dishes, do laundry
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:09.760]  Be polite, basic stuff
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:11.760]  How to grow food
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.760]  And then reading, writing, arithmetic
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:14.760]  And just how to be good humans
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:15.760]  Instead, they just teach them
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:18.760]  How to be a bunch of ninnying, screwed up
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:19.760]  People fighting with each other
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:20.760]  In peer pressure
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.760]  Winers and complainers
[02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:25.760]  Is what is really what we have today
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:26.760]  Is just a bunch of whining
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:29.760]  And complaining toxic sick children
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:31.760]  That are living on high fructose corn syrup
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:33.760]  And artificial colors and artificial stuff
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.760]  Sure, God bless you, Bill
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.760]  I want to say something to your support
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.760]  I want to say something to Bill
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:40.760]  I don't respond to the internet detractors
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.760]  That make up everything under the sun
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:43.760]  To hear about us
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:44.760]  We work for the Vatican
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.760]  But we expose what the Vatican is doing
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:48.760]  Or we work for Israel
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.760]  Just because we don't want to blow Israel up
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.760]  Or this is how people make themselves
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:53.760]  Feel big
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:54.760]  Is looking at us
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.760]  That have built something unique
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:57.760]  With your help
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:58.760]  To try to fight the globalist
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.760]  We're having some success
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.760]  We try to support other activists
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:05.760]  And other people to fight the New World Order
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.760]  We're all in this together
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:10.760]  And so when people are attacking us
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:11.760]  Ask yourself this
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:13.760]  Are they giving any solutions?
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:15.760]  Are they spending 95% of their time
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:16.760]  Fighting the New World Order
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.760]  Warning people about dangers of vaccines
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:19.760]  GMO
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:20.760]  Trying to get fluoride out
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:22.760]  Trying to stop the gun confiscation
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.760]  Trying to control our open borders
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:26.760]  Or do they just spend their time all day
[02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.760]  Going, this person's bad
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:28.760]  That person's bad
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.760]  This person isn't perfect
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:30.760]  You know, I know who's bad
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:31.760]  The globalist
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:33.760]  I know who's taken over
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:34.760]  I know their names
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:35.760]  I expose them
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:36.760]  I go up against real people
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:37.760]  I don't sit here
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:39.760]  And it's admitted Cass Sunstein
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:40.760]  It goes back to the Clintons
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:42.760]  How they would finance groups
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.760]  To start in fighting
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.760]  And then get other people
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:45.760]  On the bandwagon
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:47.760]  And a snowball effect
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:49.760]  To then repeat it
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:50.760]  To where our whole movement
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.760]  Is a bunch of people fighting with each other
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:53.760]  The good news is
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:54.760]  We've been transcending that
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:56.760]  As the New World Order gets out in the open
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.760]  People don't want to hear that anymore
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:22:59.760]  They're done
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:01.760]  Okay, so here's the deal
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:02.760]  Don't trust me
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:03.760]  Trust yourself
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:04.760]  World government's here
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.760]  It's tyrannical
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.760]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:07.760]  I mean, we're open
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.760]  I've got a 20-year track record
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:10.760]  I don't need to defend myself
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  I'm actually ashamed of myself
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:13.760]  I'll be honest with you
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:14.760]  The amount of power I have
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.760]  The amount of people that listen
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:19.760]  It's humbling to have people call in
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:21.760]  Who are smart and eloquent and caring
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:22.760]  And to be counting on me
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.760]  I'm sick of everybody having to count on me
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:26.760]  And I'm not mad or complaining
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:28.760]  It's just that I'm a responsible person
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:29.760]  That has three children
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:31.760]  And a whole operation to run
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:32.760]  And I get mad at myself
[02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:33.760]  And I act like a jerk
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.760]  I get mad at myself when I blow up
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:39.760]  I get mad at myself when I get frustrated
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:40.760]  But that's why people listen
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:42.760]  Because they know it's real
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:43.760]  But that's what it comes down to
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:45.760]  And I'm not mad that I get lied about
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.760]  And attacked by people
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:48.760]  In the so-called Liberty Movement
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:50.760]  They're mentally ill losers
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.760]  Or they're being government financed
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.760]  Okay, I've got other bigger enemies
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:55.760]  Coming after me
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.760]  I've got to deal with that are life-threatening
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:23:59.760]  Now, that's separately
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.760]  Then you have White House run outlets
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.760]  Saying, I'm lying about this
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:04.760]  I'm lying about that
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.760]  I want to kill police
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:06.760]  I'm a racist
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:07.760]  To set me up
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:08.760]  And you know what?
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.760]  I expect that
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:11.760]  I expect to be attacked
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:12.760]  Because I'm having an effect
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:15.760]  I'm in a death battle
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:16.760]  In an information war
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:17.760]  With the globalist
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.760]  I believe what I say
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:20.760]  Because it's true
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:21.760]  And we're effective
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.760]  And we're here to break people out of their trance
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:24.760]  So I love it
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:25.760]  Everybody attack me
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:26.760]  Bring it on
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:27.760]  I'm committed
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:28.760]  That's what gives me my energy
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.760]  I'm never going to stop
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.760]  Understand that
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:33.760]  You'll have to face your creator, though
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:34.760]  On the day of judgment
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:35.760]  For what you've done
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:36.760]  People out there that lie all day
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:38.760]  Instead of warning innocents
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:39.760]  Instead of helping people
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:40.760]  You spend all day
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:41.760]  Up there on your high horse
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:42.760]  With how great you are
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.760]  We would have already defeated the globalist
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:45.760]  And we didn't buy into all this
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:48.760]  Backbiting and infighting and behavior
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:49.760]  Dr. Group, I'm ranting
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.760]  Sorry, anything to say on that subject?
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:53.760]  No, not really
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:54.760]  Let's go to Robert
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:56.760]  Let's go to Robert in Missouri
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:57.760]  You're on the air
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:58.760]  Go ahead
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:24:59.760]  Hey, Mr. Jones
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:00.760]  How are you?
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:01.760]  Good, brother
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.760]  Thanks for holding
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  Oh, no problem
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:05.760]  I was excited to speak with you
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:06.760]  I was
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  I just love it
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:08.760]  When you turn your show
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:10.760]  Into just a big infomercial
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:12.760]  When you have this hippie doctor on
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:15.760]  You guys try to sell all your snake oil
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:16.760]  Exactly
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:18.760]  Did we screen your phone call?
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:19.760]  Yeah
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:21.760]  But I was able to get around it
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:23.760]  Okay, so you just lied
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:25.760]  Judges, we don't screen phone calls
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:27.760]  We ask, where you're calling from
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:28.760]  What your name is
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.760]  If you volunteer
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.760]  How you're listening
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:31.760]  Or what you want to cover
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  It helps us
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.760]  So you said to add the added layer of BS
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:37.760]  That we don't allow people on
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:38.760]  That disagree with us
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:40.760]  Well, I mean, that's just
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:42.760]  First of all, he doesn't even know
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:43.760]  He's calling me a snake oil
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.760]  But the thing is
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760]  Listen, let's stop right there
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:46.760]  If you open up Time Magazine
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.760]  It's full of vitamin ads
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:49.760]  And we know ours are better
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  It's okay for me to sell fund
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:53.760]  Is it more moral for MPR
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.760]  To get $400-plus million
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  Of taxpayer money
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:57.760]  And then be funded by
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  The Rockefeller Foundation
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.760]  Or is it more moral for me
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.760]  To sell high-quality products
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.760]  That I believe in
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:04.760]  That people through free will can buy
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.760]  How is it dirty in your inverted world
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:09.760]  For Planned Parenthood to sell baby organs
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.760]  So they can get Lamborghinis
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:13.760]  But it's bad if I sell high-quality
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:15.760]  Methylcobalamin vitamin B12
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:17.760]  How is that bad?
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:19.760]  Go ahead
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:21.760]  Well, first of all, they're not selling
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:23.760]  Like, aborted baby parts
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:24.760]  Like, dull parts
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:26.760]  They're selling tissue for research
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:28.760]  So you can just stop that right there
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:29.760]  There you go
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:30.760]  This is a seminar caller
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:31.760]  Right off the bat
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:36.760]  Secondly, you've blown the entire
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:37.760]  Situation out of proportion
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.760]  And made that whole thing
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:40.760]  Into something that it never was
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  In the first place
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:42.760]  We've already had this discussion
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.760]  About abortion
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:44.760]  Let me guess
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:46.760]  Do you agree with the White House run
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:48.760]  Salon
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:52.760]  That Margaret Sanger was not a racist?
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.760]  I don't think so, sir
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.760]  How could she possibly be a racist
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:00.760]  If she's in charge of a great organization
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  Like Planned Parenthood?
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:04.760]  I mean, it's better to be in charge
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:06.760]  Of an organization like Planned Parenthood
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:08.760]  Than one that sends Joe Biggs
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.760]  Down south to Mexico all the time
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:11.760]  I don't know
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:13.760]  He must have some sort of actual
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  Fascination with like donkey shows
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:16.760]  Or something
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:18.760]  I think that's why you're sending him down there
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:20.760]  But I was also wondering
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:21.760]  If there's any sort of snake oil
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:22.760]  That you can sell me
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:24.760]  To cure my homosexuality
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.760]  Okay, okay
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:26.760]  Listen, listen
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:27.760]  If you got a serious point
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:30.760]  Or you got a problem with one of the products
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:31.760]  You know, we didn't get
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:33.760]  Two billion dollars of stimulus money
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  Like NBC to give Rachel Maddow a raise
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:38.760]  Okay, I don't get taxpayer money
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:39.760]  I'm proud of what I do
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:41.760]  And I'm done talking to you
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  We got serious questions
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  You got any comeback to that?
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:45.760]  No, I mean obviously
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:46.760]  He hasn't done his research
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:47.760]  Because if he does
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.760]  He'll know that we're just
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:49.760]  Involved to help people
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.760]  And we're teaching people
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:51.760]  How to reactivate their body
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.760]  Self-healing mechanism
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.760]  I mean, like you take this
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:55.760]  And blow your socks off
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:57.760]  To causing cancer
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:58.760]  Causing disease
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:00.760]  I mean, it's not rocket science
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:01.760]  I mean, I'm not trying to sell
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.760]  We're not trying to sell anybody's
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  Well, of course we're trying
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.760]  To make money
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:05.760]  We got to fund our operation
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  And we sell high quality products
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:07.760]  But we're saving
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:08.760]  Since when is that bad?
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:09.760]  I mean, it's just
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.760]  It's upside down world
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:12.760]  Why is he even listening
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:13.760]  To the show anyway?
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:14.760]  I mean, has he tried
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.760]  Any of the products?
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:17.760]  Yeah, go take your vaccines, punk
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  Okay?
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:19.760]  Next call
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:20.760]  Go break your fluoride
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:21.760]  Spencer in Washington
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.760]  You're on the air
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:23.760]  Go ahead
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:26.760]  Hey, thanks for taking my call
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.760]  Alex, Dr. Group
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:30.760]  That last caller was baffling
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:34.760]  So just a quick background
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:37.760]  I'm a 35-year-old white male
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  12-year Army veteran
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:41.760]  With a 90% disability
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  Last year in February
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]  I had a mini-stroke
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  A trans-eschemic attack
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:49.760]  When I went down to the VA hospital
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:51.760]  They did MRIs and CTs
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:53.760]  And all that kind of stuff
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:54.760]  And they found something
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:56.760]  Growing on my thyroid
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  And now it's been about
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  A year-long battle
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:01.760]  Trying to get seen
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:02.760]  By the VA
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.760]  To find out what's going on
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:06.760]  Oh, yeah, they're putting you
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.760]  On a don't treat list to kill you
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.760]  I bet that makes you a little angry
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:12.760]  It makes me very angry
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:14.760]  I'm an out-listener to your show
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:16.760]  And anybody that doesn't believe
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  In the VA don't treat list
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.760]  You need to pull their head out of the fan
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.760]  God, brother, stay there
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:24.760]  We got Joe Biggs coming in
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:25.760]  But I want to just...
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.760]  I'm going to have you for a few more minutes
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:28.760]  A few more calls
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:29.760]  Then we'll play a clip or something
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.760]  And then get them in here
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  But I want to be able to finish up
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  With Chris and Spencer and a few others
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  It makes me sick
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.760]  They admittedly have a computer
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.760]  That decides not to treat them
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:40.760]  And they can just go in
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:41.760]  And snip that cancer out
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.760]  Or whatever it is
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:43.760]  And they won't do it
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.760]  But that's moral, though
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  Shelling something
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.760]  That makes your thyroid healthy
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  That's immoral
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  We're on the march
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:53.760]  The Empire's on the run
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:30:20.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:26.760]  These mandates will be expensive new additions
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:27.760]  For your safety
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:28.760]  Just like the safety systems
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.760]  That allow hackers to turn off the steering
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:31.760]  Turn off the brakes
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.760]  Accelerate the Jeep
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:34.760]  And drive it into a ditch
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:35.760]  Mainstream media scoffed
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.760]  When we talked at length
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:37.760]  About hacking a vehicle
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:38.760]  In conjunction with a car bomb
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:40.760]  To make it look like reckless driving
[02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:41.760]  When Michael Hastings was killed
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:43.760]  Two years ago
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:45.760]  They will rarely use this new technology
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:47.760]  To take someone's life
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:50.760]  But it is designed to take your liberty
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.760]  If you want to know the implications
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:53.760]  Of this dangerous new control grid
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.760]  Being superimposed on your life
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:57.760]  Go to Infowars.com
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:26.760]  I'm David Knight
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.760]  Alex Jones here
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:31.760]  For the last two years
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:33.760]  I've been working with top doctors
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:34.760]  Nutritionist and chemist
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:37.760]  To design a nutraceutical formulation
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:39.760]  That has truly life changing health benefits
[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:41.760]  Introducing the all new
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.760]  Ancient defense herbal immunity blend
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:45.760]  Experience the benefits
[02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:47.760]  Of combining over 14 ancient herbs
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:48.760]  And extracts
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:50.760]  With exciting new advances
[02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:51.760]  In nutraceutical science
[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:53.760]  Visit InfowarsLife.com
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.760]  Or call 1-888-253-3139
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:59.760]  That's InfowarsLife.com
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:19.760]  We now take you live
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:21.760]  To the Central Texas Command Center
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:24.760]  And the heart of the resistance
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:26.760]  Alright, I got Joe Biggs
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:28.760]  And Josh Jones coming in here
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:30.760]  Because there is a war on
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:31.760]  For your mind
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:32.760]  That's right, the Alex Jones show
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.760]  There's a war on for your mind
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:37.760]  They're gonna be coming in studio
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:39.760]  We're gonna re-air that video
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.760]  And breakdown of the drug veals
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:42.760]  Pouring in across the border
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:43.760]  Some of the most powerful footage
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  Ever shot of this happening
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:47.760]  And of course they were down there
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.760]  To cover Donald Trump
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:49.760]  That was supposed to get down there
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:50.760]  Yesterday and today
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:52.760]  Now he's going down to Laredo
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:54.760]  In the south Texas border
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.760]  Region of the Rio Grande on Saturday
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:33:58.760]  And if Biggs wants to go back down
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  He's welcome to
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:00.760]  I'm not gonna make him work on the weekend
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:01.760]  But he's a go-getter
[02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:02.760]  He likes to work hard
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:03.760]  So does Josh Jones
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:04.760]  So does all of our reporters
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:06.760]  But Biggs comes through
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:08.760]  Almost all the time
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:10.760]  He has that luck
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:12.760]  You know, I have that too
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:13.760]  When I go out and do a report
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:15.760]  Just weird stuff starts happening
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.760]  I guess God just puts us
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:17.760]  At the right place at the right time
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:19.760]  Or it's so bad down there
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:20.760]  It's just ubiquitous
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:22.760]  But I want to cram in a few final calls
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:24.760]  Here for Dr. Group
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  Since that caller was following
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.760]  His White House talking point
[02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:30.760]  That's been put out by Media Matters
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:31.760]  Rachel Madd Allen told
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  I've seen it twice
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:34.760]  But three times the last month
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:35.760]  Has made fun of us
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:36.760]  For supermail vitality
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.760]  By the way, it was selling good
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.760]  But as soon as she did that
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.760]  Her audience isn't that big
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  But I guess her audience though
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.760]  That was there did go check it out
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:47.760]  It's kind of like you attack
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:48.760]  Donald Trump as numbers go up
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.760]  We sold out real quick
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:51.760]  So thank you Rachel Maddow
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.760]  You said it's horrible
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.760]  And we're bad
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.760]  And it's sold out
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  But Deep Cleanse is here
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.760]  Known concentrated herbs
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  To help pull out toxins out of the body
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:03.760]  And multi years in the making
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:05.760]  Now available in FullWarsLife.com
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:07.760]  And so thank you for calling in
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.760]  And saying I'm a con artist
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:10.760]  And evil and bad
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:11.760]  I'm very proud of myself
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:13.760]  I'm very proud of the work I've done
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:15.760]  I'm proud that our reporters continue
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:17.760]  Whether it's Jakari Jackson
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:18.760]  Or Leanne McAdoo
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.760]  Or John Bown
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:21.760]  Or just all of them
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  Kit Daniels
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:23.760]  And Don Salazar
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:24.760]  Mikhail Phelan
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:26.760]  The list goes on and on
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:27.760]  Just wonderful people
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:29.760]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.760]  We've got an incredible team here
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  That makes national news
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  On important issues every day now
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:36.760]  And sometimes the top story
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:38.760]  Every month or so worldwide is us
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:39.760]  And we're affecting change
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:40.760]  And we're proud of it
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  And we're proud of what we've done
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:44.760]  And so spit on us all you want
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.760]  We love it
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:46.760]  We know we're doing the right thing
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:48.760]  I'm sorry, Dr. Griff, I'm ranting
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:50.760]  No, that's okay
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  Let's go to
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  Let's finish up with that last caller
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:54.760]  Absolutely
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:56.760]  We're talking to Spencer in Washington
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:58.760]  About thyroid issues
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:00.760]  Army veteran
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:02.760]  And has thyroid problems
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:04.760]  And has lumps on his thyroid
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:06.760]  And they won't give him treatment
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  Spencer, please continue
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:10.760]  Well, so
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  The entire thing about it is
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:14.760]  I went to the Mount Vernon Clinic
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.760]  In Washington and they told me
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:18.760]  That they're not accepting new patients
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.760]  And that I needed to call
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:22.760]  The Veterans Choice Program
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:24.760]  Which is entirely not related
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:26.760]  To the VA at all
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:28.760]  And I got the run around for
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:30.760]  It's going on a year now
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:32.760]  So my question for Dr. Group is
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:35.760]  Is what homeopathic remedies can I do
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:38.760]  Until I actually, if ever
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:40.760]  Get in to get looked at
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:42.760]  Spencer, you know, it's
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  You worked at the VA
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:46.760]  I actually did my internship
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  At the VA hospital in rheumatology
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:50.760]  And it was horrifying
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:51.760]  What I saw
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:52.760]  And now it's worse
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:54.760]  And hey, I'm a veteran
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:56.760]  I would never go to the VA hospital
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  I almost got kicked out of the program
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:00.760]  Because I was trying to help people
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:02.760]  And I was bucking the system
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:04.760]  I almost lost my internship
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:06.760]  You will not get help
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  From the VA
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.760]  The VA is going to give you the run around
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:12.760]  And you're going to be in the system
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:14.760]  And even if you do get to the VA
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.760]  They're going to prescribe you toxic medications
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:18.760]  Which are not going to help your thyroid
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  But something's changed
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:22.760]  Now they're just turning away almost everybody
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:24.760]  And just keep saying don't have your file
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:26.760]  Don't have your file, big's one of their like 15 times
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:28.760]  It's happening to almost everybody now
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:30.760]  Unless you were a little bootlicker globalist
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:32.760]  Suddenly you get all the care
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  Right, it's really sad because
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:36.760]  We talk to military personnel all the time
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.760]  And we try to help them as much as we can
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:40.760]  A lot of them are dealing
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  They're already on medications
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:44.760]  When they come out of the military
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  Usually anti-psychotics
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:48.760]  Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:50.760]  Drugs for PTSD
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:52.760]  They put them on those medications
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  Again, what I think is to help
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  Control guns in the future
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:58.760]  But also to
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  Be able to label them as being mentally ill
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:02.760]  There's only one way
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:04.760]  Unfortunately that you can
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  Help yourself and that is to
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:08.760]  Help yourself and cleansing
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  You know cleansing your liver
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:12.760]  With a liver shield
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:14.760]  Iodine is highly effective
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:16.760]  At balancing out the thyroid
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:18.760]  You know we
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  People's responses
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.760]  And results do not lie
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:24.760]  That's why InfoWars
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:26.760]  Life has a third party
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  Review system
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:30.760]  You can go read thousands of
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:32.760]  Reviews, I mean that in itself
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:34.760]  Should show you that what we're doing is right
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  And what we're doing is effective
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.760]  I highly recommend
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:40.760]  That you start cleansing your body
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.760]  Starting with your intestines
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.760]  Then moving on to your liver
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.760]  And then using some of the products like Deep Cleanse
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.760]  The X2
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:50.760]  And for that matter the majority
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.760]  As many InfoWars Life products as you can
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:54.760]  Because that's addressing the root cause
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:56.760]  Drinking more water
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:58.760]  I just had an idea
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:00.760]  This is liquid and it's better
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:02.760]  We can come out with like a multivitamin mineral syrup
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:04.760]  That has all the most powerful stuff
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:06.760]  If it doesn't have counter effects
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:08.760]  And call it snake oil
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:10.760]  84 different
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:12.760]  You have it Deep Cleanse
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.760]  There's 84 different minerals and vitamins
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.760]  And amino acids
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.760]  I'm proud of that name
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.760]  I'm telling you what a lot of the snake oil actually works
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:22.760]  What they determine as snake oil
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.760]  Has better
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:26.760]  Efficacy than any pharmaceutical
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:28.760]  As a matter of fact any pharmaceutical is just going to cause
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:30.760]  Liver toxicity
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:32.760]  And more chemical toxicity
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  Within your body
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.760]  It's just ridiculous
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  It's just a big pharma that wants to demonize anything else out there
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.760]  Is there bad stuff out there? Yes
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:42.760]  Is there great stuff out there? Yes
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:44.760]  They just want to say no we're the only game in town
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:46.760]  Well God bless you Spencer
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  Sorry to hear about that situation
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:50.760]  But I've had dramatic effects
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.760]  More water
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:54.760]  More exercise
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:56.760]  Everything you were talking about
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:58.760]  There are cost effective ways
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  And that's increasing your exercise
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:02.760]  Increasing your sweating
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:04.760]  Drinking tons of water and eliminating all the chemicals
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:06.760]  And toxins that you're taking in your environment
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:08.760]  I got to get Joe Biggs and Josh Owens in here
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:10.760]  So I'm going to give each caller one minute
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:12.760]  Chris in mass you're on the air
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:14.760]  Go ahead thanks for holding
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:16.760]  Hello guys how are you? Good brother go ahead
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.760]  Good so
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.760]  I just, Dr. Group I wanted to tell you
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:22.760]  A story about
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.760]  About eight years ago
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:26.760]  Somehow I got contracted with Giardia
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:28.760]  And
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:30.760]  You know
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:32.760]  Obviously it was a parasite had to
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:34.760]  Go through a course of antibiotics
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:36.760]  And after I went through that
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.760]  It got rid of the Giardia but it really
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.760]  Screwed up my stomach pretty good
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:42.760]  And went through a whole
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  Couple of years of
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:46.760]  You know getting heartburn all the time
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  After that and
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:50.760]  Kind of figured out on my own how to
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:52.760]  Treat myself as far as getting off
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:54.760]  Like the products like ran it to Dean
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:56.760]  And all that type of stuff and
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:58.760]  Started taking
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.760]  You know enzymes and probiotics
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:02.760]  And basically cured
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:04.760]  Cured the
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.760]  Gastro reflux disease on my own
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:08.760]  But
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:10.760]  Excuse me so
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  Recently I noticed that I was getting
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:14.760]  The signs of Giardia again
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:16.760]  So I did the research
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:18.760]  On my own and found
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.760]  Your product paratrex
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.760]  From Global Healing Center
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  And went through a whole course of that
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:26.760]  And it completely
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  Cured all the symptoms
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:30.760]  Of what I thought was coming back
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  Again so I just wanted to tell you
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:34.760]  Thank you for coming out with that product
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  He set the private label
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:38.760]  That for InfoWarsLife.com
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:40.760]  It's in the works right now
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:42.760]  It's going to be called Paraclens
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:44.760]  And we're going to do a big show about
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:46.760]  That we haven't talked much about the attack
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:48.760]  Of the microorganisms that we're facing
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:50.760]  Every single day and how every single person
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:52.760]  Out there has
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:54.760]  An overgrowth of microorganisms
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:56.760]  Harmful ones, fungus
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:58.760]  Bacteria, viruses, yeast
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:00.760]  Candida
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:02.760]  And mold actually
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:04.760]  So we're going to be doing a whole segment on that
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:06.760]  We're going to be launching that Paraclens product
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  Because every single person
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  Very exciting, thank you so much
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.760]  Denise in Illinois, thanks for calling
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  You're on the air with Dr. Group
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  Yeah, hi guys
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.760]  Send me some more of that snake oil
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:20.760]  Vitamin B12
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:22.760]  Yeah, we're not even promoting that
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:24.760]  And it's like one of the best sellers now
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:26.760]  Word of mouth
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  It's amazing, it really is
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:30.760]  I take it practically every day
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  Yeah, I've tried everything
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:34.760]  I have multiple sclerosis
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  I've had it since 99
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  And I'm on a bunch of stuff now
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:40.760]  Hydrocodone, Gepipentin
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:42.760]  And high dosages
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:44.760]  I just want to know what is the best thing
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:46.760]  To help control pain
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:48.760]  I can't eat all the finances
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  I can't eat all organic
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:52.760]  I could take to help myself
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  Well, Regano oil works extremely effective
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:56.760]  In about 80% of the people
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:58.760]  Some say it works as strong as morphine
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:00.760]  But as your body becomes healthy
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:02.760]  And you become cleansed with the X2
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:04.760]  Doing the liver cleansing
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.760]  Repairing your gut
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:08.760]  With the oxy powder
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:10.760]  Taking the probiotic
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:12.760]  It's amazing what happens when your body becomes clean
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:14.760]  Then your body can take care of the pain
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  But I would also recommend
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:18.760]  If you said you had MS
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  There was a doctor in Germany
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.760]  His name was Hans Nieper
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:24.760]  He wrote a book called The Curious Man
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:26.760]  And he was probably the world's leading expert
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:28.760]  On autoimmune disease
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:30.760]  And he has different programs
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:32.760]  All natural programs
[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:34.760]  So I would highly recommend taking a look into that
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:36.760]  Sure, God bless you, man
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:38.760]  We've got to go, we have unlimited calls coming in
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  But Dr. Rib's got to go
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:42.760]  And he's going to be on the nightly news tonight
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:44.760]  Thank you for helping us develop
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:46.760]  A proprietary product just for InfoWarsLife
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:48.760]  You're very proud of it, we're proud of it
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:50.760]  Deep Cleanse, infowarslife.com
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:52.760]  And we're not saying any of this is a silver bullet
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:54.760]  It's all been working great for me
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:56.760]  You've heard the right reviews
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:58.760]  We're with a major third party review site
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:00.760]  And it's just unparalleled
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.760]  Unprecedented five star reviews, thousands of them
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:04.760]  And there's other major sites
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:06.760]  Reviewing it, they're going, man this crazy right wing guy
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.760]  I'm not even crazy right wing folks
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.760]  But a lot of the liberals are like these really are
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:12.760]  Good supplements
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:14.760]  The supplement snobs
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:16.760]  Because you're one of the top guys out there
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  And you don't compromise
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:20.760]  So thank you for your help Dr. Rib
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  From what I hear the Deep Cleanse is almost sold out
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:24.760]  So I would highly recommend everybody getting online
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:26.760]  Right now
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:28.760]  Well folks, thanks for the support
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:30.760]  God bless you, we're going to go to this report
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  This is the real journalism going on
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:34.760]  This is what Joe Biggs and Josh Owen just shot
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:36.760]  Down at the border last night
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:38.760]  In the twilight
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:40.760]  Stay with us
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:52.760]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:54.760]  Now you might be asking yourself
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.760]  As to why I'm sitting in front of this random
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:44:58.760]  White backdrop, that's because
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:00.760]  Right now Josh Owens and I are currently on the run
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:02.760]  From a cartel
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:04.760]  Now we got very
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.760]  Very golden footage, the kind of footage
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:08.760]  That most reporters would wait their entire life
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:10.760]  In hopes to get and probably would never
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:12.760]  Ever get a chance
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:14.760]  We actually witnessed
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:16.760]  A drug smuggling operation from
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:18.760]  Mexico into the US
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:20.760]  Now this is intense
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:22.760]  We were seen by spotters
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:24.760]  They walked up, they got pictures of our license plate
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:26.760]  They got pictures of me
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:28.760]  And that's why we're doing this
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:30.760]  This is not a joke
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.760]  We had to take our license plate off our vehicle
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:34.760]  We had to hide the vehicle
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:36.760]  And we are in hiding
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.760]  And we're hoping we can get this footage out to you guys
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:40.760]  So you can see, because the reason we came out here
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:42.760]  Was to talk about Donald Trump
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  Because he's coming out here to visit Laredo
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:46.760]  And one of the things we want to talk about
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.760]  Was how our borders are so wide open
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:50.760]  Now we have proof for the American people
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:52.760]  To show you just how wide open
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:54.760]  The borders are
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:56.760]  To show you how easy it is
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:58.760]  For a large amount of drugs
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:00.760]  To come across the Rio Grande River
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:02.760]  And into the back of a vehicle
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:04.760]  To speed away into the unknown
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:06.760]  This is a real problem
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:08.760]  And now we're going to take a look at that footage
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:10.760]  As you can see
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.760]  We're sitting on the side of the border right here
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:14.760]  The Rio Grande River
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:16.760]  I should say in Laredo, Texas
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.760]  There are people coming over in rafts
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:20.760]  Across the border over to the US side
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:22.760]  This is actually happening right now
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:24.760]  We just saw this cameraman Joshua Owen
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  Saw it over my shoulder as we were just reporting
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:28.760]  On Donald Trump coming in
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:30.760]  To talk about the unsecured border
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:32.760]  This is breaking news
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:34.760]  Right here in Full Wars catches it
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  Alright, I'm getting it
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:42.760]  Don't put your hand up
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:44.760]  We just caught these guys coming across the border
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:46.760]  They're jumping in
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:48.760]  They just jumped in the rafts
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:50.760]  They're coming up one, two, three, four
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:52.760]  They have big satchels
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:54.760]  It's dramatic footage
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:56.760]  It's dramatic footage
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:02.760]  They're driving away from us
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:08.760]  That was a red Ford Explorer, right?
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:10.760]  Yeah
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:12.760]  ABC News
[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:14.760]  None of them will cover this
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:16.760]  Dramatic footage
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:18.760]  I'm swimming across
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:20.760]  Loading up
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:22.760]  Who knows what drugs were in there
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:24.760]  10, 20, 30 million if it was marijuana
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:26.760]  Maybe a million dollars
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.760]  Who knows
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  Looks like eight or nine satchels
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.760]  Being loaded into their
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.760]  Industrial
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:36.760]  Level
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:38.760]  And they're very precise
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:40.760]  Looks like this is a regular event
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:42.760]  A lot of times if you don't just work for the drug cartels
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.760]  They'll just kill you and your family
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  A lot of times these guys aren't even paid
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  So that's what Donald Trump's talking about
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:50.760]  And they act like none of this is going on
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  So that it's racist
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:54.760]  That we're worried about Mexico collapsing
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.760]  What needs to stop is the phony drug war
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:58.760]  It's what has put the money into this
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:00.760]  Doesn't mean you legalize it
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  You just take the big money out of it
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:04.760]  You decriminalize it
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:06.760]  The drug war just gets worse and worse
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:08.760]  But it was designed to do this
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:10.760]  Joe Biggs, Josh Owens, you guys are going to be hosting
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:12.760]  To the bottom of the next hour together
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  More on this in overdrive
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:16.760]  Some stations do carry the fourth hour
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:18.760]  But great job, you went down there for 24 hours
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:20.760]  Brought back the kill
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:22.760]  Brought back the intel
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:24.760]  It was definitely an interesting trip
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:26.760]  You know, we went down there expecting to cover
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:28.760]  The Donald Trump story
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:30.760]  And possibly try to get some questions
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:32.760]  And yesterday they came out saying
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.760]  That he was going to be down there
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.760]  Then there were reports saying that he wasn't going to go
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:38.760]  So what we wanted to do is we checked into a hotel
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:40.760]  We were like, all right, let's just pull up a map
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  So I just pulled up my map app
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:44.760]  And just randomly dropped a pin
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  On this stretch across the border
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  On the Rio Grande
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:50.760]  And it happened to be a spot that was just gold
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:52.760]  We got out, we parked the vehicle
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:54.760]  And as we were pulling up actually
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:56.760]  We actually had to do a U-turn and come back
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:58.760]  To the spot where we parked, we pulled up into a wooded area
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:00.760]  But we passed two board patrol vehicles
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:02.760]  So just remember that in the story
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:04.760]  There's two board patrols right there
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:06.760]  In that area, so we pull in, park, hop out
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:08.760]  And then we hear some balls bouncing
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:10.760]  There's two kids bouncing one basketball
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:12.760]  You know, back and forth
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.760]  And the guy walks up behind our vehicle
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:16.760]  And he's doing this
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:18.760]  Does it say anything that walks away
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:20.760]  So me and Josh will kind of look at each other
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  Like that's a little odd, it's strange
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:24.760]  The cartels have intel databases
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:26.760]  They use spotters, they use kids
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:28.760]  That's what they did in Afghanistan, Iraq
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:30.760]  That's not uncommon
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:32.760]  So him and I walked down to the Rio Grande river
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  And began to kind of go over some lines
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:36.760]  What we're going to talk about
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:38.760]  And next thing you know, those kids come right back again
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  They walk out to the edge of the river
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  Right by us and the kids got his camera out
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:44.760]  We have footage of this, I can't wait to see all the stuff
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:46.760]  Well Josh was getting B roll of the river
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:48.760]  At the same time, and I was kind of like
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  Hey, hey, these kids just came back
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:52.760]  These kids just came back just kind of act normal
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  See, I need to be able to send more guys with you
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.760]  That's why we need to get more reporters
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:58.760]  While we need more funding
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.760]  We need a three man team, she can cover everything
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  Go ahead
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:04.760]  So yeah, these kids walk away and I look at him
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:06.760]  And I was like, this is just kind of odd
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:08.760]  Don't you have a weird feeling about this
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  Let's just go ahead and film this to get out of this area
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:12.760]  I'm coming to the border, and over my right shoulder
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:14.760]  Josh goes, oh my god
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:16.760]  Look, and I turn around and you see
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:18.760]  These, what is it, seven people?
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:20.760]  Seven or eight
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.760]  Jump off the ravine into the Rio Grande
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:24.760]  And start swimming across the river
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:26.760]  On these floats
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:28.760]  With the big satchels in front of it
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:30.760]  I mean, they're paddling for dear life
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:32.760]  To get over to that border
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  And I looked at him and I said, hey, we got to
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:36.760]  Scurry up this embankment really quick
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:38.760]  Let's get to the car, try to back out
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:40.760]  We're going to come out at
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:42.760]  And you did that, when we come back
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:44.760]  We'll roll some of the footage in the background

[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:44.760]  That Bob Dylan's
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:46.760]  Where the new world order
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:48.760]  But is he speaking out

[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:52.760]  Nope
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  I guess he would say he does through his music
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:56.760]  You better get that through your head
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:58.760]  This world is ruled by violence
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:00.760]  But I better
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:02.760]  Leave that unsaid
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:04.760]  Sun down on the union
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  When we come back in the next segment
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:08.760]  I'm going to hit some on this
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:10.760]  CDC suggests mothers delay breastfeeding
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:12.760]  To enhance vaccine
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:14.760]  It says the new live virus vaccines they're giving
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:16.760]  Why the breast built counters the virus
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:18.760]  Oh, so they can't get a full brain damage
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  Oh, the mothers are fighting back
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:24.760]  That's the new CDC announcement
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:26.760]  They'll probably ban breastfeeding
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:28.760]  Then it'll be a conspiracy that ever existed
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:30.760]  And Salon can write articles about
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  Alex Jones' claims once that was breastfeeding
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:34.760]  I mean, I'm not kidding
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  They have articles about how women are learning to pee
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  Standing up to battle men
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:40.760]  And have green underarm hair
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:42.760]  I'm not joking
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:44.760]  That's how you're free, have green underarm hair
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:46.760]  Women carry these little cups around so they can pee into urinals
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  That was in Yahoo News
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:50.760]  I'm not joking, I'm going to cover it yesterday
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  Yeah, I saw that
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  It's just middle illness
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:56.760]  While everything's collapsing
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  They literally have women turning their hair purple
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:00.760]  Or pink under their arms, like I care
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:02.760]  And you want to look like a sloth troll
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.760]  And then you want to go in there and pee standing up
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  I mean, this is a joke
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:08.760]  It looks like a cup mixed with a funnel
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:10.760]  It stays and people are totally insane
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:12.760]  A vertical cup
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:14.760]  Meanwhile, the real women out there
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.760]  It's like, don't give them the milk, it's liberal
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:18.760]  Anyways, I'm sorry
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:20.760]  Josh Owens, tell us about what you saw
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  Going down on the border
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.760]  Well, I think the big point is that
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:26.760]  We didn't go down there necessarily
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:28.760]  To film illegal immigrants
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:30.760]  Coming across on the Rio Grande
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:32.760]  Illegal gods!
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:34.760]  Illegal gods, I'm sorry, those racist of me
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:36.760]  If you're saying immigrants
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:38.760]  So, like Big said
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:40.760]  He dropped a pen and we went to a location
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:42.760]  Common sense says this happens all the time
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:44.760]  Well, we know it happens all the time
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:46.760]  But do you think that we just happened
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:48.760]  Upon a place in the border
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:50.760]  And we see eight kids
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:52.760]  You know, eight young men
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:54.760]  You did that like gambling, it was like a spidey sense, didn't you?
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:56.760]  Yeah, just the force led me to that point
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:56:58.760]  I mean, because we've been covering the border
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:00.760]  For over a year now
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:02.760]  And not once have we ever gotten footage like that
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:04.760]  Whatsoever, I mean that
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:06.760]  Well, it's one that you get people crossing
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:08.760]  But up close, you're looking to get shot at
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:10.760]  Well, that's what we're worried about
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:12.760]  Those guys speeding away in that expedition
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:14.760]  More than likely have firearms in that vehicle
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  But one of the interesting things was though
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:18.760]  Like I said, when we ran back to the vehicle
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:20.760]  Josh jumped in the vehicle to drive
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:22.760]  And back out, as he was backing out
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:24.760]  I got in the road to block traffic
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  When I looked to the right, those two border patrol trucks
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.760]  I told you about earlier, were speeding off around the corner
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:30.760]  As they sped off around the corner
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  The red SUV, or the maroon colored SUV
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:34.760]  Burgundy, whatever you want to call it
[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:36.760]  Comes in, jumps back in, opens up
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:38.760]  And they started loading those drugs into the back of that vehicle
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:40.760]  So, I've been watching these guys on the border patrol
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:42.760]  A lot of their times
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:44.760]  Their shift change around 6 p.m., 6 a.m.
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  This was close to 8 o'clock at night
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:48.760]  And it was very weird for it to happen
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:50.760]  Within seconds, they pulled off and were jetting
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:52.760]  Around the corner, and at the exact same time
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:54.760]  That drug deal happened right in front of us
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:56.760]  We pulled into the spot where the
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:58.760]  Border patrol vehicle was parked
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:00.760]  That's where you got the footage of them actually loading
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:02.760]  So, do you think they have people inside
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:04.760]  That knew when they were about to speed off
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:06.760]  Or maybe they did a diversion down the road
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:08.760]  Or are you saying maybe something else was going on
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:10.760]  I'm saying it's possible that someone could get paid off
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:12.760]  The other way
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:14.760]  No, that's never happened
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:16.760]  How unpatriotic of you
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  You mean our government could be corrupt too
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:20.760]  Like Mexico?
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  Well, you know
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:24.760]  Look, you heard me say that women used to
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:26.760]  Give babies milk out of their mammary glands
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:28.760]  A wild theory
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:30.760]  Or that Margaret Sanger was a huge racist
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:32.760]  That wanted to kill black people
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.760]  She only wrote books about it
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:36.760]  And now he's claiming that we could have corruption in the government
[02:58:36.760 --> 02:58:38.760]  Joe!
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:40.760]  And the fish swimming in the ocean
[02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:42.760]  Whoa! This guy's a cuckoo
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:44.760]  We're going to be right back, overdrive
[02:58:44.760 --> 02:58:46.760]  Some stations carry it
[02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:48.760]  Support local affiliates
[02:58:48.760 --> 02:59:10.760]  Let's report some of the key
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.760]  The supply of these deep earth crystals
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:22.760]  That exclusive
[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:24.760]  999 pure source
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:26.760]  Is proprietary

[02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:30.760]  And that supply is running low
[02:59:30.760 --> 02:59:32.760]  And is in question
[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:34.760]  That's why it's more important than ever
[02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:36.760]  To secure your current and long time supply
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:38.760]  Of survival shield nascent iodine X2 today

[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:42.760]  Stores safely for years
[02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:44.760]  Available exclusively at infowarslife.com

[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:54.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:02.760]  Central Texas Command Center
[03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:04.760]  Deep behind enemy lines
[03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:06.760]  The information war continues
[03:00:06.760 --> 03:00:08.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:12.760]  So we make jokes about feminists trying to force men
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:14.760]  To be sitting down
[03:00:14.760 --> 03:00:16.760]  And they want a peace standing up
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:18.760]  It just shows the obsession
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:20.760]  With like mental illness
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:22.760]  I mean just insanity
[03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:24.760]  While the whole world goes on around us
[03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:26.760]  And we're a planetoid in space
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:28.760]  They're attacking the very species
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:30.760]  That we are
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:32.760]  Meanwhile you guys are down on the border
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:34.760]  And there's just drugs being hauled
[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:36.760]  Right in front of you
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:38.760]  Now you've got to give the license number
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:40.760]  That you got to the police
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:42.760]  Other points you'd like to make
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:44.760]  And I was upstairs
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:46.760]  And I was on the phone at the time
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  And I had pushed the button to go down on the elevator
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:50.760]  And as soon as the door opened
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  One of the two young men
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:54.760]  Who was bouncing the basketball
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  Who first came up to us when we were out there
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:58.760]  Was in the elevator
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:00.760]  These kids live there
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:02.760]  I mean they're not tourists
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:04.760]  It wasn't a tourist area
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  It wasn't an area anybody visits
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.760]  Unless you're smuggling in drugs
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:10.760]  And he was in the elevator
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:12.760]  Looking out the back side of the elevator
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:14.760]  Almost like he was looking up and down
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:16.760]  Trying to see if he noticed anybody on the levels
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.760]  So I just immediately
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  Kind of
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  Darted over and went around the side
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:24.760]  And he didn't see me
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:26.760]  Then we go downstairs
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:28.760]  And there's another guy who doesn't look like he fits in at the hotel
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:30.760]  He shirts a little dirty
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:32.760]  Just doesn't look like he's
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:34.760]  You notice when people aren't where they're supposed to be
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:36.760]  He was staring at us while we were sitting downstairs
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:38.760]  And I thought
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  Well maybe I'm just being a little bit paranoid
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:42.760]  Because of what just happened
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:44.760]  And the Los Zetas
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.760]  The cartel that controls that area
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:48.760]  There have been said that they're the most dangerous
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:50.760]  Most technologically advanced
[03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:52.760]  Drug runners
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:54.760]  So anyways
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:56.760]  We go up to the room
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:01:58.760]  Maybe 25 minutes later
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:00.760]  The guy's gotten up
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:02.760]  He's standing in front of my hotel room
[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:04.760]  Leaning over the balcony on his phone
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:06.760]  Glancing up at me as I walk
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:08.760]  As I walk by
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:10.760]  So I put my key on the door and he turns around and steps behind me
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:12.760]  So my immediate reaction is
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:14.760]  I'm not going to open this door and come in here
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  And let him come behind me and shut the door behind me
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:18.760]  I'm going to be honest
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:20.760]  I would be close to decking him in the face at that point
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:22.760]  Good you guys got out of there
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:24.760]  Please continue
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:26.760]  So I turned around and I walked the other way
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:28.760]  He kind of looked back at me and then he just kept walking
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:30.760]  The opposite direction
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:32.760]  So at that point we
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:34.760]  Put ourselves in our room
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:36.760]  Because
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:38.760]  That's what we did
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:40.760]  That seemed like the smart thing to do at the time
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:42.760]  I bet you weren't armed, I bet you got in fetal positions
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:44.760]  I urinated on myself a little bit
[03:02:44.760 --> 03:02:46.760]  Did you do it sitting down?
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  That's sexist
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:50.760]  I did it sitting down, I made sure I had the people
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  Oh thank god
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:54.760]  We did though, no joke though
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  I removed the license plate, we hid the vehicle
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:58.760]  I got under the vehicle because at one point we left the vehicle vulnerable
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:00.760]  When it was parked there, when Josh and I were down there
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  So I got on my hands and knees
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:04.760]  I looked for any kind of tracking device
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:06.760]  But let me guess, I bet you had the HD 556 at the ready
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:08.760]  Oh
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:10.760]  No no, we never do that
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:12.760]  Anyway, so what happened next?
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:14.760]  So just all in all
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:16.760]  It was very strange, the fact that
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:18.760]  Here we are, we go to this random spot
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:20.760]  The border patrol is driving away
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:22.760]  As this drug deal happens
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:24.760]  We see the vehicle as it's driving away
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:26.760]  We almost get T-boned by a semi truck
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:28.760]  We're in the middle of nowhere really
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:30.760]  Most of the trucks that are coming through are border patrol
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:32.760]  And or some semi trucks
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:34.760]  That are transporting stuff
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:36.760]  Houses are a good bit ways away
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:38.760]  What did the border patrol think of you guys?
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:40.760]  They didn't say anything
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  They probably thought we were part of the deal or something
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:44.760]  They didn't have any clue because they just sat there
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:46.760]  They watched us pull up, I even got to the back of the vehicle
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:48.760]  Waiting on one of them to approach us
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:50.760]  Because normally, whenever we go out there to the border
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:52.760]  They'll come up and say, hey what's going on, what are you guys doing out here
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:54.760]  Not these guys
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:56.760]  No, they just sat there and then we walked down to the
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:58.760]  border patrols came by
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:00.760]  Border patrol jetted off and then the drug deal happened
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:02.760]  Like I said, one in a million
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:04.760]  You never see something like this
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:06.760]  Over the year that we've been covering this
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:08.760]  I've been all the way from Brownsville
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:10.760]  All the way into California looking at the border
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:12.760]  Arizona, all that never come across
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:14.760]  A lot of times they use tunnels under the Rio Grande
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:16.760]  This is a wide part in the river too
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:18.760]  This wasn't like in El Paso where it's a lot more
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:20.760]  Narrower
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  And shallower
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.760]  This was an actual wide
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:26.760]  Let me just say this, you guys come back
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.760]  Covering the tail from start to finish
[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:30.760]  All the facets of it and bugging out of there
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:32.760]  Great job, and you're going to be hosting the
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:34.760]  show, so great job Joe Biggs
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:36.760]  Great job Josh Owens
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:38.760]  I tell you, has it been an adventure since you've been here
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:40.760]  Guys? To say the least
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:42.760]  I needed an adrenaline rush when I got out of the
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:44.760]  military and this is definitely
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:46.760]  I definitely know short of that around here
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:48.760]  The battle for the Republic, right here in the
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.760]  homeland, there's still something going on
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:52.760]  Toe to toe with the New World Order
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:54.760]  Stay back, stay well

[03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:24.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:27.440]  I'm now your host Joe Biggs and I'm with me right now.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:33.080]  We have Josh Owens and we just recently got back from a trip to the border in Laredo,
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:38.000]  Texas where we were planning to go and interview Donald Trump and kind of ask him about some
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.240]  of his different stances on immigration, veterans, things like that.
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:44.520]  But things didn't turn out that we wanted to, did it Josh?
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:45.520]  No, not at all.
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:46.520]  Not at all.
[03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:53.200]  And like I said earlier, we didn't go down there necessarily to capture illegals coming
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:54.720]  across the border.
[03:08:54.720 --> 03:08:59.960]  We especially, because like Biggs said, we've been along the border through Arizona, California,
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:00.960]  Texas.
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:05.560]  So we've seen a lot, but we haven't seen anything quite like this and we really weren't expecting
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:06.560]  it.
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:12.560]  But just to start over to explain what we were doing, we went out there to talk about Trump
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:19.440]  because Trump has kind of shined light once again on the border while running for president.
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:23.680]  So we went out there to get a couple questions with him, interview him because he was out
[03:09:23.680 --> 03:09:30.280]  there doing his presidential PR.
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:35.480]  Biggs dropped a pen on his iPhone so we could find a place along the border, just a scenic
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:39.680]  area where we could shoot a quick report that night leading up to the next day, which would
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:41.480]  have been this morning.
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:42.760]  And so we went to this area.
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:43.880]  It was pretty desolate.
[03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:47.480]  There were two border patrol cars not far from where we were.
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:51.960]  Like Biggs said, we actually had to loop around to come back and find a little dirt road to
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:52.960]  pull into.
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:54.760]  It was like a trail.
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:59.960]  So we pull in and all of a sudden we hear a bouncing basketball, which was strange because
[03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:05.480]  there were no kids around, there were no houses.
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:06.600]  There weren't people around there.
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:08.320]  It wasn't an area where there were people hanging out.
[03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:09.320]  It was a road.
[03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:10.320]  There was no sidewalk.
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:11.880]  There was nowhere for these kids to be.
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:12.880]  There was a road.
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:13.880]  So we heard the bouncing basketball.
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:17.040]  But we didn't even see him walking by as we drove up to that area so did someone drop
[03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:18.040]  them off.
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:21.120]  I mean, like you said, there's no houses for them to walk to.
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:27.160]  That's not a normal area for two young teenage boys to just be walking around in the middle
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:28.160]  of the day like that.
[03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:29.600]  I mean, that's super shady.
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:30.600]  So we heard them.
[03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:33.600]  We heard the sound of a basketball, which was eyed.
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:36.840]  And then all of a sudden I was getting the stuff out of the car and then I saw these
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:43.960]  two young men, these two young men were coming behind the car and they stopped and they looked
[03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:47.000]  at us strangely and then all of a sudden they just turned around.
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.080]  So it was like they were walking in one direction and then they just turned back around the
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.520]  other way because they saw us.
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:58.240]  The whole reason they were there, which we ultimately found out was to scout out the
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:02.840]  area because these people were about to come over with a large amount of drugs.
[03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:07.880]  And I'm talking what would have amounted to millions of dollars of drugs depending on
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:08.880]  what the drug was.
[03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:13.960]  And we know that the Los Ades are, especially in that area, they is one of the biggest
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:17.000]  cocaine trafficking areas.
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.120]  So at the time, they're two younger kids.
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:23.720]  You're not going to think, oh, these guys are a lookout for the cartel, for the Los
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:24.720]  Ades.
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:25.720]  That's not what we were thinking.
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:26.720]  We were thinking these are just kids.
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:30.560]  Maybe we should lock the door because they may mess with our stuff.
[03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:36.900]  So we see that the Rio Grande is right next to, right across this little trail, is right
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:38.360]  next to us where we were parked.
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:41.200]  So we go down there to shoot a report, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:46.480]  We shot the whole report and then all of a sudden behind Biggs, no, behind me, the kids
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:48.040]  come down and they're taking photos of us.
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:51.160]  And at the time, I'm shooting B-roll, so I don't even see the kids.
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:53.800]  And Biggs is like, hey, look up there, you know, they're taking pictures of us.
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:57.320]  I turn around and they just kind of walk past us, you know, kind of smile.
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:11:58.320]  Nonchalantly.
[03:11:58.320 --> 03:11:59.320]  Yeah.
[03:11:59.320 --> 03:12:00.320]  And walk past us.
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:04.160]  Even then, I was like, well, these kids, you know, they're interested because we have
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:05.160]  cameras.
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:06.160]  We were kind of complacent, though.
[03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:08.720]  I mean, as many times we've been to the border, we should have known a little bit better.
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:11.840]  We were just expecting to go there for the whole Trump interview.
[03:12:11.840 --> 03:12:14.000]  And then we kind of get down there and get thrown into this situation.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:17.120]  Not many people really ever get to encounter when they're out there.
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:20.440]  I mean, like you said, over a year, I've never come across that before yet.
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:22.080]  We've seen people passing over the border.
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:24.360]  We've shown how easy it is across the border.
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:27.160]  And yet you've got these Democrats saying, oh, the border's just secure.
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:28.160]  There's fine.
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:29.160]  There's nothing going on whatsoever.
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:30.280]  But we keep seeing it.
[03:12:30.280 --> 03:12:31.280]  We keep showing it.
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:33.480]  Every time we go down there, it gets crazier and crazier.
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:34.480]  Yeah.
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:36.320]  It plays into a lot of the hearts and minds.
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:40.280]  It's like, well, these people, you know, they're, you know, they have to come across the border
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:41.680]  because they can't live over there.
[03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:43.880]  They have to come across the border.
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:47.240]  And the point that we make is that look at the type of people that are coming across
[03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:48.240]  the border.
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:50.880]  One thing that I personally, just to give my personal opinion, I don't necessarily agree
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:55.240]  with Trump when he says that the majority of them are rapists or murderers, and some
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:59.160]  of them you would assume are good people.
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:04.200]  I don't necessarily agree with that, but we do know that there are rapists and murderers
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:07.320]  on both sides of the fence, but that those are the ones that a lot of them have been
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:08.720]  caught coming across the border.
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:09.720]  And they found prayer rug.
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:12.120]  So it's not just, it's not just people from Mexico.
[03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:13.120]  Other than Mexicans.
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:14.120]  Yeah.
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:18.240]  Other than Mexicans, prayer rugs, corans, Joe Biggs dressed up as an ISIS jihadi and
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:19.240]  walked across the border.
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:23.920]  So we know that whether it's happened or not, and we know it's happened, we know that they've
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:26.440]  set up camps across the border in the US.
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:31.120]  We've seen them bring illegals into Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, housing them
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:35.520]  there, not going through proper procedures to screen these children as whether or not
[03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:38.240]  they have any kind of viruses, illnesses whatsoever.
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:42.360]  And meanwhile, they're camped right next door to soldiers or airmen going through AIT, which
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:46.400]  is advanced individual training to learn their MOS in the Air Force.
[03:13:46.400 --> 03:13:50.600]  Now if you're a parent, do you want someone like that who's not documented, who hasn't
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:54.800]  had the proper checkups to be around your soldier when they're supposed to be there
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:14:01.200]  under the watch of these supervisors and they're just being allowed to sit there and bake
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:03.040]  out in the sun for days on end.
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:04.200]  God knows what they have.
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:05.200]  Exactly.
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:07.800]  But once again, the soldiers are not the top priority.
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:08.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:13.520]  They don't care anything about soldiers, just like the attack at Chattanooga, the fact
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:17.200]  that these soldiers aren't allowed to arm themselves whatsoever.
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:22.160]  And meanwhile, you get patriots across the country, flood out to these recruiting centers
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:26.400]  by the hundreds, and they set up posts, they sit out there.
[03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:31.600]  I myself spent three days, two and a half days actually, guarding the one in South Austin.
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:35.920]  And now the Department of the Army has the gall to come out and say that we're a security
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:37.440]  threat.
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:38.760]  Come on.
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:43.080]  What kind of country do we live in when our government fails and we can't stand up to
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:48.240]  help protect the soldiers, the soldiers who go overseas to fight and die for the freedoms,
[03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:51.320]  the right for you to complain, the right for you to be whatever it is you want to be, and
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:55.520]  we can't let citizens come out there and help out a little bit.
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:59.720]  It's kind of pathetic that we actually have to have citizens come out there and do that.
[03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:02.480]  Anyways, the government should already go ahead and pass this.
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:06.720]  So these guys can sit there and sit there every day for the two and a half days I was
[03:15:06.720 --> 03:15:12.200]  there to watch the wives of those airmen, Marines, soldiers come up and say thank you,
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:15.840]  my kids thank you because I'm going to get to see my husband another day because they
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:21.680]  are scared that another attack like Chattanooga can happen again and you've got these bureaucrats
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:25.040]  at the Pentagon, you've got these higher ups who could care less.
[03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:27.640]  They have our military marching around in high heels.
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:28.640]  It's ridiculous.
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:31.040]  We look like a joke to ISIS.
[03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:35.720]  The reason that we, I just can't believe that we've turned our military in the American
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:39.680]  pride that we used to have in this country, we look like a soft target.
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:44.240]  Yeah, and I think what I got of what you were saying is the worst, not the worst, but you
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:49.920]  know a horrible thing about what you're saying is that it's the veterans and their families
[03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:53.440]  that are having to carry this burden.
[03:15:53.440 --> 03:15:57.160]  Every single day it affects their lives.
[03:15:57.160 --> 03:15:58.680]  I was never in the service.
[03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:00.240]  I wasn't in the military.
[03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:05.600]  I have some family that was, but it's not a thought that's on my mind every day.
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:08.160]  It crosses my mind occasionally when I see it in the news and I hear, you know, when
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:14.480]  I talk to some friends, but it's not something that controls my life, controls my thoughts.
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:19.280]  And you have to think the veterans and their families, their wives, their kids, it's something
[03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:22.400]  that affects them every second of every day.
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:26.240]  Well, because most of their husbands have been in the military for 20 plus years.
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:29.480]  Once they get to that recruiting position a lot of times, they've already been deployed.
[03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:32.720]  So they've had to worry about whether or not their husband's going to come back home,
[03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:35.360]  whether or not their husbands and see their kids again, whether or not their kids are
[03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:39.160]  going to grow up without a father and then to have them come back and get a pretty chillax
[03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:42.960]  job like a recruiter, which is one of the jobs I wish I could always got just to take
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:47.000]  a break for a little bit from everything and to have to worry about whether or not your
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:51.440]  husband or wife's going to come back from just going out and recruiting or sitting in
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:55.520]  the office talking to people, talking to recruits and getting shot up.
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:17:02.360]  That should be the time where they are at ease when their fathers, their mothers, their
[03:17:02.360 --> 03:17:07.880]  husbands, their wives are back home and not overseas, yet now they can't.
[03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:11.400]  That can't even be a time now where they can have that comfort.
[03:17:11.400 --> 03:17:13.120]  My father was in the Marine Corps.
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:17.200]  My best friend that I've had since I was about four or five, I consider him a brother.
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:18.840]  I've called him a brother my entire life.
[03:17:18.840 --> 03:17:20.080]  He calls me a brother.
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:24.320]  He was a devil dog and to sit there and tell these guys they can't wear their own uniform
[03:17:24.320 --> 03:17:27.080]  when they go into their jobs as a recruiter.
[03:17:27.080 --> 03:17:28.080]  I mean, that's a punch in the face.
[03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:30.760]  That's like telling me I can't wave an American flag.
[03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:31.760]  I am an American.
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:34.520]  I am very proud of what I've done for my country.
[03:17:34.520 --> 03:17:35.760]  I love my country.
[03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:40.600]  I will give my life for my country and I will give my life for those around me and support
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:42.040]  of those freedoms.
[03:17:42.040 --> 03:17:45.800]  When you strip a uniform from a Marine, when you tell them they can't do that, that is
[03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:50.040]  the most degrading thing you could ever do.
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:55.640]  No wonder ISIS sits there and goes, yeah, this is an easy target.
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:59.800]  It's out of control and there's just so many crazy things going on.
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:04.400]  Every time we come in here and we look at these different articles every day, it's almost
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:07.360]  like we live in this time warp.
[03:18:07.360 --> 03:18:08.960]  It seems like a futuristic movie.
[03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:09.960]  Yeah.
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:15.800]  And one thing that I've noticed on recent trips, it seems like now almost every trip
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:22.120]  that I go on, something happens to reinforce what's going on in these articles.
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:26.080]  Something happens because sometimes people, they get complacent and they think, well,
[03:18:26.080 --> 03:18:27.080]  it's just the news.
[03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:28.080]  They're hyping stuff up.
[03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:29.080]  This isn't really going on.
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:33.800]  But Donald Trump is just trying to, he's finding this segment of people that has a belief
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:36.880]  and he's just reinforcing it, reinforcing it to get votes.
[03:18:36.880 --> 03:18:41.360]  And then we show up and then we see people smuggling in drugs.
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:46.000]  And regardless of the discussion of whether drugs should be legalized or not, the fact
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:52.120]  of the matter is, is that illegal immigrants are crossing over an open border bringing
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:59.000]  drugs into the United States, yet we're bad if we talk about it.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  You know?
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:03.120]  And I'm truly shocked that no one's picked up this video.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:07.400]  I honestly, I guess my naivety, I thought this morning it would be everywhere because
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:13.440]  I honestly believe if any other news outlet would have picked this up, it would be circulated
[03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:14.440]  in the news.
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:15.920]  This would be a much bigger story.
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:20.080]  They showed video footage down on the Mexico border where they were riding Seedoo's around,
[03:19:20.080 --> 03:19:25.200]  but she didn't see something like this paddling across with drugs, going up an embankment
[03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:26.200]  and then making that.
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:29.680]  And we had awesome footage right across the street.
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:33.480]  You don't get to see that every day and a lot of people question what's going on.
[03:19:33.480 --> 03:19:36.640]  So we'll be back here in just a little bit with the Alex Jones show coming out of the
[03:19:36.640 --> 03:19:37.640]  break.
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:38.640]  We'll be back.
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:39.640]  We'll talk about some more topics.
[03:19:39.640 --> 03:20:04.560]  Rflags.com just found out that 49-year-old Anthony Hervey, a black man in Mississippi,
[03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:11.160]  he was chased down in his car and killed apparently for his support of the Confederate flag.
[03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:12.960]  This will not stand.
[03:20:12.960 --> 03:20:19.120]  Rflags.com now offering 10% of every sale to go to the Hervey family to help them in
[03:20:19.120 --> 03:20:20.120]  their time in need.

[03:20:26.720 --> 03:20:33.680]  Rflags.com just found out that 49-year-old Anthony Hervey, a black man in Mississippi,
[03:20:33.680 --> 03:20:40.320]  he was chased down in his car and killed apparently for his support of the Confederate flag.
[03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:41.600]  This will not stand.
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:48.280]  Rflags.com now offering 10% of every sale to go to the Hervey family to help them in
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:49.280]  their time in need.

[03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:08.360]  bar none and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:13.920]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are
[03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:19.280]  not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100% organic or because they don't
[03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:25.320]  ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:30.960]  For its survival shield, nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female
[03:21:30.960 --> 03:21:37.520]  vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe that all of these products
[03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:43.880]  will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com
[03:21:43.880 --> 03:21:46.360]  and believed in us and tried the products.

[03:21:52.320 --> 03:21:55.920]  hardcore products.
[03:21:55.920 --> 03:21:59.800]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you
[03:21:59.800 --> 03:22:02.720]  are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[03:22:02.720 --> 03:22:07.120]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled.
[03:22:07.120 --> 03:22:10.760]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:11.760]  Not fun.
[03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:15.880]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:20.160]  able to gain back some strength, muscle and speed of recovery.
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:24.520]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer
[03:22:24.520 --> 03:22:25.520]  for you.
[03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:26.520]  My name is Errol.
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:27.520]  I'm 74 years old.
[03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:30.400]  You know, the taste of One World Way is amazing.
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:34.800]  I play pickleball and since taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement, I have
[03:22:34.800 --> 03:22:38.280]  more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:43.040]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results
[03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:44.800]  using One World Way.
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:55.640]  Call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[03:22:55.640 --> 03:23:00.560]  Quantitive easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:02.560]  China getting out of US Treasuries.
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:07.600]  At the end of 2008, the time of tarp, the national debt was at 11 trillion gold trading
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:10.080]  around $850 per ounce.
[03:23:10.080 --> 03:23:16.600]  Since 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce.
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:20.400]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:24.080]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[03:23:24.080 --> 03:23:26.320]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[03:23:26.320 --> 03:23:31.200]  100 years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your
[03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:32.200]  own gold standard.
[03:23:32.200 --> 03:23:37.480]  Don't be fooled with paper promises, get Midas Resources 10 reasons to buy gold, free, by

[03:23:41.280 --> 03:23:44.720]  Understanding the gold and silver market may be the only insurance you could have to avoiding
[03:23:44.720 --> 03:23:46.520]  the next economic crisis.

[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:10.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:10.160 --> 03:24:13.240]  I'm your host, Joe Biggs, with Joshua Owens.
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:16.960]  Now, we're going to get back into the story you were talking about, Josh.
[03:24:16.960 --> 03:24:25.120]  Right, so, just a preface, we, so at this point, we're not there looking for immigrants
[03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:26.120]  crossing the border.
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:30.240]  We're there to shoot a quick report about Trump being in Laredo, Texas.
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:35.040]  So these two kids, which at the time we didn't realize were spotters, have taken photos of
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:40.800]  us, have gotten our license plate number, have, and now they're kind of off on the side.
[03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:42.800]  I mean, I guess I don't know if they left.
[03:24:42.800 --> 03:24:43.960]  I don't know where they went.
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:45.800]  They just disappeared off into the bushes.
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:48.360]  Well, they're probably trying to see if we're a threat or not.
[03:24:48.360 --> 03:24:49.360]  Right, right, right.
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:56.280]  So, behind Biggs, after all this has taken place, when it finally clicks what those
[03:24:56.280 --> 03:25:04.640]  kids are doing there, I see seven or eight young men jump into the Rio Grande.
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:14.480]  And like he said, when he crossed the border in El Paso, the Rio Grande is very shallow.
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:15.920]  This is very, very deep.
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:19.600]  So as you can see in this video, they're crossing over.
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:23.200]  And I don't know if they have, at the time, I think we thought they had rafts, but honestly,
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:26.120]  I think they were balancing on these boxes of drugs.
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:28.200]  Yeah, it was kind of hard to tell from that far back.
[03:25:28.200 --> 03:25:31.960]  Yeah, well, because honestly, and this is where, this is the one thing I haven't talked
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.840]  about yet.
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:37.960]  When we got this footage, just as you hear Biggs saying earlier in the video, you can
[03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:43.240]  see this, you can see this video on Infowars.com and on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:47.240]  Biggs, as this is breaking news, we got to go get this up.
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:49.400]  So we run up to the car to get this up.
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:51.920]  Biggs blocks the road, although there is no traffic.
[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:52.920]  There's no one coming.
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:53.920]  He's just making sure no one's coming.
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:54.920]  Because we had trees on both sides.
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:55.920]  You couldn't see anything.
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:56.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:26:00.420]  This is the only vehicle, as you can see in this video, this is the only vehicle that
[03:26:00.420 --> 03:26:05.520]  drove by other than this red expedition, this burgundy expedition while we were sitting
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:06.680]  there.
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:13.800]  So we toyed with the idea of walking down the trail and getting close-up footage of
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:16.800]  what we thought or what I thought was a family.
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:19.240]  Well, I just thought it was people going to come over with some clothes.
[03:26:19.240 --> 03:26:23.120]  When they first started hopping over that rail, I thought they had a raft because I thought
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:24.560]  they deflated the raft.
[03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:26.760]  And then once I started looking, those were drugs.
[03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:27.760]  Yeah.
[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:32.320]  I mean, that's the same stuff you see on Breaking Bad or when you're watching some kind of a
[03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:34.400]  show like that with the board patrol out there.
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:35.400]  Exactly.
[03:26:35.400 --> 03:26:39.080]  But we kind of mutually decided not to go down this trail.
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:40.080]  Thank God.
[03:26:40.080 --> 03:26:41.760]  Thank God we did because who knows what could have happened?
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:43.680]  We could have been murdered.
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:48.480]  And in that moment, I thought back, after we saw the drugs as soon as we were leaving,
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:52.520]  I thought back to the time when we were in El Paso, we drove out, I can't remember the
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:56.400]  name of the mountain, but we drove out about an hour and a half outside of El Paso.
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:26:57.400]  Yeah, that's why we're looking for those ISIS spotters.
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:02.040]  Where there were apparent ISIS spotters watching the border so that people could come over
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:03.360]  with drugs.
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:05.360]  We were an hour and a half from anything.
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:06.360]  We were in the middle of nowhere.
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:08.000]  We had no cell service.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:12.040]  There was the last border patrol agent we saw as we noticed this time, it's not like
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:17.600]  it would have mattered and it's not like they would have helped, was maybe 20 minutes back.
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:18.600]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:23.240]  Because we had to go down that long winding dirt road where there was just zero, zero
[03:27:23.240 --> 03:27:24.880]  chance of getting any help whatsoever.
[03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:29.840]  And in that moment, I thought if this would have taken place there, there's a very good
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:31.720]  possibility we would be dead.
[03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:35.160]  Especially with the truck that was picking up the drugs, because you know those guys
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:36.160]  are going to be armed.
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:38.680]  They're going to have some kind of AK-47, because there's probably going to be other
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:43.880]  rival gangs, whatever have you, on that side of the border, on our side, and those guys
[03:27:43.880 --> 03:27:45.560]  would be armed to the teeth.
[03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:48.920]  If we would approach something like that, forget about it.
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:51.480]  Luckily, we didn't make that decision.
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:54.480]  And that's one of the things that I want to say these morons who comment on these videos
[03:27:54.480 --> 03:27:57.560]  and say that we've made this up and that this isn't real.
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:27:59.760]  The stuff that we're doing is real.
[03:27:59.760 --> 03:28:03.920]  We're putting ourselves in danger to get this information out, which a lot of mainstream
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:04.920]  media doesn't do.
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:05.920]  Some of them do.
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:07.960]  I'm not saying they all don't, but a lot of them don't.
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.600]  So when people see, I think that's the issue.
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:12.920]  I think when people see real stuff like this, they think it has to be fake.
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:13.920]  There's no way it can.
[03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:17.280]  I mean, there's a good chance that I, myself, when crossing over the border dressed up like
[03:28:17.280 --> 03:28:21.960]  a jihadi holding a sever head and a sword, that a Border Patrol agent could have just
[03:28:21.960 --> 03:28:27.360]  easily driven down that road at that exact time that we decided to pull that stunt, I
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:28.360]  could be dead right now.
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:31.320]  If you'll remember just to give people a little behind the scenes, we were kind of freaked
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:32.320]  out.
[03:28:32.320 --> 03:28:33.320]  We were like, this is a big deal.
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:34.800]  I mean, I felt nervous in my stomach.
[03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:36.200]  I mean, my stomach was knotted up.
[03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:37.200]  We were going back and forth.
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:38.200]  Should we do it?
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:39.200]  Should we not do it?
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:40.200]  Is this worth dying over?
[03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:43.720]  You know, and the same thing when we went to Mexico the last time, when I cross over
[03:28:43.720 --> 03:28:45.960]  to the border to go look for that ISIS base.
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:50.880]  I mean, my stomach was in knots, but once I got over there and I could kind of get in
[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:56.920]  that combat mode, I felt relaxed in that situation, but it was a different nervous this time around
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:00.800]  because you're, you know, when you're driving, when I was going through an opera, I saw some
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:04.560]  spotters here and there, but I didn't know what anyone's intentions were.
[03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:06.160]  You knew what these guys' intentions were.
[03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:10.080]  Their intentions were to get those drugs over the border, regardless of what's going on.
[03:29:10.080 --> 03:29:11.080]  They didn't care.
[03:29:11.080 --> 03:29:13.880]  I mean, you can see the one guy that's loading up the back of the vehicle, holding the door
[03:29:13.880 --> 03:29:14.880]  up.
[03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:15.880]  He looks back and sees us.
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:19.240]  So you know those guys in that red expedition saw us as well.
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:23.600]  Well, thank you for watching the Alex Jones show and listening as well.
[03:29:23.600 --> 03:29:28.320]  Make sure you tune in tonight for the Info Wars Nightly News, 7 p.m. Central.
