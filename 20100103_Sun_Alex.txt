[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:31.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well it's our first
[00:31.800 --> 00:43.960]  live a transmission of 2010 on this Sunday edition January 3rd 2010 that will certainly
[00:43.960 --> 00:50.080]  take some getting used to we're going to have our third interview with one of the key eyewitnesses
[00:50.080 --> 01:00.480]  from the international flight 253 that came in to Detroit on Christmas day and that the
[01:00.480 --> 01:08.560]  underwear bomber attempted to bring out of the air reportedly he will be joining us coming up
[01:08.560 --> 01:17.600]  in 20 minutes Haskell FBI has changed account four times our story is the same since day one
[01:17.600 --> 01:23.360]  and there have been some other developments in the case since he was last on with us Wednesday
[01:23.360 --> 01:33.440]  live he'll be joining us coming up in the third segment I have a several large stacks of news here
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.500]  that I want to go over today or attempt to cover but one that was given to me when I got to the
[01:39.500 --> 01:44.160]  office today by the crew because I encourage them to also search around for interesting news
[01:44.160 --> 01:53.280]  is an article out of the Times of London and of course we also simulcast all six days a week of
[01:53.280 --> 02:02.080]  my radio show online via television at prisonplanet.tv prisonplanet.tv viewers might want to tune in
[02:02.080 --> 02:09.360]  because you can see shots from the document cam of these articles I'm talking about Microsoft
[02:09.360 --> 02:18.160]  seeks patent for office spy software and driving into the office today with my stacks of news I
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.560]  was thinking to myself what is it I want to get into the underwear bomber and the clear evidence
[02:23.560 --> 02:32.520]  that that's a false flag event to kick off several new wars in Yemen Somalia and to expand what's
[02:32.520 --> 02:39.080]  happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan should I get into the fact that the Democratic Party even
[02:39.080 --> 02:51.840]  though it is destroying their election hopes for 2010 2012 they don't care why are they going ahead
[02:51.840 --> 03:00.040]  with government controlled government run health care which isn't socialism that's bad enough it's
[03:00.040 --> 03:05.600]  just highway robbery real liberals and socialists have finally read the bill and are saying higher
[03:05.600 --> 03:14.840]  taxes less health care and I was also looking at news from India massive deaths there from freezing
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.880]  weather which they never have in the areas of India that have been hit by freezing temperatures for
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.440]  a week freezing temperatures in Europe freezing temperatures in North America freezing temperatures
[03:23.440 --> 03:33.280]  in Asia which is of course circumstantial evidence that the world is not overheating Al Gore every
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.680]  time it gets hot says oh look global warming when that's part of a normal cycle I'm not going to
[03:37.680 --> 03:44.680]  sit here and say oh look it's record cold temperatures some of the coldest temperatures ever
[03:44.680 --> 03:52.040]  recorded at this time Europe I have the headline here coldest temperatures ever recorded for this
[03:52.040 --> 04:01.600]  time of year another headline in Washington DC biggest deepest snowstorm in December history
[04:01.600 --> 04:08.400]  in Washington DC but that doesn't matter weather is always changing you're always having extreme
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.720]  weather so because we're having extremely cold weather doesn't prove that man made global warming
[04:14.720 --> 04:21.240]  isn't real what does prove that it isn't real is that we have the ice core samples we have the
[04:21.240 --> 04:28.840]  last 300 years of temperature recorded and we know that this is moderately warming we've seen
[04:28.840 --> 04:36.520]  and the last nine years we've seen a cooling but that's a normal cycle but that's not what I
[04:36.520 --> 04:42.800]  decided to get into first today no when I read this article right before I went on air I decided
[04:42.800 --> 04:51.080]  to get a little bit into the technological enslavement system the technocracy the scientific
[04:51.080 --> 05:02.280]  dictatorship so that is coming up right after the break stay with us hi folks this is Alex Jones
[05:02.280 --> 05:07.000]  and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.840]  colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[05:11.840 --> 05:16.520]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[05:16.520 --> 05:22.520]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself
[05:22.520 --> 05:28.720]  produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the
[05:28.720 --> 05:34.360]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now
[05:34.360 --> 05:40.520]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:40.520 --> 05:48.000]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.480]  today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's
[05:52.480 --> 06:05.680]  www.silverlungs.com from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[06:05.680 --> 06:14.360]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network welcome and thank
[06:14.360 --> 06:24.000]  you so much for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast first live broadcast of 2010 on this
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.520]  January 3rd Sunday edition thank you for joining us we have one of the eyewitnesses of the
[06:31.520 --> 06:38.800]  underwear bomber flight joining us coming up for the third interview we've done with
[06:38.800 --> 06:45.560]  him there's been some big new developments on that front with Kurt Haskell as the FBI
[06:45.560 --> 06:53.200]  now has been forced for the multiple times four times total to change their story they
[06:53.200 --> 06:59.160]  are now admitting that Mr. Haskell and his family and what the eyewitnesses are saying
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.840]  is correct and is accurate so they've been caught in the middle of a cover up we'll
[07:04.840 --> 07:12.640]  get into that cover up coming up in the next segment today also the Democrats are in big
[07:12.640 --> 07:19.280]  trouble there's a huge exodus out of their party not just at the federal level in Congress
[07:19.280 --> 07:24.480]  and the House and Senate but also at the state level there is going to be a backlash the
[07:24.480 --> 07:32.400]  likes of which we've never seen before from their move to hijack 1 7th to 1 6 depending
[07:32.400 --> 07:38.920]  on what numbers you look at of the US economy through government run healthcare this giant
[07:38.920 --> 07:44.320]  boondoggle which even liberals are now upset about they've actually read the bill they're
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.560]  finding out it doesn't give them something quote for free no such thing as a free lunch
[07:49.560 --> 07:58.000]  what it gives them is something new to tax and control and dole out to the public who
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.400]  they want to make dependent on them so that is coming up later in the broadcast as well
[08:05.400 --> 08:15.520]  but the first story I want to get to is out of the times of London today and I'm after
[08:15.520 --> 08:19.600]  I saw the story I went and googled it and looked it up turns out they previously reported
[08:19.600 --> 08:28.720]  on this along with other publications last year as well and it reports that Microsoft
[08:28.720 --> 08:39.480]  seeks patent for office spy software and when you see an article like this it gives
[08:39.480 --> 08:47.600]  you a glimpse into the future and if we go back a decade ago or longer ago the predictions
[08:47.600 --> 08:55.960]  I made on the type of surveillance society we're going to be living under and living
[08:55.960 --> 09:03.040]  in unfortunately have come true and before I get into this here briefly before our guest
[09:03.040 --> 09:17.480]  joins us Friday night I went into a gas station to get a cup of coffee and a man walked over
[09:17.480 --> 09:24.120]  to me as often happens and said oh I recognize your voice here Alex Jones here in Austin
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.400]  Texas and I said yes how you doing and he said oh I just recognize your voice said great
[09:29.400 --> 09:38.720]  have a nice day and he said hold on just a minute hold on he said do you really believe
[09:38.720 --> 09:49.320]  the things you talk about on your show or do you just do it for shock value and I paused
[09:49.320 --> 09:56.560]  for a moment and he went on to say I guess thinking he'd made me angry he hadn't I was
[09:56.560 --> 10:02.880]  just being reflective I was thinking he said or are you just trying to get people to look
[10:02.880 --> 10:12.640]  in to what you have to say and that's true to a certain extent but I don't get up here
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.400]  and yell and scream and get upset sometimes because I'm trying to get people to pay attention
[10:19.400 --> 10:26.680]  though it has that effect in some cases I am upset on the radio sometimes and get passionate
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.440]  because I'm passionate about freedom and passionate about my children growing up and living in
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.600]  a free society and my unborn grandchildren growing up and living in a free society and
[10:36.600 --> 10:47.960]  I want to leave the world a better place when I leave this planet not in a worse position
[10:47.960 --> 11:00.400]  but I thought about that and I reflected on it that we're on all these AM and FM stations
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.920]  across the country where the number one internet show on the internet according to shot cast
[11:05.920 --> 11:14.560]  and other barometers other meters other gauges were clearly number one radio talk show routinely
[11:14.560 --> 11:22.760]  number one even above music on shot cast and other gauges and there's all these people
[11:22.760 --> 11:32.600]  out there tuning in and they don't understand that they don't have to believe me they don't
[11:32.600 --> 11:45.040]  understand that they can simply go and look up 95% of what I talk about here on air I
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.680]  mean 5% of the time I editorialize on something or I tell a personal story about myself like
[11:50.680 --> 11:58.400]  I just did and you don't know if that's true but if I get up here and I tell you record
[11:58.400 --> 12:04.800]  cold temperatures in Washington DC that's what the Associated Press is reporting today
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.360]  or if I get up here on the radio and I tell you that Google has patented and says they're
[12:09.360 --> 12:18.160]  now testing as of three years ago accessing the microphones and cameras on computers
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.480]  and dialing in and listening to everything you're saying and doing to build psychological
[12:23.480 --> 12:30.260]  algorithms and psychological databases on you I mean if I say something like that even
[12:30.260 --> 12:35.040]  if it shocks you and it should be shocking because you know that's police state that's
[12:35.040 --> 12:41.120]  not freedom that's an invasion of privacy but instead of instead of going man I better
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.360]  check this out and find out if it's true it's so shocking that you just decide to say that
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.080]  guy must be just putting this out there to get people's attention let me explain something
[12:52.080 --> 12:59.880]  to you if I got up here on the radio and I said that Bayer Pharmaceutical for close to
[12:59.880 --> 13:09.080]  a decade conservatively knew that over a million ampoules of their blood clotting drug factor
[13:09.080 --> 13:17.960]  eight was filled with HIV and three strains of hepatitis and infected hundreds and hundreds
[13:17.960 --> 13:27.160]  of thousands of people worldwide if I got up here and said that and it wasn't true Bayer
[13:27.160 --> 13:36.360]  Pharmaceutical would sue me off the face of the earth if I got up here on the radio and
[13:36.360 --> 13:44.600]  I said Baxter Pharmaceutical last year this was in Bloomberg and Associated Press but
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.720]  even if I give them sources they don't care they don't believe it mixed weaponized bird
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.760]  flew and shipped it to 14 different countries and thank God a lab tech in Czechoslovakia
[13:57.760 --> 14:04.000]  tested it on ferrets and if the ferrets get sick it means they didn't properly kill the
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.920]  virus if it's a regular flu shot but the ferrets all died and so they did test and said my
[14:08.920 --> 14:18.360]  God this has got superfluous and they just pulled up a mainstream MSNBC article Scarborough
[14:18.360 --> 14:26.000]  revisits Bayer marketing HIV AIDS infected blood clotting substances but see my crew
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.960]  just did that I didn't tell him to do that what it took you a minute to do that I mean
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.960]  I'm not making any of this up you can get mad at me and say Alex I don't think you should
[14:35.960 --> 14:44.960]  get upset about it but you can't just sit there and say I'm making this up and I get
[14:44.960 --> 14:50.120]  those emails every day I see it all over the message boards people send me links saying
[14:50.120 --> 14:57.280]  I'm a liar about all of this when I'm not lying about any of it if I say cold weather
[14:57.280 --> 15:06.960]  kills scores in India I have the New Delhi news here in front of me here it is talking
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.160]  about global warming being fraud if I say Dublin airport suspends flights and cold
[15:12.160 --> 15:21.200]  weather or that DC has record cold record record cold record snow I mean it just it's
[15:21.200 --> 15:30.080]  a fact I mean if I say that major universities that the UN uses to get their data to show
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.280]  that the earth is warming and that it's man made have been caught engaged in fraud and
[15:35.280 --> 15:44.360]  that they know it's not man made we have been Santers own internal UN documents we have
[15:44.360 --> 15:50.840]  the climate gate documents when I got those FBI Homeland Security documents saying veterans
[15:50.840 --> 15:54.920]  gun owners conservatives are the real enemy of Homeland Security people didn't believe
[15:54.920 --> 16:02.560]  it for two days they thought I made it up now it's admitted it was real hundreds of nations
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.040]  have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.600]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[16:12.600 --> 16:18.640]  the Americans at home tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[16:18.640 --> 16:24.440]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.520]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[16:29.520 --> 16:35.200]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.640]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[16:39.640 --> 16:44.120]  is saying who to make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now

[20:05.000 --> 20:24.800]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network I remember I remember 14 years ago
[20:24.800 --> 20:34.760]  reading trade publications corporate publications how the federal government and international
[20:34.760 --> 20:44.680]  agreements was pushing for a system to track cars and trucks by the mile non-commercial
[20:44.680 --> 20:49.480]  vehicles as well and attacks you and I would get on the air and I would cover it and I
[20:49.480 --> 20:54.400]  would get called a conspiracy theorist because people like to rationalize they don't like
[20:54.400 --> 20:59.160]  to face a threat they don't like to hear that they need to be politically involved
[20:59.160 --> 21:04.240]  or stand up for themselves they just want to go through life like everything's a party
[21:04.240 --> 21:11.040]  and go do their job and then go to the bar or go to the football game you can't do that
[21:11.040 --> 21:18.240]  and now our entire bill of rights and Constitution is routinely ignored by federal agencies the
[21:18.240 --> 21:22.200]  federal government now admits that it spies on the American people in non-terror related
[21:22.200 --> 21:29.080]  cases without warrants the Patriot Act is used thousands and thousands of times a year
[21:29.080 --> 21:36.420]  at every state level in non-terror related cases the government is openly militarizing
[21:36.420 --> 21:43.280]  and arming against the people the federal government is completely controlled by offshore
[21:43.280 --> 21:49.040]  banks that are robbing the country blind they get tens of trillions of dollars through the
[21:49.040 --> 21:56.280]  banking bailout not seven hundred billion and then tell the Congress they won't let
[21:56.280 --> 22:01.800]  them know where the money went or how it was spent both the private Federal Reserve head
[22:01.800 --> 22:08.440]  and the head of the Treasury Geithner say we're not going to tell you and their predecessors
[22:08.440 --> 22:16.680]  like Henry Paulson did the exact same thing and so it goes on and on and on and we look
[22:16.680 --> 22:22.400]  at the cashless society control grid we look at Patriot Act compliance now every financial
[22:22.400 --> 22:29.360]  tracks transaction is tracked and controlled everything is chronicled this is big brother
[22:29.360 --> 22:33.280]  and it isn't a loving big brother it isn't a government that cares about you or wants
[22:33.280 --> 22:38.440]  to help you it is a government that in its own white papers admits that it is simply
[22:38.440 --> 22:44.760]  trying to suppress the people from gaining control of their government again we have
[22:44.760 --> 22:51.280]  a tyranny in place and anyone with a lick of sense or who pays attention knows that
[22:51.280 --> 22:57.600]  but here's just one article of thousands concerning big brother Microsoft seeks patent for office
[22:57.600 --> 23:05.080]  spy software Microsoft is developing big brother style software capable of remotely monitoring
[23:05.080 --> 23:11.400]  a workers productivity physical well-being and competence the Times has seen a patent
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.760]  application filed with the company for a computer system that links workers to their computers
[23:15.760 --> 23:22.840]  via wireless sensors that measure their metabolic system the system would allow managers to
[23:22.840 --> 23:30.280]  monitor employees performance by measuring their heart rate body temperature movement
[23:30.280 --> 23:36.040]  facial expression blood pressure union said they fear that employees could be dismissed
[23:36.040 --> 23:41.120]  on the basis of a computer's assessment of their psychological state technology allowing
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.480]  constant monitoring of workers was previously limited to pilots firefighters and NASA astronauts
[23:46.480 --> 23:51.960]  this is believed to be the first time a company has proposed developing such software for
[23:51.960 --> 24:00.080]  workplaces and this patent it was brought forward in 2008 by the way and then you add
[24:00.080 --> 24:08.920]  that in with the fact that police aren't even needed anymore other than enforcing fines and
[24:08.920 --> 24:15.400]  fees for more than a decade the entire United States every major highway and every major
[24:15.400 --> 24:21.680]  juncture through the Department of Transportation in the Pentagon has had license plate reading
[24:21.680 --> 24:28.480]  cameras installed you'll notice on many toll roads take central Texas in the NAFTA super
[24:28.480 --> 24:35.320]  highway trans Texas corridor most the toll roads don't even have systems where you can
[24:35.320 --> 24:43.440]  pay with cash or pay with the transponder it says pay by mail and the system simply
[24:43.440 --> 24:50.200]  tracks your license plate and point A to point B where you got on where you got off the toll
[24:50.200 --> 24:55.920]  road and they send you a bill the issue is the federal government and other governments
[24:55.920 --> 25:02.880]  of the world they're all unified in their deployment of these systems and centralized
[25:02.880 --> 25:10.200]  are now in the process of announcing and conditioning the public to accept by the mile taxation
[25:10.200 --> 25:18.120]  but also by the mile fines and fees as you drive down the road let's say the speed limit
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.720]  is 60 miles an hour and then you go through a 40 mile an hour and then it goes up to
[25:22.720 --> 25:31.760]  70 according to those markers and the cameras you will be given tickets if your average
[25:31.760 --> 25:40.240]  speed goes above the average speed that you are allowed to drive for that distance so
[25:40.240 --> 25:45.360]  everything has a double-edged sword GPS is a great tool but it is also being used to
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.800]  control you license plate scanning systems could be a great tool but from day one it's
[25:50.800 --> 25:58.520]  being used to control you and some will say well if you have nothing to hide why then
[25:58.520 --> 26:03.120]  should you worry about it well the point is throughout history any time you let the balance
[26:03.120 --> 26:09.520]  of power between the people and the government get out of whack and it's always gravitating
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.200]  towards the government getting more power it's always sliding down into that that's
[26:14.200 --> 26:20.800]  the problem that always arises governments are the most abusive most destructive powers
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.280]  in human history government the 20th century conservatively killed 200 million innocent
[26:27.280 --> 26:36.560]  people cold-bloodily just to get them out of their way corrupt wicked scheming tyrants
[26:36.560 --> 26:42.480]  tend to get in control of government systems but even if you built this technological tracking
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.760]  system and angels were running our government which they're not within time you would get
[26:48.760 --> 26:55.480]  a corrupt group or a group of tyrants plutocrats in control and they would use it as a tool
[26:55.480 --> 27:03.620]  of domination our children in the public schools where ID badges there's fences around many
[27:03.620 --> 27:08.520]  of the schools parents have to be thumb scanned to get into the school to get their children
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.760]  the state is taking over our children the children are trained to be searched they're
[27:13.760 --> 27:21.400]  lined up in drug dogs in famous cases bark at them and start biting their gym bags remember
[27:21.400 --> 27:27.480]  goose creek north carolina they're randomly searched we're randomly searched at the airport
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.240]  the name of security has nothing to do with that it's all part of training you to be
[27:32.240 --> 27:41.360]  a slave training you to go under their control satellites formerly used in the cold war are
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.720]  now publicly used in australia europe england the united states canada and countless other
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.260]  nations to surveil people's land use laws are being passed across the planet to shut
[27:53.260 --> 27:58.640]  down land use to slowly bankrupt and push farmers and ranchers and rural communities
[27:58.640 --> 28:04.280]  off the land we have official united nations biological diversity assessment perspectives
[28:04.280 --> 28:08.280]  that the environmental movement has nothing to do with the environment that is the governmental
[28:08.280 --> 28:14.240]  controlled environmental movement and that it is about quote in the words of morris strong
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.880]  of the u.n. destroying industrialized societies and bringing in a form of neo feudalistic
[28:19.880 --> 28:28.520]  serfdom a highly managed controlled population these are the real issues that need to be
[28:28.520 --> 28:35.520]  discussed and make no mistake the mexican attorney general four years ago made his employees
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.320]  take implantable microchips school children are taught in the united states that they
[28:40.320 --> 28:47.000]  will soon get microchips in time magazine for kids this is worse than george arwell's
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.160]  1984 and we know the people running the world government have the worst of intentions they
[28:53.160 --> 29:01.160]  want a planetary tyranny to protect all their fraud and corruption this is alex jones with

[34:01.360 --> 34:08.880]  open phones for first time callers and you may notice i'm somewhat subdued today my new year's
[34:08.880 --> 34:16.480]  resolution is to truly shake up the radio show it's growing by leaps and bounds one of the fastest
[34:16.480 --> 34:24.320]  growing radio shows in the country i'm happy with the broadcast but i'm calm a lot of the time but
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.400]  i'm also fiery part of the time and i'm trying to train myself to have control where some days
[34:30.400 --> 34:37.280]  i'm going to make myself even if i become angry be calm other days i'm going to let myself off the
[34:37.280 --> 34:44.160]  leash uh and i'm going to some days do nothing but take calls other days do nothing but guest
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.320]  some days nothing but rant other shows i'm just going to cover news and for the first time in 14
[34:50.320 --> 34:57.200]  years of talk radio i'm actually scripting out some of my radio show i mean not line for line word
[34:57.200 --> 35:04.720]  for word but i'm going to try to do something different do something new challenge myself
[35:04.720 --> 35:11.120]  because it's been more than 10 years since i got butterflies coming on the radio and i think that
[35:11.120 --> 35:18.240]  when i have butterflies that makes the show more effective and it makes me stay more cutting edge
[35:18.240 --> 35:27.920]  and frosty and by discipling myself to shake the program up that will force me to get butterflies
[35:27.920 --> 35:35.360]  because it's something new for me to try to remain very very calm and very very focused
[35:35.360 --> 35:43.600]  but don't worry you'll still get the classic alex jones i'm just announcing my experiment here with
[35:43.600 --> 35:50.720]  everyone on air today coming up after our guest leaves us i want to get into what's happening
[35:50.720 --> 35:59.040]  with the government takeover of healthcare and we are also going to get into the new war front
[35:59.040 --> 36:07.520]  the calls for going into yemen samalia sudan and other nations a big kickoff all because
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.520]  of the deadly underwear bomber notice us forces were massing in yemen before the underwear bomber
[36:13.520 --> 36:22.160]  came along the christmas day bomber i guess our free society has to end because why somebody might
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.320]  might try to bomb us and then if somebody tries to bomb a shopping mall we'll have to have tsa
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.080]  level security there that's what they're calling for and i guess if parents aren't good parents all
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.840]  parents need cameras in their homes watching everything they do like 1984 but no one watching
[36:39.840 --> 36:48.400]  the government we're now seeing the british government over 20 000 homes have cameras in them
[36:48.400 --> 36:53.680]  guilty until proven innocent these are just some of the issues we'll be covering today
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.240]  and at the end of this hour i'll give you the toll free number to join us in the second hour
[36:58.800 --> 37:04.800]  to be part of our first maiden broadcast of 2010 but for this segment a little bit into the next
[37:04.800 --> 37:13.440]  segment i am joined by kurt haskell one of the survivors of the flight 253 the christmas day
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.560]  underwear bombing flight they were coming back from an african sight seeing safari with his wife
[37:18.560 --> 37:26.880]  lori they have a family blog they're also both lawyers and they witness a sharp dressed man
[37:26.880 --> 37:33.040]  lead the underwear bomber who they believed to be the underwear bomber on the fbi said no they
[37:33.040 --> 37:40.640]  didn't see that and have refused to release the footage from the european airport that they were
[37:40.640 --> 37:46.160]  in an amsterdam then he reported that in customs they were all being searched again obviously on a
[37:46.160 --> 37:54.800]  plane that was had a small bomb go off on it started to fire and they saw another indian man
[37:54.800 --> 37:58.240]  they saw an indian man lead him up to the plane and get him on without a passport
[38:01.520 --> 38:05.680]  get detained and they said we've got to get you out of here we may have found a bomb
[38:05.680 --> 38:09.600]  then he told the news about it he talked to the fbi about it in person they said no such thing
[38:09.600 --> 38:14.240]  happened they changed their story days later as other witnesses came forward and said no
[38:14.240 --> 38:20.240]  mr and mrs haskell are telling the truth so here's a headline this is out of the detroit news
[38:21.040 --> 38:29.360]  this is out of michigan haskell family fbi has changed account four times our story is the same
[38:29.360 --> 38:37.040]  since day one and so joining us to kind of recap what's happened and and and why this is important
[38:37.040 --> 38:42.240]  and i'll get to that before he leaves us because this is launching some new wars this underwear

[39:35.920 --> 39:40.960]  the man i call the man in orange i'm just going to go over this real quickly for those that don't
[39:40.960 --> 39:48.800]  know when we're being detained in detroit we were held uh in an area of the baggage claim area that
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.360]  all the passengers from our flight there was nobody else around in this area from other flights
[39:55.200 --> 40:03.040]  workers nobody except for some law enforcement personnel after we had been there for about an
[40:03.040 --> 40:08.000]  hour all the time with our carry-on bags three bomb sniffing dogs were brought in
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.040]  one of them sat down by the bag that was brought in by him the man in orange he had an orange he
[40:15.040 --> 40:21.760]  appeared to be of indian or pakistani or some similar descent maybe around age 30 he was walked
[40:21.760 --> 40:28.000]  back to a room not in handcuffs uh he went in the door he was in there approximately an hour
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.080]  when he came out he was handcuffed taken away an fbi officer came up to the group of the
[40:34.080 --> 40:40.160]  rest of his passengers and said the following which is not exact but close you're being moved to
[40:40.160 --> 40:46.080]  another area it's not safe here i'm sure all of you saw what just happened and can figure out
[40:46.080 --> 40:53.520]  why you're being moved we were then escorted out of this very large room into a long uh narrow
[40:53.520 --> 41:02.720]  hallway um my story on this has been the same all along and uh the fbi now has five versions of
[41:02.720 --> 41:10.160]  their story which i lay out uh in an article i wrote on m live uh it's it's actually got gone
[41:10.160 --> 41:16.320]  difficult for me to remember which one is which and when they put them out but basically uh when
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.280]  i go out and call them out on this story then a new version comes out uh their new version comes out
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.000]  i called them out on that and another one comes out and this has happened now they've now had
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.360]  five versions which i clearly lay out with a time period and with each version and they're just not
[41:31.360 --> 41:38.960]  they're not credible and the reason in my opinion the reason this is happening is there is absolutely
[41:38.960 --> 41:45.840]  no excuse for the reason why number one we're left on the plane for 20 minutes not knowing if there
[41:45.840 --> 41:53.680]  is another bomb there number two security allowing us to take our carrion bags off the plane uh into
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.640]  the the place where we were being held and we stood there with all of our bags together
[41:59.440 --> 42:06.640]  for an hour until the bomb sniffing dogs arrived uh and then you know after they found one well
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.880]  then we're moved to another area and now they don't want to talk about the man uh who you know who
[42:12.880 --> 42:18.400]  was taken away you know i've repeated this many many many times there's no explanation for any of
[42:18.400 --> 42:24.960]  this except for these stories that keep changing so make of that what you will but you know i'm
[42:24.960 --> 42:31.200]  kind of irritated about it and then i see on tv today uh i didn't catch the man's name but the

[47:29.920 --> 47:35.440]  his father had gone to the embassy repeatedly had said my son is training with terrorist
[47:35.440 --> 47:43.200]  in yemen you've got to stop him and he was not even put on the terror list but congressman get
[47:43.200 --> 47:49.040]  put on it over a million americans can't fly it's a list you don't know how you get on it you don't
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.760]  know how to get off guilty until never proven innocent you're just a slave a nameless slave
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.760]  and you have thousands of troops massing in and around yemen you have us airstrikes being prepared
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.080]  you have the media saying we may go to war with yemen in the week before this and then this bombing
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.520]  comes along the perfect pretext for it and you've got eyewitnesses of the sharp dressed man bringing
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  the underwear bomber up saying he doesn't have a passport but let him on the plane he gets on
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.520]  witnesses report someone videotaping the whole flight aimed at the underwear bomber then during
[48:21.520 --> 48:28.000]  the flight then during the attack the fbi says there are no videos they say uh that there was no
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.840]  one taping despite other witnesses saying this and then they're impeached they're caught saying no one
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.040]  was detained we didn't say somebody had a bomb no one was taken away uh we didn't tell people get
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.880]  out of here for your safety once they landed in Detroit and now they've changed their story and
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.120]  said okay we did detain somebody but for a passport issue but the bomb sniffing dog that
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.120]  mr haskell and his wife saw went over to the guy's bag that's why they took him away so now they've
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.640]  changed their story five times go over the five different stories kurt haskell again who was on
[49:02.640 --> 49:10.320]  board uh flight 253 break down the five different stories we've heard okay i'll i'll try it's getting
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.480]  hard for me to remember them and and you got cut off by the break you got cut off by the break to
[49:14.480 --> 49:19.600]  finish that point if you need to um you okay just briefly i'm gonna finish my last point
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.960]  uh white house eight brennan i saw on tv this morning clarifying a point made early in the
[49:24.960 --> 49:31.360]  week by janin apolitano and please don't take me take this as a shot at the current administration
[49:31.360 --> 49:38.560]  i'm making no claims um to what my political um alliances are as you said you just want the truth
[49:38.560 --> 49:42.960]  go ahead i just want the truth i take issue with the statement and the statement earlier in the
[49:42.960 --> 49:49.760]  week was our system worked and now eight uh eight john brennan says well no our system worked
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.720]  after the incident and to me what happened after the incident as i've been explaining
[49:54.720 --> 50:00.640]  before the break was this utter chaos i can't see how they they can say anything worked at all
[50:00.640 --> 50:05.120]  there's a complete disaster nobody knew what they're doing nobody knew who was in charge
[50:06.080 --> 50:11.360]  they let us into the airport with our bags that might have and probably did have a bomb in one of
[50:11.360 --> 50:20.640]  them um they they didn't search our bags by hand ever uh they they had the alleged video made on
[50:20.640 --> 50:25.120]  the flight there with us that they could have seized they didn't do that even though a fellow
[50:25.120 --> 50:29.760]  passenger of mine point pointed out that the man could have only been in four possible seats
[50:30.640 --> 50:36.480]  they did nothing to find that out to see who that was there's an utter disaster so i really
[50:36.480 --> 50:43.600]  take issue with that point now the five versions well the first version was that the man in
[50:43.600 --> 50:51.600]  orange didn't exist at all i believe it's four days until they even admitted he existed in fact
[50:51.600 --> 50:57.120]  you had the fbi at your office and they didn't want to discuss that person that's right when they came
[50:57.120 --> 51:02.080]  to my office on tuesday i said they showed me a picture of a person i said well i can't say for
[51:02.080 --> 51:07.920]  sure but it kind of looks like the guy um that you took away in handcuffs that you refuse to admit
[51:07.920 --> 51:14.000]  admitted this later that day well i believe it's later that day or the next morning version two
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.360]  came out which was yes there was a man on her flight taken away being held and definitely on
[51:19.360 --> 51:26.560]  immigration charges then version three came out i believe it was later that same day let's be clear
[51:26.560 --> 51:30.800]  you were there they didn't stop him for immigration violations the dog went over and sat down in front
[51:30.800 --> 51:38.640]  of his bag the alert for explosives right unless this is a passport sniffing dog apparently apparently
[51:38.640 --> 51:43.520]  apparently this is some kind of wonder dog that can snap papers and read them with his nose i don't
[51:43.520 --> 51:51.920]  know version number three was that um this man was from another flight which was impossible we
[51:51.920 --> 51:56.800]  were kind of quarantined there was no one else around anywhere i mean this is you know the biggest
[51:56.800 --> 52:01.120]  investigation so then they gave another story they said we've taken him away then there's another story
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.560]  it was another flight right story three was that it was another flight and after i went on the
[52:06.560 --> 52:12.800]  internet writing a blog about that claiming how was impossible and telling them i anxiously away
[52:12.800 --> 52:20.480]  version four i was surprised to get version four and five within the next day and i'm trying to
[52:20.480 --> 52:28.800]  think what those were but i think version four was um yes there was a man taken away from our flight
[52:28.800 --> 52:33.920]  but we searched him and questioned him and found nothing there was another man taking away from
[52:33.920 --> 52:42.640]  another flight and he's being held or something like that and version five was yes we took someone
[52:42.640 --> 52:50.160]  away but it was due to having some agricultural issue with bringing food in the country something
[52:50.160 --> 52:54.560]  like that i can't remember it exactly but i i laid out well in my blog oh so now the bomb
[52:54.560 --> 53:00.800]  sniffing dog now the bomb sniffing dog is a agriculture food sniffing dog right right and i
[53:00.800 --> 53:06.320]  think they even said them that man was also from another flight i believe okay now now here's the
[53:06.320 --> 53:11.360]  big issue you and other people saw this guy let away there have been quite a few of your fellow
[53:11.360 --> 53:16.000]  passengers say no we saw him they ushered us out for our safety so they started having to change
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.840]  their story uh this is a huge story one of the biggest out there the fbis on this full time
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.760]  they know what's going on why are they being dishonest there and and and how do we investigate
[53:27.760 --> 53:34.240]  this when the investigators themselves are engaged in clear obstruction of the truth well
[53:34.960 --> 53:43.680]  you know i don't know how to take it it's either uh utter and utter incompetence or uh intentional
[53:43.680 --> 53:49.280]  intentionally hiding something you know and i don't know how to take it but uh i i can see why
[53:49.280 --> 53:54.080]  they don't want to comment on it and their story keeps changing because there's really no other
[53:54.080 --> 54:00.880]  explanation now when the fbi came to your house or came to your office last week uh tuesday because
[54:00.880 --> 54:04.240]  i talked to you right after they'd been there you were live on the radio with us right after they
[54:04.240 --> 54:10.320]  left uh you you brought up the guy in orange in detroit in customs you brought up the sharp dressed
[54:10.320 --> 54:18.400]  man in amsterdam helping uh the the reported bomber get on uh the plane uh you brought up all of this
[54:18.400 --> 54:24.720]  you said just show the footage and still we're now what eight nine days into this and we still
[54:24.720 --> 54:31.600]  haven't seen the amsterdam footage exactly and i'm really not too happy with that you know if somebody
[54:31.600 --> 54:38.160]  robs a bank or holds up a gas station well there's video footage of the the incident on the 11 o'clock
[54:38.160 --> 54:45.040]  news usually that very night uh you know if if i'm not correct well show the video what are you
[54:45.040 --> 54:49.600]  hiding show the video show that hey mr. Haskell is not correct here that's right because they've
[54:49.600 --> 54:55.120]  been telling you they've been telling you you didn't see that they didn't say uh according to
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.400]  the pressure reports i've seen you correct me if i'm wrong they didn't say oh we'll look at that
[54:58.400 --> 55:03.440]  they just said no there was no one helping him which is very suspicious instead of just putting
[55:03.440 --> 55:10.160]  the footage out right you know if if they're in fact uh it's footage which i believe they said
[55:10.160 --> 55:15.360]  they've already reviewed and they think that i'm wrong well just put it out there and show that i'm
[55:15.360 --> 55:20.240]  wrong well you would think everyone two three minutes long you know the media you know the
[55:20.240 --> 55:27.920]  media is clamoring to see uh the underwear bomber oh absolutely so where is it i mean i mean the
[55:27.920 --> 55:34.080]  people demand it well and also why aren't we seeing the video of when he's going through
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.480]  uh metal detector passport check you know and boarding you know they have all these videos
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.040]  or you would think i mean you know this is a modern airport you think they would have video of all
[55:45.040 --> 55:51.440]  this of some sort well current i know you don't i know you don't like to speculate sure but but
[55:51.440 --> 55:56.400]  having the fbi come to your office having them not want to discuss these issues now seeing them
[55:56.400 --> 56:02.880]  tell five different stories uh all of this stinks to high heaven we've had other high profile bombers
[56:02.880 --> 56:08.560]  that get on planes who were also shuttled on and protected from my research this has all the
[56:08.560 --> 56:15.040]  the earmarks of a provocateur operation or where the underwear bomber thought he was part of a drill
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.400]  or something we've seen previous things then this is used to sell the domestic police state to sell
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.000]  new wars to sell body scanners in the airports that were that literally record a naked image of your
[56:26.000 --> 56:32.160]  body 360 everyone's resisting this now and then right on time right as the body scanners
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.560]  were scheduled to go in in january nationwide that was already scheduled folks they're they're
[56:36.560 --> 56:41.360]  saying on the news oh now we're doing this yeah these million dollar machines now i went and looked
[56:41.360 --> 56:46.960]  it up they were scheduled to go in the additional 214 airports they were in less than 20 in the
[56:46.960 --> 56:52.880]  us before now they're going in nationwide at all major airports right on time with this happening
[56:52.880 --> 56:59.840]  mr haskell well you know you know i can't comment on that um even myself just coming out and stating
[56:59.840 --> 57:06.880]  what i saw over and over again i have a a significant portion of the country that are just continually
[57:06.880 --> 57:12.800]  taking shots of me left and left and right uh you know obviously i can't make any comments on
[57:12.800 --> 57:18.000]  something that no i understand but but clearly on record you're calling for a real open investigation

[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:09.200]  underwear bomber you were finishing up with saying i'm just glad to be alive i'm just trying to tell
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:14.640]  the truth of what i saw and and i was asking the question is this an ongoing cover-up and how
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.120]  do we have a real investigation if the government charged with investigating are the ones covering
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.400]  up well that's a good point and i i just want to state how else am i to take um take it when
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:31.440]  every time i put something out in the media a new story comes out it happened you know they've had
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:37.440]  five versions of this story all i can think is you know they want to put misinformation out there
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:42.800]  to refute what i'm saying or it's just gross incompetence they can't figure out what actually
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:48.240]  is going on i mean what explanation is there besides that you know i don't know i i don't know
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:54.720]  what else to say on that um but you know i'm just glad to be alive i'm trying to get the story out
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.040]  there and i i just want a full investigation i know a lot of people are taking shots at me
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:03.840]  i really can't understand why you know i've put my entire career it's called co-intel
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:09.760]  plus sir sir it's on record the government has hundreds of thousands of private corporations
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:14.240]  and contractors hundreds of thousands working for private contractors who go out and just throw

[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:08.000]  times and i really don't understand it because i tell you know you have the same story no matter
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:14.800]  what show i'm on it's tv if it's radio if it's a news reporter it's the same story and i really
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:20.000]  understand that and they want to isolate everybody and not have all of us communicating they want to
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.720]  be the gatekeepers who says who can talk to who who can do what and just one other statement on that
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:33.680]  point every single request that i've gotten i've complied with every interview every show radio or
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:39.040]  tv i don't discriminate not that i don't like your show i'm just pointing that out to the people
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:43.680]  that are taking shots at me well i just wouldn't spend your time even responding to the government
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:48.720]  operatives most of them are sir uh kurt haskell thank you so much for spending time with us and

[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:58.560]  anytime take care there goes kurt haskell we'll come back this is alex jones with five good
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:03.760]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:09.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:14.400]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.840]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:25.520]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:30.640]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:35.200]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:39.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:46.880]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:51.920]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[1:05:51.920 --> 1:06:02.720]  backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 from his central texas command center deep behind enemy
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:08.960]  lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:15.920]  coming up towards the end of the broadcast i'm going to get into what's happening the democratic
[1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:24.800]  party national polls show between 55 and 70 plus percent depending on the poll are vehemently against
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:29.840]  the government takeover of health care and with every passing week those numbers are shifting
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:37.360]  more and more towards a super majority of americans so every week the numbers of people in the polls
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:43.280]  against government running health care increases that's why the democrats are so desperate to
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:53.520]  ram this through now because even the democratic party chairman has come out and said that he is
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:58.000]  against the bill denise casinich one of the most liberal people in congress has said they're against
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:03.840]  it when you can't get howard dean or denise casinich for your socialist bill you got a problem
[1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:09.280]  because it's not even a socialist bill i don't like socialism because it makes people dependent
[1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:13.360]  it creates corruption any big pool of money special interest you're going to get their
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:18.720]  snouts in you don't have to wait for special interest to mine in and burrow into this this
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:25.600]  takeover of one seventh conservatively some estimates are one sixth it was written by the
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.440]  insurance company and banks they make you get insurance they make the rates go up they increase
[1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:38.720]  your taxes and then it actually gives them immunity from prosecution a massive immunity in many forms
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:46.880]  of suits for not giving good care it's horrible it's horrible but they're set to go to conference
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:52.000]  this week and try to ram it through so that is coming up some stations don't carry the first
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.440]  five minutes of each hour they carry news but we do do the first five minutes then we have a one
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:03.920]  minute break come back at six after if you missed it mr haskell one of the survivors of flight 253
[1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:07.920]  finished up what he had to say and they'll be joining us again later in the week as the fbi
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:17.520]  continues to change their story more than a victoria secret model changes what they're wearing
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:26.320]  when they do a runway event i mean they're changing in every five minutes but just finishing up on
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:32.320]  the new wars being launched by obama he's continuing rendition secret arrest torture
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:38.000]  expanding that expanding the patriot act expanding all the major wars saying they're getting ready
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:45.280]  to go into yemen and somalia and sudan the biggest defense budget ever bigger than all
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:51.520]  50 states budgets combined the government's bankrupt the banks are looting everything
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:57.120]  obama has spent in less than a year in office a little over 11 months in office this is some
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:04.160]  january 21st it'll be one year in office he has spent more than all presidents before him combined
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:09.360]  in less than a year and he did that eight months in that number is an eight month number
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:15.760]  so that's from three months ago more than all presidents before him back to george washington
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:22.800]  so that is something we're going to be covering and going over they want to bankrupt you big
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:29.040]  offshore banks want an insolvent country just like they finance countries to do deals with the
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:33.680]  imf and world bank where they create all this fiat currency out of nothing backed up by us
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:40.720]  taxpayers they go in the third world countries whether it be brazil or nigeria or indonesia
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:47.040]  they run up these giant bills and you'll have a billion dollar loan and nigeria ends up paying
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:53.360]  30 40 50 even 60 billion dollars back on it the same thing is now being done to our republic
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.760]  now i'm going to open the phones up here in just a moment we're going to carol michael jonathan
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:03.840]  david paul kim nigel chris ceo billy bob and others but please have your question or comment
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:08.960]  quickly fired out or moving to the next person i did want to finish up with this cnn report
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:15.200]  that our guest was mentioning us terrorism's are christmas day plot not like 9 11 this is a
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:23.040]  transcript of his interview on uh seeing in and their state of the union program it's not like
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:29.760]  9 11 brennan said the terrors are adding that the system didn't work as it should have due to lapses
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:36.960]  in human error this wasn't an effort to try to conceal information not like 9 11 what does that mean
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:43.840]  i mean look at this this folks the more security i mean even even if you believe this is all
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:49.680]  incompetence the more liberty we give up the more terrorism we get but if government knows it can
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:54.960]  stage a few events or let a few terrorists get through and then use it to give their buddies
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:59.680]  hundreds of billions of dollars a year in airport scanner and security money the government gives
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:03.840]  this to their cronies it's a revolving door to people in the pentagon and justice department
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:10.320]  they all then revolve in and out of government into these security firms and and big defense firms
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:15.680]  that are really taking over that market and they have an incentive for terror an incentive for fear
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:22.080]  but you look at the pre bombing run-up of propaganda against yemen you look at the
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.960]  hype about terrorism you look at obama now saying get ready for biological attack today
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:32.880]  i mean all of this is going on in fact here's one of those reports obama orders u.s government to
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:39.680]  begin preparing for biological attack this is how the government takes your liberties and says oh
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:47.760]  it's it's being done to keep you safe let's go to uh calvin in ohio calvin you're on the air
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:55.520]  welcome uh yes sir uh i just wanted to make a comment that here my local news um right after
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:02.240]  the the underwear bombing the very next day they reported the Taliban turned around and bombed
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:12.640]  a CIA building say that again right at my local news here in ohio um channel 10 had reported
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:19.680]  one day about the underwear bomber and in the very next day they started reporting about how
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:24.800]  the Taliban attacked the CIA embassy building oh yes over in afghanistan well it wasn't really
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:32.560]  an embassy building it was a former soviet airfield in prison uh and it killed eight cia
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:37.760]  employees but i appreciate your call and that was probably a real terror attack
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:46.400]  because the cia admittedly has been inside pakistan bombing weddings and other public events
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:52.880]  and those people are all about vendetta's and those particular tribes and that's what they're
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:58.800]  saying they're saying this is of vendetta for killing our families and that's the problem being
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:04.080]  in all these countries it creates real terrorism and the system knows that let's take another call
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:09.680]  thank you uh calvin i'm glad you brought that up let's talk to carol in california carol you're
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:16.080]  on the air go ahead yeah i'd just like to say gratitude to you um and to mr haskell for speaking
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:22.080]  the truth having the courage to be the example for all of us to stand up and do the same sir i
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:30.400]  could go on for eon i'd like to say that the people have the right in the republic to act in commerce
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:36.080]  to take back our sovereignty and it is important that we do the research so that we can stand in
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:42.640]  peace and combat them with peaceful means that arms are not the only way to go and i i could go on
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:47.280]  forever but thank you so much for speaking up and speaking for the truth carol thank you good
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:53.040]  to talk to you in 2010 i'll tell you one way to take things back in commerce ten years ago you

[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:05.280]  sometimes even more is organic that's uh ten years ago you couldn't find milk that didn't have
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:10.720]  bovine growth hormone in it making our kids go into puberty when they're seven eight years old
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:19.280]  old now there's a tiny little area in the cold case the refrigerated dairy case of the gmo
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:26.800]  milk and there's four or five six big cases full of different varieties of organic milk
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:34.080]  or at least non non-harmon milk natural milk and it's the same thing with so many issues
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:39.840]  you vote with your dollars supports alternative media buy the books and videos that i've written

[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:06.640]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:16.320]  okay to answer michael's questions from california
[1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:24.080]  in the last three years we've seen fox news sky tv bbc and others
[1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:37.280]  come out and say white al-qaeda is working with al-qaeda
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:46.960]  and in one clip they used on fox it showed a british government training video where the
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:52.960]  military was dressed up with ski mask with bazookas uh showing what a terror training camp might
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:58.160]  look like but people weren't told that i had to go look it up and so what they do is they tell the
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:08.080]  public this has all been set up for people that are different from you people overseas we're not
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:13.200]  taking your rights we're just setting up this police state to fight you know these evil people
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:19.360]  overseas that live in caves that made norad stand down on 9 11 and all this other baloney but then
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:23.600]  when you get the homeland security documents the mayac reports remember all those earlier last
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:28.960]  year that we got that we broke that the fbi had to admit were real were their main internal
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:33.920]  focus is gun owners conservatives libertarians that's who's being tracked that's who's being
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:39.760]  controlled and so yes more and more we're being told terrorists can look like anybody but going
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:46.880]  back to 2001 2002 all these training manuals even the public ones for police say don't trust a woman
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:53.280]  with a baby carriage don't trust a priest don't trust anybody or anybody could be al-qaeda and so
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.720]  that's happening now on a totally different subject of illuminati symbolism i like to be careful about
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:07.760]  this because people can go overboard with it like i'll make films about the new world order
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:15.040]  and then i'll say we will defeat the new world order and i'll show an all-seeing eye in pyramid
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:20.720]  saying terror storm and then all these websites get created going look he's got illuminati
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:26.960]  programming in his film he's got hidden symbols they're not hidden a big giant pyramid when i'm
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:31.920]  talking about the new world order in their system and their symbol being a pyramid of command and
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:38.480]  control compartmentalization i'm going to show you an all-seeing eye pyramid they've done reviews
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:44.880]  of my film order of death where the whole thing is about illuminati symbolism it's about exposing
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:52.640]  it so people go look he's showing symbolism i was a consultant on a scanner darkly and
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:57.600]  they wanted to point out that it was like an illuminati type future where the government
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.640]  puts out the drugs through a private corporation that then basically turns you into a brainwash
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:08.000]  zombie and then the government controls the rehabs the work camps it makes you a slave
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.280]  so they sell you the drugs it ruins your brain makes you a zombie and then they use you as a slave
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:18.640]  it's a philip k dick book hate to give it you know give away the end of the movie but that's
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:25.920]  this that's the storyline and i consulted some on the high tech aspects of it on the surveillance
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:30.480]  aspect of it i'm also in the film with keanu reeves when on a rider woody harrelson and others
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.600]  and there's illuminati symbolism throughout it we're saying it's the illuminati it's the illuminati
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:44.000]  i mean a guy wearing a shirt with an all-seeing eye on it illuminati symbolism on the walls that's
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:53.200]  out in the open we're saying it's the illuminati it's the new world order okay now that said
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:24:02.160]  there is massive symbolism the symbol for cbs and all these major logos being all see eye all
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:06.080]  seeing eyes all these top rappers and you guys found a video clip of that play it for the prison
[1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:10.960]  planet dot tv viewers in the background now we were playing it earlier and you see them doing
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:17.680]  all these gang signs illuminati signs in their films and you know that's saying you know we're
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:25.120]  down with it we're on the inside track uh of course because there's so much power associated
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:33.280]  with the new world order and the illuminati that people are then going to mimic it they're going
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:41.360]  to they're going to imitate it now that said i gave you guys a group of printouts when i got
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:47.520]  into the office today i hadn't stapled them yet did you staple those oh good here's the stack
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:56.800]  i actually went to the library of congress it's not in this stack i actually went to the
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:03.280]  library of congress and later in the week i am going to do a little ten minute piece on the
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:09.120]  weekday show while we're simulcasting at prison planet dot tv so people can actually see it and
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.120]  i want to prepare for it i want to have it all preloaded in the computer so we can do it in a
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:18.800]  graceful way and go over all of it i want to engage in a defense of george washington
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:25.200]  because last week i did a little short ten minute tribute to george washington
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:30.880]  and at the founding of our country and how he was offered to be the king of the colonies and he said
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:40.320]  no and then i got all these emails and comments saying alex george washington was illuminati
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:47.200]  look there's this quote about him saying i am satisfied with the fact that the illuminati
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:53.200]  is operating in the united states well you just don't know classical english of that day our english
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:26:00.720]  has changed he was saying i am satisfied that this is going on meaning yes i agree this is going on
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:07.040]  and so i went to the library of congress online and there are more than 20 letters
[1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:15.040]  by george washington where he speaks of the illuminati and in that very letter that everyone
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:22.560]  uses against him the scan of the letter he is writing letters in fact they did find it
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:28.720]  i i aimed it to him that there is the letter he is writing to people he wrote hundreds of these
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:33.680]  but library of congress has 20 or so that i could find warning them and so
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:41.040]  they use this famous quote and take it out of context for what the quote clearly means
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:47.600]  preying on people who aren't aware of how classical english worked
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:53.600]  and then they ignore the very next paragraph where he says the illuminati and jackabins are
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:58.880]  of the worst sorts and horrible criminals and we must stop them taking over america
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:05.840]  see there's the copy of the letter and there's a whole bunch of them i spent like three hours i
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:17.200]  couldn't quit reading these friday night so what he said is in this letter it says if you've ever
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:22.080]  doubted the existence of the illuminati order there are archives from george washington's self
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:28.080]  which proved not only they exist but they were intensely active in america and this site that
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:33.920]  wrote about it is very accurate in that that's a whole nother controversy here people keep acting
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:41.280]  like the illuminati doesn't exist or didn't ever exist when it was the main issue of the day
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:50.160]  the 1770s through 1820 or so and i had read countless mainline history books where george
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:55.120]  washington was fighting the illuminati i had read text of his letters i had never actually
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:59.440]  looked at the letters the scans the letters themselves so what people do is they take out
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:06.800]  of context the following it was not my intention to doubt the doctrines of the illuminati and
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:13.120]  principles of jackabism had not spread to the united states so people take it out of context
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.120]  to make it sound like he's saying they're good it was not my intention to doubt the doctrines
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:22.080]  of the illuminati then they stop he's saying i'm not doubting that they're going on in the
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.800]  united states it was not my intention to doubt that the doctrines of the illuminati and the
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:32.000]  doctrines of the illuminati and the principles of jackabism have not spread to the united states on
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:39.040]  the contrary no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than i am and and they they pray on ignorant
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.920]  people and say that satisfied means he likes it and we say i'm satisfied at the fact that they're
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:47.920]  operating here in the united states and later in the week i'll read the rest of the letter where he
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:29:00.000]  then calls in the worst type of scum that must be stopped
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.920]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator

[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.880]  aware of that because for more than a decade we've been covering in here there was a illuminati
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:39.040]  infiltration of our government washington writes about that his last year as the president saying
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:44.800]  we must stop these people yes he was a mason that doesn't mean all masons were members of the illuminati
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:51.280]  the illuminati used their secret society system to take over and there were a lot of people in
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:56.080]  europe who were angry at the monarchs tired of the corruption tired of the church's corruption
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:04.160]  tired of the inquisitors and so if you read the illuminati documents in germany one of
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.240]  their letter carriers got struck by lightning that's how the conspiracy was made public
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:13.920]  it said oh we're manipulating all these good men the best people in society are now working with us
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:18.880]  you know but they don't know that we plan to take over government and put ourselves in the thrones
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:24.720]  you see so it was a sophisticated system you had a rebellion against tyranny happening
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:30.080]  so of course corrupt scammers went in and tried to take that over and of course
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.200]  benjamin franklin being the us ambassador to france then the ambassador to england of course he
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:41.760]  was going to be involved in all these intrigues and that's what washington later discovered
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:47.600]  years later and put an end to and there's clear evidence that he was blood to death he was murdered
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:51.680]  by one of their operatives who was a who was an attending physician and there's a whole
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:57.120]  another subject there the issue is the bill of rights and constitution is good the globalists
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:03.280]  today are getting rid of it and we need to get our bill of rights and constitution back
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:09.600]  regardless but it's not fair to use these letters and just say where he says yes i'm satisfied
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:15.520]  of the fact that the illuminati is operating here in the united states well of course he's saying
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:19.280]  i'm satisfied they're operating then he goes on to say these are the worst type of people
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:23.600]  and they've got to be stopped i mean go to the library of congress yourself you know i said
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:27.920]  i was going to take calls and now one guy's questions taking me on a ten minute rant folks
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:32.880]  i can't answer long questions because i want to get to everybody jonathan in texas you're on the
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:40.640]  here go ahead uh yes sir uh thank you for taking my call uh my question is is there an alliance
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:51.360]  or a slight rift between you and the likes of beck limb ball and savage who are also inspiring a lot
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:57.840]  of other red white and blue americans to wake up because wouldn't the rift just complicate things
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:05.200]  more or an alliance help more because they are not people like the cnbc people who bash republican
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:09.440]  people that's my question thank you you know incredibly important question i'm going to draw
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:15.680]  a picture here guys give me a camera shot for tv viewers at prisonplanet.tv and for radio listeners
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:22.160]  will later post a youtube of this up on the side for everybody here's the deal i am an alternative
[1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:29.040]  of grass roots radio host who is not part of the left right paradigm i don't let myself
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:36.800]  be put in a box okay now it would appear that i'm allies with rush limb ball glenn beck
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.800]  michael savage and others right now because i'm opposing government takeover of health care
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:48.560]  because i'm opposing the copenhagen global carbon tax treaty uh because i'm opposing
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:55.520]  everything obama's doing limb ball beck and others aren't opposing obama on the war they're
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:00.160]  saying he's not doing enough that that then gives him left cover when the guy's actually the biggest
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.960]  defense budget ever expanding all these wars that bankrupt our country and destroy our security
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:12.720]  in the left right paradigm you've got the left on one end and you've got the right on the other end
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:20.880]  okay you've got the left on one end you've got the right on the other end and they keep everybody
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:34.240]  contained within this system i am outside of this system there are some truths within the
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:39.600]  left right argument but the main fight in the left right argument is the republicans and
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:45.920]  the democrats controlled by special interest fighting with each other for control of the
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:52.960]  political system and so when a republicans empower the government triples in size and
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:38:00.800]  we launch all these wars and we lose freedom and then when democrats get in power they expand
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:05.760]  the size of government and they expand the wars and we lose more freedoms but the rhetoric is
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:14.320]  different now when the democrats were in power they were opposed to the war to the patreon
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:22.480]  act to warrantless spying to the police state to torture and a lobbyist now that they're in power
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:28.560]  therefore at all and have taken it even further than bush now that republicans are out of power
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:32.960]  they want to be with the people with rhetoric that's popular hey we don't want world government we
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:38.640]  don't want government health care we don't want carbon taxes but as soon as they're in power unless
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:43.840]  we really get real leadership in there it is only going to continue and then the democrats will
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:49.600]  suddenly be anti-establishment i'm anti-establishment and a constitutionalist no matter who's in power
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:55.200]  if george bush violates the constitution i exposing if barack obama violates constitution
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.720]  i exposing when george bush is under the control of offshore private interest i exposing when bill
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:07.120]  clinton's in power i exposing when barack obama's in power i expose him you know if if general
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:16.400]  patreus is in power in three years i'll expose him or if it's mit romney or whoever it is i expose
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:24.480]  him i'm into facts i'm into issues i'm into how things actually work okay and i know that the
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:28.720]  government gets bigger and we lose freedoms no matter who is in there because a global private
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:35.840]  interest look things have changed though at least limbaugh and beck and savage could say there was
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:40.640]  no new world order the cfr didn't warrant world government there was no north american union
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:45.520]  for years now because we educated myself and many others mainly the listeners of this show
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.280]  ed and and lewdabs educated so many people he deserves a lot of credit he's a trailblazer
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:56.240]  and look they kicked him off cnn bought him out got rid of him bought out his contract to be precise
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:02.640]  is now because everybody basically knows world government's real they've heard the un call for
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.720]  it now limbaugh and all them look pretty stupid never talking about it so now we're so far down
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:14.960]  the line so deep into this they're now admitting it's real and i commend them for that uh but
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:23.280]  again i i don't sit up here bashing these guys all day of the three you mentioned i think savage
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:28.720]  has always been the best but still he does horrible things like say and i heard him over and over again
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:33.680]  say years ago anyone who disagrees with the government and protest the war is aiding terrorist
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:38.800]  you should be arrested and put in a camp and we shouldn't have to pay for you in a camp so it
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:44.880]  should be forced labor now that's basically word for word that is 180 degrees the opposite of liberty
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:51.040]  let me close shot again guys you know here's liberty and freedom over here and here's tyranny
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:41:01.760]  over here when bush was in power savage and others were supporting total tyranny now that
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:07.760]  obama's in power savage gets up on his show and says the government may stage terror attacks to
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:15.840]  take our freedoms see now he's on the side of liberty i haven't seen anything that truthful
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:21.200]  out of the other two all i'm saying is in three years when you get a republican you're gonna
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:29.120]  hate me a lot of you republicans now love me just like democrats liked me when bush was in
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:37.280]  and then when republicans get in you're gonna hate me liberals hate me now conservatives love me
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:42.640]  folks you gotta grow up i mean come on i mean somehow you've got to grow up and get the facts
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:49.120]  somehow you've got a shadow of the left right paradigm please somehow you've got to see what's
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:54.800]  happening you got two parties fighting over power and paychecks they get from offshore interest
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:00.480]  that's it the government's too big it's rotten it's corrupt they have declassified that our criminal
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:06.800]  government has staged terror attacks it's an army manuals how to stage terror attacks for officers
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:13.840]  folks all i do is report the facts okay we're in a lot of trouble we've been robbed criminal
[1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:17.840]  interests don't want you to get control of your government because then they'd be prosecuted so
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:21.520]  they want to set up a tyranny so they get away with it let's jam in a call i'm gonna go to break

[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:34.560]  politically of washington's victory at trinton and it was it's a giant victory against the globalist
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:40.000]  they were staking everything on this and it blew up and their whole fraud to set up taxes
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:45.600]  on every facet of our lives is in trouble well you know that's an excellent analogy and that's
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:50.480]  why you're sitting in the chair you're sitting in there brother you know i i think what we need
[1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:56.080]  you know we don't need we don't need a bunch of public selves in a big building that calls itself
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:53:01.200]  un that pretends to look over us we need some sort of a citizens executive council i mean we've
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:05.120]  got you've got some good people they're on paul and and you know percentage they've been doing

[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:15.440]  talked about a global freedom party based in each nation that pushes for sovereignty and
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:21.840]  liberty against the new world order and and excellent yeah that is moving forward oh great
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:28.160]  you know we we we were showing a very strong non-confidence of government not not just government
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:34.400]  but the individuals exactly congress has an 11 percent approval rating they're doing the opposite
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:38.400]  of what the people want the opposite of what's constitutional good to hear from you see you'll

[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:09.280]  exponential thing and the applied force will become exponential uh and uh they've had it
[1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:17.360]  these ivory tower clowns uh they're they're 40 or 50 years behind i do not give them the credit that
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:23.760]  too many people do they're they're old school are too old school and and this is a new millennium and
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:28.960]  even going back from the new new millennium to george washington the father of our country
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:34.960]  i mean if we've got them boxed in well we've got them boxed in if we take action it's true
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:40.160]  that the pendulum was swinging towards tyranny that woke a lot of people up and now the pendulum
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:46.720]  stopped at copenhagen and is beginning to swing back towards freedom if we take the initiative

[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:20.240]  titled us marshal law in january 2010 an article states that federal reserve bank will be disbanded
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:25.680]  replaced by the world bank at the end of 2010 january 2010 causing american dollar to value
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:33.760]  by 50 percent who wrote it who wrote it it says submitted by mauser but the person that posted
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.800]  it isn't who wrote it what's the what's the source um i don't have it here i've printed it off all
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:44.080]  right i'm gonna let you go and comment on that quickly when they got body scanners in the airports
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:48.160]  and police are taking blood without warrants and babies blood at birth without warrants of all
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.960]  children born when we've got gmo food that's killing us on our store shelves when we've got a
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:58.000]  government that arrests people and tortures them and then puts them on trial that is marshal law
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  don't ever look for them to announce it when we have military running checkpoints all over the
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.200]  country and it's not even a big news item that's marshal law it's what increment of marshal law
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:12.320]  yes the dollar's dead that's why the bankers are buying everything up while it still has some value
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:20.560]  but to put dates on it i don't know but definitely this the real economy is imploding joblessness
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  is up they're printing tens of trillions pumping it out there it's like a sugar high and yes they
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  want to implode our economy to bring us into world government that's in their own documents and
