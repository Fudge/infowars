[08:33.920 --> 08:38.920]  well Attorney General Holder has told Russia that they won't torture or kill
[08:38.920 --> 08:44.400]  Snowden so that means they will torture or kill Snowden for telling the world
[08:44.400 --> 08:48.320]  what everybody already knew he's really in trouble for saying it's illegal and
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.520]  authoritarian that they're targeting Congress and targeting the media something
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.320]  we already knew they're saying it's illegal to talk about what the
[08:57.320 --> 09:02.240]  criminals are doing but Russia says they won't extradite because the US is a
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.720]  country known to be run by criminals known to be hijacked to or even
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.120]  authoritarian Russia I can't even imagine the type of crimes that the
[09:12.120 --> 09:18.160]  banker occupied us engages in admitted torture of children admitted white
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.880]  slavery programs admitted narcotics trafficking admitted murder of
[09:23.880 --> 09:30.520]  journalists it just admitted crimes on every front of course they killed Michael
[09:30.520 --> 09:36.000]  Hastings I remember back during the Iraq war they attacked the Reuters hotel the
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.680]  very floor they were on on record in front of journalists said target Reuters
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.160]  and kill them and they had Abrams tanks open up on them from a few hundred
[09:44.160 --> 09:49.880]  yards away basically point-blank range and we forget all this we forget them
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.920]  this is not our government and the minute we wake up from that nightmare the
[09:54.920 --> 10:01.880]  minute it can all stop how Nancy Pelosi saved the NSA surveillance program
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.120]  foreign policy publication of Washington Post basically a CFR publication
[10:06.120 --> 10:13.240]  praises her she's such a great lady it's so trendy and here's another one of
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.440]  the defense one the NSA's new spy facilities are seven times bigger than
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.080]  the Pentagon yeah and that's just the ones in San Antonio Texas and they're
[10:23.080 --> 10:29.840]  also in Utah outside Salt Lake and the one in Fort Meade Maryland others seven
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.840]  times bigger than the Pentagon hundreds of thousands of analysts the only part
[10:35.840 --> 10:41.280]  of the economy growing like a cancer that's what a smart tyranny does is
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.280]  that it puts things in place so the only jobs are in the tyranny or serving the
[10:46.280 --> 10:50.240]  tyranny and so people make excuses because that's their paycheck we're
[10:50.240 --> 10:57.040]  converting I mean you know the largest segment of federal aid and scholarships
[10:57.040 --> 11:02.720]  the feds give your taxpayer money to the major universities and corporations
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.960]  give endowments and then it's for data mining and secret police activity that's
[11:06.960 --> 11:11.160]  all on record there's people going for degrees they've been graduating now with
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.080]  homeless career degrees for at least 11 years and they're just everywhere you'll
[11:15.080 --> 11:20.400]  be at a restaurant here I'm talking yeah there's Alex Jones I mean there's

[11:28.160 --> 11:35.400]  gonna be in law enforcement but I'm just going to work for the NSA it's just
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.560]  everywhere that's what we do in America that's what we produce that's the service
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.000]  economy even McDonald's is closing restaurants around the US but the new
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.120]  service is tasering you taking you to a FEMA camp spying on you forcing
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.200]  inoculations on you oh it's wonderful government service that we're all all
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.240]  getting and I want to thank the government for all the services all the
[11:59.240 --> 12:04.120]  free services okay let's get into the ultra massive stack of news all posted
[12:04.120 --> 12:12.040]  at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and all incredibly off the charts off the
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.120]  hook important today this is a mega massive news day ladies and gentlemen
[12:16.120 --> 12:20.360]  and no it's not Zuckerberg to call his users dumb efforts and laughed at him
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.840]  with his pump and dump making 3.8 billion today in one day that's up at
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.240]  drudgereport.com and that is important news we're gonna be getting to all of
[12:29.240 --> 12:35.160]  that now this is the news that we're gonna cover first Kit Daniels we got
[12:35.160 --> 12:41.080]  tips about gun shops around the country not able to get 7.6239 and I was up here
[12:41.080 --> 12:44.920]  about five o'clock yesterday in a riders meeting right next door to the
[12:44.920 --> 12:48.520]  studio we got several offices of riders but I was in the one just literally 15
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.840]  feet from where I sit and these tips were coming in and I was like yeah you
[12:51.840 --> 12:55.400]  know I was trying to buy some 7.6239s I don't have enough of that maybe only a
[12:55.400 --> 13:00.000]  thousand rounds of it I said I need and I went to several gun shops a few months
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.680]  ago and they said look our suppliers and they listed the names and told me the
[13:07.680 --> 13:10.520]  companies I even wrote down some names and numbers meaning to give it to the
[13:10.520 --> 13:13.480]  crew and then you put it in the car and it the kids get in it falls on the floor
[13:13.480 --> 13:16.680]  and then you forget about it but I talked to I guess I went to three
[13:16.680 --> 13:20.480]  different shops kind of on a gun buying spree and ammo buying sprees I do
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.800]  occasionally it's I don't gamble I don't have a lot of other compulsions but I
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.440]  go in a gun shop it it's or hunting or fishing place it's it's not pretty I'm
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.360]  just coming I'm like most cavemen that's just kind of how I am and you know
[13:33.360 --> 13:44.840]  throwbacks and so they were all telling me no no no we can't get 7.6239 we can't
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.920]  get the different Russian handguns we can't get the different imported out of
[13:48.920 --> 13:52.640]  Russia or Bulgaria or anywhere it's all being bought up and the word is the
[13:52.640 --> 13:56.120]  Defense Department is buying it all up and it's being put in warehouses and
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.640]  then I talked I actually did later trying to get ammo talked to a big
[13:59.640 --> 14:02.680]  warehouse they said yeah we've just been told the Department of Defense and
[14:02.680 --> 14:05.840]  Homeland Security is getting it all and I said well wait a minute I forgot about
[14:05.840 --> 14:15.480]  this conversation in Weldon Henson's office and I started talking to him and
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.640]  they said yeah and what doesn't make sense is the Defense Department doesn't
[14:19.640 --> 14:27.000]  use 7.6239 or the other Russian Warsaw packed ammo is what it's called the
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.480]  West uses stuff different it was two different competing forces and so I
[14:31.480 --> 14:34.120]  just forgot about it for a few months I guess that's been about actually two
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.040]  three months so it clicks and I go go to the FedBis site and see if they're
[14:39.040 --> 14:48.040]  buying AK-47 ammo boom just one of the purchases upwards of four mil in 7.6239
[14:48.040 --> 14:54.000]  AK-47 ammo and the rifles and the handguns that carry other Russian ammo
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.840]  and folks that's where it's all going so we did a little bit of journalistic
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.640]  work yesterday and by the way it's a bottomless pit there's National Weather
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.720]  Service buying more we're gonna break that in a few minutes he's doing that
[15:06.720 --> 15:10.840]  right now there's that there's so many hundreds of millions more being bought
[15:10.840 --> 15:15.320]  that we can't even keep track of it and whatever the manufacturers can supply
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.600]  they just put more orders in the corner of the market and whatever the Russians
[15:19.600 --> 15:25.160]  and the Chinese can ship from Norinco the most dirty you know you know whatever
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.680]  ammo not saying a wrinkles bad but a lot of stuff out of China is it is all just
[15:29.680 --> 15:37.160]  pouring in yeah there it is FedBis ops AK-47 ammunition dot gov you can read
[15:37.160 --> 15:41.200]  all the numbers and everything it's in our article and it's kind of like we
[15:41.200 --> 15:46.880]  broke two million targets paid for by Homeland Security and the company's
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.560]  mistake was to sell them to the public as well for a few million more of like no
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.240]  more hesitation five-year-old kids pregnant women women in showers and it
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.960]  says to train your cops to kill women and children to desensitize them and it
[15:59.960 --> 16:03.960]  was confirmed the company admitted it and said hey don't blame us no one
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.040]  covered that no one can handle it no one can handle it that broke like six
[16:09.040 --> 16:14.960]  seven months ago no one can handle it and by the way I've got like 15 articles
[16:14.960 --> 16:23.240]  here in the stack or more that are all this insane or more okay US Army buying
[16:23.240 --> 16:30.000]  millions of rounds of Russian ammo and popular civilian firearms compelling
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.160]  proof Department of Defense we should probably add is joining DHS in
[16:35.160 --> 16:39.640]  drying up firearms and ammo supply let's let's say that joining DHS which
[16:39.640 --> 16:42.880]  probably I do editing here on the air kid Daniels at a great job on this
[16:42.880 --> 16:45.880]  wrote this last night and finish it this morning and it goes through all of it
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.560]  and they're not just buying the three plus million rounds of AK-47 they are
[16:51.560 --> 16:58.320]  buying the Makarovs they're just buying everything Makarov ball ammo I mean no
[16:58.320 --> 17:03.000]  NATO country uses that and they're storing it where they're storing it at the
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.200]  Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky and this is just one of the purchases this
[17:07.200 --> 17:13.200]  was a few days ago they they put the bid out and so that's why you can't get it
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.320]  and again I've talked like Weldon's got all the names written back there I need
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.120]  to call that big giant ammo warehouse back what the one in Georgia or there
[17:21.120 --> 17:24.720]  was one in Virginia where they just said all I've been told Department of
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.200]  Defense and this is one of the big warehouses that sells all over the
[17:29.200 --> 17:37.240]  country and then finally we did the story so here it is and and it's just off
[17:37.240 --> 17:40.920]  the charts and saying now let's move on to the next article
[17:40.920 --> 17:47.080]  Obama DHS planned to kill peaceful protesters and sniper attacks this
[17:47.080 --> 17:50.640]  broke a few months ago but since then Homeland Security has confirmed that
[17:50.640 --> 17:57.040]  indeed this is the Federal Bureau of Investigation directive for squads in
[17:57.040 --> 18:01.520]  Houston Jacksonville Florida it's all over the country to prepare contractors
[18:01.520 --> 18:06.040]  feds and police with suppressed sniper rifles and then you can find this on the
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.320]  FedBiz site they've got these thermal you know $10,000 3d scub shoe name it
[18:11.320 --> 18:17.560]  suppressors to to decapitate Occupy Wall Street leadership which itself was
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.680]  just White House funded front groups but because they couldn't control it they
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.120]  then shut it down in DHS raids but they were they had an option to decapitate if
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.760]  the if the crowds got big just like they do in Egypt to kill everyone this is
[18:32.760 --> 18:36.560]  totally legal death squads the entire leadership of the government should be
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.960]  arrested over this it's nothing it's just the rollout of the death squads this
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.480]  is how they create an army of killer feds contractors and police preparing
[18:45.480 --> 18:51.480]  sniper death squads are open mega massive purge in everyone's face and I want
[18:51.480 --> 19:04.800]  that red-linked that should be absolutely red-linked on on info wars.com and
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.000]  we're also going to add at the bottom of the article the film the purge I see
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.520]  they added the text but I don't see the video because I did some editing on it
[19:12.520 --> 19:15.560]  this morning working with a reference on there need to add the film the purge
[19:15.560 --> 19:22.280]  because you watch that film that's fiction 90% of it or more is already
[19:22.280 --> 19:25.240]  happened in Israel when they're showing the targets of these are the targets for
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.040]  no more hesitation of children to shoot them this is your enemy the veterans and
[19:29.040 --> 19:33.840]  gun owners that's all real manuals they just play out and we have real video of
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.520]  FEMA teaching this type of stuff Obama DHS plan to kill peaceful protesters and

[19:42.880 --> 19:46.320]  bars they see if they get Homeland Security and pay them money total

[25:59.400 --> 26:04.840]  that Kurt the regular editor is out sick today it says this is how they create

[26:18.240 --> 26:27.040]  operations and then it continues here with the article the document above was
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.840]  obtained through a freedom of information act request filed by the
[26:32.840 --> 26:38.040]  partnership for civil justice fund you can click to read the document in June
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.440]  info wars.com cited a report by who what why.com revealing to the FBI was aware
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.360]  of an organized possibly local police department or private security company
[26:49.360 --> 26:55.680]  that had plans to assassinate peaceful protesters during the Occupy movement
[26:55.680 --> 27:03.400]  the classified document revealed the FBI was planning quote an identified
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.760]  deleted as of October plan to engage in sniper attacks against protesters in
[27:08.760 --> 27:13.520]  Houston Texas if deemed necessary and identified deleted had received
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.520]  intelligence that indicated the protesters in New York and Seattle plan
[27:17.520 --> 27:23.520]  similar protest in Houston Dallas San Antonio in Austin Texas deleted plan to
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.040]  gather intelligence against the leaders of the protest group and obtain
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.240]  photographs then formulate a plan to kill the leadership via suppressed sniper
[27:31.240 --> 27:36.520]  rifles according to journalist David Linderorf the FBI plan to assassinate
[27:36.520 --> 27:41.200]  the leaders of the now morbid Occupy movement via suppressed sniper rifles
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.640]  they follow up report by Kurt Nemo confirmed via the document the
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.560]  following is a transcript of Alex Jones spoken analysis and it goes on it is
[27:51.560 --> 27:57.560]  essential to understand that information is being declassified on purpose to
[27:57.560 --> 28:01.040]  create a chilling effect against constitutionally protected activities
[28:01.040 --> 28:06.360]  like demonstrations and protest but it's also there to mainline the idea that
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.960]  assassination death squads are operating within America when you have the
[28:10.960 --> 28:16.880]  president shining the NDA a publicly saying we can kill disappear Americans we
[28:16.880 --> 28:21.920]  can torture we can do where we want that can then be given to special forces
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.760]  contractors and others as the rubber stamp authorization but still it's
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.840]  fraudulent we've already been carrying out these types of signature operations
[28:32.840 --> 28:37.920]  in foreign countries so they're so they're very very good at it so again
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.320]  they believe this is legal and lawful in essence this is a public rollout or
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.880]  testing of the waters a trial balloon for death squads to operate openly in
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.720]  America all of this in the name of terrorism when the government itself has
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.480]  become the ultimate terrorist this is a psychological warfare operation it's the
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.320]  police military in the general public it is the mainlining of the normalization
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.080]  of the most barbarous over-the-top illegal activities the government can
[29:05.080 --> 29:11.680]  engage in historically the open premeditated plan to murder peaceful
[29:11.680 --> 29:18.920]  demonstrators on a scale that dwarfs the kins state massacre at those protests
[29:18.920 --> 29:25.400]  this is a test to contractors police and military and feds to see if they will
[29:25.400 --> 29:30.640]  follow standby orders to kill you this is how they are creating an army of
[29:30.640 --> 29:35.920]  killers the police need to know this is a scion aimed at them to see if they will
[29:35.920 --> 29:41.200]  carry out over the top evil we're talking about a truly hijacked road
[29:41.200 --> 29:46.040]  government that's done this clandestinely in the third world for over 60

[33:07.680 --> 33:13.600]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security
[33:15.880 --> 33:21.760]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make

[34:22.600 --> 34:28.040]  talking about federal government contractors and local police with
[34:28.040 --> 34:34.600]  suppressed sniper right rifles to take out the leadership none not take out
[34:34.600 --> 34:41.640]  hostage takers not to just to to kill political opposition and I was reminded
[34:41.640 --> 34:50.920]  the other day when they've somebody dug up a video of myself and others it's
[34:50.920 --> 34:54.640]  over on my cancer archives on YouTube protesting the Ku Klux Klan back in
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.240]  1999 one of my many protests the Klan when they would come out basically fed
[35:00.240 --> 35:04.080]  run to stir up people I would go out and protest them I need to go out and do
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.880]  that some more and in Waco we're sitting there and there and there's a parking
[35:08.880 --> 35:17.840]  garage across from the courthouse and everybody goes look Alex wherever you
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.720]  go the police snipers are aimed at you and so there's video where I start
[35:23.720 --> 35:27.960]  walking over and they're aimed right at me and I'm wearing a t-shirt and pants
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.880]  I'm clearly have no nothing on me they knew who I was no criminal record I was
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.120]  building a memorial church for the Davidians that were murdered I've even
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.600]  interviewed the sheriff before he died who was sad about what happened and so
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.160]  the cops knew who I was and they were aiming the rifle at me and following me
[35:47.160 --> 35:51.000]  with it until I went over with a camera and then they stopped aiming it at me
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.160]  just as pure intimidation and that's what this is all about is the plan under
[35:57.160 --> 36:02.840]  infraguard to even authorize executives and infrastructure protection to be
[36:02.840 --> 36:07.920]  deputized to kill people during a purge and that came out in several magazines
[36:07.920 --> 36:13.320]  about six years ago you can look up the original articles on infraguard so this
[36:13.320 --> 36:17.600]  is all really over-the-top stuff kind of like NDAA secretly kill Americans
[36:17.600 --> 36:22.080]  secretly torture Americans secretly disappear Americans this is real just
[36:22.080 --> 36:27.200]  like America the good guys tortures the good guys spy on you the good guys
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.400]  forcibly inoculate you the good guys kill Pat Tillman and then say he died
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.800]  fighting al-Qaeda and get caught and nobody gets in trouble because it's not
[36:36.800 --> 36:41.960]  the good guys and because we've been so naive we've allowed evil to grow and
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.800]  grow and grow this is not our government these are criminal elements
[36:45.800 --> 36:52.240]  that have hijacked the nation and I know I keep going over that but here are
[36:52.240 --> 36:57.520]  these articles US Army buying millions of rounds of Russian ammo and popular
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.800]  civilian firearms that the US Army has never used and is not part of their
[37:01.800 --> 37:07.360]  arsenal and we've got another article coming out very soon about the National
[37:07.360 --> 37:14.520]  Weather Service again buying more ammo I mean every day there's millions of
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.880]  rounds one day the next day it's a hundred thousand the next day is twenty
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.600]  five thousand the next day it's a half million the next day it's three million
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.160]  I mean it's just every federal agency you can imagine is out there just going
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.320]  completely hog wild insane and how the media discredits this the controlled
[37:29.320 --> 37:32.480]  media is they'll go Alex Jones says there's one point six billion rounds
[37:32.480 --> 37:35.240]  bought in the last year now it's like two billion four hundred million or
[37:35.240 --> 37:40.840]  something and look social security administration just bought two hundred
[37:40.840 --> 37:46.560]  thousand they needed it wasn't one point six so they cherry pick and be like
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.840]  Alex says there's seven people seven million people in the world like line
[37:50.840 --> 38:01.840]  item one of thousand that's not even a good lie you like line item one of
[38:01.840 --> 38:08.480]  thousands of purchases on CNN MSNBC Fox News and say I'm a liar on all these
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.560]  shows so people go oh I've been psychologically inoculated to that guy
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.440]  he's a liar it was only two hundred thousand Martho that they got not one
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.960]  point six billion oh that's that guy that lied so they were gonna have drones
[38:21.960 --> 38:28.760]  over America or blimps by the way it's been announced in RT Reuters today DC is
[38:28.760 --> 38:39.400]  to have blimps over it watching everyone they launched the blimps in 2003 and it
[38:39.400 --> 38:43.120]  was in local newspapers and all I did was look local news they've launched
[38:43.120 --> 38:49.000]  blimps they've got them up over every major city now and they're powered by
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.500]  solar panels on the top and they have ground penetrating radar and face
[38:53.500 --> 38:59.560]  scanning cameras and laser microphones and here here's here's Alexander Higgs
[38:59.560 --> 39:06.520]  company that started it all in the 19 early 1990s oh crazy blimps blimps and
[39:06.520 --> 39:11.280]  then it's just it looked about 95% of what I tell you is public I'm trying to
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.360]  explain this to you I know it sounds crazy it sounds this topic to say oh
[39:15.360 --> 39:18.060]  they're torturing people's kids in front of them they're putting poison in the
[39:18.060 --> 39:21.800]  water here's a Harvard study admitting it here's a guy White House science are
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.400]  saying it's to dumb you down I mean they're admitting it this is not my
[39:26.400 --> 39:33.000]  opinion have I gone a little crazy knowing this information am I in like
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.800]  full verbal combat mode with these people has it has it has been working this
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.520]  hard this long have I gotten a little bit eccentric yeah folks you're you bet
[39:43.520 --> 39:49.040]  I'm pretty freaked out right now and I'm so awake and I'm so aware it's like
[39:49.040 --> 39:55.640]  torture it's torture to pick up all the archetypal symbolism in films the
[39:55.640 --> 40:00.280]  subliminals it's torture to pick up all the spins the ten layers of propaganda
[40:00.280 --> 40:07.120]  on MSNBC the manipulation the twisting the lies it's unbelievable
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.720]  oh these people are all coached by the CIA and big think tanks on how to screw
[40:13.720 --> 40:21.640]  people up and now that's admitted as of last week but it was admitted before
[40:21.640 --> 40:27.160]  that it was they were like oh yes CNN's run by the CIA and people are going oh
[40:27.160 --> 40:32.320]  yeah right it's like when I had that Esquire writer here you got a big cover
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.240]  story coming out in September issue middle August he'd go Delta Force was
[40:37.240 --> 40:42.520]  at the Seattle thing they'd look at him go it actually was or he'd go the
[40:42.520 --> 40:46.320]  White House science are said put stuff in the water to reduce fertility yeah
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.240]  right he's like oh they did well Rachel Maddow says you said they sent the
[40:52.240 --> 40:59.760]  tornado he went to the full video goes no actually you didn't you're right and I
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.400]  said the only place you may have me is I say the whole government's evil that's
[41:03.400 --> 41:06.920]  not true but the people running it basically are and then the other people
[41:06.920 --> 41:10.080]  are in such denial right beside it they'll just give him some flimsy cover
[41:10.080 --> 41:14.600]  story of you know you open your door and some guys on top your wife and he's
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.480]  like oh I'm a doctor doing a gynecological exam I mean it's just you
[41:18.480 --> 41:26.040]  know oh okay thank you doctor and he's not even worn a white lab coat I mean
[41:26.040 --> 41:33.280]  she's not even dressed up like a nurse I mean it's like at some point folks
[41:33.280 --> 41:37.400]  you're really asking for it is what I'm saying for for new listeners where
[41:37.400 --> 41:45.960]  people think this is all funny this ain't funny and I guess I'm kind of a
[41:45.960 --> 41:59.240]  grown-up boy scout who ain't a nice guy after all no more mr. nice guy because
[41:59.240 --> 42:02.800]  you dance with the devil the devil doesn't change you change look into the
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.640]  abyss too long you may become the abyss I have become the abyss to a great
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.640]  extent I mean I've got my one foot in one world one foot in the other but I I
[42:11.640 --> 42:17.520]  basically am these people now I've studied it to such a point that very
[42:17.520 --> 42:20.880]  few globalist they're all compartmentalized specialized in their
[42:20.880 --> 42:26.000]  criminal area and I see how they all just work like a symbiotic jellyfish or
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.280]  something you know jellyfish are really hive composite creatures made up of
[42:31.280 --> 42:38.320]  hundreds of thousands or millions of single cell organisms and that's what
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.720]  the New World Order is it's like a swarm of evil and I I basically have reached
[42:43.720 --> 42:52.360]  master New World Order psych warfare societal annihilation degree and I know
[42:52.360 --> 42:58.560]  them I know as much as their top people do I really do and let me tell you man it
[42:58.560 --> 43:04.280]  is it is freaky it is horrible it is horrible and I know it's horrible for
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.760]  those of you that are smart and have figured this out as well it's I know
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.040]  people say I can't listen I got a tune out of this this is too too intense but
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.840]  that's going to destroy us folks we've got to admit how sick we are and how
[43:15.840 --> 43:23.440]  screwed up this is and we've got to suppress our instinct to just go
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.600]  nihilistically eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we die
[43:28.600 --> 43:39.400]  oh god I'm watching the cancer of tyranny of authoritarianism grow spread
[43:39.400 --> 43:47.840]  its horrible wings over society so it can suck our blood and relative comfort
[43:47.840 --> 43:53.320]  and I just watched the whole economy converted over to fraud economy crony
[43:53.320 --> 44:01.360]  economy now civilization is built by a code of honor a code of ethics a social
[44:01.360 --> 44:07.040]  contract and and people working together under good common sense rules but
[44:07.040 --> 44:12.840]  what happens when the social engineers are insane and try to overturn the the
[44:12.840 --> 44:19.040]  common law and the common sense and invert things well then it becomes the
[44:19.040 --> 44:27.280]  duty to resist and to not comply and to subvert the subversion to rebel against
[44:27.280 --> 44:33.640]  the rebellion to restore the republic because I've seen nothing better though
[44:33.640 --> 44:39.200]  it was never implemented in full partially implemented it created maximum
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.040]  levels of liberty this world has ever seen ingenuity strength honor flowed
[44:45.040 --> 44:51.640]  from it security flowed from it so evil came here to take it over because with
[44:51.640 --> 44:57.520]  the goodness came great strength and then we follow the same cycle of falling
[44:57.520 --> 45:06.200]  huh and now the criminals have gotten in control they're screwing everything up
[45:06.200 --> 45:10.280]  they've even created a cosmology and compartmentalized knowing they're going
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.440]  to collapse things that that's good for the earth agenda 21 all they do things
[45:14.440 --> 45:17.120]  are actually horrible for the earth because their real desire is just to
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.840]  hurt things because they're psychopathic time to talk to the devil is
[45:21.840 --> 45:25.680]  what's going on here they've been talking to the devil for a long time and
[45:25.680 --> 45:32.440]  they like it it's all they know it's it sends a thrill up their leg
[45:32.440 --> 45:44.920]  at the devil's arm around them and we sit here a hundred percent watching
[45:44.920 --> 45:48.800]  homeland security with all the agencies in the Pentagon trying to buy up every
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.360]  farm of civilian ammo they're buying every little 380 you name it and they're
[45:53.360 --> 45:59.400]  getting they're buying just everything weird shotgun a gun 20 gauge they are
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.480]  just absolutely trying to drive up the price out of the general public's hands
[46:03.480 --> 46:07.720]  because they plan a massive civil war in this country where they stage IED
[46:07.720 --> 46:10.960]  attacks everywhere and then say the veterans are doing it and then the
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.680]  veterans are suspect and only homeland can save us and that's the real scripting
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.880]  in all the homeland security documents and that right there should indict them
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.720]  all I mean you know it's a foreign corporate occupation force really trying
[46:25.720 --> 46:31.120]  to establish the idea of a purge against the American resistance I mean this is
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.080]  real that this is really happening I'm really on air opposing these people this
[46:37.080 --> 46:44.120]  is you're really opposing them this is really happening and homeland security
[46:44.120 --> 46:50.360]  started 12 years ago 11 years ago or so saying I saw it on c-span you're gonna
[46:50.360 --> 46:52.800]  have to have homeland security authorization have a job anywhere with a
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.960]  national ID card and now they're going into movie theaters malls saying your
[46:57.960 --> 47:02.680]  security has to be certified by us or we're gonna put our own DHS in them and
[47:02.680 --> 47:06.240]  now they're in the shopping malls and now they're on the streets where I live
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.160]  and you drive and you see army one day I saw army twice on the streets
[47:11.160 --> 47:15.720]  directing traffic and running checkpoints and again all just to acclimate
[47:15.720 --> 47:22.760]  and military drills and just you can just see a program that is being brought
[47:22.760 --> 47:31.720]  in and again TSA searching people at a San Antonio mall yeah there is TSA canine
[47:31.720 --> 47:39.600]  in San Antonio near the stroller rental area with a dog I mean it's just it's all
[47:39.600 --> 47:44.400]  happening and it's just there to get us like animals domesticated accustomed to
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.960]  it and they plant a giant purge and and and people are like well I'll just go
[47:48.960 --> 47:53.720]  along with it whoop-da-da-da-da you're who they want to go after I mean if
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.800]  you're a lion do you go after a gazelle that has its leg broken and isn't running
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.480]  or that's got a fever and has fallen down or do you go after one that runs no
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.040]  you go after the sickly one and you people think you're gonna grovel to it
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.400]  and learn to lick its boots to the obese TSA person that comes over in the
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.560]  mall to grab your genitals and and the prisoner train you prisoner acclimate
[48:15.560 --> 48:18.520]  you I mean that's they're just gonna take you down they're gonna take your
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.120]  bank accounts they're gonna make you do compulsory national service and it's
[48:24.120 --> 48:29.440]  just so horrible to see America go into scientific evil and I'm really sorry I
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.440]  have to tell you all this I mean it's all just happening I don't know what to
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.360]  say and Boston bombing was a beta test if I get killed for anything it'll be
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.000]  for exposing that that they are hopping mad at us for that we blew them wide
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.280]  open that was a savage blow to the globalist and they're totally freaking
[48:47.280 --> 48:50.920]  out that alternative press is gonna go to their other events as soon as they
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.480]  blow stuff up so they know we're watching them they're freaked out right now
[48:54.480 --> 49:00.280]  and I'm freaked out and the whole thing's horrible and it's horrible
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.280]  horrible horrible horrible it's a horrible nightmare it's all horrible
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.320]  nightmare and I mean only repenting is gonna fix it only admitting how screwed
[49:09.320 --> 49:16.960]  up we are is gonna fix this you know I saw an article on info works calm by
[49:16.960 --> 49:22.760]  Michael Steyer the American dream that had I don't know 15 examples how many is
[49:22.760 --> 49:31.640]  that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 I can just approximate but 16
[49:31.640 --> 49:36.520]  links to mainstream news where at college they make you draw the name Jesus
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.000]  on a piece of paper and then stomp on it screaming Jesus is bad and if you don't
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.320]  do that you're expelled if you in your poem mentioned Jesus you get in trouble
[49:45.320 --> 49:48.720]  that that's total free speech that's not separation of church and state
[49:48.720 --> 49:53.000]  separation state means the government can't tell you what to do with your
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.520]  religion you're free to talk about it whenever you want and I read that this
[49:56.520 --> 50:00.760]  morning and I went and looked at it and I I I remember most these stories but I
[50:00.760 --> 50:05.840]  mean this is just the last few months I mean this is crazy naked Soviet style
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.760]  authoritarianism I mean this is just 200 proof evil I mean this is just just
[50:12.760 --> 50:18.160]  sit in it's just everywhere and it's worse and worse and it's so obvious it's
[50:18.160 --> 50:25.000]  so certified it's so illegal it's so horrible it's so bad it's so horrible
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.480]  and it's just gonna get worse and worse and they're gonna blow stuff up and come
[50:29.480 --> 50:33.240]  arrest everybody there's gonna be a big shooting war it's gonna wipe out the
[50:33.240 --> 50:36.920]  police and military it's gonna radicalize who's left they're gonna
[50:36.920 --> 50:40.960]  bring in foreign troops it's all official America's gonna be implode and
[50:40.960 --> 50:44.400]  then after the Civil War the globalists will buy everything up for one son on the
[50:44.400 --> 50:48.800]  dollar re-engineer everything they're gonna do a Soviet style mal purge on

[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.880]  name of Jesus has become a dirty word and politically correct America see
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.040]  Michael Snyder is a great writer and a great compiler of factoids that's kind
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.280]  of a writer I love an American dream but the headline should be incredible
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.160]  authoritarianism as Christians persecuted in America I mean you read this
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.000]  it's like people being kicked out of college because they won't stomp on them
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.240]  with the name Jesus on a piece of paper as part of sensitivity training or
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.840]  people expelled for in their speeches they give or whatever saying the word
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.880]  God I mean it's just beyond Soviet Union and by the way that's why he's joining
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:19.080]  us he wrote the article role reversal how the US became the USSR best-selling
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.740]  author Paul Craig Roberts Dr. Roberts cord this the former had a policy for
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:28.520]  Reagan at the Department of Treasury the father of Reaganomics you go to Paul
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.160]  Craig Roberts org his amazing website to find all of his stuff I tell you the
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.200]  twilight zoning of the world just gets crazier every few months when we have
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:46.120]  you on doc what is front and center for you in the wild abandoned orgy of
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.240]  blooming tyranny well it seems to be in full bloom bloom doesn't it I mean now
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:12:00.200]  they're demanding the the National Stasi Agency is demanding that all of our
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:07.240]  passwords be turned over to them as well I don't know why they need them but
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.320]  they're demanding that so I think it's just to establish that they're the law
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:18.400]  there's no statutory law that lets them make us demand but we now are ruled by
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:26.360]  the executive branch and the Congress and the judiciary are irrelevant if they
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.560]  were to make a ruling or decision that the executive branch didn't approve of it
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:37.840]  would just be ignored so we rule by the executive branch and what we know is
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.480]  executive branch is no longer accountable it was established in the Bush
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.440]  regime that the executive branch is above the law as long as there's a war
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:54.720]  against terror and of course we've been told this is a war for many ages it
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:02.400]  won't go on for a long time so we are we have a Caesar it's the entire executive
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:10.280]  branch and any aspect of part of this executive branch can act without getting
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:17.800]  presidential clearance they just have the power of all of them being Caesar's
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.120]  and so that's how we live now the Americans will say oh this is preposterous
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.120]  they've not done anything to me and blah blah and that's true they haven't done
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.080]  anything to most people except ship your jobs overseas and jack up your taxes and
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:39.360]  make mega bankers exempt and stuff yes on the economic scene but I'm talking
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.400]  about the that was done by the corporations in Wall Street and I'm
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.720]  talking about the executive branch it now has uncountable power and so there
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.040]  has been a coup d'etat you see the United States is defined by the
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:00.560]  Constitution and the government is constrained by the Constitution but
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:07.000]  since Bush the government has been unconstrained by the Constitution these
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.840]  are all impeachable offenses yet Obama gave the approval or the Obama regime
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.200]  gave the approval to the overthrow of the Constitution by the Bush regime and
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:23.400]  has proceeded along the same lines yeah Chris Hedges says he's doubled down I
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:31.240]  would say tripled down well it doesn't matter he's increased it's gotten it
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:37.400]  it's gotten worse and so we no longer have rights for example if they decide
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:45.600]  if anyone in the executive branch many consequence decides that a person is
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:52.080]  suspicious that person can be picked up and imprisoned indefinitely without any
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.360]  accountability to report a judge no presentation of evidence apparently
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.160]  they don't even have to tell your associates or your family your friends
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.120]  what's become of you and if that's inconvenient they can just have you
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.160]  murdered they can send a hellfire missile from a drone blow you up and it's not
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.280]  accountable it's not an action that has to be or put cyanide in your drink or
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.920]  poison Breitbart and then the coroner who did the autopsy they admitted he was
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.480]  murdered and say we're not going to investigate the dead corner well I'm
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.800]  sure there's all kinds of things that they can do because they're not held
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:34.720]  accountable and people who try to expose them I like yourself or dismissed as
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:42.560]  conspiracy theorist who crazed and think that the government is evil so the
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.920]  gullibility of the people is one of the greatest handicaps for the people
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:56.280]  retaining a constitutional order or they are civil liberties and what's
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:02.000]  happening in my opinion Alex is that the police state is more entrenched and is
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.640]  getting more confident and it's so much more confident that soon exposing it
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.960]  will have no prospect of having any effect soon even I think if the
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.120]  Congress were to act it simply wouldn't have any power behind it because when a
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.400]  police state becomes very confident it's simply no longer worries about public
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:35.640]  perceptions or or other former institutions that had power it just
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.760]  simply prevails so I think that's what we're headed into I don't sure I mean
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.520]  this is the pattern of history so let me ask you with your historical research
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.680]  and talking to colleagues around the world what where does it end because now
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.120]  the minions of government are getting more and more arrogant and are going
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.080]  what we're not accountable because this historically spreads downward and then
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.320]  everything starts getting stolen because no one can can can can stop the
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.400]  criminal government until things collapse so what do you see coming from
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:08.880]  this well though they've been stealing for some time you know the police they've
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.200]  been they've been embarrassed news reports of police stopping traffic on
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:19.880]  interstate highways and if you've got cash they simply take it they say well
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:25.480]  this cash is proof that you're dealing in drugs otherwise you wouldn't have this
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:32.400]  cash and so we're seizing it because it's contraband you know they can do
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:38.680]  just about whatever you want we become Mexico probably worse yeah yeah because
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:45.240]  there the drive I think it's just crime and and greed and here I think it's even
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.640]  worse is there's an evil force behind the drive exactly I agree this is a
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:57.360]  scientific evil not a third world oligarchy yeah and in the in the and the
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.440]  drive for power goes far beyond the American citizens they won't power over
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.880]  the whole world and and we're gonna be the fuel to do that I mean the people in
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.960]  an empire that's going for broke look at Nazi Germany it don't go too good
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.400]  yeah that's right I mean once you know they were for a period of the Nazis
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.200]  early years they could have been stopped but all the institutions just
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:30.280]  collapsed and and so the power of the party prevailed the same thing in the
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:36.080]  Soviet Union and Stalin he was able to put on show trial all the heroes of the
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:44.600]  Bolshevik revolution and even convict Buchanan the who linen declared to be
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:50.240]  the golden-haired boy of the revolution but the car and was convicted of being
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:59.920]  a capitalist spy and and executed in the in the prison so once this gets out of
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.720]  control it's out of control and there's no real way put it back under control now
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:12.360]  what what I've always said in past when we've talked is that the basis for the
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:19.400]  United States power is a little bit shaky and the economy is no good we've
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.640]  lost our manufacturing prowess our great cities are collapsing I mean like
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:29.480]  Detroit and just the other day there was report that Holmes and Cleveland now
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:37.400]  being boarded up cities like St. Louis once very prosperous now have 19% of
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:45.800]  their housing vacant so the cities are collapsing the jobs are good jobs are
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.400]  gone stay there doctor I want to come back and get your prognosis and then
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.760]  ideas to pull us out of this though it appears the the insanity of tyranny is
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:58.560]  growing we're enjoying all the blessings some call them curses of a big fat out
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.520]  of control corporate run government well they're right back Bill Carroll here for

[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.240]  proteins in your body just like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.560]  to build a brick wall so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids

[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.840]  4 to 6 p.m. central time and if you've done any historical research what we're
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.400]  talking about here is just verified fact this is now really the coming out of
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.880]  the closet of the military industrial complex owned by offshore multinational
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:37.400]  corporations that are leveraging the US in their takeover worldwide but at the
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.160]  impoverishment of the US so do we collapse like the Soviet Union is that
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.440]  the best we can hope for or I do see people waking up to the social contract
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.000]  being broken I do see pretty much everybody every cop I walk by at Austin
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.040]  says hi Alex we're awake it keeps happening live on live video shoots
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.120]  cops walk by and wave and say hi Alex happened again last night so I'm seeing
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.280]  a lot of people wake up but they feel powerless dr. Roberts what what comes
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:12.120]  out of all this I think collapse you know we have a huge triple bubble don't
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.200]  we we have the bond market bubble the stock market bubble and the currency
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.480]  bubble the dollar bubble and to keep all these bubbles afloat they have to
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.800]  intervene in the gold market and sell naked shorts to drive down the price of
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:33.680]  gold they have to get the rest of the world to intervene in currency markets
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:42.520]  and support the dollar they're now trying to finish these two so-called free
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.120]  trade packs one with Asia one with Europe and then the real purpose of
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.520]  these packs Alex is to has to draw so much of the world into dollar structure
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.440]  trade relationships that they have to support the dollar so they're desperate
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.880]  to keep the thing afloat but it's such a big house of cards one doesn't know that
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  they'll be able to if for example the second downturn of the current great
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:20.120]  recession occurs this fall on this winter they haven't a remedy the unemployment
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:27.960]  will rise further it puts more pressure on the budget which becomes larger
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:35.680]  and they're not really all that smart people in charge and so it could it
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:42.240]  could be a big collapse it just they get overwhelmed by problems and they're not
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.680]  having as much success in their foreign adventures as they thought they would
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.280]  well they're also certainly gearing up for collapse and from their own
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.680]  admissions plan to use an orderly collapse to pose as saviors and bring
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.160]  an authoritarianism but instead people now understand that they've basically
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.800]  been the authors of it so I see them losing the public doctor that's my
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.120]  point or I'm really seeing signs of that is that positive or do you not agree
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:14.480]  well I think Americans are gullible and some of them are beginning to wake up
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.000]  but you see they already have authoritarianism they don't need to have
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.800]  a collapse to impose it they've already done that the Constitution is a scrap of
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.720]  paper has no more authority there has been a coup over our form of government
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.440]  as you wrote last week in coup d'etat so what do we do I don't know if we tried
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.560]  to organize anything they pick us up because they would know it as soon as
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:47.200]  we began I think Alex the only way out is collapse or else the rest of the
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.440]  world simply says we've had enough of being your lackeys your puppies when
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.080]  puppets and we're not going to be paid by you any longer and we're going on
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.240]  without you and simply cease to pay any attention to us or to deal with us it's
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:07.800]  it's not like we've got much to offer you know we're the domestic market which
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.680]  the foreign countries liked for their exports it's drying up because the
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.800]  incomes are drying up you know you can't have a consumer economy on Walmart
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:27.680]  part-time wages so as the ability of the American economy to support the kinds
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.080]  of consumption levels that are associated with past American history
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:39.200]  that's dying off so our value to China and to Taiwan and to Germany and the
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.320]  people who export here and have trade services which have been to their
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:50.800]  advantages in the past that aspect is is going away so they may simply find it's
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:56.640]  too inconvenient or all the pressures to support a currency and then you've got
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.000]  Israel with cruise missiles hitting Russian emplacements in Syria and Russia
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.360]  launching you know nuclear bombers openly with talk in Russia about nuking
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.880]  Israel I mean this really is one of those times like before World War two or
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:14.240]  World War one but now we have nuclear weapons where the the climate is there
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:22.240]  for a political tornado that's very dangerous it's very dangerous and the
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:28.480]  public is very slow in seeing this and waking up look we've lost habeas corpus
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:35.280]  we've lost the right to life but what are the only rights anyone's focused on
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.240]  it's politically correct right hold on I want you to comment on that we got to
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.400]  go to break do five more minutes with us on the political correctness if you can
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.640]  we'll be right back okay thank you well I want to hear what you have to say on
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.640]  that that's right they've replaced it with fake synthetic football rights that
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:57.040]  we debate all day we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.400]  it's always hard to just get him on for two segments because he talks about so
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.440]  many important things then I'm going to hit news and take phone calls into the
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:42.880]  next hour 800-259-9231 for first-time callers on this Friday first time
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:49.640]  callers today 800-259-9231 what do you think of almost four billion rounds of
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.960]  ak47 ammo and the Pentagon admits they don't use that in combat and they're
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.840]  just storing it in warehouses and I looked into it this isn't being shipped
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.640]  to Syria that's separately going on so just a lot of craziness to drop the
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.760]  market what do you think about that all the stuff that's going on 800-259-9231
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:14.280]  dr. Roberts I didn't think to bring that up but I mean we concur on the whole
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:20.600]  social engineering I've noticed they've replaced football issues of gay marriage
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.720]  you know the racist white people mantra to divide and conquer and then how about
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.440]  the right to not have 85 billion a month in Qe3 devalue our currency how about
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.560]  the right to not you know have all these illegal wars that bankrupt our country
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.600]  and destroy our name I mean they have synthetically brought in all these fake
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.160]  issues quantify that because I think you were starting to go there well what I
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:48.040]  was saying Alex is all the important civil liberties have been overturned and
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:55.960]  what they've substituted are homosexual and lesbian rights that is marriage or
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:06.400]  homosexuals and lesbians voting rights issues and abortion abortion rights so
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:12.080]  these are the three civil liberties that are in the news that the country is
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.760]  worked up over either for or against the even the American civil liberties union
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.760]  is mainly preoccupied with these issues and not with the destruction of the
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:29.440]  Bill of Rights none of these issues of course are in the Bill of Rights they've
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:36.080]  been efforts over the years to sort of read them into it and they no doubt are
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.240]  important to some people but they're not important on the level of habeas
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:46.920]  corpus they're not important on the level that the government cannot murder you
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:53.800]  they can only execute you after a trial and evidence presented and you're being
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:58.920]  convicted all of these time you have to process in other words well these have
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:04.440]  been overturned and and you don't find any discussion of it in the media what
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:12.760]  you find discussion of is voting rights abortion rights gay rights well this
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:20.200]  shows you know the the supremacy or the success rather shows a success of the
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:28.040]  police state and substituting nebulous relatively unimportant issues for the
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.160]  United States Constitution I'm glad you're saying that because no one else
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.400]  is really saying that but my show and I know you've been writing about it and
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.560]  that freaks me out that it's so clear the program they're using and then and
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.360]  that and that and that the libertarian and conservative tribe groups aren't
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.280]  sophisticated enough to get it I'm not bragging I'm just shocked that we're
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.280]  smarter than most people I mean that's kind of freak shout when you don't
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.520]  think you're that smart you realize the general public and even other pundits
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.240]  aren't that aren't that they're smart in ways but they they're just not
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.960]  sophisticated and then this there was always a real left in a way that was
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:09.040]  pro civil liberty they had some problems and things but they were still pro
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.360]  liberty now they're just a pure fascist club and all they care about is that
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.680]  their black guy is in power and it's really like a Hitler cult or something
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:24.560]  I mean isn't this the fall of a genuine left what we've seen I yes I don't think
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.320]  there is a left anymore you know a counter punch has which we was the main
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:37.480]  sort of intelligent left publication they have acknowledged that there's no
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:44.320]  longer a left and I think that's true if for that matter they're not any real
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:51.760]  conservatives either they they were replaced by the neocons so the count of
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.120]  way people of my generation I noticed that among lifetime friends they still
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.360]  faint like it's the liberals and the conservatives the liberals are doing
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:07.320]  that than not any this there's a police state and there are these people who have
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.520]  these sorts of issues that are very important to them but don't bear on the
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:19.240]  duration or the ability to have a free society so I mean we had a free society
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:25.920]  without having abortion rights or gay rights so as I say I'm not saying these
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.360]  are not important rights to some people but it's a diversion on purpose being
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:39.000]  deployed well I mean look at the Cia we've known has been involved in the
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.040]  media since it began but now it's just oh we're gonna run the media now and
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.800]  we're gonna to propagandize and use psych warfare it's corporate scientific
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.760]  cold-blooded psych warfare bottom line destroying the foundations that let
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.520]  these corporations even develop to where all the rich people are having to get
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.520]  armored redoubts now because they stole their loot and stole and destroyed their
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.880]  own future I mean this I'm agreeing with you more and more that these people are
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:13.120]  just crazy I mean they have a weird cosmology framework of an excuse but the
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.400]  truth is this new world order is just a bunch of crazy people yes they've used
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:24.320]  lies and deception to steal accountability of government from the
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.280]  people and when you don't have an accountable government that means you
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:33.040]  have a police state that means the government is not subject to law but the
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.160]  elite always get purged and robbed by their own groups this is the worst
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.360]  climate doctor I know you're a historian as well tell me if I'm wrong isn't a
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.800]  tyranny a horrible climate for the elite as well yes but they often lead into it
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.360]  because the initial part they are controlling the government you know
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.960]  the powerful interest groups control the government and they use it for their
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:02.960]  own enrichment but by making the government unaccountable they enable
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:08.640]  the police state to rise up and against which they're powerless you know the
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:13.400]  elite the elites thought they were going to control Hitler I can remember I had
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:21.880]  professors who were refugees there were Jewish refugees from from Hill when I
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:28.360]  was an undergraduate and they they confirmed that the German business
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.960]  elites including many of the Jewish upper-class people thought they would
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:42.120]  control Hitler and just use him for their own advantage but of course once
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.760]  you get unaccountable power then it can be used against you too that's what
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:58.560]  elites always overlook unbelievable dr. Roberts folks can find your new book at
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.840]  your website dr. Paul Craig Roberts site again folks is absolutely vital we
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:09.560]  carry his articles and infowars.com but Paul Craig Roberts.org is the place to
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:15.680]  visit and I have hope I am seeing a bigger awakening I'm seeing I talked to
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.320]  somebody I know that works in the county government and he said basically all the
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.560]  county buildings at lunch listen to me and they all know basically what's true
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.880]  and they're all freaking out every cop I come across even other cities I mean
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.640]  everyone even in England at the cops hugging me not as a Psyop but saying
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.200]  we're awake I had in my five giving me info that turned out to be accurate and
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.800]  I mean you could tell these people were genuine they're freaked out about their
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.920]  future and and and but I hope there's some way now I think that's why they're
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.200]  announcing NSA and the spying and the the hit teams is to scare everybody and
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.240]  to scare not so much leakers or whistleblowers but but people in
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.440]  government who have moral authority from the inside with the public to say
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.240]  this is wrong Snowden's crime is exposing what we already knew and saying
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:07.000]  it's illegal it's not that he's leaking anything that wasn't secret in my view
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.080]  right well you know President Jimmy Carter said the other day that the United
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:18.880]  States no longer has a functioning democracy to my knowledge this was never
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.560]  reported in the United States only in Germany by their spiegel that's right
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:29.600]  it was on one Georgia TV station and then their spiegel picked it up and and and
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.920]  you would think a former president saying that that you would hear that ever
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.480]  but that shows the control like the drills it go ahead no it does you're
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:42.800]  right it shows the control the media the print and TV media are a propaganda
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:50.160]  ministry that's all they are you've made that point over and over amazing just
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:56.520]  just amazing dr. Roberts a have a good weekend and we're just here just trying
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:00.600]  to put out the SLS of the world the message is in the bottle and we just
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.480]  hope people at every level do whatever they can to just even passively slow
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.680]  down the wheels of this thing and it's sad to say the best we can hope for is
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:18.360]  collapse well keep it up Alex you have a big audience and you'll wake some more
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.240]  I bless you thank you well the the behind the scenes attacks are really
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.880]  heating up I'm not giving the enemy any intimidation coverage I know they intend
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:30.960]  that but it's getting scary over here so yeah it's it's definitely two minutes
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.960]  to midnight thank you dr. Roberts please to talk to you Alex it's good talk to
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:38.200]  you and and and folks I think you need to understand you don't know how long
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.280]  stills like this will be on the air I mean we may hold them back and when I
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:45.520]  see people in the alternative media because they're going tell pro or
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.040]  cognitive infiltrators like Sunstein talks about or just just been
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.200]  propagandized by this sick culture and are just jealous of anybody that sticks
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.720]  their head up and are Monday morning quarterbacking or backseat driving what
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.320]  I'm trying to do nobody's a bigger critic of myself than I am on the real
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:07.440]  things I do because I know this is for all the marbles my family your family
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:13.120]  my life your life but I'm really in the in the fulcrum I mean I'm in the maelstrom
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:20.080]  I'm in the heart of it and I know how real this is I know how serious the
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:26.960]  the stakes are but we're here trying to hold the new order back at the door and
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.760]  they're ramming it and and now I mean there's big pieces of the door knock
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.400]  down we're at the gates trying to hold it up there's spears sticking through
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.720]  stabbing political people reporters are being killed dirty tricks are happening
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:43.320]  IRS is going after everybody state federal agencies are just messing with
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.720]  us 24-7 and I don't even give it attention just just support us folks
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.720]  because believe me believe me that this is evil we're facing and you've seen it
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:45:03.080]  and and and the drums drums in the deep they are coming they are here and it's
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.600]  not on our doorstep it's in our house now and it's it's moving quickly now
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.800]  because it knows that humanity is waking up to it we're in the fight ladies
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:17.880]  and gentlemen but this is not a game this is not a game ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:23.240]  this is not a joke I just hope you understand words I don't have words
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.600]  after I read 100 200 articles a day I scan over or the video clips or all the
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:31.920]  research and preparation we do for the show and I don't get to 10% of it
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:37.520]  because I'm mainly just marveling here on air just we're everybody's under red
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:44.320]  level attack and and I need you to wake up to that especially new listeners and
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.880]  we're here trying to hold it back where everybody's going where's the new world
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:52.080]  order where's the spying you said where's the and I'm like where's the spying
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.640]  where's the tearing what the government's gonna come get us you said 18 years ago
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:01.680]  and now they are you're discredited what you said came true and they play these
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.040]  psych warfare games of nanny nanny boo boo you watch MSNBC or any of it it's
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.000]  about you're discredited you said we bought bullets and we did you said
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.120]  there were blimp surveillance and we are because you're a cook you said the CIA
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.680]  is running weather warfare in America and now it's in the beast BBC and
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.840]  Associated Press you're you're confirmed right again and I'm like
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.960]  what does that mean I mean it's just reached cuckoo level it's reached
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:41.680]  absolute cuckoo crazy level and I guess everybody else have been conformist
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.320]  maybe I have been a true individualist and have not been a conformance I don't
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.520]  conform in my life I conform to whatever seems natural whatever seems
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.160]  wholesome and I mean everything the new order does stinks to high heaven it's
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:00.440]  it's bad let me let me tell you about some amazing information some really
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:05.800]  important information and also is super important as it funds our operation and

[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:24.440]  half of my brethren in this country and people in other nations have done I mean
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.600]  I want to live in reality and make preparation for it as Patrick Henry said

[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.200]  top 35 there and and and it doesn't mean I say those the top 35 I'm looking at
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.760]  some of the others too might might be in the running I just it's driving me
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.480]  crazy I can't decide and but I'll have to by Monday I've already pushed it back
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.120]  couple days so that's coming up also speaking of films you know I walked out
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.440]  of a movie last night and two cop cars pulled up so I wouldn't put one of my
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:22.000]  magazines on one of the cop car windshields and one of the cops get
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.760]  sounds as hey Alex and they go in they probably had some people fighting or
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.200]  something who knows they look they were in too big a hurry and people always
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.080]  think it's fake like I'm on the hike and bike trail and cops come by and go hi
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:36.520]  Alex while I'm shooting a video or I mean it happens constantly any video I'm
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:40.560]  shooting in public if cops come by they go hi Alex people think it's like a
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:46.120]  production it's it's it's it's real it happened it's not a big deal it will go
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.200]  out of how do they know him I told you I have 50 million listeners a week folks
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.120]  that's conservative okay and in England it's like how does the cop wave at him
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:58.840]  on the bridge by Big Ben he must be you know with the with the British
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.320]  intelligence and you know I mean the kind of people know I am all over the
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.080]  world folks and I'm not bragging but Liberty's popular I mean we're the
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:11.620]  show's a big deal okay and so I did satire police respond only God forgives
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:16.600]  movie review and and it's not satire it's satire to be clear when I say that
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.700]  they're going to arrest what's his name Eric Schmidt of Google because Eric
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.320]  Schmidt was on the magazine so that parts that I want to be clear they weren't
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.120]  arresting him that was just a joke I threw in there but it's real video earlier
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:32.800]  it said police respond only God forgives movie review if I can punch my
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.760]  computer up in here I just had a mad satire snake satire should go to the
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.360]  end guys doesn't the ender or in the note or put it in the comedy section the
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:47.320]  point is it's a real video but I still see the satire what I'm saying now only
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.200]  God forgives is very gratuitous very violent I don't particularly like that
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.120]  part I think it's a horrible film but also a genius film and it's very thought
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.960]  provoking art because it hits you on many levels and I will do a brief review
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:05.040]  of only God forgives that I saw with some of the crew of the TV crew last night
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.840]  my dad went to and I said what was the movie about at the end he goes only
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:14.480]  one in 20 will get it you know the cop psychic and it's kind of like a good
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.560]  versus evil and this is what the devil does and this guy is basically like an
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.560]  angel but it shows that good can be very very vengeful as well and there's also
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:28.520]  kind of an Asian exploit like like machete or the black exploitation films
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:32.000]  with the black guys are killing all the bad white guys I mean it's also kind of
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.640]  like that but it's produced by a French slash I think German guy so it's not
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.160]  really a Asian exploitation film it's not even aimed at the Asian market it's
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:50.640]  it's bizarre it's like 2001 space Odyssey avant-garde but very disturbing so
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:57.600]  kind of just did the review didn't I I need to do it I need to encapsulate a
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.600]  little bit better than that I mean it's got that director which I'm not some
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.600]  giant film buffal I kind of am I mean I do my research of the director
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:16.440]  Nicholas Windig Reffen that I pronounce it he also wrote it is a smart cookie
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:26.720]  the cinematography is out of this world the casting is out of this world but I
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.320]  did not like what happened when I got home last night I did not like it at all
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:36.200]  and I'll have to tell that story later as well one of my dogs got into my son's
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:53.160]  fishing equipment so it didn't go well after seeing that film why does the
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.000]  United States been the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health

[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.160]  got other things from it but i have the proper interpretation of it it's not
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.120]  it's a hundred percent clear very archetypal uh i need to write some notes
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:49.200]  that make sure i cover every point then i've got a big admission to make folks
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:55.280]  i i may actually have myself arrested for thought crime i you've heard of the
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.000]  hitler teapot we're not going to get to it yet guys
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.920]  you've heard of the hitler teapot that had to be banned and destroyed
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.040]  ladies and gentlemen i have committed a crime even worse i i saw a hitler
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.880]  mustache in the sky today and that's that those clouds must be no no no
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:13.760]  wait till i get to it it's pretty funny it illustrates political correctness
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.880]  i'm going to tie it into the name of jesus has become a dirty word in the
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:19.840]  politically correct america so that is coming up
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:22.560]  actually at the start of the next segment i'll do that briefly and then get
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.840]  into all the other serious news here but right now let's go to mike martin
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.400]  uh and and he says he's the owner of the restaurant that's in our article at
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.520]  info wars dot com that paul watson found that was in the local news
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.360]  homeland security is now regulating live entertainment indiana dhs demands
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.240]  restaurant owner get permit to play live music
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:48.800]  i mean you talk about thought police uh so you say you're the owner of the
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:52.560]  restaurant mike yes sir alexa
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.520]  wow so so do they think there might be terrorists in the assault shaker
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.640]  you know i i think it's more of a control issue and
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.120]  really the idea with the department of homeland security attaching themselves
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.760]  to the state fire marshal that really gives them jurisdiction in every
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:17.760]  business in that state completely circumventing any due process
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:21.280]  and that's really my biggest reason i'm challenging it i don't understand why
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:24.640]  the department of homeland security became part of the fire marshal's agency
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.480]  i think we'd all agree the fire marshal's a very legitimate agency that has
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:32.080]  a duty to protect the service but i don't see that with the department of
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.800]  homeland security
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:39.760]  well they want the funding and the homeland security is to replace the old
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:46.160]  republic homeland security on record uh is there
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:52.000]  they've always said to absorb america it is the alien invasion it is the foreign
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.640]  usurper it is the normans invading england go ahead
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.800]  i agree with you completely and i've caught a little criticism about the
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:03.600]  harvesting that you know that i've blown it out of proportion
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.280]  and i and i've tried to explain very clearly on my blog that it's not blown
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:11.040]  out of proportion that if you look at the actuality of what this wall
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.440]  does you cannot play live music and right now my case is in the state of
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.280]  indiana uh through the state fire marshal's office in the indiana
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.640]  department of homeland security but you cannot play live music in the state of
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.480]  indiana without paying the department of homeland security
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.360]  the criticism i got was that that only applies to commercial public buildings
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.120]  and i've tried hard to reiterate that every place in the public is a
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.680]  commercial public bill everywhere that's not a home
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.680]  is a commercial public building no no it is undoubtedly a naked
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:46.160]  power grab sir they have national guard now all over austin running checkpoints
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.240]  and and and dhs randomly we always get there it's on the local news but then
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:53.440]  they're gone by the time i get there they're now
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.760]  on highways and you'll have army with dhs with
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.360]  tsa now in in san antonio they'll have
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:07.200]  air force mps at the mall with tsa and drug dogs i mean it's just
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:13.040]  it's just it is third world takeover uh and uh you need to have your state
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.880]  challenged this i mean what are the feds doing
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:20.320]  embedded with the fire department
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:24.640]  uh criticism i get is that this is indiana department of homeland
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.760]  security not the federal and my question to that would be maybe you could help me
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.480]  here where did the indiana department of homeland
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:34.480]  security come from it's not from the no no no it's federally funded all of them
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:39.280]  are on record no this is the state traders
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.440]  and and and because they take our money send it back and then
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.280]  federalized it's like cops are like yeah we got some free federal money
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.680]  it came from your state you know it came from
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:54.800]  detroit all right sir very interesting um ever in indiana

[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.200]  think there was things wrong with it but that's because i'm a bigot folks
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:21.280]  i'm a right-wing extremist racist i think obama bombing people all over the
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:24.240]  world putting al qaeda in charge to exterminate christians all over africa
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:26.480]  in the middle east is part of a globalist takeover
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.280]  plant and i think it's illegal and horrible because i'm a racist
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:37.680]  let's go to d in texas you are on the air
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.240]  hey man i'm a first-time caller a long time listener how you doing
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.680]  i'm actually sitting with humanity and i'm so awake and so alive i just can't
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.640]  stand it right now well here i want to get you
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.040]  take on this check this out i was just reading on the drug report that uh
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.960]  lord obama was down in um vietnam he's talking to their president
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:07.280]  and he said that ho chi men was actually inspired by thomas jefferson of the u.s
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.560]  constitution and that what he did down there in vietnam was a good thing and
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:16.240]  you know like yeah i forgot to cover that when you guys
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:21.280]  pull that up obama in vietnam that's a pretty big deal and in a sick way it's
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:26.080]  true ho chi men did admire thomas jefferson
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.520]  and was going to try to bring in more of a socialist construct of it
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.200]  and the endo uh you know china area the french that were
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.880]  leaving in the late 50s wanted to keep control of the opium so the real fight
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:42.800]  was over the schmack uh and uh yeah so now he has come out
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:50.000]  uh today uh with praise for ho chi men absolutely amazing because ho chi men
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.680]  did horrible things once he went full commie
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.640]  and got the backing of the ussr and then the us
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:59.600]  would pay with aid this was in congress in hearings
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:02.960]  for the for the 10 plus years for trucks and missiles and weapons
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.720]  to then go and fight us the russians they wouldn't let the port be bombed they
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.160]  let the russian ships come in with the weapons because it was a full spectrum
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.800]  dominance operation that was developed by robert
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:15.600]  McNamara in the in the in the mid and later war
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.120]  where you fund al qaeda and then have a war with them
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.360]  just to make money off the war or where you grow the opium ship it in and put
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:27.040]  people in jail for it or where where you put the communist in
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:32.640]  charge you give them the weapons and ho chi men was actually aided
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.480]  in the fight against the japanese in world war two and and and our government
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:41.600]  in 49 put malin to china and they helped put uh
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.400]  ho chi men into power or keep him in power but then the southern allies
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:52.400]  promised to pay more schmack money uh to the western banks uh and so there was
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:54.960]  a fight with the with the socialist over
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:59.840]  over how much uh opium they would send to the american pigs as we were called
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:02.960]  and and so it's all just a big sick gangsterism
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:06.240]  so obama shows a ci trained he knows the history
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.360]  uh that that ho chi men actually did quote thomas jefferson
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.240]  and was like a weird libertarian slash anarchic socialist you know well that
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.800]  makes sense i i know it doesn't but but he he was put in power
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:24.720]  basically in world war two by the os s now and by french intelligence and then
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.560]  later uh again it was all a fight over the opium
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.360]  kind of like mohammed cars i was put in power to run the opium but
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:34.080]  then he doesn't you know like some of the things that are going on so then they
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:37.840]  try to kill him so he comes out admits that okay the cia runs al qaeda it's
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.520]  all staged and they're trying to kill me and it's all admitted too so uh but
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.680]  does that answer your question yeah i just uh i mean more
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.200]  common though it just seems like utter ridiculousness that
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.880]  you know 50 years ago that would have been
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:16:00.000]  political crucifixion for someone to you know give major props to a communist
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.080]  leader nowadays most people will probably think ho chi men some sort of fried
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:07.920]  rice bitch well no i mean the average american who isn't
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.440]  aware does not know what planet they're on you're like hey you know you're in a
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:14.880]  planet deep spaces right out there isn't that incredible they're like no it's
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:21.120]  meaningless more msg more trendy i just want to act like i'm arrogant
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:24.320]  because i'm really insecure i'm real stupid too
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.880]  okay i don't want no that's the average of person out there the average go
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:34.000]  what is that a new dish at pf chang's that's exactly what you're that's
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.120]  exactly the essence of what we're dealing with and they hear me
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:41.280]  knowing about the history of ho chi men and and that's like oh what are you some
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.880]  kind of weirdo that guy's a conspiracy theorist
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:51.200]  he said he read a book once like there's like books even exist
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:55.520]  i say these are jolly ranchers in my nose i eat i'm sorry go ahead
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.800]  yeah i said just keep up the good work man that's all i wanted to say
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.360]  god bless you brother yeah no i mean it's all just staged it's a multinational
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:06.560]  corporations that fund both sides with our money to have a war so they make
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.640]  money i mean that's not really hard to figure out
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.240]  i mean this is uh let's go ahead and talk to joseph in
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:15.600]  texas here on the air joseph
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:19.760]  hey alex how's it going i'm doing all right brother
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:23.600]  cool cool and i'm talking about the occupy leadership and the reason i'm
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:28.800]  calling is i was an organizer and occupy san antonio and was subject to this
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:32.880]  surveillance well no they had snipers on you on record
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:36.000]  declassified and if obama gave the order you were all the
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.360]  leadership was to be killed and then they're now public oh yeah we have
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.440]  death squads we'll kill you for no reason if we want to
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:46.080]  tell you about there's like a little background you're almost veteran i spent
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:48.640]  two years in iraq i did training as a peace
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.080]  officer and i worked in the federal detention system for a little while
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.360]  so you know i know a surveillance band when i see one
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.760]  and about halfway through the protest i went home
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.200]  and i noticed there's a group of three vans sitting down the street from my
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:06.000]  house you know two of them having tenors all over
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.480]  i'm the first prisoner transport band you know they have company details
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:14.560]  civilian license plates you know and then you know we always have
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:17.600]  people coming to our camps saying hey you know who's the leaders who's the
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:20.480]  leaders and there's other friends that also
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:23.520]  and they use the group they see is unpopular actually run by the white
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:25.360]  house not that you were they put it out as a
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.240]  projection then when they couldn't control it and turn it into a political
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:31.120]  movement they controlled when it turned against them
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.960]  then if it got out of control peacefully they were going to kill you
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:40.000]  so how does it feel because though that i'm on a purge list not very good
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.960]  well see they're now announcing this to scare everybody though
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.560]  you know it doesn't scare me unless we know they're much crooks
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:50.080]  well they are a bunch of crooks and you know i i ran into your show there and
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:54.240]  i've been listening ever since and you know it's you're saying you're saying
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.680]  a lot of truth out there and it's really good happening you're the first

[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.680]  in florida on public property legally and start fires
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:13.200]  i've been poisoned i never really talked about that before but i mean just you

[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.000]  because it's so insane sounding believe me i know
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.200]  i've had cops repeatedly aiming sniper rifles at me
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.680]  and and trying to intimidate me this country and then look cops

[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.080]  shocked to see someone actually cover it i know uh some other organizers who
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:48.560]  would like to talk about it if you want to speak to them
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.360]  they were subject to the same surveillance and intimidation as well you
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:54.480]  know what i do when i get surveilled i surveil them
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:58.640]  i mean it's just getting the point where you know what

[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:37.200]  correct america it's worse than that when you actually
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:45.120]  read the 16 examples he gives recently of saying a valovictorian can't thank god
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:49.280]  or uh you can't in a school poem to say the word jesus
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:53.760]  folks that's your free speech the state can't get involved in religion

[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.520]  expelling people at school but you can bring a harry potter book

[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:24.560]  who served in the vietnam war the ohio statehouse banned christian pastors
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:28.480]  from using the name jesus when they speak the use of the name jesus was

[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:46.960]  refuses stomp on the name of jesus and sensitivities writing was banned from
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.600]  class oh yeah that's what goes on a student's

[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:43.680]  left will they love it this is authoritarianism calling
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:46.880]  itself liberal calling itself conservative and then you see jc
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.480]  penny with a good-looking teapot a few months
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:53.520]  to go it looks nice like looking at a cloud saying i see
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:56.880]  hitler it's got a handle where it's supposed to be it's got a top
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.280]  around top it's silver let's put let's start rolling some of this footage for

[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:09.440]  here is the evil here is the evil evil evil teapot

[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:18.560]  yes there's the teapot that they say is so horrible
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:22.400]  and that is so evil and then going back to the piece that i put together with
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.480]  rob doom there is the evil teapot and then there
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.960]  is my french bulldog now i could have probably seen
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.120]  hitler in in a pile of dirt outside my house but instead of
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:37.760]  sort of looking at captain our french bulldog
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.120]  and i gotta admit i'm like a closet nazi because i kiss him right on his hitler
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.000]  mustache that dog who gets kisses from me okay
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.800]  and for my children they're there they're sitting supporting hitler
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:49.920]  and look at him i mean he even looks like hitler his eyes kind of look like
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.000]  hitler he's got no fur on his lip and it's what
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.920]  looks like a hitler mustache that dog jc pennies banned those teapots
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:03.440]  and had him destroyed so i'm taking captain today
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:06.480]  into the pound and i'm gonna have him put him in a gas chamber and kill him
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:11.360]  like to do stray dogs and i'm sad but i'm gonna prove that i'm not racist
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:14.880]  and i'm gonna sacrifice him on the ultra political correctness to prove i'm
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.200]  not racist and to satisfy al sharpton so captain
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.800]  should i give him lethal injection or or give him the the the pressure chamber
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:26.320]  i mean i don't want him to feel any pain i love the dog but i mean he does look
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.520]  like hitler and i realized i want to apologize maybe i
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:36.240]  should be gassed because i just realized i my wife and i chose a dog
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.440]  when he was a puppy that had a hitler mustache because of a subconscious
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.600]  racism can we can we put the racism back
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:46.400]  upon air only to illustrate it and to apologize

[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.160]  in fact it may be a genetic experiment he may actually be add off alia was hitler
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:11.280]  perhaps he escaped to america and is hiding out
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:14.800]  not argentina no that was all they were all hiding at the cia

[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:36.080]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:44.720]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live here and i promised
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:51.600]  to premiere some clips from the paul revere contest
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.800]  that we're going to be giving you the winners on monday
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:58.640]  tuesday and then first place on wednesday and so we've got some of that
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.160]  coming up but just getting back to political correctness again
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:06.880]  this is authoritarianism this is not liberalism or caring about anybody you
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:10.160]  need to understand that you know when obama puts al-qaeda in
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:14.960]  charge to call 40 000 black people in libya uh it's to the back of the newspaper
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:18.480]  people say good or when the un goes in and kills whole villages in africa or
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:21.280]  latin america to create a carbon sink and take their
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:24.800]  villages it's in the news but they go well it's for the earth
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:27.920]  you know i mean you you understand they manipulate
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:32.080]  your heartstrings and so i had an idea i said i bet
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:35.280]  if you're making a joke about the jc penny teapot which obviously looks
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:37.520]  nothing like hitler and wasn't meant to be hitler
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.240]  i mean it is insane that my french bulldog uh
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:46.320]  looks like he has a hitler mustache because he doesn't have any fur on his
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:49.600]  upper lip he's got black skin he's got black spots on there
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:54.000]  there's a black spot right there that are there other racist animals
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.920]  that need to be taken to be gotten rid of like the teapots
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:01.280]  and we did find some if you type in hitler animals or hitler dog
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:05.280]  we found a baby english bulldog very racist
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.120]  hyling hitler not only does its nose look like a hitler mustache
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:13.520]  look at the hate in the eyes uh the dog has been trained to raise its arm
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.680]  and i mean look alert al sharpton immediately and there's cats
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:21.440]  look at that cat right there it's got a little black on its nose
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:24.160]  it's got black on its head that makes it look like hitler
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:28.560]  and off hitler look at i've seen boxers too
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:32.000]  out that look a little bit like hitler and i'm gonna walk over
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:38.400]  and i'm gonna say hey you need to be sent for reeducation because we all know
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:43.600]  that you are basically in league uh with hitler
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:48.160]  and and you know i consider and joke about this folks it cares my heart out
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:51.520]  to know how conscious this authoritarianism is and how they get us all obsessed
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:54.480]  with imaginary stuff well meanwhile we're all losing our
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:56.720]  bill of rights and constitution our basic freedom

[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:46.480]  hi it's just sent uh just sent a great i'm sorry i can't read today
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:49.200]  believe me it's it's descending into our live zone
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  everybody messes that name up i i didn't expect it to be correct
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:39:00.240]  um good afternoon um i have listened to you for a while now usually for youtube
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.880]  and uh believe it or not um i have a counter argument for the uk filter
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:13.280]  um because what basically led me to this big awakening um
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:17.280]  was pretty much i was anti pornography for
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:21.520]  a long time and i just could not figure out
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:28.480]  why it is so rampant and damaging and nobody's doing anything about it
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:32.320]  now one thing led to another and believe it or not it led me
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.000]  to you because everything suddenly tied together
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.480]  um i went from the anti pornography to basically reading
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.640]  do you know Yuri Besmanoff's books he uh
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.440]  went under the pseudonym Thomas Schuman he was a defector from russia
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:52.080]  Soviet Union
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:57.520]  are you there yeah what happened is i was going to be premiering videos right
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.840]  now but i'm the only one that had the list that had the timecode on it so i'm
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:04.720]  trying to queue up videos while you talk i don't normally ignore the listeners
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:08.240]  but i'm i'm doing show prep here on air go ahead keep going
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:13.920]  okay well uh here's the thing um
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:18.400]  to say that you're blacklisted for opting in to basically go and
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:22.080]  and do a uh you know say i want the filter turned off
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:26.480]  i find that silly because for a while i've wanted something like this
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:31.200]  germany has something like that where you have to go to a post office and say
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:35.680]  you know i want to go ahead and be able to look at the adult content
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:39.920]  and how this saves kids is i mean on the iphone and whatnot
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:43.440]  they can have access to it anytime and you can make the argument parents
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:46.720]  need to be more on top of their kids no i don't
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.640]  believe that we have stores where you have to be 18 or older
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:54.640]  and able to even walk in um but the internet has taken away that
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:59.520]  step it's sex on tap and tell me this why is the
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.720]  pornography market um targeting boys from 11 to 17
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:08.320]  that's underage well i mean they're trying to sexualize children nicolodian
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.920]  and viacom admit that they have pbs documentaries about it
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:15.760]  um because they find it effective marketing to bind you to the brand
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:19.680]  uh and they want to wreck society i mean it's a psychological warfare
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:26.800]  uh weapon and major governments uh run all the major vices
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.160]  and Zbigniew Brzezinski's written multiple books admitting this their
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.560]  argument is well we control it then so it doesn't get out of hand
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:37.840]  i mean it's the ultimate thing of you know we control it it's like in the godfather
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:40.480]  we're we're going to build the drugs but we're going to control it i mean that
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:45.040]  is so accurate to how they sell the idea of we're just
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:48.800]  going to give it to the colored people uh to quote the godfather
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:52.160]  uh their animals anyways let them lose their souls
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:55.760]  show but but now see it's everybody it's because we're all animals
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:58.960]  to the new world order their gods when and really they're the animals
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:02.640]  are lower than the animals uh so yeah look look
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:06.320]  they flood everything with porn illegal porn all of it
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:09.040]  and then just use it like they flood the country with drugs
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:12.560]  to frame whoever they want and then to create a new witch hunt where they're
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.800]  the savior they create the al-qaeda they create the
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:18.240]  communists they create the nazis they fight it they ship the drugs in they
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:20.960]  fight it they put fluoride in the water destroy education
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:24.240]  and then say they're taking over with even more education to fight it so yes
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:28.000]  great great question ma'am uh let's go ahead and talk to
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:34.880]  Anna Anna you're on the air go ahead hi Alex thank you so much
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.720]  um a couple of things that are going on right now in Florida that you might not
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:43.040]  be aware of um the DEA is putting a lot of us
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:48.400]  physicians and pharmacists in jail um they've closed down these quote unquote
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:52.880]  pain clinics which aren't a good idea but they've left a lot of these people
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.800]  who are in pain without medication and now they're
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:01.120]  committing suicide so a lot of the uh doctors who are
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.680]  working in these clinics are now being put in prison and a lot of them
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:09.760]  were good doctors they're they were doing nothing wrong
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:14.400]  i don't know if you're aware of that uh yes i am aware of all this and they
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.480]  are now criminalizing everything uh if they say they're coming to your house
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.680]  because of drugs we don't need a warrant and a swat team comes no law
[02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:24.960]  says it uh they'll grab even five hundred
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:29.280]  dollars out of somebody's even an old lady and say well it may be drugs
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:33.360]  and the sheriff or the judge you'll have seen him on the news go
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:38.000]  sing it in i'll do whatever i want we tested the bills and one of them had
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.440]  a residue well they know almost all money if it's old
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:45.840]  you know been in circulation has drug residue on it uh because it's being
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.800]  moved by drug dealers by banks that are the drug dealers
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:52.160]  and by people that use it to snort drugs i mean it's just ridiculous
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:55.040]  and so there are you see the shows on everywhere
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:00.160]  about yes we run checkpoints take your cash
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:04.560]  i mean it's just we give people inoculations we do what we want
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:07.520]  uh i mean it's like rick perry saying it's the law to take Gardasil when
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.240]  there's no law they just run frauds on the helpless gullible
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:18.880]  childlike public we have a brain damaged childlike poisoned drunk on
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:22.960]  poisoned uh gibbering public brainwashed from birth by the
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:27.040]  television who literally think freedom is a hundred and
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:31.360]  one million people on food assistance who think uniformed police and black
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:34.560]  uniforms at checkpoints everywhere and helicopters looking through our walls
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:37.520]  is freedom and so yeah i mean the dea every
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:40.880]  agency is growing like cancer and they're taken over and they're hiring
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:43.760]  people that want to run our lives and we've seen this before and we're in deep
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:46.880]  trouble let me play some of these clips from some
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:51.920]  of these films here this is a 19 minute film or so up on the
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:56.320]  paul revere site at info wars dot com forward slash uh revere but i'm just
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:59.760]  going to play a minute of it the film is about pullpots democide
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:03.440]  first they took the military then the journalist and anyone with an education
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:06.480]  even those that wore glasses by the way the u.s government funded all this and
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:09.200]  ran it brazinski wrote a book about that he actually planned it all
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:12.720]  they killed 30 of the population also talks about all the communists
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.160]  destroyed people's will destroyed the family by murder and by
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:19.120]  isolation and it's narrated by english speaker then a
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:22.880]  cambodian speaker talks about how they destroy families
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.400]  uh and so his accent makes a little bit difficult understands all narrate some
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.120]  of that let's go to a short clip from drop of
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.200]  water please see the whole thing at info wars dot com great job of the
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:40.240]  filmmakers there it is and then we'll uh
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:43.600]  the spirit of gremlins has entered the building again
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:46.480]  we're going to do this on sunday and do it right we're gonna have a big three
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.880]  hour meeting powwows everything else and then we'll do this because it
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:55.040]  it's weird like once something messes up it's like balan wire man
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.760]  speaking of that i said i'd tell the story and i'll tell this story now
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:06.320]  okay uh speaking of that um
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:09.920]  so my wife's out of town taking the children uh to a nearby city with my
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:13.680]  mother to look at museums uh they did every few months going to
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:17.760]  museum trip so they're visiting museums in texas
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.600]  and so i'm home alone i don't know why that adds the story
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:24.640]  it's already kind of a bummer you come home your family in there so i go i'll
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:28.000]  go out to a movie with my dad last night so we went out and saw just to see what
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.600]  all the hype was about uh the worst movie ever as they're calling it uh
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:35.120]  not being contrarian saying it has some some good points but also some bad
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.160]  points um only god forgives
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.680]  with gosseling and and the amazing director has made some other very
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:47.760]  interesting films amazing cinematography but i get home at 10 30 at
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:51.680]  night with a movie that's got a lot of you know graphic
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:55.840]  violence in it and i walk in and i see a fishing
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.840]  pole in the living room going into my youngest daughter's
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:02.320]  bedroom
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:09.200]  fishing line and so i go in there and the chihuahua bambi 16 years old love the
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:11.440]  dog
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:18.640]  is pinned down to the carpet and has a deep-sea fishing lure that was in the
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:21.600]  garage the garage was closed i don't know my son had it out or
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:26.480]  something left in his room i don't know what happened deep sea lure
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.440]  pinning it to the ground because it's one of those deep sea lures about four
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:31.760]  inches long and then it's got a big trouble
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:35.200]  look on the back maybe we should google and show the people this or start page
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:39.520]  it uh a a treble hook uh topwater bait and it's
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:42.240]  got a treble hook three hooks on the back with really bad barbs and three on
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:46.480]  the front it's interchast with it pinned to the floor
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:50.320]  with the other one pender or arm and i work for a small animal vet for a
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.840]  couple years work for large animal vet off and on for about a year
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:57.680]  in several stents so i i could tell she didn't go to the vet because a vet that
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:03.360]  wants a bunch of money out of you uh would do a big surgery put
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:07.360]  her under at 16 years old she's already got health problems might not live
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:12.800]  barely survived a surgery a few years ago uh for some medical issues
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:15.760]  and so because i knew i'd have to talk to my wife about it and why you're
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:18.000]  here to the vet and all this stuff but the point is
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.920]  so i'm sitting there and i can either take it to the vet
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.160]  and an old-fashioned vets gonna pull these out and it's gonna rip the skin
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:29.920]  or a modern that's going to do surgery and slice it open and you know 10 times
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:34.320]  works for the dog so i'm sitting there and i turn the
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.160]  dog over with carpet attached to her and it's it's hard to pull a treble hook
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:41.920]  out of a fish's mouth you got to use pliers
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:45.200]  but i'm so emotional and i don't think they'll get pliers but i know how to
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.600]  work them out so you pull up and out but i was more exhausted after this last
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:52.640]  night that i've been in decades and then this morning i was really exhausted
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.720]  psychically you know psychologically from the dog which didn't resist me and do
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:00.720]  it and it knew it wanted to be released took me like 10 minutes because
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.240]  she had from fighting it all three hooks
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:07.840]  on each of them in her from you know trying to get it out more got in
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:11.760]  so i had and it's hard when there's three in i had to work one
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:15.200]  out and got so angry i was able to actually bend it up and out
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.960]  doing it and then i had to get the others out and
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:25.600]  the point is is that uh i couldn't imagine like your child in a car wreck or
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:28.720]  something about their kids pinned in and crying and hurt
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:32.400]  what it would be like because i was like you know love the dog and have empathy
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:35.200]  for it and then i just wondered i'm so drained today
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.880]  and really in a weird mental state from it
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:42.160]  it's not even that traumatic but it was my dog i mean i've been there and helped
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:44.800]  other animals that were in trouble and it's still stressful
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:48.720]  i thought about how stressful is for doctors and vets who have empathy
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.080]  to to to be around suffering and i thought who are people
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:55.360]  that like suffering and it just kind of made me think
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:59.600]  what the enemy's like and and then they manipulate those of us that have
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:04.160]  bleeding hearts for life
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:08.000]  they manipulate us
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:13.440]  to give up our liberties and things in the name of doing sweet nice things and
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:17.040]  they're just messing with us but then i thought it is good i wouldn't
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.560]  enjoy hurting somebody who was really evil but i would enjoy
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:24.960]  stopping them so i guess in a way i you know
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:27.520]  some bully starts a fight with you they're beating you up you get a good
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.600]  punch in knock them out they hit the concrete and for a minute you know as
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.400]  you watch blood pour out from the back of their head you're like yeah then you
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:36.880]  go uh oh the person's like you know flopping around
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:39.360]  on the ground and you realize i don't have to deal with this
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.760]  but but you know it's not like oh i'm glad i hurt him it's glad you've had
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.240]  victory but not glad you're just hurting someone
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:49.360]  even somebody who's evil i just it's so alien to me like
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:52.960]  people sexually that are into pain and stuff i i just i just don't
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:56.880]  i i just don't get it i just don't get it and i guess i'm a square i'm a bad

[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:30.480]  before he died Arthur C. Clark inventor of the telecommunications
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:35.520]  satellite OSS operative Fabian socialist new world order
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:40.720]  master planner basically gave out the symbology of 2001 space
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:44.160]  odyssey and you can go look up my reviews of that film going back more
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:48.320]  than 15 years one of them is online it's exactly what Arthur C. Clark later
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:51.920]  said it was and i mean it's not hard when you know all the symbology
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:57.280]  archetypal Joseph Campbell didn't invent all this he kind of quantified it
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:01.520]  you realize the subconscious programming that the social engineers are
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:06.160]  involved in and i want you to be aware of the fire of the gods
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:09.280]  that because they're not gods they're humans like us
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.360]  trying to suppress us i believe in an open straight up society
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:19.280]  and only god forgives first got really bad reviews
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:23.600]  now it's getting really good reviews in the last few days as people start to get
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.280]  what it's really about i don't like just or two of this mindless pointless
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:30.960]  violence i mean it's based on a true story to illustrate
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:35.040]  something it's got some scenes of torture in it
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.080]  and it's about the two sides of good and evil
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.800]  and at certain points how close are they together
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:47.760]  and the the brian gozling character is almost the bridge between his brother
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.600]  ryan gozling uh and
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:57.520]  his brother who plays the the devil i mean that's all it is
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:04.640]  i'm going to talk to the devil's the tagline uh for the film and it is very
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:08.880]  easy to understand uh what the whole thing is about
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:15.680]  and it just shows how unconscious the population is
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:20.480]  that they still don't know what the movie is about
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:23.920]  but it is a two it has 2001 space odyssey
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:28.640]  type stuff it's got him going through the inner dimensional gate
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:32.320]  or the womb and it's got him being
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:37.520]  reincarnated and it's got the the police captain and
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:42.560]  the uh ryan gozling character have a psychic connection and it's totally
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:47.280]  clear what's going on in the film and i just again i'm not up here going
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:49.360]  hey i know what the film's really all about
[02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:52.960]  aha you don't i don't know how people can't go see the movie and see what it's
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:56.560]  about now at one level it is an asian exploitation film
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:59.920]  about yeah the asians beat up the white guys and kill the white guys and
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:02.400]  they're in charge and they're slick and they're cool
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:05.600]  but it's not even really aimed at an asian market it's meant to look like an
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.520]  asian film it's a very sophisticated
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:15.120]  okay i'll probably go see it again uh because
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:20.720]  it it it it it's it's definitely i you know i want to get that director on
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:26.320]  and ask that guy i'm sure he's really smart uh european fellow uh nicholas
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:30.000]  wending reffen i'm gonna go see his other movies now i want to get him
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.720]  honestly did you came up with this on your own
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:35.680]  because uh it's one thing to even know this stuff nothing to actually put it
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:40.480]  into form and i'm still trying to analyze what the motive is in this
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:43.680]  i don't think there is a motive i think is super deep art
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:47.680]  over the top of on guard and it's really a statement about all the senseless
[02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:51.440]  violence in the culture there are movies out that that you know take
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:56.480]  sylvester Stallone and in his latest uh movies the expendables
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:59.920]  that are probably
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:04.880]  50 times more violent and more graphic but this is done
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:10.640]  in a very archetypal slow way the violence that's in it
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:17.040]  it actually has a lot less violence in it than a john wane movie but it's done

[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:07.440]  and most people are really positive about not being the top 35 so people are
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:11.200]  real mad they thought their ship had come in your ship came in making a film
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:15.760]  your ship came in taking action against the globalist your ship came in living
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:18.960]  contributing that was the whole point of this it didn't about
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:23.680]  the hundred and fifteen thousand dollars it's about you guys all trying to make
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:26.000]  films even if your film is not that good the first
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.520]  stuff i did is i'd turn on a light in the control room
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:32.960]  because it took like six months of classes to get on access because he only
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.840]  gave like three classes and only gave him every two months
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:40.800]  and they gave him right around the same time and i was working full time so i
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:43.840]  have to go in take classes volunteer on other shows
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:48.480]  where i could get on and then uh you know just be a guest for one minute on
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:52.320]  somebody's show in in 1995 and then when i finally
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:55.600]  after six months got my license
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:58.160]  yeah i didn't know to go ask people to help me whatever went in the control
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:02.080]  room brought a camera in what i'd turn on the light real bright
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:06.080]  the exposure all wrong go i think it's wrong they want to take our guns
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:09.120]  in third world countries they've done that to enslave them listen the
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:12.160]  government's getting guns and and locally they're taking old people's
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:15.840]  property for this sos plan has nothing to do with the with the water recharge
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:19.120]  zone they're giving it to and by the way we should go do such and
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:23.600]  such i mean it was just purely resisting and and you'd see it
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:27.920]  out of 600 plus entries i would say my first shows
[03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:32.800]  production wise are worse than everything you did i i mean i would be
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:37.520]  number 655 okay i mean the worst bottom of the barrel
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:40.640]  and some days i'm still the worst bottom of the barrel
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:44.320]  do you know what i'm real folks and you know it don't you
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:48.480]  and what i like is real i wasn't smiling on a power trip i was thinking about
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:52.160]  real people and just how much i love them because i'm a love machine ladies and
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:55.760]  gentlemen and i work for you and you work for me
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.080]  we're in this together and this is a fun adventure on a
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:04.480]  planetoid in deep space with crazy government and a bunch of
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:07.280]  weirdos that love to torture us and stuff running things and this is the
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:10.320]  great animating contest of liberty this is what makes good people
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:14.480]  stand and flourish and shine is the challenge of evil
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:18.640]  and i can see god's plan though from a primitive
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:23.200]  troglodyte perspective i can see god's plan just the edge of it and i can
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.520]  imagine and then i can begin to imagine the things the ear
[03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:30.800]  is not heard the eye is not seen that god has in store for us
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:35.840]  and i'm just you know what if they kill me be me up scotty

[03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:19.680]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer

[03:08:18.480 --> 03:08:23.600]  with your host alex jones broadcasting live from the front lines
[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:29.520]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:36.000]  nobody understands that because it's gibberish and that's what the globalist
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:39.840]  pump out is cultural gibberish everybody just gets confused
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:42.720]  that's one of their most effective propaganda techniques i gotta tell you
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:45.840]  hollywood knows that more and more positive stuff is what's selling cc
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:49.120]  movies like op and superman man of steel
[03:08:49.120 --> 03:08:54.560]  uh and and and and more wholesome narratives
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:58.080]  but the establishment allows it because it's only in fiction
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:04.480]  so it almost gives you like the idea in your mind of a respite from the tyranny
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:07.840]  and that's why they allow that we need to have a real respite in our own lives
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:12.560]  and build good stories in our own lives and do good things
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:15.200]  not just because we're goody tissues but because it's
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:20.400]  fulfilling and that's what really blocks the new world order so i salute my crew
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:23.680]  the sponsors the listeners everybody that makes the transmission possible i'm
[03:09:23.680 --> 03:09:25.760]  going to go to your phone calls that's why we're in overdrive but
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:31.120]  some clips i promise to get to uh the first one i want to play is a marijuana
[03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:35.120]  is the new beer ad that's showing at nascar events to the hundreds of
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:39.360]  thousands that attend on the jumbo trons and i want to be clear
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:45.760]  i don't think marijuana overall is totally positive i know it has a lot
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:48.640]  of medical attributes i know the feds hate it because they can't control it
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:51.600]  it can be grown anywhere they banned hemp that doesn't even have dhc
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:55.600]  that makes better cotton and better stuff than polyester the chemical groups
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:59.120]  and cotton groups lobby against it i get all that
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:02.960]  but there's also this pro weed culture where the marijuana now
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:07.440]  i mean is like super strong a lot of it and and it does turn a lot of people
[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:11.920]  that would just be medium uh achievers into zombies into welfare
[03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:15.440]  zombies smoking dope and watching tv all day and walking around so stone they
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:19.120]  look like they've had a lobotomy so so let's just get straight i want to
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:22.880]  decriminalize because i'm tired of it funding the police state takeover
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:26.160]  the british brought down china by getting china to make drugs illegal so they
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:28.320]  could chip them in and make profits and take over
[03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:31.520]  i don't like the globalists the banks doing this so they can launder the money
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:34.320]  that's why i'm for total pretty much legalization i think it should be
[03:10:34.320 --> 03:10:38.000]  controlled though because it'll just go right back into a black market they can
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.600]  control it's gonna be a big fight but but you know
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:47.360]  this ad says less harmful than alcohol way less harmful on average
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:51.040]  now they're starting to engineer marijuana and and breed it to be stronger
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:55.280]  and stronger and i think therein lies the issue and will also give marijuana a
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:58.640]  bad name i mean it's a million times better than prozac of your upset the
[03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:02.240]  study show it's better for depression people with cancer all
[03:11:02.240 --> 03:11:04.800]  sorts of stuff helping them hold down food
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:07.920]  i mean it has a lot of miraculous traits to it and if people want to go home
[03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:11.760]  after a long day and not abuse marijuana and it's you know take a couple of
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:15.360]  tokes off a joint george washington did that they called it
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:19.680]  toothache or stomachache uh hemp they they there's only a few varieties
[03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:23.200]  actually have the thc and high levels in it so george washington smoked pot out
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:26.640]  of out of we had toothaches i mean you know a long day with the president
[03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:30.480]  let me have some of that let me have some of that stomachache or some of that
[03:11:30.480 --> 03:11:34.320]  toothache weed i mean every culture in most
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:36.960]  areas of the world has smoked marijuana and they and it was the medicine man it
[03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:40.480]  was a it's just a drug folks it's a drug
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:43.680]  that's a lot better than the pharmaceutical stuff so that's where i
[03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:48.240]  stand on marijuana i mean i as an experiment throughout my
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:52.800]  life have smoked marijuana off and on uh i didn't like it when i was younger
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:56.000]  because i didn't know what the stuff my friends had was like cheap
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.960]  you know what they call like mexican brown weed and it makes you want to just
[03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:01.920]  eat you know later on the couch feel like you've been run over by truck
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:06.720]  and just uh that's not what i'm into uh i've smoked
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:10.640]  designer marijuana before that made me feel like i could write classical music
[03:12:10.640 --> 03:12:15.840]  i so i'm gonna just tell you right now folks it it's it's it's a heavy-duty thing
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:18.560]  the different varieties they've got now the stuff rich people are smoking in
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:23.840]  los angeles is is is really amazing the issue
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:26.640]  is though they start doing it more and more and i see it take over their lives
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:30.080]  as well so i'm not smoking it everybody that's
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:33.360]  into it it takes over their life so i want to be clear about it to young
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:36.480]  people out there uh and young people aren't going to listen to a message if
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:38.240]  you smoke marijuana you'll kill your parents like
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:41.760]  reformandus they'll listen to me be honest about it
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:45.120]  i'm not going to say i i i tried marijuana but didn't inhale
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:48.640]  i've inhaled plenty i'm like well i like these cigarettes and chewing
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:51.600]  tobacco so much and my dad's at work i smoke his
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:56.880]  regular pipe with uh you know uh tobacco i love this let me give me some of that
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:02.400]  marijuana i don't like it uh but again i've been
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:06.720]  old-fashioned marijuana i don't like it the new stuff is scary
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:10.320]  uh and uh you can tell when somebody's a dope smoker
[03:13:10.320 --> 03:13:13.920]  a heavy dope smoker it really changes them it builds up in the brain
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:18.080]  it doesn't kill brain cells it it puts them into a
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:24.160]  arrested relaxed formation i'll tell you this i don't ever get
[03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:27.840]  any trouble out of pot smokers and the government kind of likes that so see
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:29.760]  that's why there's also the george soros group
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.480]  wants to legalize it because uh now i'm gonna shut up now
[03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:37.280]  because i've got to go to your calls but the whole point is that there's a lot
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:40.880]  of contending groups out there and and there's also big groups that know when
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:44.160]  this stuff gets legalized they want to be in position to control it
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:46.880]  and the last thing i want as it becomes legalized
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:51.120]  is to have the cigarette companies that are tied up with big pharma you didn't
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:54.720]  know that look it up the last thing i want is for them to go in and
[03:13:54.720 --> 03:13:58.240]  add chemicals you know some cigarettes have over 300 chemicals in them
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:02.640]  that's what's really deadly them now the cigarettes have flame retardant in it
[03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:06.240]  that's totally carcinogens carcinogenic i mean you'd be
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:09.120]  crazy to smoke so folks if you smoke cigarettes stop now
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:12.640]  please stop now people go why is the government doing it because they lost
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:17.040]  that battle government used to say smoke cigarettes
[03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:20.800]  they knew hundreds of years ago what tobacco did when it's abused
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:25.520]  okay now let's get to this right here 97 percent of climate activists in the pay
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:29.440]  of big oil shock london telegraph i already knew this
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:33.040]  but james dilling poll has written about it and links to the study
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:36.640]  yes big oil wants to shut down its main competition who's that
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:40.240]  well giving lip service to to fake new energy so they can control the new
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:42.800]  energy movement and not let the real one come forward
[03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:46.800]  see that's control your enemy fund al-qaeda fund the communists
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:50.160]  see so then you can oppose them while controlling them it's full spectrum
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:52.720]  dominance it's the globalist mindset it's like
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:57.520]  one of the first james bond movies they have you know three fighting fish
[03:14:57.520 --> 03:15:00.560]  and he opens the door and the two kill each other
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:03.680]  or one gets killed other gets injured then the big one comes in and knocks out
[03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:06.480]  the competition that's how this works folks get into full
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:12.320]  spectrum dominance awareness it's it's elementary my dear friend once you do it
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:16.160]  but i mean i just discovered this at the underwriting
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:19.920]  97 percent he goes through the links to it
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:28.480]  of the climate change alarmist groups are funded wait for it by big oil
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:40.240]  oh yeah exxon mobile dutch roll shell bp texaco chevron
[03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:45.760]  of course because what is the main challenge
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:51.840]  to fuel to oil the main challenge is coal and again i get zero money from
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:53.920]  coal my family gets no money from coal
[03:15:53.920 --> 03:15:56.480]  they always say you're making money from the old companies no no the oil
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:15:59.520]  companies want to shut down our power plants
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:03.920]  and make us energy starved on average i mean the ap sued
[03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:07.360]  in 2000 got the documents where they said there's too much oil worldwide
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:10.720]  let's fund this peak oil idea this is not a dependant
[03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:14.720]  10 oil companies met in 1995 and 96 95 they first met
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:18.880]  then the ap article shows that paul watson's written about the ap article
[03:16:18.880 --> 03:16:23.120]  years after it came out just pointing it out i was proud of it came out in ap
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:26.080]  but of course it didn't get picked up anywhere but then a year later they
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:28.960]  meet again they go the answer is buy up all the refineries shut them off
[03:16:28.960 --> 03:16:32.160]  and fund environmental groups demand new ones not be built
[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:35.920]  and demand that no pipelines be built that way we have artificial scarcity
[03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:41.040]  and that's why you've gone since then from paying 65 70 85 90 cents a gallon
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:45.600]  to paying 350 a gallon and dollar devaluation see this is what real info
[03:16:45.600 --> 03:16:48.640]  is about then you don't have to be conned and ripped off anymore
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:52.720]  and i mean if i have one more communist authoritarian hippie
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:55.600]  because this happens every few months and whole foods are on the street go i
[03:16:55.600 --> 03:17:01.680]  like your show man but i know you're fun about all companies on global warming
[03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:06.400]  i mean i want to punch him in the nose okay
[03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:08.960]  let me tell you what i do get well i don't get any money from it but i've got
[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:12.000]  family gets a little bit of money from it it's natural gas i mean on average you
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.560]  get like 500 bucks a month or something you know because those things don't
[03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:18.640]  even hardly pump any in east texas
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:22.720]  this cousin gets 600 this one gets 500 this one gets 400
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:27.840]  i mean i you know the whole point is is that if they're able to shut down coal
[03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:31.200]  and natural gas groups are lobbying to shut down coal too
[03:17:31.200 --> 03:17:35.120]  then i'll my family will start getting some money i guess if i just thought of
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:41.200]  things like from a from a self-centered position
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:48.160]  that i would then be yes yes shut down coal shut down coal shut down coal
[03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:51.440]  because we might get tens of thousands of dollars a month in my family if that
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:54.480]  happened and don't worry natural gas companies are lobbying they're one of
[03:17:54.480 --> 03:17:58.720]  the biggest groups to shut down coal most sure these electric cars most their
[03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:01.840]  power 50 plus percent comes from coal
[03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:04.720]  i mean i love it they say coal's the worst thing and that's where it's not
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:08.080]  the worst thing they're totally clean now and they're shutting them down
[03:18:08.080 --> 03:18:11.440]  they're shutting america down it's why i'm obsessed on this we're going to skip
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:14.800]  this network break because this is such a big central deal
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:20.560]  you know of real god zillas came out of the ocean and they wanted to take out
[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:25.200]  our cities that attack our power plants folks that's what obama is a giant kaiju
[03:18:25.200 --> 03:18:28.640]  a giant yes i think a japanese monster or godzilla
[03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:31.520]  and i've already gone over that analogy with people but i'm just watching this
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:36.320]  happen and then here it is the proof i i i knew
[03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:40.880]  it was most of them i in fact i never saw an enviro nazi group that wasn't
[03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:44.560]  funded by oil companies and see the genius of that you're like al-qaeda is
[03:18:44.560 --> 03:18:47.600]  funded by the government oh you're crazy and it's like it's all admitted though
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:51.920]  if you just look uh no the anti oil groups are funded by oil
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:55.920]  because it's fake opposition and then it's admitted that people just can't
[03:18:55.920 --> 03:18:58.880]  compute that our government funded hitler our
[03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:02.640]  government funded the communist because our government's not our government
[03:19:02.640 --> 03:19:06.480]  it's the globalist that's why they're in charge that's why they're in control
[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:10.160]  they know what they're doing so i've now gone from
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:14.080]  marijuana to that but but here's the clip uh that is going to be airing at
[03:19:14.080 --> 03:19:19.600]  nascar's all over the country marijuana is the new beer and it just shows
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:23.040]  that that that once people realize something's hypocrisy
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:27.520]  it collapses and this could happen on every other issue here it is
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:31.680]  if you're an adult who enjoys a good beer there's a similar product you might
[03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:34.800]  want to know about one without all the calories
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:38.400]  and serious health problem less toxic so it doesn't cause
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:45.040]  hangovers or overdose deaths and it's not linked to violence or reckless behavior
[03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:50.240]  marijuana less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way
[03:19:50.240 --> 03:19:56.080]  for more information visit marijuanaissafer.org
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:20:04.320]  yeah i mean i would just run ads saying the 1997 congressional hearing with the
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:07.920]  cias lister general found that the vast majority of narcotics are shipped to
[03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:12.240]  the country by the government and since then since the drug war began in the
[03:20:12.240 --> 03:20:16.080]  1980s really started in the mid 70s but heated up in the 80s
[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:20.080]  we've seen a more than tripling of the amount of drug use in the country
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:23.920]  alcohol prohibition didn't work and this prohibition didn't work unless it's
[03:20:23.920 --> 03:20:26.720]  lining the bank accounts of giant banks
[03:20:26.720 --> 03:20:29.680]  bloomberg reported that wakovia and wells fargo alone
[03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:33.760]  laundered 378 billion in a two-year period now you know why they're lobbying
[03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:38.000]  to keep drugs illegal because they're the drug dealers
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:42.960]  there's your 60 second ad don't you guys think that that's the ad we should
[03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:45.760]  have of course the people at NASCAR will be like
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:50.400]  what they're talking about about banks it's a commie ad
[03:20:50.400 --> 03:20:59.440]  so you've got to tailor it that way okay my dear commies
[03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:04.320]  let's go ahead and uh talk to andy in
[03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:08.960]  utah site of the giant nsa command base
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:14.160]  hey this is alex how you doing good i'm seeing the uh hitler moustache out here

[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:21.520]  a racist yeah i must be too well yeah i mean i mean
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:24.880]  my dog looks like he has a hitler mustache and the dog needs to be banned
[03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:29.840]  like that teapot you know it's interesting i i i didn't have to
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:32.240]  tell him to say this but i'm uh you know dear
[03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:35.840]  friend who's black he's not very literate out here and he doesn't listen to
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:40.160]  info wars and he's retired but boy he sure has been buying into this
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:44.400]  tea party as racist stuff i had to have a sit down with him the other day but
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:47.600]  yeah they're they're certainly doing the best madison avenue
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:51.520]  you know that's it that's right they're madison avenue that guns and freedom
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:53.920]  are racist because once they teach you all the
[03:21:53.920 --> 03:21:56.000]  whites are racist and then what are they promoting
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:00.960]  they're promoting freedom oh my goodness well you saw that jc penning teapot i
[03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:04.000]  mean that was racist too and if you don't support the health care bill
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:08.160]  you're racist you didn't know that and andy
[03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:12.640]  alex you know i love your sarcasm i think the best part part of it is when
[03:22:12.640 --> 03:22:16.000]  you do one of your voice limitations while you do it otherwise dumb dumb
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:19.520]  think you might be telling you know speaking while you're talking about
[03:22:19.520 --> 03:22:22.960]  uh i know you're right you're right i'm in the absurdity of all of this i mean
[03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:26.400]  this is i don't need to take acid i mean this is like
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:30.160]  live living living in this modern culture is like hallucinating i mean it
[03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:34.080]  is just freaky and and and then again
[03:22:34.080 --> 03:22:37.280]  those of us that know it's crazy we become the weirdos
[03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:40.400]  god bless you good to hear from me andy and i've used this analogy five thousand
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:43.200]  times i'll do it again if i teleported back a thousand
[03:22:43.200 --> 03:22:50.480]  years ago to central mexico in in in in chalupa outside mexico city
[03:22:50.480 --> 03:22:54.400]  and i said do not sacrifice your children
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:23:00.800]  to quitscott lepoto or to chock mule you know the sun is really a ball of fire it
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:04.320]  will come back in the morning uh we're in deep space two-thirds
[03:23:04.320 --> 03:23:08.960]  the way out on the spiral arm of the milky way galaxy the atmosphere is thinner
[03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:14.880]  than the skin on a uh apple we
[03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:19.120]  yeah i come from the future they would say sacrifice him
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:23.680]  and i know they would because albinos are white people and whenever they had albinos
[03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:26.480]  they got tortured royally for a long period of time because that was special
[03:23:26.480 --> 03:23:30.560]  for the gods anything special so it'd be awful off with this crackers
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:35.840]  hind and immediately uh just because it was so wonderful and so so so so alien
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:39.840]  so special uh and if i teleported back three thousand years ago to one of the
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.400]  stone circles where they were sacrificing people and i said you're
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:46.160]  feeling energy because there's a magnetic line blasting out of the earth
[03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:50.080]  here and you have cells in your brain used for navigation like birds and fish
[03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:53.200]  that's not been proven that are picking up on this the normal
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:56.800]  electromagnetic field of the earth that you're in tune with is about 10 times
[03:23:56.800 --> 03:24:01.440]  stronger here they would say
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:05.440]  or i guess they'd actually speak kind of a germanic uh Celtic dialect of
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:11.440]  umga sunga bunga and you know
[03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:18.160]  you know whatever and drag me on i mean i don't know trying to make up some ancient dialect

[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:14.160]  and i guess if he was scottish it'd be a McWiener
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:21.440]  what if he was a british it'd be a lime wiener
[03:36:22.400 --> 03:36:27.600]  oh my goodness a uh hey now i'm getting hungry a kraut wiener

[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:54.880]  the ones who want you gone and what's the name of your channel
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:59.920]  uh i'm on uh i i'm on the info wars contest entries where i find it
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:03.680]  no i don't know but we'll need to search it on youtube just just just uh
[03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:10.240]  say the name again it says ziggy parton z-i-g-y-p-a-r-t-o-n
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:15.120]  ziggy parton and then the name of the the video one more time
[03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:18.960]  is the ones who want you gone the ones who want you gone well listen
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:22.240]  that's your good widows my and that's how they get the work in poor
[03:38:22.240 --> 03:38:26.640]  where you can't ever get the credit or the or the money you need
[03:38:26.640 --> 03:38:29.600]  to get the apartment and then i talked to a big apartment managers they're
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:32.400]  ordered by the federal government to give the illegals the apartment with no
[03:38:32.400 --> 03:38:35.280]  proof preferential treatment over america's whether you be white
[03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:38.320]  hispanic black whatever and then you get stuck in these
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:42.800]  weekly hotels where you can never save enough money to get out of them
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:46.880]  and that's where churches used to come around you know the real work in poor
[03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:50.400]  so they could save money you don't have family you can move in with till you
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:38:52.880]  save enough money to get on your feet
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:56.640]  no i'm i'm pretty happy where i'm at i i i work seven days a week at
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:01.840]  maintaining a an rv campsite well if you're happy then brother good job
[03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:05.680]  so hallelujah well good yeah as long as you know that you love the universe and
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:09.040]  god i mean it's just every day is a banquet it's just beauty beauty
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:14.640]  everywhere sorry go ahead oh i'm sorry um i was gonna say if if you
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:17.360]  like the song i mean you're welcome to use it uh maybe
[03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:21.680]  audioly enhance it audioly because i did it i engineered it myself i'm not a
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:25.360]  good we got stuff like crazy like alex jones an info warrior and so much great
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:28.400]  music we've been sent we should put more of that in rotation
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:31.600]  and play more of it then encourage others to make more
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:35.280]  uh so that's a great idea uh let me uh let you go ziggie and i'll play a
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:37.680]  little bit of this for computer doesn't hiccup today like it was doing we got
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:41.520]  three of them in there but lord knows you know internet is these days
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:47.040]  do we have it queued up and ready all right let's go to where the devil
[03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:50.880]  if i were the prince of darkness i'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness
[03:39:50.880 --> 03:39:54.160]  and i'd have a third of its real estate and four bits of its population but i
[03:39:54.160 --> 03:39:58.000]  wouldn't be happy until i am seized that my first apple on the tree
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:03.440]  v so i said about however necessary to take over the united states
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:06.720]  i'd subvert the churches first i'd begin with a campaign of whispers
[03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:10.080]  with the wisdom of a serpent i would whisper to you as i whispered to you
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:14.480]  there was a please to the young i would whisper that the bible to submit
[03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:18.000]  i would convince them that man created god instead of the other way around
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:22.320]  i would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:26.720]  and the old i would teach to pray after me i would bother
[03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:32.400]  richard in washington and now i get organized i'd educate authors and
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:35.520]  how to make a loaded literature exciting so that anything else would appear
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:39.760]  dull and uninteresting i'd threaten tv with dirtier movies and vice versa i
[03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:43.360]  peddle narcotics to whom i could i sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:46.640]  distinction i tranquilized the rest with pills
[03:40:46.640 --> 03:40:49.680]  if i were the devil i'd soon have families at war with themselves
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:53.440]  churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:59.040]  until each in its turn was consumed and with promises of higher ratings i'd
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:04.080]  have mesmerizing media chanting the flame if i were the devil i would
[03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:07.280]  encourage schools to recline young intellects but neglect to discipline
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:10.640]  emotions just let those run wild until before you knew it
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:14.080]  you'd have to have drugs nipping bombs and metal detectors at every school
[03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:19.200]  house door within a decade i'd have prisons overflowing
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:23.120]  i'd have judges promoting pornography soon i could have gotten from the
[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:27.120]  courthouse then from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of congress and in
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:30.880]  his own churches i would substitute psychology for religion and dfi
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:34.160]  science i would lure priests and pastors into misusing
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:38.160]  boys and girls and church money if i were the devil i'd make the symbol of
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:41.520]  Easter and egg and the symbol of Christmas a bottle
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:45.840]  if i were the devil i'd take from those who'd have and give to those who wanted
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:49.360]  until i had killed the incentive of the ambitious
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:52.880]  whether you bet i couldn't get whole states
[03:41:52.880 --> 03:41:57.760]  to promote gambling as the way to get rich
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:01.520]  i would crush it against extremes in hard work
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:06.480]  in patriotism in moral conduct i would convince the young that marriage is
[03:42:06.480 --> 03:42:10.080]  old-fashioned that swinging is more fun
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:13.840]  than what you see on tv is the way to be
[03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:17.200]  and thus i could undress you in public
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:23.840]  and i could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:28.320]  in other words i'm already got a lot of speedlight on doing what he's doing
[03:42:28.320 --> 03:42:36.080]  music
[03:42:36.080 --> 03:42:43.360]  speaking to the power
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:50.720]  living in the final hour
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:58.160]  so much time is wasted
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:06.000]  where's that place i hope you taste it
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:13.360]  wake up the whole world's coming down
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:23.520]  wake up all the kids don't want to want you gone
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:27.200]  that's pretty good music for a guy uh oh he's almost homeless
[03:43:27.200 --> 03:43:32.080]  that says the ones who want you gone it's only got 50 something views let's get
[03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:37.120]  it to 10 000 views you're the whole song on youtube
[03:43:37.120 --> 03:43:41.600]  so yeah we got over 600 entries and a lot of hundreds of them are like that
[03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:45.920]  a lot of effort uh paul harvey very powerful info
[03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:51.360]  mixed together and and that is a widow's mic but it's great
[03:43:51.360 --> 03:43:54.960]  it's a lot better than what i put out probably the first couple years so
[03:43:54.960 --> 03:43:58.400]  a lot better when i put out a lot of the time
[03:43:58.400 --> 03:44:01.920]  and i'll get Darth Vader imitations everywhere though folks bubba

[03:44:19.040 --> 03:44:23.440]  i take the train to work or i work up close to the district of criminals there
[03:44:23.440 --> 03:44:26.640]  oh you get to have tsa start you without warrants and stuff
[03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:29.600]  that's right they're they're they're probably every other week they come
[03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:32.080]  around uh sometimes they have their little
[03:44:32.080 --> 03:44:36.560]  dogs with them with the uh yeah they're looking for the uh
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:41.200]  the bombs that they put at the boston marathon
[03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:45.040]  and they come around they've they've never approached me but some people i
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:48.400]  know they've approached them and they and i said what happened they said
[03:44:48.400 --> 03:44:50.320]  oh they asked me if they could look in my bag i said
[03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:53.920]  and she says well i'm not i don't have anything to hide and i said no that's
[03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:57.680]  not the point yeah no there i mean they're setting the i mean
[03:44:57.680 --> 03:45:00.080]  now the state police in texas they don't even say
[03:45:00.080 --> 03:45:03.840]  mind if i stick my hand in your area they without a warrant they go get up
[03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:08.400]  against the car and we're such animals at an animal
[03:45:08.400 --> 03:45:11.600]  veterinary clinic they change gloves they don't change gloves because we're
[03:45:11.600 --> 03:45:14.560]  lower than animals
[03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:18.560]  yep so they're they're and guess what cops that act like that so are your kids
[03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:22.480]  you just committed your children to hell i'm sorry go ahead but it's a lot of the
[03:45:22.480 --> 03:45:25.600]  psyche that's going on it's the scythe that they're conducting too because they
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:28.560]  walk around through there just to get people used to them being there
[03:45:28.560 --> 03:45:31.280]  and it's not like like andy and barney walking around
[03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:34.960]  it's like the the gestapo the the night police come in you know they have their
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:38.800]  little fancy holsters on and the leg straps and they're it's all
[03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:41.600]  government parading around that we've been conquered
[03:45:41.600 --> 03:45:46.000]  planning the flag and that they even know it and then they give them fake
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:49.600]  threats to feel like they're real and now they did the boston bombing i mean
[03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:52.880]  of course it's an authoritarian mass murdering criminal government
[03:45:52.880 --> 03:45:55.760]  and it's all fake it's all in constitutional it's all criminal
[03:45:55.760 --> 03:45:58.560]  because they're not going to let us decriminalize drugs so they can't make
[03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:02.240]  their money they're not going to let us not you
[03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:06.240]  know let our kids take their deadly shots they want to run our lives
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:09.680]  and they're average idiots i shouldn't say that a lot of the people that work
[03:46:09.680 --> 03:46:12.240]  in the government are actually more awake than most people because they
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:16.080]  they know we're telling the truth but the types that they get to go to those
[03:46:16.080 --> 03:46:19.760]  stupid viper teams i've seen them on the streets of la not even at a bus
[03:46:19.760 --> 03:46:23.840]  terminal walk up and go where are you filming you can't film me
[03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:28.560]  we had a reporter up in chicago outside the train station at a restaurant they
[03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:30.560]  come over and say you're not allowed to film us
[03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:35.120]  you put us on the internet last week i'll arrest you if you film me again just
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:40.400]  totally criminal outside of law just flaming authoritarians
[03:46:40.400 --> 03:46:45.040]  bubba i mean i'd go over to them and say you're just here to acclimate people to

[03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:51.920]  i would still stick to my argument that uh gold is a real good long term
[03:47:51.920 --> 03:47:56.080]  identifier on the value of a of a currency in the value of our dollar
[03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:59.840]  i mean if you look at the hundred years it's very easy twenty dollars up to
[03:47:59.840 --> 03:48:03.040]  eighteen hundred dollars now still thirteen hundred dollars and we're
[03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:08.080]  printing money faster than ever and uh there's pretty good evidence right
[03:48:08.080 --> 03:48:11.600]  now there's a shortage of physical gold the physical gold market has always
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:14.240]  been strong and that's going to continue this is
[03:48:14.240 --> 03:48:18.480]  going to be sorted out and after these corrections sometimes you see an
[03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:22.880]  explosion even though i'm not into uh big
[03:48:22.880 --> 03:48:27.200]  as a technician on gold i i suspect that could happen but
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:31.280]  i think long term you can expect governments not to change
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:35.440]  we're going to see more detroit eventually the government of the united
[03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:39.280]  states will be somewhat similar to detroit because people will give up
[03:48:39.280 --> 03:48:43.120]  their confidence in us they're going to give up confidence in the dollar
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:46.400]  and eventually they'll give up confidence on our military and then you are
[03:48:46.400 --> 03:48:51.200]  going to see some real real changes uh in this system which has been
[03:48:51.200 --> 03:48:54.160]  built on a fiat dollar for the last 40 years
[03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:57.840]  dr paul you mentioned uh the detroit bankruptcy and you said that may not be
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:01.200]  the last one that we're going to see how do you think this story plays out not
[03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:06.080]  only in detroit but also nationally well you know i'll be surprised if the feds
[03:49:06.080 --> 03:49:09.920]  don't come in they probably won't say they are but they're already in i mean
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:12.880]  think of all the welfare programs every time somebody's unemployed they're
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:17.440]  going to get some benefits the food stamps won't start so the feds are very
[03:49:17.440 --> 03:49:20.960]  much involved uh but there's gonna be a lot more cities
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:24.720]  and uh and they'll there will be a limit it might
[03:49:24.720 --> 03:49:28.560]  push it over you know if ten cities declare tomorrow and the feds say well
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:32.000]  we can't let this happen we got them bailed my way we bailed out the banks
[03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:35.680]  you know five and again folks it's all just fiat
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:39.680]  money it none of it in the end will help anybody
[03:49:39.680 --> 03:49:43.120]  except the globalists that loan it to them they take our money
[03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:47.200]  from the treasury the treasury basically creates
[03:49:47.200 --> 03:49:52.720]  io use that we owes what happens and then the federal reserve puts it out
[03:49:52.720 --> 03:49:55.360]  and then gives the order to the treasury to put out the physical but then the
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:50:00.000]  federal reserve puts out 97 plus of the uh of the fiat
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:03.920]  and then we go into debt to them they get the whole world
[03:50:03.920 --> 03:50:07.280]  the deeper they get us in debt they get real assets
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:10.400]  when it all goes under and they get to use the money
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:14.000]  when it still has fiat value on the way up on the way down that's when they
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:17.840]  really consolidate everything and have guys in black uniforms walk around and
[03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:21.600]  shoot anybody that gets in the way of it until all of america is

[03:55:13.280 --> 03:55:16.720]  well they i mean they they've classified it from the military
[03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:19.600]  the highest level people in the pentagon can't look at it because it didn't
[03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:23.040]  happen but go ahead right what happened their chief foreign
[03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:26.640]  correspondent richard engel who's normally in the middle east
[03:55:26.640 --> 03:55:31.120]  well this time he was at Langley at cia headquarters and they were giving him a
[03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:35.040]  personal tour through the cia museum which is not open to the general
[03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:41.200]  oh yeah they showed a bin laden's ak-47 yeah which was not his because look at
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:46.160]  all of the file photos of ben laden he's carrying one of those shortened models
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:51.200]  it was an akf 74 u that has about a 12 inch barrel it's not
[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:54.480]  really in assault of course it's fake it might as well be ripleys believe it or
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:58.160]  not with some you know giants foot in a bottle of
[03:55:58.160 --> 03:56:01.760]  formaldehyde or one of those things where they put a carp onto a monkey skull
[03:56:01.760 --> 03:56:04.960]  and say it's a merman i mean it's you know they might as well like one of
[03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:07.920]  those snake snake pits they have on the side of the
[03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:11.680]  highway where you see some alligator sitting i mean yeah it's just total

[03:56:19.440 --> 03:56:24.320]  well but bin laden's gun was in pristine condition with a 12 inch barrel
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:29.360]  they showed an old ragged out ak-47 with a 16 inch barrel that was in
[03:56:29.360 --> 03:56:33.680]  trashy condition it was not the same gun look at the fall listen do you know
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:37.040]  what else they have at that museum they have the gun that that when they killed
[03:56:37.040 --> 03:56:40.640]  santa claus he had a few years ago they had a rate on the north pole and
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:45.360]  santa they even have santa claus taxidermied at the cia base

[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.360]  oh yeah of course they have an internal cia museum for all the nobody's more
[03:57:05.360 --> 03:57:07.840]  brainwashed and the people that work at those places
[03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:11.040]  there's a bunch of people put the sunlight i see cia people and stuff and
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:14.400]  they they can't help but like wear suits and put their glasses on and take

[03:57:32.880 --> 03:57:36.720]  what did he say we should have more cia snuff films
[03:57:36.720 --> 03:57:41.040]  yes elix yes or go ahead hey i wanted to ask why you didn't ask about the black
[03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:45.280]  block anarchist so i'm just i know you asked him about the delta force and he
[03:57:45.280 --> 03:57:48.640]  was told he wasn't lying he was told what to do i talked to him
[03:57:48.640 --> 03:57:51.520]  later off air he was told by secret service what to do
[03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:55.440]  he wasn't running anything that's why he apologizes says it was wrong
[03:57:55.440 --> 03:57:59.280]  but then he also takes the sword and says but i'm responsible
[03:57:59.280 --> 03:58:02.000]  well yeah he did say that and that's what i thought he goes well it's kind of a
[03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:04.880]  community thing and i'm thinking the way pal everybody said hey we're doing
[03:58:04.880 --> 03:58:07.520]  this you're standing over there because they held those guys and i seen it in
[03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:10.480]  your documentary and then they got him out of here before they got arrested
