[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:40.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.440 --> 00:50.080]  here we are ladies and gentlemen on Tuesday the 24th day of June 2014 I am
[00:50.080 --> 00:58.680]  your host Alex Jones and I am shell shocked yet again quite frankly sitting
[00:58.680 --> 01:05.700]  here going over all the news it is so over the top what's going on and to watch
[01:05.700 --> 01:16.920]  the prostitute dinosaur fake state-run media try to spin everything is truly
[01:16.920 --> 01:24.000]  over the top yesterday they had articles that were up on Drudge from the
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.160]  Chicago Tribune and others with the headline Chicago scoops up big data it
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.080]  should say Chicago puts hidden microphones and systems that steal all
[01:37.080 --> 01:43.160]  your internet data without warrants on streets Chicago rolls out NSA snooping
[01:43.160 --> 01:47.400]  hubs with microphones and steals all your data and tracks you in live time
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.760]  without warrants we broke this four months ago with Mikhail Phelan with a
[01:53.760 --> 01:59.560]  whistleblower inside the city of Seattle Washington that we could print me
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.800]  those articles guys from three or four months ago Mikhail Phelan and the city
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.960]  had to respond and admit it was illegal and said they were suspending the
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.080]  program these are open boxes that are cell towers that grab all your data
[02:15.080 --> 02:20.640]  illegally and track everything you're doing and have microphones now what
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.680]  does Chicago do because it's rolling out nationwide we tell you that in the
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.380]  article there's the headline Seattle police deactivate Wi-Fi spy grid after
[02:27.380 --> 02:33.040]  privacy I'll cry Chicago comes out and I just had it here just print it again
[02:33.040 --> 02:35.360]  for me I know you just gave it to me just printed again there's like 400
[02:35.360 --> 02:38.320]  articles in here I can't keep track of it people so we'll just go online and
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.400]  get it I can't have that many windows open it's just insane news centers will
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.600]  scoop up big data on Chicago Chicago Tribune there it is on screen and they
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.360]  just go oh yeah beautiful sculptures the art department and they're so
[02:55.360 --> 03:02.080]  beautiful I mean imagine that's beyond 1984 in 1984 they hid the microphones
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.280]  because that was a police state and didn't want the public to know here they
[03:06.280 --> 03:10.680]  go oh it's a beautiful sculpture it's trendy and it's got hidden cell towers
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.640]  in it and microphones hacking into your phone live time tracking everything
[03:15.640 --> 03:18.160]  because they don't even want to pay the telecoms like they've been doing since
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.840]  1996 to have huge floors in every building of their facilities everything
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.360]  going through it they don't want the telecoms having that now government is
[03:29.360 --> 03:37.320]  going to the next level in a race a surveillance big brother 1984 race it's
[03:37.320 --> 03:42.240]  1984 squared this is already beyond 1984 level surveillance where the the
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.400]  companies are all racing to build the control grid but then government's
[03:45.400 --> 03:48.920]  discovered in Europe in the US and other places oh wait they're more powerful
[03:48.920 --> 03:52.960]  than us now they can predict the future at Google even though they were founded
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.320]  by the CIA we don't want that so there's all these companies and governments
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.520]  racing to outdo each other with the grids to where we're just everywhere I
[04:02.520 --> 04:08.120]  mean Austin in 1998 had over a thousand hidden microphones on it hooked into
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.160]  Tom Warner cable I don't mean the ones inside your house in your cable box I
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.600]  guess that was hundreds of thousands I'm talking about they use the cable lines
[04:16.600 --> 04:23.440]  to just put peep cameras tiny little cameras and microphones everywhere and
[04:23.440 --> 04:29.240]  I even had the federal for grants and I'd go up and talk to senior police they'd
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.440]  smile and say I'm gonna talk to you Alex that's in the news last week Obama has
[04:32.440 --> 04:36.680]  meetings with them saying don't tell the public this is a giant criminal

[08:17.680 --> 08:27.500]  it is a really strange feeling when you are able to put out a report and it
[08:27.500 --> 08:33.820]  becomes a national news story it's even more wild when you put out a report and
[08:33.820 --> 08:39.300]  it becomes the number one story in the country but sometimes this happened to
[08:39.300 --> 08:42.340]  us five or six times I was thinking about it this morning you put out a
[08:42.340 --> 08:50.820]  report that becomes the number one story in the world and that is what infowars.com
[08:50.820 --> 08:56.220]  presentplanet.com this radio show slash TV show the whole news operation is now
[08:56.220 --> 09:04.700]  able to do every month a global dominant story every week a national
[09:04.700 --> 09:12.060]  dominant story every day a story of serious import that has a major effect
[09:12.060 --> 09:16.380]  and that's the real value that's what I'm proud of that's what I am extremely
[09:16.380 --> 09:28.220]  humbled by that's why we're here that's the reason we do what we do is to try
[09:28.220 --> 09:32.420]  to have a better world one based on free market and on justice and on real
[09:32.420 --> 09:39.300]  equality and on free association and being able to make as many of your own
[09:39.300 --> 09:47.100]  personal choices as you can there is a global meltdown by design being
[09:47.100 --> 09:53.300]  programmed we're going to be breaking that down in the second hour and taking
[09:53.300 --> 10:04.420]  your phone calls but I first just want to read to you this stack of headlines
[10:04.420 --> 10:13.540]  only part of the news today on the end of our borders the total collapse it was
[10:13.540 --> 10:18.580]  back earlier this year that the head of the border patrol union speaking to
[10:18.580 --> 10:24.860]  Breitbart we're going to get them on said we're being ordered to stand down from
[10:24.860 --> 10:30.060]  San Diego California to Brownsville Texas that's the quote and when they tell
[10:30.060 --> 10:35.700]  us to stand down they say replacements are coming but they never come because
[10:35.700 --> 10:40.660]  it's illegal to have the president or anybody else order them to stand down
[10:40.660 --> 10:45.020]  and when you go to the border now ladies and gentlemen the border patrol is
[10:45.020 --> 10:49.500]  not there you probably see one truck where you would have seen a hundred
[10:49.500 --> 10:53.260]  anywhere you go on the Texas border to a major city around the middle of
[10:53.260 --> 10:58.540]  nowhere there is no border patrol they are at facilities changing diapers and
[10:58.540 --> 11:06.220]  heating up the formula and drudge report calm has a headline out of CBS local
[11:06.220 --> 11:14.260]  where Homeland Security is seeking jumbo above 5x underwear because a new
[11:14.260 --> 11:19.980]  type of immigrant is hit the giant South American and Central American 400 500
[11:19.980 --> 11:26.100]  600 pound super jumbo couch potato because usually it was pretty tough
[11:26.100 --> 11:37.460]  immigrants that were able to make their way up to the border but now it is the
[11:37.460 --> 11:43.580]  supreme jumbo's that are getting up here who will go directly on the welfare
[11:43.580 --> 11:47.820]  instantly now let me get to our top story in this stack and then go to the
[11:47.820 --> 11:57.180]  stack headline from the Associated Press 15 hours ago 15 hours ago so this
[11:57.180 --> 12:03.060]  broke late last night a full week and a half after we first broke it a week
[12:03.060 --> 12:06.980]  after we double confirmed it with emergency manager head of mcowland
[12:06.980 --> 12:12.220]  texas with the video of it happening and with our ice whistleblower on the
[12:12.220 --> 12:23.740]  border off-duty meeting with us about the stand down here is the headline US
[12:23.740 --> 12:30.060]  releases immigrant families won't say how many AP it goes on to say they are
[12:30.060 --> 12:35.980]  released and allowed to go wherever they want they're being totally released
[12:35.980 --> 12:41.260]  there is no internal border patrol roundups haven't been in six years except
[12:41.260 --> 12:45.060]  for two or three staged events at meat packing plants and homeland security
[12:45.060 --> 12:50.580]  four years ago it came out in the AP takes them to the ice facility and gives
[12:50.580 --> 12:54.340]  them green cards on the spot so they do stage raids and a day later they're back
[12:54.340 --> 12:58.940]  at the meat packing plant Obama's not even doing that now so if you can make
[12:58.940 --> 13:02.500]  it in you're legal and you get free welfare you're not gonna have to work
[13:02.500 --> 13:06.900]  you weigh 500 pounds we got some section 8 housing for you let's read the
[13:06.900 --> 13:10.140]  article now remember people couldn't believe this a week and a half ago we
[13:10.140 --> 13:13.900]  first broke it a week ago when drugs picked up our second article we got the
[13:13.900 --> 13:20.460]  federal document at the Fed biz ops site sent to us by border patrol we said
[13:20.460 --> 13:24.020]  if you notice this that's how we're always breaking all the stories is we
[13:24.020 --> 13:27.020]  get it all in the Intel and the emails and phone calls and we're at the border
[13:27.020 --> 13:36.020]  every week now 200 something miles away from Austin meeting with the actual
[13:36.020 --> 13:42.540]  border patrol people and they said look we're ordered to load them on buses when
[13:42.540 --> 13:46.620]  they get to the border we bring them into the churches that stage there we
[13:46.620 --> 13:50.540]  give them vouchers to get on the buses and they travel deeper into town go to
[13:50.540 --> 13:55.860]  this tent city at the Sacred Heart Church and you can talk to the emergency
[13:55.860 --> 13:59.340]  manager he's allowed to talk to you we go there the emergency manager admits it
[13:59.340 --> 14:05.020]  all the border patrol would instantly be fired prosecuted persecuted you name it
[14:05.020 --> 14:09.580]  they told you this is a massive federal and state crime being committed every
[14:09.580 --> 14:18.740]  single day and the AP is now admitting it AP reporting from Washington the
[14:18.740 --> 14:22.620]  Obama administration has released into the US an untold number of immigrant
[14:22.620 --> 14:26.300]  families caught traveling illegally from Central America that's the trains that
[14:26.300 --> 14:30.100]  arrive daily in recent months and although the government knows how many
[14:30.100 --> 14:33.820]  it's released it won't say publicly so they're aiding them they're saying they'll
[14:33.820 --> 14:39.580]  make them legal they're releasing them and no one's getting in trouble but if
[14:39.580 --> 14:42.580]  you fly to Mara they're gonna want to put you in a naked body scanner and grab
[14:42.580 --> 14:49.340]  your testicles or take your wife's brazier off okay understand although the
[14:49.340 --> 14:56.020]  government knows how many it's released it won't say do you understand the
[14:56.020 --> 15:00.540]  Republican leadership acts like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz that are criticizing
[15:00.540 --> 15:04.500]  us I mean Ted Cruz just says we ought to follow the law the media is like how
[15:04.500 --> 15:08.420]  radical how racist there's a judge ruling that a border fence is racist
[15:08.420 --> 15:12.100]  really can I go to Mexico get everything paid for or it's racist they
[15:12.100 --> 15:18.900]  would laugh at me this is the total suicidal suicide packed religion a
[15:18.900 --> 15:23.900]  political correctness and here's the deal the general public still has no
[15:23.900 --> 15:27.500]  idea what this means this is the North American Union this is the crisis you
[15:27.500 --> 15:30.460]  think it's bad to have hundreds of thousands of illegals showing up every
[15:30.460 --> 15:36.060]  few months directly going on welfare 14 year old kids 2 year old babies 500
[15:36.060 --> 15:40.100]  pound fat people do you have any idea what's gonna happen in the next wave I
[15:40.100 --> 15:45.100]  predict up to 1 million a month I'm on record if this isn't stopped and the
[15:45.100 --> 15:49.580]  crime rate I have mainstream news all over Texas is the main target zone is
[15:49.580 --> 15:54.540]  just exploding the home break-ins the carjackings the crime of the completely
[15:54.540 --> 16:00.220]  collapsed Mexico highest crime rate in the world 130,000 dead I keep quoting
[16:00.220 --> 16:04.100]  old numbers from four years ago because I just got that number in my head and say
[16:04.100 --> 16:10.180]  over 70,000 it's now over 130,000 it was only a hundred thousand I looked at the
[16:10.180 --> 16:13.020]  numbers you can pull them up type in number of dead in Mexico in the last
[16:13.020 --> 16:17.700]  decade and it was a hundred thousand a year ago now it's 130 something that's
[16:17.700 --> 16:22.060]  what we know of they're finding mass graves everywhere and it's a Mexicans
[16:22.060 --> 16:30.900]  killing Mexicans but oh the la raza race god hardcore you know into racism
[16:30.900 --> 16:34.660]  of people that know him well totally gone off the deep end people I know that
[16:34.660 --> 16:39.140]  know him say he's crazy now he used to be like this Robert Rodriguez has it in
[16:39.140 --> 16:42.740]  movies where it shows Don Johnson shooting pregnant Mexicans in the
[16:42.740 --> 16:46.820]  stomach that ain't going on there's not people cowboy had white guys shooting
[16:46.820 --> 16:51.340]  Mexicans Mexico is where it's happening but there's no discussion of that
[16:51.340 --> 16:58.980]  130 plus thousand dead look at that headline la raza demands amnesty from
[16:58.980 --> 17:07.300]  new major leader Kevin McCarthy new Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
[17:08.260 --> 17:13.700]  and that ought to say the race demands amnesty that's what it means it's
[17:13.700 --> 17:18.300]  literally the Klan but it's so socially acceptable that that Hispanics will go
[17:18.300 --> 17:22.340]  to other Hispanics and say you better join the raza or you're a sellout
[17:22.340 --> 17:26.140]  because you want guns you want private property you're against abortion well

[17:31.660 --> 17:36.380]  the country this is the murdering of the nation right now and the rule of law
[17:36.380 --> 17:41.100]  let's go over the headlines so again we told you with the emergency manager and
[17:41.100 --> 17:45.180]  and the video that the government is shipping them in and shipping them
[17:45.180 --> 17:48.660]  wherever they want and paying for it and bringing them to welfare offices in
[17:48.660 --> 17:54.260]  cities from New York to Austin Texas from Seattle Washington to Minneapolis
[17:54.260 --> 18:00.900]  St. Paul Chicago Kansas City Virginia all every state in the union thousands a
[18:00.900 --> 18:04.820]  day are arriving in these states and they are giving full carte blanche while

[28:33.100 --> 28:36.740]  that they bought that I was saying would be used against you on the lakes and
[28:36.740 --> 28:39.660]  things and then I talked to a state senator who was on a few years ago and
[28:39.660 --> 28:43.300]  he said there's a plan for the state to have martial law on the border if
[28:43.300 --> 28:47.300]  Mexico fully collapses because the feds we've been told won't do it he said that
[28:47.300 --> 28:50.540]  on air then I was told off record by some state senators I'll leave it that
[28:50.540 --> 28:53.900]  that they were getting ready to maybe implement this but you know I'll believe
[28:53.900 --> 28:57.940]  it when I see it well we're actually seeing it and why is the state doing it
[28:57.940 --> 29:02.140]  because the state isn't perfect by all means but realizes it's more like old
[29:02.140 --> 29:07.100]  fashion government that if the whole country collapses their pension funds
[29:07.100 --> 29:11.340]  are gone their grandkids have no future I mean the folks Texas will collapse

[33:54.580 --> 34:01.140]  down on the entire southern border from San Diego to Brownsville I'm gonna read
[34:01.140 --> 34:07.740]  the quote coming up in a few minutes we go down and get video of it and even
[34:07.740 --> 34:12.660]  libertarian and conservative grips for a full week questioned our article that
[34:12.660 --> 34:17.820]  had quotes video and an ice whistleblower on top of the head of emergency
[34:17.820 --> 34:24.380]  management of mccallan Texas that's a big town that's a city on video saying it

[34:29.060 --> 34:32.820]  report calm because drudge can watch a video and read quotes and those were
[34:32.820 --> 34:35.180]  credible
[34:35.540 --> 34:39.820]  I tell you what's credible is getting upset and getting angry about this and
[34:39.820 --> 34:45.220]  getting out of our coma because if we don't get out of our coma when all of
[34:45.220 --> 34:49.060]  this is going on we'll never get out of our coma and it's going to get ten times
[34:49.060 --> 34:51.300]  worse

[34:59.140 --> 35:02.140]  you're flying out of this country you should talk to the TSA police you name
[35:02.140 --> 35:05.500]  it so this is a joke that you want to grab my testicles or put me in a naked
[35:05.500 --> 35:10.180]  body scanner but the borders wide open it's all a hoax and that's the angle to
[35:10.180 --> 35:16.300]  hammer we wear our bias on our sleeve we tell the truth common sense and we put
[35:16.300 --> 35:19.420]  it out strong
[35:19.740 --> 35:27.580]  this country is being butchered and AP now admits months after the border
[35:27.580 --> 35:35.260]  patrol president and deputy president went public it doesn't matter whether
[35:35.260 --> 35:39.420]  it's drugs bodies or how large the group is our agents are being ordered to stand
[35:39.420 --> 35:43.740]  down by the board patrol management close quote said Sean Moran vice president
[35:43.740 --> 35:49.140]  national board patrol council told Breitbart news back in October this is
[35:49.140 --> 35:54.860]  last year excuse me so we're talking October November December oh my gosh
[35:54.860 --> 36:00.140]  nine months ago excuse me I said a couple months ago people accuse me of
[36:00.140 --> 36:05.340]  exaggerating the only reason that there's a way I lie and I've said this
[36:05.340 --> 36:08.300]  many times I'm gonna be honest with you the only reason I say things that are
[36:08.300 --> 36:13.060]  wrong a lot is is a psychological phenomenon that British intelligence
[36:13.060 --> 36:16.580]  wrote about in some of their side warfare documents that were declassified a
[36:16.580 --> 36:20.620]  decade or so ago that I read in the psychology publication that I already
[36:20.620 --> 36:25.340]  knew prima facie it was just common sense that the human mind likes to dial
[36:25.340 --> 36:31.260]  down tragedy in its mind's eye so they said if our special forces kill 40
[36:31.260 --> 36:35.500]  something thousand people in African nation we want to report first that four
[36:35.500 --> 36:39.820]  were killed I'm paraphrasing the article from years ago I talked about a lot
[36:39.820 --> 36:44.380]  about it we're gonna say that four died instead of 40 something thousand and
[36:44.380 --> 36:48.580]  then when the real numbers come out later it'll make people doubt it well I
[36:48.580 --> 36:53.780]  don't do this on purpose you know it's a hundred plus thousand have been killed
[36:53.780 --> 36:57.420]  in Mexico and I keep saying seventy thousand because it's an old number and
[36:57.420 --> 37:03.300]  I don't want to exaggerate or I say a couple months ago he warned people and
[37:03.300 --> 37:07.220]  no one listened it's actually nine months ago and when I listen to my
[37:07.220 --> 37:10.820]  rebroadcast sometimes I'll sit there and check stuff I'm saying and if it's a
[37:10.820 --> 37:14.020]  headline I get it right almost 100% of the time because I have a near
[37:14.020 --> 37:21.940]  photographic memory when I'm switched on studying news but when it's when it's
[37:21.940 --> 37:31.900]  me giving a number or something I tend to dial it back so for anybody that
[37:31.900 --> 37:38.820]  accuses me of exaggerating here I've said repeatedly that a hundred plus
[37:38.820 --> 37:44.900]  million people ended up getting cancer from the polio vaccine and when I went
[37:44.900 --> 37:48.540]  and looked up the Centers for Disease Control documents again yesterday it was
[37:48.540 --> 37:52.740]  close to 180 million people that were vaccinated and they believe most of them
[37:52.740 --> 37:56.900]  ended up if they lived long enough contracting a type of cancer from the
[37:56.900 --> 38:04.220]  dozens of lethal highly active aggressive biological warfare they claim
[38:04.220 --> 38:08.660]  for monkeys but it was beyond that weaponized cancer that was put in the
[38:08.660 --> 38:13.980]  shots most most cancers viral folks the system knows that so they give you the
[38:13.980 --> 38:18.820]  cancer and they go oh it's genetics that's why everybody's getting cancer
[38:18.820 --> 38:25.140]  now we got the same genetics we had 50 years ago 100 years ago so again I'm
[38:25.140 --> 38:29.100]  already digressing it just makes my head totally and completely spent I've got
[38:29.100 --> 38:36.820]  so much other news to get to it's just that every week I see articles in the
[38:36.820 --> 38:41.180]  Western world where little children were taken by the hundreds or the thousands
[38:41.180 --> 38:46.020]  and tortured to death killed given pesticides given vaccines and test
[38:46.020 --> 38:51.260]  till they died and then put in mass graves chess pits I remember when it
[38:51.260 --> 38:55.100]  first broke seven eight years ago about them digging up small mass graves at
[38:55.100 --> 38:59.620]  Indian Reservation Christian orphanages in Canada and now it turns out it's
[38:59.620 --> 39:03.340]  tens of thousands of dead kids with their heads clubbed in their brains
[39:03.340 --> 39:09.900]  blown out of course they got raped first but because we're all so naive I mean
[39:09.900 --> 39:14.900]  it's literally every week they find a new death dungeon a new a new giant
[39:14.900 --> 39:19.260]  septic tank in Ireland for a little dead Irish kids or a or a new one in
[39:19.260 --> 39:24.780]  California or a new one in Israel I mean it's just totally unbelievable and now
[39:24.780 --> 39:29.980]  all over South Texas they're finding mass graves of Mexicans and others that
[39:29.980 --> 39:37.620]  paid to get up to the border and then we're held captive by the coyotes who
[39:37.620 --> 39:41.940]  are incredibly wealthy and taking over politics and worshiped by directors and
[39:41.940 --> 39:47.060]  movie stars because the whole raza movement is just gangster Satan worship
[39:47.060 --> 39:51.500]  hardcore feed on Hispanics as much as you can hate white people as much as you
[39:51.500 --> 39:55.820]  can hate blacks it's the most evil culture you can imagine super imposed to
[39:55.820 --> 39:59.180]  try to dominate and control his Spanish like they sell evil in the black
[39:59.180 --> 40:02.900]  community with a gangster rap or they sell evil in the white community it's
[40:02.900 --> 40:09.500]  just total pure wickedness societal death ladies and gentlemen just dead
[40:09.500 --> 40:15.060]  bodies all over the place this is what's coming to America CBS News immigrant
[40:15.060 --> 40:18.180]  children were ordered by human traffickers that cut off fingers ears of
[40:18.180 --> 40:21.700]  other kids every time he talks about that they have a southern poverty law
[40:21.700 --> 40:25.860]  center come out and say it's not true a few years ago I talked about dozens of
[40:25.860 --> 40:30.260]  heads being chopped off in Arizona in one week and delivered you know to the
[40:30.260 --> 40:33.940]  front of government buildings and they actually had quote liberal media
[40:33.940 --> 40:39.900]  fascist hardcore psych warfare vicious media posing as liberals you know
[40:39.900 --> 40:44.140]  dressing trendy and going look I'm wearing a multicolored shirt and I have
[40:44.140 --> 40:49.820]  a beard and I and I act wimpy that is a sigh warfare cover of vicious
[40:49.820 --> 40:58.500]  commandos in a black-op takedown I'm not joking they're black-op commanders these
[40:58.500 --> 41:02.660]  people are going to take over and put us in FEMA camps but they learned to not
[41:02.660 --> 41:07.340]  wear uniforms because you see that as a threat they've already taken over they
[41:07.340 --> 41:13.260]  start shutting everything down they know what they're doing they're into mind
[41:13.260 --> 41:22.820]  control ladies and gentlemen they're running it on you and he goes on to say
[41:22.820 --> 41:26.260]  that there's a stand-down and now you go down there and the state police are
[41:26.260 --> 41:30.940]  down there and the local police are down there and the Mexicans won't take
[41:30.940 --> 41:35.300]  any of the Latin Americans back and they won't take any of the Mexicans back
[41:35.300 --> 41:38.820]  and and the jails are just filling up and the feds are getting them and
[41:38.820 --> 41:44.780]  busting them deeper into the US this is total and complete high treason and the
[41:44.780 --> 41:48.420]  state police are down there catching aggravated felons and making the
[41:48.420 --> 41:52.100]  border patrols at least to port those because Obama got caught releasing 36
[41:52.100 --> 41:58.580]  thousand in one month last month you understand the total mega magnitude no
[41:58.580 --> 42:05.220]  one can describe what's going on this is criminals refugees welfare queens of
[42:05.220 --> 42:10.820]  collapsed communist regimes south of Mexico that Mexico would never let in
[42:10.820 --> 42:14.700]  one of the most controlled borders in the world look it up now they say you
[42:14.700 --> 42:18.700]  load on the trains you don't get off the trains they got Mexican troops lining
[42:18.700 --> 42:23.020]  it and they come right in by the thousands every train delivery dump off
[42:23.020 --> 42:27.140]  and border patrol buses are waiting with food and water and they say come on in
[42:27.140 --> 42:33.580]  and their bus directly into the heart of the country and again I have nothing
[42:33.580 --> 42:38.300]  against these poor desperate people but but some of them that I do a problem
[42:38.300 --> 42:43.020]  with our radical terrorist groups radical Islamist ISIS connected groups
[42:43.020 --> 42:47.020]  that's in the news they have diseases they have no future and they're going to
[42:47.020 --> 42:53.500]  be used by the globalist as the giant ticking time bomb mass to riot and burn
[42:53.500 --> 42:59.500]  cities whenever the globalists want them to that's what goes on in Latin America
[42:59.500 --> 43:03.980]  folks I challenge anyone out there that's a bleeding heart liberal and who's
[43:03.980 --> 43:07.020]  under this mind control believing it's racist if we don't open our borders
[43:07.020 --> 43:12.060]  give everybody free welfare I challenge you to go to Paraguay or Ecuador or
[43:12.060 --> 43:21.940]  El Salvador or Brazil or Chile or Argentina Argentina just 50 years ago
[43:21.940 --> 43:26.580]  was more wealthy than the US a hundred years ago was the richest country per
[43:26.580 --> 43:31.860]  capita in the world as rich as an Argentine was the saying look it up
[43:31.860 --> 43:37.740]  incredible resources they had corrupt kleptocratic governments come in left
[43:37.740 --> 43:42.660]  wing right wing Pinochet you name it and it and Ted Anderson was down there a
[43:42.660 --> 43:47.060]  few years ago and he said Alex it's worse than you even said he said you see
[43:47.060 --> 43:54.700]  good-looking families like doctors in suits patched living in doorways on the
[43:54.700 --> 44:07.020]  streets with their children it's scary and it's all coming here any of you been
[44:07.020 --> 44:15.860]  to Nigeria any of you been to Calcutta I mean it'd be one thing if we had 50
[44:15.860 --> 44:19.940]  million illegals here that would least we're able body most these people are
[44:19.940 --> 44:26.620]  not able body they are the dregs the dregs the dregs of Latin America and
[44:26.620 --> 44:29.060]  it's not going to be the tens of thousands like the Cuban crime wave of
[44:29.060 --> 44:35.340]  the 80s and Castro sending his jails here it is going to be tens upon tens of
[44:35.340 --> 44:39.260]  millions and this is the false flag I now realize it and we've talked a lot we
[44:39.260 --> 44:44.820]  were the first to say it's in operation cable splicer garden plot and Rex 84 to
[44:44.820 --> 44:49.460]  use a massive immigrant collapse in Latin America to bring in a crisis that
[44:49.460 --> 44:53.980]  brings in martial law that's congressional hearings Miami Herald we need
[44:53.980 --> 44:58.860]  to dig up that stuff again and do a report on it to show folks that they're
[44:58.860 --> 45:02.420]  going to flood the country just like Obamacare is meant to blow the economy
[45:02.420 --> 45:05.860]  shutting off the power plants meant to blow the economy all the new
[45:05.860 --> 45:10.700]  regulations meant to blow the economy and now they're gonna ship in millions of
[45:10.700 --> 45:14.700]  destitute I mean already the soup kitchens the churches the welfare
[45:14.700 --> 45:20.340]  lines from New York to Virginia it's Kentucky they are in panic mode just
[45:20.340 --> 45:25.660]  overrun ladies and gentlemen there's the economist a decline without parallel
[45:25.660 --> 45:34.140]  Argentina was Latin America's star how it became a basket case 2002 and again
[45:34.140 --> 45:37.940]  that was multiple declines from the richest country in the world per capita
[45:37.940 --> 45:41.820]  Switzerland had more rich people or Germany did England you know they were
[45:41.820 --> 45:48.260]  in the top but but per capita I mean it was high cotton for everybody no more
[45:48.260 --> 45:53.060]  because they got the kleptocratic banking systems in yeah if you read the
[45:53.060 --> 45:57.380]  Washington Post about what happened in 2001 there it described a cattle trailer
[45:57.380 --> 46:03.300]  tumping over on a highway and families running up and biting chunks out of the
[46:03.300 --> 46:07.620]  cows eating them like wolves with globulets of flesh on them with blood
[46:07.620 --> 46:15.340]  spraying out of the cows as humans like vampires were just gobbling the beef I'll
[46:15.340 --> 46:21.500]  never forget read an article like ten times on air just raw globulets of
[46:21.500 --> 46:27.260]  beef and and and the article described it formerly middle-class people like
[46:27.260 --> 46:34.380]  hordes of demons within eight days of not having food over 90% of people become
[46:34.380 --> 46:39.900]  hardcore criminals start murdering within 15 days almost a hundred percent
[46:39.900 --> 46:47.620]  become cannibals the globalists say the world is unsustainable our carrying
[46:47.620 --> 46:51.380]  weight is unsustainable whether that's true or not they've decided under a
[46:51.380 --> 46:56.740]  jenna 21 cloud heavens a small piece of that to implode the west and implode the
[46:56.740 --> 47:01.420]  third world and let a hellstorm come out that the military the police and the
[47:01.420 --> 47:06.100]  control grid the drones and the robots will mop up having what's left of the
[47:06.100 --> 47:11.500]  middle-class serve the elite and the police state to survive and authorize
[47:11.500 --> 47:18.300]  tacitly the extermination of 90 plus percent of the world with a bio weapon
[47:18.300 --> 47:26.060]  they may get it so bad that the public welcomes it and it's a public sterilization
[47:26.060 --> 47:32.740]  or cauterization they are they have shut off the economic systems my god I can
[47:32.740 --> 47:38.540]  see the whole plan oh my god and I don't want to kill all these people down
[47:38.540 --> 47:42.300]  there I want them to have jobs in the future I know the globalist did deals
[47:42.300 --> 47:46.460]  to shut off their industry paid off all their leaders billions of peace in some
[47:46.460 --> 47:50.500]  cases in almost every case to shut off all industry and jobs to kick all the
[47:50.500 --> 47:56.500]  farmers off their land they did this they did this to Latin America they did
[47:56.500 --> 48:00.940]  this to Africa they did this to areas of Asia in the Middle East just like you
[48:00.940 --> 48:05.700]  see them be stabilizing Iraq year after year with new stage events they don't
[48:05.700 --> 48:08.420]  want any other sovereign nations or anybody and they're going to take us
[48:08.420 --> 48:12.420]  down as well if they don't want the Iraqis having their daughters go to
[48:12.420 --> 48:16.580]  college do you think that the globalist want you to go to college or you to have
[48:16.580 --> 48:22.780]  a future they're going to end it all in a planned dark age and you're now seeing
[48:22.780 --> 48:26.300]  the beginning of the control collapse and we predicted they do it through
[48:26.300 --> 48:29.740]  border implosion we didn't predict it's in the BAMP Canada secret meetings

[54:03.980 --> 54:06.980]  Yeah, we ought to play some of this song. It's fitting.
[54:07.980 --> 54:09.980]  I was sitting in traffic,
[54:09.980 --> 54:12.980]  Listen to the radio
[54:12.980 --> 54:14.980]  George Strait
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.980]  George Strait was singing
[54:16.980 --> 54:20.980]  Seashores of old Mexico
[54:20.980 --> 54:23.980]  It sounded so good
[54:23.980 --> 54:25.980]  I got an idea
[54:25.980 --> 54:29.980]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here
[54:29.980 --> 54:32.980]  Along the star state should be renamed
[54:32.980 --> 54:34.980]  Texaco
[54:34.980 --> 54:36.980]  He's a good name, actually
[54:36.980 --> 54:38.980]  Along Texas,
[54:38.980 --> 54:41.980]  Hail of Mexico
[54:43.980 --> 54:46.980]  I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande
[54:46.980 --> 54:48.980]  At El Paso
[54:48.980 --> 54:51.980]  No, no, no. You go down there
[54:51.980 --> 54:53.980]  You wear a 6x underwear
[54:53.980 --> 54:55.980]  You demand those
[54:55.980 --> 54:56.980]  You give them a baby
[54:56.980 --> 54:58.980]  Don't change his diaper
[54:58.980 --> 55:01.980]  And you just ride, ride it on a train
[55:01.980 --> 55:02.980]  And then there's a greyhound bus
[55:02.980 --> 55:03.980]  Picks you up and says,
[55:03.980 --> 55:05.980]  Where would you like to go in Mexico, Senor?
[55:05.980 --> 55:07.980]  Well, I think I want to go to Chiapas
[55:07.980 --> 55:09.980]  I think I'm gonna move into a Chiapas village
[55:09.980 --> 55:11.980]  And I'm gonna make them pay for everything for me
[55:11.980 --> 55:13.980]  Thank you, Senor
[55:13.980 --> 55:15.980]  And you get on the bus
[55:15.980 --> 55:17.980]  And you drive down, you know, almost a thousand miles
[55:17.980 --> 55:18.980]  To southern Mexico
[55:18.980 --> 55:20.980]  And you pull up in Chiapas
[55:20.980 --> 55:21.980]  And you get off
[55:21.980 --> 55:22.980]  And you just walk over
[55:22.980 --> 55:23.980]  And you say, I'm here
[55:23.980 --> 55:25.980]  Pay for everything
[55:25.980 --> 55:28.980]  And, uh...
[55:28.980 --> 55:30.980]  Well, somebody walks over
[55:30.980 --> 55:31.980]  And punches you right in the nose
[55:31.980 --> 55:33.980]  And, uh...
[55:33.980 --> 55:36.980]  That's what would happen
[55:36.980 --> 55:37.980]  First people would laugh at you
[55:37.980 --> 55:39.980]  It'd be real funny
[55:39.980 --> 55:41.980]  But see, we are the schmuck
[55:41.980 --> 55:42.980]  We are the sucker
[55:42.980 --> 55:43.980]  We are the joke
[55:43.980 --> 55:45.980]  America is
[55:45.980 --> 55:48.980]  A giant toilet
[55:48.980 --> 55:50.980]  Where the politicians, the bankers
[55:50.980 --> 55:51.980]  I mean, we let the bankers
[55:51.980 --> 55:52.980]  Still tens of trillions of dollars
[55:52.980 --> 55:53.980]  In the banker bailout
[55:53.980 --> 55:55.980]  We let them let our troops use DU
[55:55.980 --> 55:57.980]  That's a death sentence
[55:57.980 --> 55:58.980]  They had DU in the 40s
[55:58.980 --> 56:00.980]  Folks, they wouldn't let our troops use it
[56:00.980 --> 56:01.980]  In 46
[56:01.980 --> 56:03.980]  Because it was so deadly
[56:03.980 --> 56:05.980]  Used to the reactors that they were leaking
[56:05.980 --> 56:06.980]  It was a big deal now
[56:06.980 --> 56:08.980]  Most of them leak, 90 plus percent
[56:08.980 --> 56:09.980]  So what?
[56:09.980 --> 56:13.980]  There's an attitude of just not caring
[56:13.980 --> 56:14.980]  By the general public
[56:14.980 --> 56:15.980]  But the elite is beyond that
[56:15.980 --> 56:17.980]  I mean, it's like they're space aliens
[56:17.980 --> 56:22.980]  That want to destroy the country and the world
[56:22.980 --> 56:24.980]  I'll never forget watching that
[56:24.980 --> 56:25.980]  Trinity and beyond
[56:25.980 --> 56:27.980]  Narrated by William Shatner
[56:27.980 --> 56:29.980]  Where they detonated hundreds of
[56:29.980 --> 56:31.980]  Hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere
[56:31.980 --> 56:34.980]  Trying to blow holes in the atmosphere
[56:34.980 --> 56:37.980]  To see if they could blow up
[56:37.980 --> 56:38.980]  The Van Allen radiation belt
[56:38.980 --> 56:40.980]  Or destroy the atmosphere
[56:40.980 --> 56:41.980]  And, of course, if they...
[56:41.980 --> 56:43.980]  Look, we can destroy the atmosphere
[56:43.980 --> 56:44.980]  Does anybody see a problem
[56:44.980 --> 56:46.980]  With the blowing holes in the ozone layer?
[56:46.980 --> 56:48.980]  Of course, they didn't blame on the general public
[56:48.980 --> 56:49.980]  And tax you over
[56:49.980 --> 56:51.980]  I just can't handle it anymore
[56:51.980 --> 56:53.980]  And no one even made an issue out of that show
[56:53.980 --> 56:54.980]  When it came on
[56:54.980 --> 56:56.980]  I mean, I've read declassified documents about that
[56:56.980 --> 56:57.980]  Before that aired in the 90s
[56:57.980 --> 56:58.980]  But I always obsess over that
[56:58.980 --> 57:00.980]  Because it's like
[57:00.980 --> 57:03.980]  Let's see if we can blow up the atmosphere
[57:03.980 --> 57:06.980]  They would fire missiles up into the edge of space
[57:06.980 --> 57:07.980]  And detonate them
[57:07.980 --> 57:09.980]  Just to see what happened
[57:09.980 --> 57:12.980]  And to see what the energy pulse would do
[57:12.980 --> 57:15.980]  The electromagnetic pulse, as well, was three tests
[57:15.980 --> 57:17.980]  And then the radiation level went up
[57:17.980 --> 57:19.980]  And, again, I'm not being gloom and doom
[57:19.980 --> 57:23.980]  These crazy people are out of control
[57:23.980 --> 57:28.980]  Why do you think the U.S. took 36,000 top Nazis
[57:28.980 --> 57:32.980]  To run every major department in the country?
[57:32.980 --> 57:34.980]  Because they were crazy enough to do
[57:34.980 --> 57:37.980]  What the new order wanted
[57:37.980 --> 57:39.980]  Crazy people, folks
[57:39.980 --> 57:41.980]  Yeah, they got 180 IQs
[57:41.980 --> 57:42.980]  They're nuts
[57:42.980 --> 57:44.980]  Oh, yeah, those Nazi scientists
[57:44.980 --> 57:46.980]  I've read the history books from U.S. scientists
[57:46.980 --> 57:49.980]  There's nobody as smart as them
[57:49.980 --> 57:50.980]  The Germans before World War II
[57:50.980 --> 57:52.980]  Had vetted almost everything at that time
[57:52.980 --> 57:53.980]  They'd surpassed the U.S.
[57:53.980 --> 57:54.980]  They'd surpassed England
[57:54.980 --> 57:57.980]  But they were crazy
[57:57.980 --> 58:01.980]  And if you'd worked one of them, they'd kill you
[58:01.980 --> 58:04.980]  And I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy we face
[58:04.980 --> 58:07.980]  I'm saying it's like powered by Energizer
[58:07.980 --> 58:09.980]  The whole world you see today was thought up
[58:09.980 --> 58:12.980]  By a bunch of crazy Nazis and British eugenicists
[58:12.980 --> 58:17.980]  And U.S. eugenicists who actually created Hitler
[58:17.980 --> 58:19.980]  You go, why did they set him up and destroy him?
[58:19.980 --> 58:23.980]  Because that was part of the plan
[58:23.980 --> 58:25.980]  Just like they created Al Qaeda
[58:25.980 --> 58:27.980]  To wreak havoc and then they posed as savers
[58:27.980 --> 58:28.980]  Full spectrum dominance
[58:28.980 --> 58:31.980]  I mean, aren't people smart?
[58:31.980 --> 58:33.980]  Or do they not have my Welsh brain?
[58:33.980 --> 58:35.980]  I mean, I don't think I'm that smart
[58:35.980 --> 58:38.980]  What's wrong with people?

[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.980]  And now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:33.980]  Alex Jones
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.980]  All right, we're now into hour number two
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.980]  If you just joined us, AP confirmed everything we broke
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.980]  A week and a half ago that Drudge carried
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.980]  That they have opened the border
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.980]  And that the border patrol buses the illegals
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.980]  Into wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.980]  I haven't gotten into the other stacks of news yet
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.980]  And I will do that now and take your phone calls
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.980]  And I wish we were wrong about that
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.980]  I talked earlier in the last hour about how weird it is
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.980]  To see my talking points based on hardcore analysis and truth
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.980]  Being picked up by senators, members of Congress
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.980]  I'm not bragging, we are the hottest thing on Capitol Hill
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.980]  The hottest thing in the U.S. military
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.980]  And I don't usually brag, I just want my crew
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.980]  And the audience, everybody else to realize
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.980]  The establishment knows how important Info Wars is
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.980]  They know how important Drudge is
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.980]  That's why they attack Drudge all the time
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.980]  And they're attacking us all the time now
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.980]  Because, you know, we're nothing special
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.980]  I mean, I know how to go down to the border
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.980]  Find out that, you know, there's the border patrol
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.980]  Busting people in and giving them vouchers
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.980]  And we have witnesses in ICE and in the city of McAllen
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.980]  That's called doing your job, folks
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.980]  That's why InfoWars.com is so popular
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.980]  That's why this radio show is so popular
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980]  That's why DrudgeReport.com is so popular
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.980]  And WorldNetDaily.com is so popular
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:01.980]  I don't think of WorldNetDaily or InfoWars.com
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.980]  Or DrudgeReport.com or Breitbart for that matter
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.980]  As right wing, I'm certainly not
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.980]  I just want to have a country to live in
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.980]  I don't want to go bankrupt, I don't want to lose my guns
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.980]  I don't want to lose my future, I want prosperity
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.980]  I want justice
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.980]  I don't want anti-American, Latin Americans
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.980]  Running around everywhere, that's not all of them
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.980]  That's who the Democrats want
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.980]  Running all over me and bankrupting the country
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.980]  But I don't want them sterilized, either like the Democrats want
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.980]  Or they could come up here and eat the GMO food
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.980]  And go from 100 pounds up to 600 pounds
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.980]  And get all their limbs sawed off with diabetes
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.980]  It's such a frustrating thing to really care about people
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.980]  Because I mean, I care about everybody because I have empathy
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.980]  You know, somebody giving you a massage
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.980]  The best masseuses, they have empathy
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.980]  They can imagine what that knot feels like
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.980]  And how they're grinding it out
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.980]  A bad masseuse has no empathy
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.980]  Sending, I have empathy, folks, I love these people
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.980]  But at the same time, I understand it's like water
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.980]  Water is a good thing
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.980]  Except if it's turned up like a high-powered water hose
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.980]  Fire hose to cut through mountains with strip mining
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.980]  It will cut through your flesh like a knife through butter
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.980]  Like a hot knife through butter
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.980]  And these people are a weapon
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.980]  I love the Atlantic Ocean
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:39.980]  I don't want to be a thousand feet under it without a mask and a tank
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.980]  And that's what this is
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.980]  Yeah, water is a great thing, strange but true
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.980]  You can drink too much of it and have your electrolytes go out of balance and die
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.980]  They've had folks that have run marathons only drunk water
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.980]  And not gotten the minerals they need and died
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.980]  So we're going to give the number out when we come back
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:05.980]  But I just marvel here on air
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.980]  And I want you to begin to marvel at the power you have, because you have the truth
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.980]  And the establishment is just dishonorable liars
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.980]  They've lost the Info War, so now they're just going, we don't care
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.980]  Yeah, we run Al-Qaeda, yeah, we open the borders up, yeah, we ship guns in Mexico to destabilize things
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.980]  And to blame the Second Amendment
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.980]  Yeah, we're running energy scams and not paying any taxes
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.980]  The French Socialists got caught last year not paying taxes
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.980]  The leadership, while they raised taxes to 101% on the middle class
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.980]  To destroy the political enemy and to ship in unlimited immigrants
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.980]  And no one got in trouble
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.980]  Let them eat cake, Marie Antoinette, the Bastille
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.980]  And out of this crisis, the Jacobins of the 21st century, the Illuminati
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.980]  Planned to bring in a reign of unholy terror
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.980]  That'll make the Bolshevik Revolution look like a cakewalk
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.980]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.980]  About a potential fourth-world situation?
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.980]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980]  Here we go, talk time being a subject!
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.980]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.980]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.980]  Is this another false-flag-stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.980]  By sticking the hands down our pants on the streets?
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.980]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.980]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:37.980]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.980]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.980]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.980]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.980]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.980]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.980]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.980]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.980]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.980]  On average the county said it sprays with glyphosate, at least once a week
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.980]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:35.980]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.980]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and water and breads and toothpaste
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.980]  It is our responsibility to protect our families, the establishment is not going to do it
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.980]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:53.980]  Visit infowarslife.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products

[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:07.980]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.980]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:20.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have gotten the purchase order that the federal government has put out
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:33.980]  Now confirmed, DHS looks to buy thousands upon thousands of pairs of 6x supreme
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.980]  Job of the Hut underwear that I could wear as a leotard
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:44.980]  That the average man could wear or woman as a full-body suit
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.980]  For the new migrants that are arriving
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.980]  And they're not bashing people, they're extremely obese
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.980]  A lot of it's the food systems, the genetic things that happen at the glands, all the additives
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  People you see are much unhealthier diets, 50, 60, 70 years ago, you can look it up
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.980]  And they weren't getting this fat, it's literally
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.980]  They feed rats, GMO, they become obese
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.980]  Obviously some folks do eat too much, they're out of control, but you have to understand
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.980]  6x underwear is like a cellboat cell, almost
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.980]  I mean, it is unspeakable
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:23.980]  And this just illustrates the insanity of them changing diapers, heating up formula
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.980]  As the Board of Patrol has been saying
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.980]  And the head of the Board of Patrol Union is on record in October of last year
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.980]  9 months ago, October, November, December
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.980]  January, February, March, April, May, June
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.980]  Oh my gosh, it's almost 10 months
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.980]  So, almost 10 months ago they warned of this and said
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.980]  We've been ordered to stand down, close quote
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.980]  We've been down to the border, open gates, Board of Patrol standing down
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.980]  Ice ages blowing the whistle, and then what's this?
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.980]  Buses pull up, Board of Patrol gets off
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.980]  Families, kids, women, self-propelled stomachs
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:59.980]  They all get brought and go, where are you going?
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.980]  Here is your voucher that will pay the bill, wherever you want to go in the U.S.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.980]  To quote, meet your family or French
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.980]  Imagine if it was, if you were super poor and there was some wealthier country
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:15.980]  Say in South America, and there was a train from Mexico all the way down there
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.980]  And all you got to do is get on the train, it's free
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.980]  And then you just choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.980]  Or you got a plane ticket, you land at Air Force bases
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.980]  If a citizen tries to fly in, they shoot you down
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.980]  You land at the Air Force base, down there at Biggs Field
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.980]  In El Paso, I'm not kidding
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.980]  And you land at Biggs Field, no pun intended with our reporter being named Joe Biggs
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.980]  He's actually named after his great grandfather, strangely enough
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.980]  And they land and they disgorge him there
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:51.980]  I mean, this is the level of the joke that we are dealing with
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:57.980]  This is the out of control insanity that this has gotten to at this point
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.980]  I'm living in the twilight zone, are you living in it?
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:10.980]  And the cruise is like, we ought to follow the law and deport them
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.980]  Outrageous!
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.980]  If your house was burning down, we ought to call the fire department
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.980]  Outrageous!
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.980]  Remember you cut your leg off, you ought to put a tourniquet on that
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.980]  Outrageous!
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.980]  Our border's totally collapsed
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.980]  And it's not like our border was lowered with Switzerland
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.980]  The Swiss would put troops there, so we couldn't get in
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:35.980]  Our border has gone down with Mexico, Guatemala
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.980]  And it just gets worse from there
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.980]  And again, you want to go down there? I dare you
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.980]  I dare you to go to Guatemala City
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.980]  I dare you to go to the major cities of Brazil
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.980]  I dare you to go to Venezuela
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.980]  I double dare you
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.980]  In your sweltering five-star hotel
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.980]  It's as bad as a one-star in the U.S.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.980]  And the power goes off like five times a day for hours
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.980]  And there's guys with machine guns everywhere
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.980]  And starving children with snot all over their faces
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.980]  And you might even see a few dead bodies
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.980]  How's that sound?
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.980]  And let's say you got a business outside town
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.980]  Your family's hung on to it for years
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.980]  Maybe you grow coffee, maybe you got a private school
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.980]  The government shows up and says,
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.980]  You're going to hire all these people and pay them this
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.980]  Or we're going to shut you down
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:23.980]  Well, that's more money we make
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.980]  Sorry, better do it
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.980]  Well, fine, I quit
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.980]  Fine, we take over your school
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.980]  But we own this school, we own this 300 acres
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.980]  You don't anymore
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.980]  And if you've got a problem, I'll call the army
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.980]  And if you get a problem and smart off, an army truck pulls up
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.980]  And they take you and throw you in a prison
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.980]  Where you don't get fed
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.980]  Unless your family brings you food
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.980]  And there's crap all over the floor
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:52.980]  With up to 500 people per public giant open air cell
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.980]  How's that sound?
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.980]  Well, that's what America's going to get
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.980]  And I told people a while back
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.980]  If you got the money, evacuate
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.980]  If you got the money, evacuate
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.980]  This place is fallen, the US is gone
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:16.980]  Now, when a person dies, they're dead
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.980]  They don't rise again unless they're Christ
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.980]  Or Lazarus
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.980]  But a country is an idea and a culture
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.980]  And if we want the Phoenix to rise again, it can
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:37.980]  But undoubtedly, I've said America was bleeding to death on the ground
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.980]  The last 10 years
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.980]  Now, we're dead
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.980]  We're dead and they didn't resuscitate in five minutes
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.980]  We're brain dead, we're gone
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.980]  But we could rise again
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:53.980]  But America wants to, you know, act tough
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.980]  And America wants to watch football games
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.980]  And America wants to, you know, not care
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.980]  And thinks you get ahead when you don't care about anybody
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.980]  And everybody wants to, you know, see what's in it for them personally
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.980]  Well, what's in it for you is to have a good, honest society
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.980]  That creates incredible prosperity and where you have honor
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.980]  And that's your number one possession
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]  That's who you are
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.980]  But see, we became a dishonored nation
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.980]  When they could convince us that it was trendy and cool
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.980]  To have state-run abortuaries
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.980]  And kill 53 million Americans
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.980]  Well, we're going to get some judgment now
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.980]  And those of us that don't want the full curses to come upon us
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.980]  Even if we don't believe in God
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.980]  In every culture, people become decadent and evil
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.980]  And don't care anymore, everything collapses
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.980]  The society degenerates and guess who the number one group is
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.980]  Targeted under this system, the ultra rich
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.980]  And they think biometrics, they think checkpoints
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.980]  And the new TSA society
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.980]  And their segregated command bases are going to protect them
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.980]  No, it's not
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.980]  Your kids are going to venture outside
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.980]  You're going to venture outside
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.980]  You're going to be robbed and killed
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.980]  And the elite itself will end up robbing you
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.980]  Not just the poor masses
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.980]  The elite will kill you for your billion dollars
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.980]  Even though they can print a billion dollars
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.980]  They're not going to like you
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.980]  Maybe your wife's better looking
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.980]  Maybe you beat them in a business deal 20 years ago
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:23.980]  They're going to take you before they kill you
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.980]  And they're going to videotape you being tortured
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.980]  Because the people up top will sit there all day
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.980]  Watching their enemies be tortured to death
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.980]  That's their entertainment in every culture
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.980]  The old dungeons, they would have dungeon viewing rooms
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.980]  With open windows and things in Rome, Babylon, you name it
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:41.980]  The Byzantines had it as well
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.980]  Where they would sit and eat lunch while people were tortured
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.980]  And so you want to get rid of checks and balances for us?
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.980]  Your checks and balances are gone
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.980]  All the police that serve this
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.980]  You're not going to get your pension funds
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.980]  And you're going to die young of the biological and chemical weapons
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.980]  In the food chain
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.980]  And your children will die even younger
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.980]  And then they try to have kids
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.980]  They'll almost all be born stillborn
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.980]  Three generations and all mammals under this bio
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.980]  Weapon attack on the GMO are born
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.980]  Completely stillborn, totally miller retarded
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.980]  Hair growing out of their mouths
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.980]  Testicles on top of their heads
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.980]  Intestines growing out their butts
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.980]  Leg sticking out their heads
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.980]  And I'm not trying to be gross here
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.980]  Go look up third generation GMO
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.980]  That you're eating, that I'm eating
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.980]  Fed to guinea pigs, white lab mice, rats, you name it
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.980]  Hair growing out of their mouths
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.980]  Testicles growing outside their body
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.980]  On their backs, out of their eyes
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.980]  What happens to them is exactly what happens to us
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.980]  Except our generations are every 20 years on average
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.980]  Theirs are every few months
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.980]  So we can see real quick
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.980]  Near complete sterility by third generation
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.980]  O.B.P.A. may cause infertility
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:59.980]  Studies says the Boston Globe is reporting
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:01.980]  Next they're going to tell me that
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.980]  Turkey's gobble
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:08.980]  Total free number to join us
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.980]  800-259-9231
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:15.980]  800-259-9231
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.980]  800-259-9231
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:19.980]  By the way, we've done the math
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.980]  Off the federal parts disorder
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.980]  Probably wants to do the math themselves
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:24.980]  And add this or our guys can add it
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.980]  To an article we're doing
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.980]  In the one parts disorder
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.980]  Posted on the federal website
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.980]  That we have here
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.980]  They've just ordered one order
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.980]  42,000 pairs of 6x underwear
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.980]  So let's say they give 3 pair of underwear
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.980]  To each of the
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.980]  Large big men
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.980]  And women that are coming here
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.980]  That is statistically tens of thousands
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.980]  Of people that wear 6x
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.980]  And statistically let's say
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.980]  That's 20% of the underwear they're ordering
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.980]  We're talking about hundreds of thousands
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.980]  Of underwear ordered
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.980]  6x ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.980]  That's enough
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.980]  That's enough
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:10.980]  We've done the math
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.980]  It's 42,000 pairs
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.980]  Oh boy
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.980]  And they're putting some other numbers
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.980]  Up there on the site
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:18.980]  Now continuing from an earlier article
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.980]  But of course we'll find more
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.980]  So that's what's going on
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:23.980]  On that front
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.980]  I haven't really gotten into this yet
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.980]  I guess I could
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.980]  I'm kind of stuck on this one area
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.980]  The total collapse into the country
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:32.980]  Literally people crying
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.980]  Saying thank you Obama in Spanish
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.980]  Yes we can is a communist
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.980]  Chant that the Mexicans use
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.980]  From the Communist Party in Mexico
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.980]  Look it up
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.980]  How do you say it in Spanish?
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.980]  See the bumper stickers everywhere
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.980]  With the black eagle
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.980]  Of the workers party
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.980]  Farm workers party that's communist
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.980]  How do you say yes we can in Spanish?
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.980]  Si, se puede
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.980]  Yes say it on air
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.980]  Si, se puede
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.980]  Yes we can
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.980]  Yes you can
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.980]  Yes you can
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.980]  Live in dirt floor houses
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.980]  With troops in black uniforms running around
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.980]  Yes you can be in a collapsed society
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.980]  I don't even know what to say at this point
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.980]  Coming up
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.980]  We told you they're putting up
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.980]  Hidden microphones all over the country
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.980]  They've already done it
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.980]  They're just now announcing it
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.980]  To the slaves today
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.980]  And also Intel developing kill switches
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.980]  For laptops and computers
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.980]  Just like all the other iPads
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.980]  And apples and everything
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.980]  That's a total control grid
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.980]  Everything gets a kill switch in the new world order
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.980]  We've got more VA deaths
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.980]  Covered up as they put them on
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.980]  Sarvation torture death list
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.980]  For most hardcore
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.980]  Forms of death available
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.980]  Like dehydration takes about 14 days
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.980]  Of torturous pain as your tongue swells
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.980]  Up giant blacken
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.980]  Blood pours out your mouth
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.980]  Maybe we should send the vets to the board of patrol stations
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.980]  To get some care
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:21.980]  There's one major factor affecting the health of millions and most people are completely unaware
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:29.980]  You are now in the crosshairs
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.980]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.980]  And monitoring your every move
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.980]  Ron Paul said recently
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.980]  The evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.980]  What's taking place right now is a coup
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.980]  And the destruction of the Constitution
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.980]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole

[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.980]  Who co-hosted the show with me some back in the late 90s
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.980]  And was friends with Mike Hansen
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.980]  He ended up moving to Tennessee
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.980]  He's an engineer
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.980]  And he's got a good chance
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.980]  He's been endorsed by the campaign for liberty
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.980]  And he's got a good chance of winning
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.980]  He's a engineering professor now
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.980]  And he co-hosted the freedom report with myself
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.980]  And others here in Austin, Texas
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.980]  I think like 97, 98, 99
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.980]  And he's up in Tennessee with a good shot
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.980]  At winning the primary and ending up winning the general election
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.980]  So to talk about the Tea Party Revolution
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.980]  He'll be joining us for about 45 minutes
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.980]  To talk about a host of issues
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.980]  And he's a really smart fellow so I look forward
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.980]  To having Steve Lane on air with us
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.980]  And there they're showing some video of Alex Jones
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.980]  About in 1998
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.980]  As you can see, I probably didn't have any trouble with the ladies back then
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:56.980]  Man, I can't wait until I lose another 30 pounds or so
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.980]  I've already lost almost 50
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:59.980]  I really turned into job of the hut myself
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.980]  I only went up to extra-large underwear though
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.980]  At 275 pounds
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:07.980]  I'm down to 220 something now
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.980]  I can't imagine what it would be like
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.980]  Actually weighing enough to wear 6X that the government's paying for
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.980]  40-something thousand of them for the illegals
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.980]  Only in America, man
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:20.980]  What a joke
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:21.980]  We've got to admit how far we've fallen
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.980]  We're never going to turn this around
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.980]  Oh, briefly
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.980]  We've been here for a few weeks
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.980]  We've just been so busy
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:28.980]  We haven't gotten them up on the shopping cart
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.980]  At infoorstore.com
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.980]  I came up with the concept
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.980]  And then Cade, one of our great designers, did the final design
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.980]  It's similar to the best-selling Moa on Lobby T-shirt I designed
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:43.980]  That has the two-crossed M4
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.980]  M16-type variants
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:51.980]  The awesome 300 Spartan helmet with Moa on Lobby
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.980]  Come and take it
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.980]  And then infoorstore.com
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.980]  You know, wreath under it
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.980]  This is an incredibly handsome belt buckle
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:01.980]  By the way, I'm wearing it right now
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:04.980]  And when I wear this out with cowboy boots
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.980]  And with, you know, a T-shirt
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.980]  Men and women, because I've had these a few weeks
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.980]  Like I said, walk over and say, well, that is incredible
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.980]  Now, I designed the George Washington one as well
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.980]  Came up with the concept
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.980]  My great graphics crew came up with the final design
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.980]  But those are almost sold out
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.980]  One is nickel, silver, nickel, plated, pure bronze
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.980]  Made in the USA
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.980]  Those are almost completely sold out
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.980]  We've got some of the straight bronze ones left
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.980]  That I think are just as good
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:35.980]  But we've got 500 of each of the new Moa on Lobby
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.980]  And when they're gone, they're collectors
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.980]  That's it
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.980]  And these will sell out quickly
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.980]  They're $45
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.980]  Comparable belt buckles like this are $100
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.980]  You go to like a cowboy shop or whatever, Justin's
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.980]  They're $75 to $100, $200
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.980]  These are $45, they cost 20-something bucks
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.980]  To get them smelted and made in the USA
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.980]  And individually numbered on the back
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.980]  With Made in 1776.com
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.980]  So these are priced to get the word out
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.980]  And to fund our operation
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:08.980]  So Moa on Lobby, Alex Jones concept
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.980]  Belt buckle
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.980]  And let me tell you, it's bad to the bone
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.980]  I've worn the George Washington one out
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.980]  And haven't really gotten any comments
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.980]  I've seen people looking, but most folks don't know
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:19.980]  Who George Washington is
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.980]  Or they don't recognize him in his battle uniform
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.980]  On the front with his signature above it
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.980]  Looks western-styled with stars
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:28.980]  And the answer, 1984, 1776
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:32.980]  Most people don't iconically pick up what that is
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.980]  You wear a Moa on Lobby belt buckle, baby
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.980]  And let me tell you, there ain't nothing looks this good in my view
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.980]  Especially with a western-style belt
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.980]  Like that one that's got like the little bullets
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:45.980]  As the belt, you know, not bullets in it
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.980]  But it's carved bullets in that leather
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.980]  That's the belt I'm wearing right now
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.980]  It is simply amazing
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.980]  The comments you get
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:54.980]  People love it
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.980]  And it's about Liberty culture
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.980]  We're this close to taking over the motorcycle culture
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.980]  The good motorcycle folks with Liberty
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.980]  Made in 1776 type
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.980]  Moa on Lobby, come and take it
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.980]  Iconography, the snake, don't tread on me
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:11.980]  The military's awake to it, loves it
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:13.980]  That's how you take over culture
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:16.980]  Use with your signets, your symbols, your logos
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:18.980]  Your clothing, your regalia
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.980]  That's what the t-shirts all made in America
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.980]  At Madein1776.com are about

[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.980]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.980]  That your body can really absorb
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:25.980]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.980]  If you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:30.980]  Rare earth, deep earth crystals

[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:04.980]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.980]  To find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available

[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:11.980]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.980]  You know, I'm not bragging when I say this.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.980]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.980]  But we are defending.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.980]  It's hard to turn a heart off.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.980]  Their first few records are really good.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:51.980]  The later ones in the 80s, not so much.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:59.980]  You know, I tell you, Obama is a magic man, even though this song is barracuda.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:03.980]  He can just make the border disappear.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.980]  And the yuppies don't even know what that means.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:13.980]  No, they don't know. They don't act trendy, though.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:20.980]  I want to go to some of your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.980]  But I don't mean to brag, because it's actually sad.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:31.980]  There were NSA whistleblowers, British NSA whistleblowers, German whistleblowers, in the midnight.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:37.980]  And I would cover it on the radio, and then engineers and people from the telecoms, Time Warner,
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:44.980]  would come to rodeos and car dealerships, and Chewie's Mexican food restaurant.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.980]  You know, because, I mean, a couple nights a week, sometimes I would go do a remote,
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:49.980]  because that's how I got paid.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.980]  I would get a small percentage of the remote.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:56.980]  And it's everybody at the radio station would love to do remotes, so they'd have the sports show,
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:02.980]  you know, from like three to six on, and then I would come on from these remotes.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.980]  And the more NSA documents I got, that was the age of whistleblowing.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.980]  God, where are all those documents?
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.980]  I used to shred them afterwards.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.980]  I didn't like keeping them around.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.980]  And I didn't even understand this stuff what these engineers were telling me.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.980]  All of it came out with Snowden.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:22.980]  But the stuff they were giving was even bigger and more insane.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:27.980]  And I would get on air and say, all the Scientific Atlantic Time Warner cable boxes nationwide
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.980]  have microphones in them listening to you.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.980]  People didn't believe it.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:35.980]  Of course, I busted one open on Access TV on air and showed folks the microphone,
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:40.980]  and, you know, where the engineer told me it was at.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:43.980]  And then I delivered it back to H-E-B saying, you know, saying it was broken.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.980]  I needed a new one, because that's how you did it back then.
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:47.980]  You dumped them off.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.980]  The person said, why is it broken open?
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.980]  I said, you got to watch my TV show to figure that one out, lady.
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.980]  I got death threats over that one.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.980]  I mean, really mean ones like, you like what we did in the parking lot that time?
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:02.980]  You pull one more thing like that, you're going to get it.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.980]  And it's weird when you're 25 years old and a full grown, mean-sounding man is saying,
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:10.980]  you do one more thing, buddy, and they've got an unlisted phone number threatening you,
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:12.980]  and there's nothing coming up on the caller ID.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.980]  I mean, they would become violently angry at that point that microphones were in the,
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.980]  but you know what, the public had cognitive dissonance.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.980]  They would just say, Alex is the loon.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:25.980]  There's no microphones in the thing.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:28.980]  And then people would come to my house, even, you know, 15 years ago,
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.980]  and they first started putting the cameras in the laptops and computers.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:33.980]  Apples had it early on.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:36.980]  And why do you got the thing covered?
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.980]  And I'd say, oh, they watch you over those.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:41.980]  Oh, they do.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.980]  Oh, the black helicopter is going to get me.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.980]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:51.980]  Because everybody knows that's a mega police state.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.980]  Everybody knows that would never happen in America.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:57.980]  Well, we again broke.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:02.980]  And I'm coming to set for calls with the blueprints from a whistleblower
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:10.980]  who hand delivered the data files through the intermediary to our person.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:15.940]  I mean, people had to meet literally in parking lots.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:19.460]  Remember Matt Drudge tweeted earlier this year, but it was last year that journalists
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:26.940]  have to now meet like in the old days in parking garages, like deep throat during the whole
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:32.260]  Watergate situation with Woodward and Bernstein.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.020]  And that's because the people working in this, they know they're under surveillance.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:39.260]  And see, that means the political class is all scared.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.860]  The political class is known for decades.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.940]  This is going on and they're told, shut up if you want your pension, go along with it.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:50.740]  And now Obama meets with the cops last week that was in mainstream headlines and ask them,
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:54.140]  don't tell the public what we've got.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:03.060]  The license plate readers, the data mining systems, the cell phone tracking, but it's
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.060]  beyond that.
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:09.780]  I learned because one of these engineers called me because once one was telling me, everybody
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:14.500]  was telling me, hey, we put in a couple hundred of them a few years ago in 96.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.780]  We're now going to put in hundreds of microphones.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:19.020]  We're going to call them gunshot detectors.
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:24.140]  Here's where you find the federal grant that Kay Bailey Hutchison got passed in the Senate.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.380]  And sure enough, I reported it and a week later, the whitewash at the statesman had
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:33.220]  a cover story in Metro and state and it's in my phone, police at 2000 saying, oh, gunshot
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:38.100]  detectors come to areas of Austin to detect gunshots.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.100]  They don't detect gunshots.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.220]  Sure, they can use it to try to triangulate.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.980]  It's used to listen to you at shotgun microphones that can listen to you at hundreds of yards
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.980]  away.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:47.140]  And now the companies admit that.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.140]  Okay.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:51.940]  There's now thousands of microphones and thousands of hidden cameras in Austin.
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:57.460]  And now the Austin police chief wants to wire quote your business in so you can see crimes,
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:02.180]  which sounds reasonable till you realize the globalists are using it to corner the market,
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:06.620]  corner the economy, and we'll use it to tax people by the mile in the future.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.780]  And it's a technocracy.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:15.740]  And see, I'm here to even decompartmentalize people like Art Acevedo, who goes along with
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.380]  all this when he's at meetings with Obama and closed doors, as he admittedly has been
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:22.940]  in, up at the White House with other top police chiefs.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:26.300]  Austin's like the 10th biggest city in the country now, isn't it?
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.500]  Hanging out with the president and they're saying, don't tell people about this.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:31.740]  This is important.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:34.140]  We need you to be part of the big cover up.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:38.780]  So next time he comes in, oh, we do have some systems to keep you safe, Alex, but we cannot
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.780]  discuss those.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:42.980]  Just give me a break, man, give me a break.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.860]  The border's wide open, the government ships in the narcotics, the big banks launder the
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:49.220]  money, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:52.020]  And now Chicago Tribune.
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:57.620]  New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago streets.
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:02.020]  They will record digital address of every device in live time, tracking the whole history
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.140]  of where you went and what you did.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:10.740]  Totally illegal, totally violates your rights, but beyond that, there's microphones in it.
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:13.980]  But don't worry, it's sculptures.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:18.540]  It's sculptures to keep you, oh, it's beautiful, and the whole article's about how beautiful
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.540]  the sculpture is.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.540]  You're not against art, are you?
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:27.100]  And of course, they're blasting you with electromagnetic radiation.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:32.660]  By the way, the Toronto Star and the Baltimore Sun both reported more than 15 years ago about
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:39.620]  how DARPA was testing hidden antennas with soothing energy wavelengths to calm public
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.260]  steering time of distress.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:45.480]  And now DARPA has admitted it and came out two weeks ago and said, we do want to put
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.380]  brain chips in everybody who's upset.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:49.940]  And not just them.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:52.580]  If you want to be in black ops now, we want you to have it.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:59.780]  And of course, what do they call, what is the call of duty slogan?
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.380]  The future is black.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:05.260]  That means secret armies that can be flushed down the toilet.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.180]  It isn't cool to be in black ops, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:14.780]  But all our young people, oh, black ops, soon all they'll be is black ops.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:19.140]  A secret army, everyone a spy, everyone recruited.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.740]  So you can be spied on more closely.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:26.060]  You're a doctor, you're a lawyer, you're a top scientist.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.380]  You've been recruited by the CIA or they've tried.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.020]  You've been recruited by the FBI.
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.180]  Not because they want you to help save the country.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:42.900]  They want to watch your butt.
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:48.740]  Now I will tell you, there are still good people at the state level in states like Texas,
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:59.500]  Tennessee, Arizona, and a few others, Montana, Wyoming, Missouri to a certain extent, Oklahoma,
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.140]  where people aren't perfect, but they love their kids and don't want to be under pure
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.220]  evil and are physically upset by it.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:09.060]  Maybe it's because their ancestors fought King George, I don't know.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:15.260]  But the issue is the state of Texas was preparing an emergency plan when the government got
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:21.100]  rid of the border to stop at least the criminals and the drug gangs with the armored vehicles,
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.900]  tanks, and gunboats.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:25.860]  And I didn't believe it when the senator first talked about it on air.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:30.100]  Another senator gave me intel six months ago that, no, you'd see him, seen him deployed.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:34.300]  And I've been told the stories about the Mexican Marines are operating on both sides.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.740]  We broke that five years ago.
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:40.260]  And they're throwing drug cartels, people out of helicopters.
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.700]  But that's only drug cartels that aren't paying their cut.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.860]  So when your family members who are in the U.S. Army, U.S. Marines, or with the Mexican
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.700]  Marines, the Mexican Army is totally corrupt.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.220]  It's not involved.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.220]  That's actually on the other side.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:53.220]  Los Zetas fights them.
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.820]  Los Zetas was founded by the CIA on record 10 years ago to run all this.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:59.180]  And it's come out in federal court documents.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:04.140]  This is all a war over who controls the Mexican government, Wall Street, or their own L. Heffy's
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]  down there.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:11.220]  It's a civil war and the drug cartels, and our government is the ultimate drug cartel.
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:14.620]  Whenever people get busted, U.S. soldiers carrying out these ops, they just get in
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.460]  trouble like, oh, they were doing it on their own.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:19.620]  But it came out in federal court of top Los Zetas operatives.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:24.100]  They're really CIA.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.100]  There's the headline report.
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:30.660]  New American CIA working with Mexican drug cartels, of course.
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:33.100]  And if you join the U.S. Army now, you're being rotated.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.300]  Well, it only takes season, folks, for this.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.100]  I know I've got family down there.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.300]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:46.780]  They've got that Eurocopters, what they're using, not U.S. Blackhawks.
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:50.340]  So it's the type that the back opens up, and they can all run off.
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:54.860]  And it's just full on war down there, just slaughtering, sheen gunning, throwing people
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:59.460]  out helicopters every day, just blowing up, just total death.
[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:04.540]  And this is the average person that has no idea what's going on.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:09.700]  The public, just take your cancer shots, drink your fluoride, and get ready to get in a coffin.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.700]  Watch some sports.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.700]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:16.100]  Diane in NEB, Nebraska, formerly in the U.S.
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.100]  What FEMA region are you in, Diana?
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:21.100]  Actually, I forgot to look it up, Alex.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.100]  I used to know.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.100]  I'd want to say five or six, but I'm not sure.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.460]  Yeah, I think you might be in eight.
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:26.460]  Can we look up those FEMA regions?
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.460]  Go ahead.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:28.460]  Go ahead.
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:33.900]  Yeah, I was just calling the last couple of years, especially just the last couple
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:34.900]  months here.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:40.940]  I've been thinking more and more about this dream I had in the spring of 2001, and I remember
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:46.580]  it because it was so striking and because I was living in a place that was very remote
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:49.380]  and it was the first time I'd ever lived out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:54.100]  And anyway, in the dream, when I came into it, it wasn't, I wasn't seeing like everything
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.100]  that's going on now.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:02.260]  I was catching the back end of it, and it was at the end of a very, very, very long war,
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:05.740]  whether it was just a civil war or world war, I don't know.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:08.060]  By the way, you are in FEMA region eight.
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:09.060]  Just so you know, go ahead.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060]  Eight.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.060]  Okay.
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:12.060]  Thank you.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060]  I'll remember that for next time.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:16.100]  Well, it's good to know where you are in the former U.S. because admitting that is half
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:17.100]  the battle.
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:18.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.100]  I'm there.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.100]  Definitely.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.580]  No, no, I'm saying, we got to explain to the public, when I say deep behind enemy lines,
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.580]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.980]  I'm in occupied New World Order, former United States, and now plan to mop up the media and
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:29.980]  the rest of us.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:36.100]  So, I mean, it's just full on, and the enemy's operation is so over the top, only admitting
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:37.500]  the full horror can stop them.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:38.500]  Go ahead.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:43.220]  Well, that's why I keep thinking of this dream, because in the dream, there was really
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.220]  nothing left.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:45.220]  I don't even know.
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:46.220]  I was still there.
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:50.300]  Now, whether I was in body or there in spirit, I don't know, but there was definitely much
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:52.300]  less than 5% of the time.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.300]  You know, it's funny.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.780]  In my whole life, I've had dreams that come true.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:59.380]  Sometimes 10 years later, sometimes 10 years later, sometimes a week later.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.380]  And I've told people about them.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.380]  They don't happen very often.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.080]  They're always very upsetting.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.700]  You feel like you've been somewhere.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:05.700]  It's very scary.
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.740]  And I mean, nothing really scares me, folks.
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.340]  These dreams do.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:12.380]  And sometimes it's like, I'm walking down a path I've never been on, and a guy comes
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.380]  out and mugs me, and they're wearing the exact shirt, it's the same guy.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:19.900]  Or a family member dies, you know, stuff like that.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:25.900]  I've had, I've had a recurring dream that I would have when I was first about to get
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:33.380]  on air in about 1994, 95 of trying to get somewhere in the Texas Hill country and pulling
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:40.020]  up on Mexican troops at a checkpoint and having to look at my rifle and making the decision.
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:42.540]  And I'm going to leave the rest of the dream alone.
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:45.460]  And I remember even in the dream, I was like, oh, my back was hurt.
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.460]  Not real old.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.460]  I remember I was a different person.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:51.140]  It was like the dream is so advanced, it's like you're even smarter in the dream.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:55.020]  Like it's in a, you know, like six dimension able to time travel, they think in the brain
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:59.100]  is what describes that phenomenon, oppressing it, dreams of like precognition.
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:01.980]  And then I'm getting the rifle and making the decision because I've got kids with me
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:05.580]  that I've got to go ahead and that I can't go where they're taking me.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:09.020]  And there's a knowledge they've been, no, that's a hypothetical book I'm writing before
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:10.020]  the New York Times picks it up.
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.020]  I'm just joking.
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:12.020]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:13.020]  Go ahead.
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:19.580]  Well, anyway, my dream, the strange thing was there really was, except for one low level
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:23.700]  spy, there really was not any New World Order left.
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:27.780]  That's not to say they weren't underground in some of their deep underground crystal
[01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:30.300]  palaces or whatever they have down there.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:37.540]  But there was one older man, looked like a professor guy, still wore a cardigan sweater,
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:40.820]  and he was a spy, but he didn't really have anyone to report to.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.220]  So that was the strange thing.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:48.500]  But what was even stranger was, like I say, this had probably gone on this war or craziness,
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.020]  complete dismantling of civilization.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:55.540]  Oh, no, no, no, the official British Ministry of Defense report, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:01.500]  From 2007 predicts total collapse and just mass death by the billions.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.820]  Just type in flash mobs, brain chips is our future, London Guardian wrote a big article
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:06.820]  on it.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.980]  You can read the full report.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:12.100]  And it's just incredible when you actually read it for yourself.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:16.100]  And now the Pentagon says, but that's the plan, but they want to stop it.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.100]  No, no, no.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.020]  All the compartmentalized Pentagon people, they're trying to stop it so they don't understand
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:22.380]  it's being engineered.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:28.060]  Just like troops killing drug cartel people don't understand their compartmentalized
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:31.220]  only taking out the rival cartel of the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:32.220]  You understand?
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:33.220]  Hmm.
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:36.780]  So, so, so, I mean, is this a prescient dream?
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:38.780]  Have you ever had prescient dreams before?
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.780]  Yes.
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:45.020]  And a lot of times they have come to pass and I'm, I'm hoping this one doesn't.
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:52.180]  It stuck with me a long time after I had it, but, but also what was unusual was even though
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:56.860]  and people were beyond homeless, they, there was still some building standing, but people
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:49:03.380]  had just been nomadic for so long that homeless wasn't even really a reality anymore.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:07.620]  Everyone was just so used to kind of traveling in packs or solo, but at the same time there
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.620]  wasn't.
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.980]  Well, that's why everybody's buying food and getting weapons and everything is they
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:16.220]  can sense that things are collapsing, things are being shut down by design.
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.220]  Things are, and I mean, literally most of Latin America and Africa is what you just
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.220]  described.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:29.140]  So, so there's tiny islands in Europe, some of the Middle East, some areas of Asia, Russia,
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:34.060]  and North America, Australia, New Zealand, everywhere else is literally dead bodies on
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:39.340]  the ground, skulls, armed gangs running around and people just living in huts being bitten
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:44.180]  by mosquitoes and, and you know, uh, salons predicting America will collapse.
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:49.100]  I mean, they're all preparing us for this while they survive it in armored compounds
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.660]  and redoubts above and below ground.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.940]  And that's why we've been warning everybody God bless you, ma'am, and, and you know, everybody
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:50:03.420]  should talk about this prescience and I'm telling you folks, I'm telling you that you
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:05.220]  don't have to believe I had that dream or not.
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:07.220]  And let's just happen to leave for the media say I was joking.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:11.100]  I was funny, I'm thinking about writing a fiction book along those lines.
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.220]  I really, I'm going to start telling you what I really think folks.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:16.980]  The point is, is that, have you noticed how, how we know about all this stuff?
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:23.620]  The point is, is expanding on all of this information is that we can change this future.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:26.900]  That's only a possible future the globalists are trying to push.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:30.540]  If we expose all the ones behind it, they won't shut down the rest of the coal power
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:31.540]  plants.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.780]  Notice the Supreme Court ruled yesterday kind of a half-hearted deal.
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:36.620]  Oh, you need to have a little bit of, you know, check with Congress.
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.620]  Shut everything down.
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:39.380]  Because shutting them all down will be too obvious.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:44.700]  See, I mean, even though there's evil globalists in control, the average person in the system
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.660]  doesn't want to kill prosperity.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:50.100]  So there's major forces battling here.
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:54.780]  And we don't have to have this collapse happen, but we've got to admit it's coming to turn
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:55.780]  it around.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:58.780]  I mean, look at this Texas State Police trying to stop the invasion.

[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:01.780]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:07.820]  Male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:13.420]  synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:16.740]  and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:21.420]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:25.740]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:32.180]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:37.700]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.700]  dose.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:40.700]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:44.740]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:46.700]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.740]  Curious about what comes next?
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:10.060]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:12.060]  has been ransacked by burglars.
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:15.540]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:20.940]  You asked for it, we listened and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.020]  previous model.
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:26.100]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40 inch TV.
[01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:31.500]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:35.820]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:37.900]  and move on to an easier target.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:42.700]  The new brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:48.180]  Go to fakedv.com or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:54.860]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to fakedv.com.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:13.700]  The next stop that we make will be in line.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:20.100]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:24.300]  Before I got a bunch of emails about the sixth dimension not being the dimension of time,
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:30.260]  I'm no quantum mechanics expert, but the fourth dimension is basic time, straight line, fifth
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:35.020]  dimension is a plane, sixth dimension is like a cube, where within this dimension you can
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:36.860]  move back and forth different points.
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:41.660]  And that's how the scientists in mainline science have computers proving prescient dreams,
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.260]  things like that.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:48.660]  The problem is there's so many quacks and kooks and you know, gypsy wagons on the side
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:53.220]  of the highway to use the term, conning people.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:57.940]  It's not controllable in my view, but we now have computers that electronically off of
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:04.820]  our data, the Google super computers, quantum computers that are able to predict the future
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:07.620]  in mass movements almost 100%.
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:10.620]  And if you're a new listener and think that sounds crazy, they've been doing it for years,
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:14.060]  but Amazon has now announced they can package your order and have it ready to ship before
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.860]  you order it and are because if you're a big enough customer of them and they have enough
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:21.500]  data off the internet, they know what you're going to order before you order it.
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.980]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:26.900]  The human brain can do that too, just that we can't control it.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.940]  Let's go ahead in most cases.
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:30.740]  Let's talk to Karen in Arizona.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:32.700]  Karen, you're on the air.
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:33.700]  Welcome.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.700]  Welcome.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:38.700]  Thank you so much, Alex, for doing everything you do.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:45.420]  We've been calling Jam Brewer's office to call out the Arizona Rangers, like Rick Perry
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:51.140]  did, and they're finding all the kinds of excuses why they can't do the National Guard,
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.660]  why they can't call out the errors.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:56.260]  It's a globalist North American union plan to collapse the country.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:59.180]  You tell them you're going to vote them out if they don't put troops on the border and
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:01.500]  start turning these people back to Latin America.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:05.860]  If they don't, it'll be a full collapse of Latin America through Mexico into the U.S.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:08.100]  that will make this look like a joke.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:13.580]  They want to wait till the crisis is unstoppable to bring in martial law using this.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.580]  Absolutely.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.580]  And that's why AP finally has had to admit it is on purpose.
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:23.500]  So you're calling Congress people, and they're giving you the run around.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.860]  We're calling Jam Brewer's office.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:27.860]  The governor's office.
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:30.860]  And she's saying, oh, she can't do that.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.860]  And I said, yes, she can.
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:36.020]  The Constitution gives her the authority to do that.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.220]  She can do it.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.260]  She doesn't need Congress to do it.
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:42.860]  She can do it on her own.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:49.220]  And then now they're saying, after so many people call, well, we'll go ahead and take
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.780]  down your input and give it to the governor.
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:58.980]  So maybe the next solution is people going with the American flags and placards and going
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:00.380]  down to the state house.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.380]  No, no, I agree.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.860]  The answer is going to these border patrol facilities, these holding facilities with
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:09.020]  your own cameras and showing the world what's happening.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:14.420]  And the fact that there's real media will make the mainstream horror media cover it,
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:16.860]  like we've done with the enemy operation AP.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:22.620]  So yes, go to the state house and stuff, but more importantly, go show the VA collapsing
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.660]  and then go show the illegals being given a red carpet.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:26.660]  God bless you.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:30.420]  We just put on TV screen the governor's phone number.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:32.420]  You should be calling all of them.
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.420]  You should be calling Rick Perry.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.820]  He said some stuff and he's quietly done some stuff.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:39.140]  I got to say it's actually a decent job having some of the state police down there.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:43.220]  It's not a total stand down, but we need to get just full state guard.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:44.220]  I mean, we need full.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.220]  I mean, this is an emergency.
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.020]  I mean, no country's ever done this.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:48.020]  This is the end of the nation.
[01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:50.380]  I mean, this is off the chart.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.380]  Pete in New York.
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.380]  You're on the air.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.380]  Go ahead.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:54.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:59.900]  I was wondering, I saw a video on YouTube recently.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:07.140]  It was basically a four-part series from Fox News that aired in November, 2001, which basically
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:12.300]  showed that Israeli intelligence has control over the information networks in the USA.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.500]  Now this, I'm not like trying to be like an anti-Semite or anti-Semite.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:15.500]  No, I don't care.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:22.500]  I mean, I knew right when you started talking about the Fox News, the dancing Israelis, what's
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:23.500]  it called?
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:27.500]  The reserve force of Israeli spies.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.980]  They talk about that in there.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.940]  I tell you what, we're going to break some of the next time to come right back to you
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.940]  to finish your question.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.940]  Pete in New York.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940]  Shouldn't have gone to you.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:35.940]  I only had a minute left.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:36.940]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:37.940]  Then Mike and others.
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.940]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:45.660]  We've got my old buddy coming on the transmission who's running for Congress, Steve Lane, as
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.660]  we take action.
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:47.660]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:49.460]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:54.860]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:58.940]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:02.980]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:07.380]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:09.380]  toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:12.780]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.780]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:20.260]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]  to as well.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:25.380]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:30.420]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:31.420]  back against.
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:35.700]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:40.100]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:42.220]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:59:42.220 --> 02:00:12.180]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-2533-139.
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:13.180]  So does he.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:24.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:28.060]  I remember when that aired on Fox News at the time.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:29.540]  It was bizarre right after 9-11.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:34.740]  That like a four or five part series that's on YouTube, talking about Israeli intelligence
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:38.940]  following the supposed hijackers, dancing on buildings, videotaping.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:44.980]  I've even interviewed one of the cops involved in the arrest years ago, the white vans, all
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:45.980]  of it.
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:51.060]  And that's something that the film I produced, Fabled Enemies, covers.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:55.380]  For exposing that, I was then accused of working for Israel.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:01:00.820]  For exposing the U.S.'s liberty, being a false flag attack on our Navy and interviewing
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:05.660]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the captain before he died, the first mate.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:10.660]  All of them exposing it, the anti-Israel crowd then said that was a cover-up for Israel,
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.940]  because they actually aren't the anti-Israel crowd.
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:17.860]  The main, virulent anti-Israel groups are almost all FBI, like Hal Turner, as I told
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:20.180]  you he was, that came out.
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:26.100]  To not have criticism of Israel be legitimate, but to just be ultra-mindless, so it doesn't
[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.380]  ever affect anybody in Israel, so they'll listen.
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.980]  There's actually very diverse viewpoints and ideas.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:36.780]  There's big debates now about funding al-Qaeda and Netanyahu endorsing it, so it's not monolithic.
[02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:40.460]  Just like Germany's not monolithic, Mexico's not monolithic.
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.260]  So it gets weird whenever I talk about the Pope calling for world government, people
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:48.580]  call him and say, I work for the Catholics Church or something, or people always call
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:51.940]  him and they go, what do you know about this, because I've gotten the call many times and
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.220]  I know exactly what they're talking about, I've covered it, I made a best-selling film
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:00.940]  about it as part of my cover-up, of course, being sarcastic.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:05.140]  And really what it always is, is a way for also, not just the operatives, but other people
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:08.020]  to feel better than everyone else.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.180]  Oh, Alex, he's an Israeli agent.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:15.020]  Well, he lives in the same city as Stratford or whatever, and then, well, that proves
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.020]  it all.
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.940]  Nothing he does is good, none of it's true.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:22.700]  Well, let's take him down, which is what Cass Sunstein, who I do think is an Israeli
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:27.940]  operative at the White House, said will infiltrate the new media and cause infighting, and that's
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:35.220]  Cointel Pro, but I am more than happy to discuss the Israeli clear involvement with cutouts
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.580]  with Saudi Arabia, Pakistani intelligence, U.S. NATO.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:43.780]  I just don't think it was only Israel, because you say Israel, it's all this global criminal
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:46.140]  cell that's in all these systems.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:49.540]  Now, separately in those reports, Israel has one of the big contracts for a lot of the
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:55.020]  color ID systems in the country to track calls and surveil as a major intelligence problem.
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:58.340]  I point out that's how this country from every angle has been overtaken.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:02.660]  Now, you've got two minutes to talk about, try to plug the name of the YouTube video
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:05.660]  so people can see it and give me your view on it.
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:07.260]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:13.540]  And I appreciate you talking about the Amdox and Comforts, companies that actually monitor
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:14.540]  it.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.540]  Yeah, you made a film about it.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:16.540]  This is all part of our cover-up.
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:17.540]  Absolutely.
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:18.540]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.540]  Basically, it's Israel Spies on U.S. Part 1.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:27.420]  There's a four-part series, and it basically just talks about how there were 60 Israeli
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:30.420]  nationals that were arrested in connection with the 9-11 attack.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:34.900]  No, there's no doubt that the Israelis were at certain levels, groups of Israelis, were
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:37.180]  working with the Saudi Arabians, the Pentagon.
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:38.540]  It was a very sick operation.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:39.540]  Go ahead.
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:42.860]  And you've enlightened me and opened my eyes, and I know that, you know, there's some people
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.860]  that are just going to say, oh, it was Jews, and it was Israel.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:47.140]  I know that's not the case.
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:50.660]  They were definitely working with other intelligence operations.
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:51.660]  Because that's what happened.
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:55.820]  I mean, part of what was paid for by Mossad, the FBI was involved in the other part, criminal
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:04:01.100]  cells in all the agencies, so they were all could be corrupted and all then blackmailed
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.100]  with the info.
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:05.420]  Do you know how blackmailed our government is for taking part in that now?
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.860]  Yeah, I mean, it's wild.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:14.780]  I mean, they're inclined to do things, especially on the House, in the Senate, you know, basically
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.780]  all of Congress.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:19.580]  You know, they have to bend their knee to certain aspects or else they're not going
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:20.580]  to get fined.
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:25.260]  Do you think, think of how scared members of Congress are, they all know it was an inside
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:26.260]  job.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:31.260]  And it's not just Israelis, you know, it's other aspects, other lobbies, other, um,
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.260]  Sure, sure.
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:33.260]  I mean, that's my issue.
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:36.620]  I mean, if you just say Israelis, there's a whole bunch of different power structures
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.620]  in Israel.
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:40.100]  People don't even know which power structure that would be or subgroup.
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:44.100]  Like, if you said the Vatican's doing something bad, what, all Catholics know it's certain
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:47.060]  great, you have to identify the bad that's going on.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:51.300]  I mean, they got Baptist churches, you know, calling for nuking them at least.
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:54.660]  I mean, it was, I mean, all Baptists or Christians are bad.
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:05:00.740]  No, it's just that there's this bad vein of stage terror out there.
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:07.100]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball security
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:13.100]  alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operation.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:18.100]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:21.100]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:24.100]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.100]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.100]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.100]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:33.100]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:35.100]  They are never going to stop.
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:39.100]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:03.100]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:07.100]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:11.100]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:14.100]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:19.100]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:22.100]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:26.100]  On average the county said it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.100]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:36.100]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:40.100]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and water and breads and toothpaste.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:43.100]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:44.100]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:45.100]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:47.100]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.100]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:30.100]  Music playing.
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:36.100]  We've got loaded phone lines and our guest is happy to talk to you
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:42.100]  coming up at the bottom of the next segment if you'd like to talk to him.
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.100]  Steve Lane.
[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:46.100]  We're going to go to Steve here in just a moment.
[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:49.100]  But it just hit me during the break.
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:53.100]  The plan of San Diego during World War I was a German government plan
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:56.100]  because Germany, when it was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire,
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:09:05.100]  that it was during World War I, had actually run Mexico off and on for about 40, 50 years.
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:11.100]  And the Germans would send their royalty basically over to the control of the country.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:14.100]  That's why you get German brewed Mexican beer like dozeches.
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:17.100]  It's why the railways down there are German-style.
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.100]  And even their signals and commands are German.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:24.100]  Commands translated into Spanish.
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:30.100]  And the plan was by the Germans was to get the Mexicans to kill all white people,
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:32.100]  all white males, 16 and older.
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:37.100]  And they launched the attack down in the Big Bend area and other areas.
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:43.100]  And it was 30 raids by Mexico into the United States trying to draw the United States out of World War I.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.100]  It failed miserably.
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:52.100]  And then there were reprisals that were heavy-handed and vicious by the U.S. Army
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:55.100]  to the Mexicans in the area.
[02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:57.100]  But this has been going on for a long time.
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:03.100]  When the Marines went down to Mexico City on the halls of Montezuma and took over,
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:08.100]  going back in the middle of the century before last,
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:14.100]  that was because Mexico was all the way up in Colorado and areas of Oklahoma claiming they controlled it,
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:17.100]  which they never even had claims to before that with Spain.
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:21.100]  And we're killing U.S. Army teams.
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.100]  So that's where all this comes from.
[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:26.100]  And now the globalists, the big megabanks that run Mexico,
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:29.100]  run the narcotics trafficking on record, launder the money,
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:33.100]  they are using the failure of Mexico, the 130,000 dead in the last eight years,
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:37.100]  and Latin America below Mexico, below Southern North America,
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:41.100]  Central and South America imploding into depression.
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:44.100]  The Caribbean crime levels are four, five, ten times higher.
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:49.100]  The Bahamas are a war zone now of just criminal activity, used to be safe.
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:52.100]  Other islands that were totally safe were becoming dangerous.
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:54.100]  The whole world's sinking into crisis.
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:11:00.100]  I'm going to shoot a special report today that will air later in the week, maybe even next week,
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:04.100]  dealing with the accelerated global collapse.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:07.100]  But I wanted to talk to Steve Lane first about that subject,
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:10.100]  what he would do on that front and what he would do if he gets into Congress.
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:15.100]  But it's great to get him on because I know him well.
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:20.100]  I know he's a great guy, a family man, an engineer who teaches construction
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.100]  at the university, an Air Force veteran.
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:26.100]  And I know in the demographics he has a good chance of winning
[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:29.100]  and getting into Congress there from the great state of Tennessee.
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.100]  So we're going to be talking to him in a moment.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:38.100]  But think about this, we have our government being collapsed right now.
[02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:40.100]  And it's into the North American Union.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:42.100]  It's not even Mexico.
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:44.100]  And it's total treason and it's being done.
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:47.100]  And if this next wave gets in, all the others are going to come,
[02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:50.100]  it's not going to be hundreds of thousands, it's going to be millions.
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:53.100]  And Mexico is involved in a very aggressive action,
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:56.100]  not sealing their Guatemala border, working with Obama,
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:12:00.100]  this is on record, to bring the immigrants in on the, quote, train of death.
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:04.100]  These big trains every day, all the way up from Central and South America,
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:08.100]  as long as they don't get off, the illegals are not put in forced labor camps,
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:11.100]  as Mexico does, the New York Times reported.
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:14.100]  Mexico is conduiting this up.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:18.100]  And the border patrol then gives them vouchers to go anywhere they want in the country.
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:19.100]  They're released.
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:24.100]  AP was forced to admit that today and we'll go over that article.
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:25.100]  We'll get into the NSA.
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:26.100]  We'll get into the wars.
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:28.100]  We'll get into all of it with Steve Lane.
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.100]  Steve Lane off and on co-hosted a couple different shows,
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:34.100]  some of the shows that I hosted, like Freedom Report and others,
[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:37.100]  was a frequent guest on my daily weekday radio show.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:42.100]  And he's a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, served in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:47.100]  He teaches building construction at the Tennessee College of Applied Technology in Nashville.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.100]  And two years ago, he was awarded Instructor of the Year.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:51.100]  Steve is currently a Republican primary.
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.100]  His district is overwhelmingly Republican as in the state.
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.100]  They have supermajorities in both houses and have a Republican governor.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.100]  He's running against Republican incumbent.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.100]  I won't even say their name.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:06.100]  Recently called one of the top 10 most valuable congressmen he has recently endorsed
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:09.100]  by the Republican Liberty Caucus.
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.100]  And of course, that's who Steve's been endorsed by.
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:19.100]  SteveLaneForCongress.com joins us and we've got to get him elected to Congress.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.100]  But I want to get him on, and again, we'll take your calls at the bottom of the hour,
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:29.100]  in a wider area to discuss the Tea Party in Texas and Virginia
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:32.100]  with Brad and so many others winning.
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.100]  The next head Cruz, the next Rand Paul, the next Congressman Jones,
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:43.100]  the next Justin Amash, there are so many of these great people getting elected
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.100]  and it's one of our only hopes.
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:48.100]  That's why the globalists are trying to accelerate the collapse of the country
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:52.100]  with Cloward and Piven, Obamacare, shutting down the coal power plants.
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:56.100]  What is Steve Lane going to do in Congress as a bully pulpit?
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:58.100]  I mean, I can't imagine what he would do in Congress.
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:02.100]  He would be basically a well-spoken, calm Alex Jones in Congress.
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:03.100]  He knows as much as I do or more.
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:06.100]  And he joins us, SteveLaneForCongress.com.
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:13.100]  And again, he is just a great patriot on everybody to get behind him.
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:16.100]  Steve, I've seen you in years in person.
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.100]  We've talked over the phone many times.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:20.100]  You've been busy up there with family like I've been busy down here.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.100]  So much has happened.
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:23.100]  You heard me do that long intro.
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.100]  What do you have to say?
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:28.100]  Do you realize it has been 15 years since we've been on the air together?
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.100]  I was thinking about it just before we went on.
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:33.100]  Somebody asked me that same question.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:34.100]  Amazing, buddy.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:37.100]  Well, listen, let's talk about all the stuff we've been through.
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:41.100]  You're not just some new libertarian, Republican, conservative tea party guy
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:42.100]  coming along.
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:47.100]  You've been involved for about 16, 17, 18 years in the Liberty Movement,
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:48.100]  the Proto-Liberty Movement.
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:52.100]  And let's get into what you would do as a congressman with all these issues.
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.100]  Well, that's correct.
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:57.100]  Actually, I was thinking back, reflecting, getting ready for this interview,
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:15:00.100]  thinking about the first time you and I had met.
[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:01.100]  I had heard you on the radio.
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:06.100]  I was working in construction at the time and heard an ad for you on KGFK.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.100]  And a friend of mine and I, we wondered, is this guy for real?
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:13.100]  Does he do this just to get ratings or is he for real?
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:16.100]  And you were appearing at the Downsized Government Conference.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:21.100]  I'm sure you remember that and took the trip over to Austin to see you in person
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:25.100]  and people need to know you are exactly who you are on the air.
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:28.100]  That's the friend I've gotten to know personally.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:31.100]  And they're not getting anything contrived.
[02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:34.100]  You're a very real person and found that out very quickly.
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:36.100]  And I wanted to get involved.
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:41.100]  You have an amazing talent, Alex, for breaking through media conditioning
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.100]  and getting people to think independently oftentimes for the first time in their lives.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:50.100]  And that's exactly pretty much what you had done with me.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:54.100]  I started questioning things from the mainstream media
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:58.100]  immediately after starting to listen to you and challenging those things.
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:02.100]  I just always accepted things on CNN that they were factual
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:06.100]  and found out through experiences, getting involved in activism
[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:08.100]  that it's actually the opposite.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:12.100]  Very rarely does the mainstream media report things factually.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:16.100]  They always tend to have an agenda, always tend to have a direction.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:22.100]  They want to take things rather than just presenting facts and let those fall where they may.
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:26.100]  And for those that don't have the TV on right now
[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.100]  who aren't watching us at prisonplanet.tv
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:32.100]  or the free feeds at infowars.com forward slash show,
[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:36.100]  we're showing footage of you holding the UN flag while I cut it up
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:38.100]  because the state police said there was a burn ban
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:41.100]  so we couldn't burn the UN flag as we did every UN day.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:43.100]  So they said just cut it up with a knife
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:45.100]  and it turned out to be more dramatic than burning it.
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.100]  We're going to play that clip coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:52.100]  Yeah, not only that, but as you recall,
[02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:57.100]  burning is the appropriate treatment, appropriate way to retire a flag.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:00.100]  And I think in retrospect, I'm glad we didn't burn it.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:03.100]  That's not the way to treat the UN flag.
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:04.100]  We don't want to treat it with reverence.
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:07.100]  We want to treat it with all the disrespect we possibly can.
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:11.100]  We want to wipe our butts with it.
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:15.100]  That wouldn't made for a very good video.
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:18.100]  Oh my gosh, this is Michelle Obama toilet paper.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:20.100]  Getting serious here, bro.
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:22.100]  It's all coming through.
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:26.100]  I can't believe that the patriots that woke us up were so right,
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.100]  like Ron Paul and those that came before him.
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:31.100]  Do you think we have a chance to turn this around
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:33.100]  because we did get a jump on them?
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:34.100]  I really do.
[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:36.100]  And if I didn't think we had a chance,
[02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:39.100]  obviously I wouldn't be running for office.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:43.100]  At the same time, I think we have a responsibility to our kids
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:44.100]  and our grandkids.
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.100]  I have six kids.
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:47.100]  I now have a grandbaby.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:48.100]  I don't know if you know that.
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:52.100]  My 21-year-old daughter Karen, shout out to Karen, by the way.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:56.100]  She just gave birth to Lil Emery and beautiful, healthy baby.
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:59.100]  She was born five weeks early, but not a thing wrong with her.
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.100]  Congratulations, brother.
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:02.100]  Yeah.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:05.100]  So we have a responsibility to them at the very least to try.
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:08.100]  We've got to be able to look back, regardless of what the future holds,
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:11.100]  to be able to say, you know, we got to be able to look them in the eye
[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:13.100]  and say we did everything we possibly could do.
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:14.100]  And that's part of this.
[02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:19.100]  But in addition to that, no, I generally believe it can be turned around.
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.100]  It didn't get this way overnight.
[02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:22.100]  It's not going to happen overnight.
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:24.100]  It's going to take years, if not decades.
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.100]  But I do see things turning in the right direction.
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:30.100]  You had mentioned some folks that have gotten elected,
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:33.100]  Justin Amash, Congressman Tom Massey, Raul Labrador.
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:36.100]  These are all guys that are moving things in the right direction.
[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:38.100]  And you asked what I would do in Congress.
[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:43.100]  I see my role as kind of two roles, actually.
[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:47.100]  Number one, kind of a forward air observer.
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:51.100]  I think one of the ways to restore the Republic is to strengthen state
[02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:54.100]  and local governance and most importantly, self-governance.
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:57.100]  And I think one of the ways that we can do that is as a Congressman,
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:01.100]  I could see kind of giving our state and local officials heads up
[02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:05.100]  of what's taking place in Congress so that they can be anticipatory
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:06.100]  with the things they do.
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.100]  That's what Congressmen should be.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:10.100]  That's why the senators used to be elected by the legislature.
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:12.100]  So they were forward observers.
[02:19:12.100 --> 02:19:15.100]  But the 17th Amendment got rid of that the same year we got the income tax
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:17.100]  and the Federal Reserve 100 years ago.
[02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:21.100]  I think that's a great idea to say since we don't have the Senate anymore,
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:22.100]  it's imperial.
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:28.100]  We should see our representatives of the House more like forward observers.
[02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:29.100]  Absolutely.
[02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:33.100]  And we can help our state and local governments and the people
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:36.100]  kind of gird themselves against federal overreach.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.100]  The second thing I think...
[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.100]  Stay there, Steve Lane.
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:39.100]  We're coming back.
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:40.100]  Steve Lane for congress.com.
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:42.100]  Give him your Twitter account.
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:43.100]  I just tweeted you.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.100]  Oh, at lane for TN.
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.100]  At lane E-F-O-R-T-N.
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.100]  Now we're going to plug it when we come back again.
[02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:50.100]  Straight ahead, Steve Lane is our guest.
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:53.100]  He'd make a cracker jack Liberty-based Congressman.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.100]  He's running against an establishment tide.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:57.100]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:59.100]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:03.100]  Listen up all you preppers and survival enthusiasts.

[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:39.100]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:41.100]  Chaos on our border.
[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.100]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:45.100]  Life is getting ready to change.

[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.100]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:03.100]  because it was helping me and my family so much
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:05.100]  get healthy and detoxify.
[02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:09.100]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:13.100]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions,
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.100]  especially the thyroid.
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:17.100]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:21.100]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:23.100]  that your body can really absorb.
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:25.100]  Then, about a year ago, he said,
[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:26.100]  listen, if you think this is powerful,
[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:30.100]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:34.100]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:39.100]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:43.100]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:46.100]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,
